Chantal Sicile-Kira's goal is to save parents \\"countless hours of precious time and heartache\\" by sharing what she has learned navigating through the various systems.  She has an autistic child of her own and she knows the ropes having spent \\"tens of thousands of hours\\" learning about autism and the treatments and interventions available, and how the various support and governmental groups and organizations work.<br /><br />She begins by debunking myths about autism while providing a little history including some sharp commentary about Bruno Bettelheim, the psychotherapist who thought that autism was caused by \\"refrigerator mothers\\" of cold affect who pushed their children into emotional isolation.  She emphasizes that autism is a \\"spectrum disorder\\" that is becoming more and more prevalent without a clear etiology.<br /><br />She follows this with a chapter explaining what ASDs are and \\"How to Know If a Person Has One.\\"  She addresses herself to parents who have absolutely no experience with autism, parents who have no idea what to do or how to feel.  In Chapter 3 she looks into the causes and attempts to explain why people with ASDs act the way they do.  Then she guides parents to what to expect and what to do after a diagnosis of autism.  In Chapter 5 she comments on treatments, therapies, and interventions.<br /><br />What Sicile-Kira does so well is to make the reader understand and appreciate what it is like to be a parent of an autistic child, what family life can be like with siblings, what the educational prospects are, how one fits into the community and what the future may hold.  Autism spectrum disorders are becoming better and better understood all the time, and there is even a school of thought that suggests that, in their milder forms, to look for a \\"cure\\" may be a misdirection because many autistics have a unique and valuable way of viewing the world and living life.<br /><br />This is a personal book, but it is also a professional book.  There is an appendix giving \\"Parent Ratings of Behavioral Effects of Biomedical Interventions\\": which drugs have or have not been effective, how non-drug supplements have or have not helped, and the effect of special diets.  There is a section on \\"Resources,\\" including ASD-Specific Organizations, general organizations, governmental agencies, books; and there's a bibliography.<br /><br />If you want an introduction to autism and the world of autism from a parental and a professional point of view, this is an excellent place to start.orld and living life. <br /> <br />This is a personal book, but it is also a professional book.

7910:US	49786731	R17OBQFUUU162S	1557666717	968335513	The Autism Encyclopedia	Books	4	8	9	N	N	A to Z for anyone concerned about autism	The first thing to notice about this first of its kind book is the copyright date: 2005.  It's completely up to date on a subject that very much needs to be up to date.  The second thing to notice is the tag line on the cover: \\"500+ entries for parents and professionals.\\"  This is a good book for counselors, parents, grandparents, ministers and other people who are not specialists but who find themselves called upon to help people with concerns about autism.<br /><br />The third thing to notice is the long list of contributors, that is, the professionals who wrote the entries.  Professor Emeritus John Neisworth and Associate Professor Pamela S. Wolfe of The Pennsylvania State University are the editors of the book and the authors of many of the entries.  However there are (I counted them) 123 other professionals who penned the mini essays that make up the bulk of the book.  They come from all over the world and from a number of relevant disciplines.  They are doctors, academics, therapists, teachers, heads of institutions, etc.  Clearly this is an authoritative work.<br /><br />Each entry is focused on how it relates to autism.  For example the entry for \\"depression,\\" signed by Britta Saltonstall, allows that \\"Study has demonstrated the co-occurrence of depression and autism.\\"  Note the careful terminology: \\"co-occurrence\\" instead of any other sort of linkage.  However in their entry on the \\"Premack principle,\\" Neisworth and Wolfe don't relate \\"Grandma's Law\\" (to do the less agreeable activity before the more agreeable one) directly to autism, noting only that therapists in general might want to require it of their clients.<br /><br />Some of the language is technical and some of it is highly technical, and almost all of it is carefully hedged and qualified.  The influence of mainstream psychology, including behaviorism and cognitive psychology is evident.  I wish that, in addition, interpretations from evolutionary psychology were more in evidence.  I don't think we can hope to understand disorders like autism outside of an evolutionary perspective.<br /><br />In this context it is strange to read that \\"natural environment\\" refers to home and community and everyday activities like eating and shopping.  It's hard to argue with this, but the implication seems to be that other environments might be seen as \\"contrived.\\"  When I think about it, this perspective might be a hint about the cause of the recent dramatic increase in the instance of autism: green fields and forest lands, river beds and ocean beaches, savanna and woodland, may indeed be, for today's people, \\"contrived\\" rather than natural environments.  And the \\"natural environment\\" of concrete streets and homes constructed with manmade materials and artificially made foods is what we are stuck with.  Personally I think some types of autism may be better understood as alternative strategies for coping with the world; however, the more severe manifestations are clearly disorders, some of them disabling.<br /><br />Also apparent in the book is how autism is viewed today.  Once thought to be a disease caused by \\"refrigerator mothers\\" (Bruno Bettelheim)--women of cold affect who emotionally and mentally isolated their children--autism is now seen as a \\"spectrum of disorders\\" whose etiology \\"is not clear, but accumulating evidence suggests a neurological basis that may relate to inheritable factors\\" with \\"environmental stressors\\" also \\"implicated.\\"  Under \\"autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\\" we find that the terminology is synonymous with \\"pervasive developmental disorder\\" (PDD) which includes Rhett syndrome, Asperger syndrome and others.  There is a \\"catch all\\" category called \\"pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified\\" (PDD-NOS).<br /><br />The book has 22 pages of references including ones from all four editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (an evolving compendium).  Even Bruno Bettelheim's now infamous The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self is referenced.  However nothing appears by Temple Grandin, who is probably the world's most famous, and one of its most accomplished, autistics.  By contrast, in another book on autism, Autism Spectrum Disorders (2004) by Chantal Sicile-Kira, there are eight references to Grandin's work.  So, even though this book is copyrighted in 2005, it may not be as entirely up to date as might be expected.<br /><br />There are two excellent appendices, one on \\"Screening and Assessment Tools and Curricula\\" and another on research, therapeutic, and informational organizations.  Each entry in these appendices is annotated and explained.  Addresses, both snail and email, and sometimes phone numbers are included.tress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self is referenced.

It may be, in its \\"milder\\" forms, as that experienced by Dawn Prince-Hughes, who writes so beautifully well, an attempt to adapt to an ancient environment in which social abilities are not as valuable as some other talents.  Many autistics would be more at home in the jungle or in woodlands or on the savannas of Africa than non-autistic people.  Their ability to concentrate and to sense things acutely would serve them well.  And any lack in social skill would not matter.<br /><br />At least that is my impression after reading this wonderful book by a woman who \\"went forward by going backwards\\"--backwards, that is, \\"into the most primal and ancient part of myself.\\"  She had this experience with her \\"first and best friends, a family of captive gorillas, people of an ancient nation.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, the autistic spectrum of disorders may represent imperfect ways of dealing with the world and with others.  Usually autistic people are at a disadvantage, especially socially and vocationally, because other people find their behavior inappropriate and unfeeling.  Dawn's behavior seemed at times cold and withdrawn and without proper affect.  She had to force herself to make eye contact with people and to remind herself to engage in the social niceties.  The curious thing about this is that autistics may actually feel things more strongly than the rest of us.  The lack of social grace that many autistics display does not mean they are incapable of feeling or that their feelings of love and empathy are less than that of \\"normal\\" people.  Clearly we can see in this memoir that Dawn has always been a deeply caring person with a great capacity for love.<br /><br />The problem for some autistics is that they feel things too deeply.  Many autistics have senses that are so acute that everyday interactions with other people overwhelm them emotionally.  Satchel Paige famously said that \\"the social ramble ain't restful.\\"  He was, in understatement, expressing what Dawn has always felt.<br /><br />As a child Dawn could repeat conversations verbatim and had a \\"vast repertoire of commercial jingles\\" which she would sing.  She loved repetition and symmetry, and later as an adult learned from her gorilla friends \\"the value and beauty of ritual.\\"<br /><br />She had sensory addictions, as she calls them, to various sights and sounds and tactile sensations.  She craved salt and would eat it straight from the shaker; and she would suck on burnt matchheads and \\"craved Alka-Seltzer for its taste and feel.\\"  She loved to smell her grandparents' car and her grandmother's purse.  She felt a sense of calm and security in the presence of familiar things.  Away from the familiar, she became frightened and insecure.  She liked to hide in caves and other places away from people and from the \\"chaos of noise\\" all about her.<br /><br />After a horrendous childhood in which she was abused by peers at school, and an adolescence and young womanhood in which she was often homeless and terribly alone, she found a sense of love and belonging by watching and interacting with gorillas at the zoo.  She herself became a gorilla in part, and refers to her kin throughout the book as \\"people.\\"  This of course is part of the political and moral message of the book: the great apes are \\"people,\\" or at least they should be treated as people and not as inferior animals to be enslaved and experimented upon.<br /><br />Prince-Hughes's experience with the gentle and peaceful gorillas marked the beginning of her transformation from hopeless misfit to instructor at Western Washington University with a PhD in anthropology.  It also helped that she came to understand that she is autistic, and came to accept that she is different from other people.  From that understanding she came to realize that she had to consciously make adaptations to better fit in with others, and to make allowances for what they expected and considered proper even though for Dawn some of their expectations were strange and needless.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, honest, and deeply revealing memoir about what it is like to be autistic.t she had to consciously make adaptations to better fit in with others, and to make allowances for what they expected and considered proper even though for Dawn some of their expectations were strange and needless. <br /> <br />This is a fascinating, honest, and deeply revealing memoir about what it is like to be autistic.	2005-10-09

Well, I was young and while not exactly foolish, I was adventurous and liked challenges.<br /><br />Anyway, I knew a little mathematics and a little probability, but it was only when I picked up this absolutely charming book and began to read it that I realized with a kind of glee and something akin to a thrill that I was about to learn something of great value.<br /><br />Warren Weaver, a good friend, by the way, of Claude Shannon, the great information theory pioneer, has a wonderful gift for expression and an equally wonderful gift for explaining things clearly and making his subject matter exciting.  And the engaging illustrations by Peg Hosford do nothing but add to the excitement.<br /><br />From the very first words in the book, \\"This book is, in one sense, about thinking.  About a certain way of thinking, that is...,\\" I knew immediately what he meant and that I had stumbled upon exactly the sort of book I was looking for.<br /><br />Weaver begins literally with \\"Thoughts about Thinking\\" and illustrates how probabilistic reasoning, as he calls it, is the only kind of reasoning that can help us answer certain kinds of questions, questions such as will it rain today? or is Alex Rodriguez, who hasn't had a hit in five at bats, due for a hit this time up? or \\"if I have my left lung removed, what is the chance that the cancer will really be cured?\\" (p. 28)  He follows this with a most interesting short chapter on the history of probability, \\"The Birth of Lady Luck.\\"  And then he explains \\"The Concept of Mathematic Probability.\\"  His exposition was so clear and such a pleasure to read that  I can still recall the delight I experienced in reading it for the first time.<br /><br />In the chapter on \\"The Counting of Cases,\\" Weaver gets down to the basics of compound events and the difference between combinations and permutations--knowledge that is necessary, for example, in order to analyze a game of chance, especially games involving dice or playing cards..<br /><br />The next chapter covers independent events, and then there are some famous problems including the one involving dice throwing that the Chevalier de Mere presented to the celebrated French mathematician Blaise Pascal.  Weaver had mentioned it earlier, noting that this historical problem from 1654 actually marked the above mentioned \\"birth of Lady Luck.\\"<br /><br />In other chapters Weaver introduces us to the law of large numbers and explains the \\"maturity of chances\\" fallacy and some other fallacies.  He explains in a particularly clear and utterly convincing manner why the so-called Martingale system and other \\"doubling up\\" systems yield no advantage to the bettor, and why, if any given independent event is disadvantageous for the bettor, no system of betting on such events will ever lead to an advantage for the gambler.  In the case of doubling your bet after each loss, Weaver shows that every time you win, you will be one unit ahead no matter how many times you double up--except for one very deadly proviso: Sooner or later you will run into a streak of losses that will wipe you out--or, run you up against the betting limit of the casino or whomever you are betting against, and you will have to eat your losses.  It is simply a matter of the observing the powers of two: 2,4,8,16,32,64,128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536.<br /><br />In other words, if your betting unit is $100 and you decide to bet on National Football League games, betting $100 the first week, and if you lose doubling your bet to $200 the next week, and then to $400, the following week, etc., until you either win or the season ends, you will gain $100 for each time you win.  Should you however run into a bad streak, say losing every week, you would lose $65,536 after the 16th game!(I have simplified this of course since, due to the bookie's vigorish, you actually have to wager $110 to win $100.)<br /><br />If you double up on something like the throw of the dice at a casino where the odds of winning the bet are less than fifty-fifty, your chance of a ruinous streak is (markedly) increased.<br /><br />A very interesting chapter is number XIII, \\"Rare Events, Coincidences, and Surprising Occurrences\\" where Weaver presents some of the coincidences he has experienced and collected over the years.  He goes on to explain the nature of such rare events and gives a very interesting look at them from a mathematical point of view.  One of the events is about a guy in Las Vegas who made an amazing 28 passes in a row at a dice table at the Desert Inn.  He, cautious bettor that he was, made only about $750, while the side bettors made $150,000.  Another event was thirteen spades having been dealt to a bridge player.  Weaver discusses whether we should believe that this and some other very, very rare events could happen by chance.<br /><br />Since reading this book, I have read a number of other popular books on probability, statistics and gambling, but I can say, as good as some of them were, none were nearly as exciting nor half as interesting as this book.  As far as I am concerned Lady Luck is a classic of the genre, and more or less timeless.<br /><br />As for the baseball betting...well, that's another story, but suffice it to say it ain't easy beating the spread.ter the 16th game!

The books are characterized by beautiful photography, authoritative authorship, and succinct descriptions.  In this book the authors, Philip W. Rundel, Professor of Biology at UCLA's Department of Ecology and Ecological Biology, and Robert Gustafson, who is the manager of the Botany Department at the Natural Museum of Los Angeles County, go a bit beyond the usual as they describe the ecology of the various plant ecosystems in Southern California.<br /><br />The first chapter is on the biogeography of Southern California (from Point Conception to the Mexican border) with a comparison to other Mediterranean-type climates throughout the world, including those in South Africa and southern Australia as well as in the Mediterranean itself.<br /><br />The other chapters, 12 in all, concentrate on various habitats, including coastal beaches, dunes, bluffs, terraces, and on other distinct plant communities found in SoCal, including woodlands, grasslands, riparian woodlands, and wetlands.  There's a chapter on the flora of the Channel Islands.  Throughout the authors are careful to tell the reader which species are native and which are not.  Two of the chapters are on the chaparral and its unique ecology and how the plants adapt to the frequent fires that the chaparral forest is prone to.  I love the chaparral and it was fun to discover the names and habits and to see the color photos of the plants that one sees on hikes along the trails.<br /><br />Finally there are chapters on \\"Invasive Alien Species\\" and the threats they pose, and on \\"Preserving Biodiversity.\\"  There's a table that lists public parks and preserves by characteristic plant communities such as the Los Padres National Forest in Santa Barbara County, Bolsa Chica State Beach in Orange County, and many others.  And there's a good index.<br /><br />This works especially well as both an introduction, as the authors intended, and as a handy reference for the hiker and camper.oth an introduction, as the authors intended, and as a handy reference for the hiker and camper.	2005-10-02

Authors Karen C. Fox and Aries Keck treat us to more than a few of those peccadillos, including his offer to marry either his cousin Elsa Lowenthal or her daughter Ilse, remarking that he was in love with both women, but wanted to have a child with Ilse!<br /><br />Einstein biographies can also be categorized according to what the biographer chooses to emphasize, Einstein's private life or his scientific accomplishments, or both.  In this book you can choose by letter which part of Einstein's life you want to read about.  The alphabetical entries begin with \\"Absentmindedness\\" and end with \\"Zionism.\\"  In between are such entries as \\"Cosmological Constant,\\" \\"Einstein, Mileva Maric\\" (Einstein's first wife), \\"Jokes about Einstein,\\" the \\"Michelson-Morley Experiment,\\" \\"Princeton,\\" \\"Twin Paradox,\\" etc..  In all there are 114 entries, a Timeline, an Introduction, a Selected Bibliography, and an Index.  The entries are like little self-contained essays.  They are well-written, informative and without any kind of bias while revealing that Einstein is definitely a man worth writing about.<br /><br />Here's an Einstein joke.  Einstein's driver used to sit in the back of the lecture hall while Einstein lectured.  He sat there so many times that he said he could probably give the lecture himself.  One day Einstein took him up on the idea, and the driver gave a flawless lecture with Einstein watching from the back of the room.  At the end there was a question, and the lecturer said that \\"...the answer to that question is so simple, I bet that even my driver, sitting up at the back could answer it.\\" (p. 148)<br /><br />Sometimes I like to compare Einstein to other great scientists much as some people compare baseball players.  What are the greatest baseball players of all time?  I won't hazard an opinion, but my three greatest scientists are Einstein, Newton and Darwin in no particular order.  Certainly Einstein is the most celebrated.  Reading this \\"biography\\" makes that clear.<br /><br />I was struck with just how human the authors make Einstein appear with his very human failings as a father and a husband along with his nearly superhuman accomplishments as a physicist.  I was especially struck with Einstein's stubborn streak.  Even at the time of his death in 1955 he still did not fully accept quantum mechanics, being especially disenchanted with the notion of \\"entanglement,\\" which he called \\"spooky action at a distance.\\"  This is somewhat ironic since Einstein, along with his good friend Niels Bohr (with whom he had many spirited, even heated, discussions), Max Born, Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, and others were the architects of QM.<br /><br />What makes this book so agreeable is how handy it is for dipping into and finding something out about Einstein and his work, and how gracefully and informatively it is written.<br /><br />One last point.  Fox and Keck do mention Einstein's famous disdain for socks.  They speculate that he didn't like to wear them not merely because he didn't care about his appearance, \\"but possibly because they were physically uncomfortable.\\" (p. 59)  Maybe, but since I gotten older and have had time to think long and hard on this most interesting subject, I can report that the real reason that Einstein didn't like to wear socks is he didn't like to bend over and pull them on or push them off.  If you've ever tried to put on a tight pair of socks, you know what I mean.<br /><br />Bottom line: fun to read, nontechnical with just enough science for the layperson to appreciate.>Sometimes I like to compare Einstein to other great scientists much as some people compare baseball players.

Somebody who had read my review of Bryan A Garner's Modern American Usage, 2nd ed. (2003)--IMHO, the preeminent book on usage, per se--wrote me the other day asking about a good book on typographical style.  I recommended Words into Type which I have used for many years.  But as I prepared to write a review, I was amazed to learn that a new edition of this outstanding reference work is lacking.<br /><br />What we have here is the Third Edition from 1974, the same book I have in front of me.  Yet, so much has changed since 1974--including the invention and phenomenal growth of a little thing called the Internet--that a new and updated work is sorely needed.  On the other hand, so much in terms of what is appropriate style in the publishing world has not changed, which means that this venerable and authoritative work remains a most valuable addition to anyone's library.<br /><br />First, a note on \\"style\\" as used here and as understood in the publishing business.  Style does not refer to what should more properly be called the writer's \\"mode of expression,\\" nor does it refer to such things as elegance or flair in wordsmithing; and yet it does have something to do with \\"fashion\\" in terms of how words, numbers, and symbols appear on the pages of books, magazines, and newspapers.  In this sense \\"style\\" refers to \\"the rules or customs of spelling, punctuation, and the like...\\" (from Random House Webster's College Dictionary).<br /><br />Style should therefore be contrasted with and compared to usage and grammar.  Indeed Words into Type includes in its pages plenty of advice on grammar and usage.  Part V is devoted to \\"Use of Words\\" and Part VI to \\"Grammar.\\"  Still, most of the book is about how characters appear on pages and how pages should be laid out and how various sections of books--introductions, indices, appendices, footnotes, typographical style for tables and headings, etc.--should be ordered.  Also included is guidance on the various responsibilities of writers, editors and copyreaders.  To put it simply, I know of no book that gives anywhere near as much guidance on how words are transformed into type than this very appropriately named, Words into Type.<br /><br />I have by way of comparison in front of me a copy of my old The Associated Press Stylebook, which I used when I was a newspaper reporter years ago.  The AP stylebook tells us which words to capitalize for example and which words to leave lower case.  It covers abbreviations, punctuation, whether numbers should be spelled out or not, conventions to follow in the reporting of sports, and various other matters related strictly to newspaper reporting.<br /><br />Words into Type does all this and, as indicated above, much, much more.  The AP stylebook is fifty-some pages long; Words into Type is nearly six hundred.  I do not have the Chicago Manual of Style in front of me, but it is the only book that I know of that can compete with Words into Type in terms of inclusiveness.  Perhaps it is a better book today.  But when I compared them some years ago it wasn't even close.  Words into Type was more comprehensive while being at the same time easier to use and understand.  Still the latest edition of the Chicago Manual of Style is from 2003.<br /><br />Publishers, even if they use the Chicago Manual of Style, should have a copy of Words into Type at the ready.  And any writer who wants to look professional and furthermore wants to understand the process of turning words into type--and indeed would like an education in \\"style\\"--should also own this book.  With self-publishing and Web-based publishing growing by leaps and bounds everyday, I think it would be a good idea to update this book.<br /><br />Maybe the people at Prentice-Hall or whoever now owns the copyright are working on such an edition.  I hope so.  Until such an edition or its equivalent comes out, I cannot recommend this book too highly as indispensable to serious writers, editors and publishers.rs.  To put it simply, I know of no book that gives anywhere near as much guidance on how words are transformed into type than this very appropriately named, Words into Type.    I have by way of comparison in front of me a copy of my old The Associated Press Stylebook, which I used when I was a newspaper reporter years ago.  The AP stylebook tells us which words to capitalize for example and which words to leave lower case.  It covers abbreviations, punctuation, whether numbers should be spelled out or not, conventions to follow in the reporting of sports, and various other matters related strictly to newspaper reporting.    Words into Type does all this and, as indicated above, much, much more.  The AP stylebook is fifty-some pages long; Words into Type is nearly six hundred.  I do not have the Chicago Manual of Style in front of me, but it is the only book that I know of that can compete with Words into Type in terms of inclusiveness.  Perhaps it is a better book today.  But when I compared them some years ago it wasn't even close.  Words into Type was more comprehensive while being at the same time easier to use and understand.  Still the latest edition of the Chicago Manual of Style is from 2003.    Publishers, even if they use the Chicago Manual of Style, should have a copy of Words into Type at the ready.  And any writer who wants to look professional and furthermore wants to understand the process of turning words into type--and indeed would like an education in \\"style\\"--should also own this book.  With self-publishing and Web-based publishing growing by leaps and bounds everyday, I think it would be a good idea to update this book.    Maybe the people at Prentice-Hall or whoever now owns the copyright are working on such an edition.  I hope so.  Until such an edition or its equivalent comes out, I cannot recommend this book too highly as indispensable to serious writers, editors and publishers.	2005-10-01

What Kenneth Ford, retired director of the American Institute for Physics, set out to do (and I think largely accomplishes) is to make the world of the quantum (somewhat!) accessible to the general reader.  Using a minimum of mathematics and a maximum of analogy and explanation expressed in a direct and readable style, Ford brings the \\"eerie theory\\" (p. 247) as close to the everyday mind as might be possible.  Part of the reason for the book's success is that Ford had high school seniors at Germantown Academy carve \\"up the book among themselves and\\" provide \\"valuable (and unvarnished) feedback.\\"<br /><br />But let's face it, even great physicists, entirely enmeshed in the difficult mathematics of QM--people who have devoted their lives to understanding the quantum world--can't answer John Wheeler's famous question: \\"How come the quantum?\\"  The problem is not so much that the quantum world is complicated or that the math is difficult.  The problem is that the \\"reality\\" of QM is fundamentally at odds with our everyday experience.<br /><br />Some of the ideas such as superposition, entanglement, fundamental probability, exclusion, and the famous uncertainty principle discovered by Werner Heisenberg, to mention just a few, are completely alien to our experience as human beings.  In this regard I am reminded of the saying from Eastern religion that the world is not as we think it is.  The world we see is a representation constructed by our minds in collaboration with our senses, honed through the ages by the evolutionary experience so that what we see and hear and feel and taste and smell and especially \\"understand\\" is conditioned by our need to survive.  We do not see x-rays or radio waves or individual atoms, nor do we know intuitively that atoms are mostly empty space, nor do we appreciate that the colors we see are really just inside our heads, our way of apprehending the differing wave lengths of light coming from the objects in the world, not something intrinsic to those objects.<br /><br />Et cetera, one might say.  So vast is the world and so tiny can things be (but not tinier than the Planck limit!--or so it is postulated) and so remote from our day-to-day needs that until recent times the extremes had no relevance for us.  But everything has changed.  Lasers, computers, nuclear reactors (and bombs) stem from knowledge of things impossible to see and even impossible to visualize or to fully appreciate.  The technology works, the math rings true, and our world is changed for the better, for the worse, but regardless, changed forever.<br /><br />But how much can the average educated person with no mathematic training learn about QM?  Is it a hopeless case?  Certainly the complexities presented in this book just in terms of the number of particles and their properties are formidable.  I would have to take notes and construct charts and review and re-review in order to keep the particles straight in my mind.  (Ford provides a particle appendix with four tables that helps.)  But even so, I would not understand quantum mechanics.  However I think there is something wonderful in what I do learn and appreciate.  Namely, that the world really is not as we think it is.  Such knowledge ushers in feelings of humility and awe and leads to a greater appreciation of how amazing everything is.<br /><br />Implicit in Ford's presentation is the idea that quantum mechanics is not complete.  He writes, \\"Many physicists believe that some reason for quantum mechanics awaits discovery.\\" (p. 99)  The implication is that something more fundamental underpins QM, and when that is discovered our understanding will be perhaps complete, or (more likely, I suspect) a whole new world of mystery will be opened to us.  The fact that relativity and QM are yet to be completely reconciled, and that gravity does not fit into the equations of QM, fairly cries out for a larger theory.<br /><br />Mostimportant for me and I think for most people interested in QM are its philosophic and even religious implications.  Facile ideas of gods that talk to humans only through the words of ancient books, or of gods that cannot do their will in the world except through the work (sometimes malicious) of humans, or gods that communicate with no inkling of anything beyond the Age of Bronze, dissipate like fairy tales when one contemplates the world of the very large and the very small.  In particular, when I think about the idea that the entire universe was once (before the Big Bang) stuffed into a mathematical point, I am led to wonder what could be contained within the relatively vast expanse of a particle as defined in QM.  Who is to say there cannot be worlds within worlds within worlds?<br /><br />Anyway, I believe that even a cursory or hurried reading of this book will prove valuable to the interested reader, and for those with the time and energy to study Ford's presentation, a lot more can be gained even for the non-mathematical.> <br />Most important for me and I think for most people interested in QM are its philosophic and even religious implications.

68348:US	49786731	R3CXSLV732MZX1	1568582897	908661387	Adam Spencer's Book of Numbers: A Bizarre and Hilarious Journey from 1 to 100	Books	3	16	20	N	N	Not the best example of this sub-genre	Here's a book idea.  You're a comedian who also knows a lot of number theory.  People are fascinated by numbers--and heaven knows we could all use a chuckle or two.  So...Aussie comedian, DJ and math PhD Adam Spencer decided he'd have something to say about all the numbers from 1 to 100, but he'd try to keep it lively and funny and relevant to people's lives with references to the popular culture and such.  And he'd throw in some jokes and shore it up with some number puzzles.  This would appeal to both the general public and people who love numbers.<br /><br />Well, I am sorry to say that I don't think he was entirely successful.  First of all the book is not all that funny. (But you might want to judge for yourself.)  Second, most of the mathematical stuff is about number theory which is famously that part of mathematics that is the most removed from practical application (and therefore the public interest).  In fact, until an offshoot of prime number explorations contributed to data encryption (in credit card numbers and corporate and military messaging, etc.) number theory was proudly the province of the utterly impractical, the purest of pure mathematics.  (A nice lesson here is that we can never know when some esoteric endeavor may yield a practical application.)<br /><br />Third--and to my mind most important--the information about numbers in this book is in many cases information that is only tangentially or accidentally related to the numbers themselves.  For example for the number 44, Spencer tells us that \\"Drinking 1 cup of tea a day is thought to reduce your risk of major heart attack by up to 44 per cent.\\"  The number could just as well have been 43 or some other percent.  Or \\"The highest recorded number of different costumes ever sashayed around a Hollywood movie was 85, by Madonna in Evita.\\"  (I don't even think this is correct, but never mind.)  In other words, Spencer is writing like he is trying to appeal to the readers of say People Magazine.  My guess is that the typical imbiber of People Magazine or its equivalent is not likely to even pick up a book on numbers let alone buy it.<br /><br />Fourth, since Spencer has made an obvious attempt at uncovering the cultural significance of the first 100 numbers (and I think that is a fine idea) he really needed to do more research in that area so that he could come up with something more significant than say \\"20/20 is the name of a Beach Boys album\\" for inclusion in his remarks about the number 20.  If Spencer had spent more time looking at the historical and cultural significance of numbers, he would have had to weight his remarks heavily toward the lower numbers since the human significance of especially the single digit numbers greatly outweighs that of the larger numbers.  Indeed an entire book could be written about the number 3 for example.  And I would say that in the beginning there was the one which became through duality the two, which became with three the many, and then \\"the ten thousand things.\\"  There is so much that Spencer could have told us about the number one, the IDEA of the number one, of oneness as opposed to something more or less than oneness, but instead he tells us that \\"Some things only happen once.  Snails have sex only once in their lives.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, I think Spencer missed a great opportunity here.  If he had focused on the deep human meaning (and experience with) number and on the philosophic and emotional ideas associated with numbers, his sidebars into the pop culture might have been funnier.  To do this he would have needed to do more than just Google the numbers or go to pop culture Web sites such as<br />the Get Smart home page where he found (and listed for our edification) \\"the 51 phones so far discovered on Get Smart,\\" e.g., the \\"address book phone,\\" the \\"doughnut phone,\\" the \\"perfume spray phone,\\" etc.<br /><br />There are many books on number that attempt to show us the human side of numbers and even books that makeexperiences with numbers funny.  Some of the best are written by John Allen Paulos who really is funny and very much worth reading.<br /><br />Finally, Spencer includes a kind of mathematical puzzle or \\"Quiz Question\\" for the reader to answer for most of the 100 numbers.  He gives the answers in the back.  Questions (or tasks) range from \\"What is the name of the first official episode of South Park?\\" to \\"What are the next 3 square pyramidal numbers after 55?\\" (he does explain what a pyramidal number is) to \\"Using only +, - or x, join the digits 1-9 to make a total of 100...\\"<br /><br />I even think that including some hard core numerology (anathema to mathematicians of course, but beloved by New Age types) along with the number theory and the pop culture references would have improved this book.  At least it would have broaden the context.  To his credit Spencer does include some religious aspects of numbers, for example he writes, \\"Among Indian gods, Brahma had 4 heads to symbolize the 4 directions of the world, while Shiva has 4 arms with which he destroys and recreates the world in his dance.\\"<br /><br />I think there is a readership for this book (after all I read it, although I didn't attempt to answer the questions--other constraints in life being what they are), but I think such a readership is small and rather exclusive.  His ideal reader is someone who loves numbers, trivia, TV culture (South Park, Homer Simpson, Seinfeld, etc.) and who has a lot of time for exactly that.

68415:US	49786731	RI218VTQKCA1J	1570035822	801643586	Aliens in the Backyard: Plant and Animal Imports Into America	Books	5	3	3	N	N	How alien species have changed America	John Leland (Professor of English at the Virginia Military Institute) does a great job of pointing out which plants and animals are, and which plants and animals are not, native to America.  He writes well with style, grace and wit, and he gives a lot of interesting information about how various animals and plants came to be incorporated into the America landscape and enterprise.<br /><br />From apples to kudzu he details which aliens have been a boon and which have been a sorry bust.  In the case of kudzu (Pueraria lobata, which I saw for the first time in a Louisiana swamp a week before hurricane Katrina hit), \\"It Seemed a Good Idea at the Time\\" (title of one of his chapters).  That was before people realized that kudzu completely blankets \\"whatever it grows on in a smothering welter of leaves and vines\\" strangling trees and other vegetation to death. (p. 161)<br /><br />Also not a good idea was the introduction of carp into America's waters.  Leland opines that \\"Most fishermen and environmentalist regard its widespread introduction...as a disaster...,\\" although there are some, including the Carp Angler Group, who have a different opinion.  Similarly, people differ about whether it was a good idea to bring the starling (one of the birds mentioned in Shakespeare's works) to America since it is now considered \\"a dirty, noisy, gregarious, and aggressive\\" bird that has displaced native species.  Perhaps the worst of the \\"it seemed like a good idea at the time\\" species is the gypsy moth, brought to America as a possible silk worm.  Leland goes into some detail about \\"well-intentioned dreamers of silken fortunes\\" in the chapter, \\"A Sow's Ear from a Silk Purse.\\"<br /><br />But these deliberately introduced species are relatively benign in the public eye compared to those that have freeloaded their way into our land and have more or less taken over in ways that we cannot control.  The German cockroach, the Norway or brown rat, and the tumbleweed (surprisingly not native to the land of the cowboy but from Russia (with love)--oh, you deluded Sons of the Pioneers!) are three that Leland zeroes in on.  He also has a few words to say about the American cockroach (probably not American--also called the palmetto bug) and the Oriental cockroach.  Here in southern California we have all three, the German, the American and the Oriental.  The German is the ever so prolific one that lives indoors in apartment houses and restaurants the world over, while the larger American and Oriental tend to live outdoors.  I sometimes find one of the latter in my house dried up and dead in a corner or in a drawer, having wandered in and found nothing to eat and no moisture.<br /><br />An introduced species that is perhaps an even bigger pest here in the southland is the Argentine ant, which Leland unaccountably does not mention.  I recommend he take a study on it.  There's enough material there to write a book and then some.  Once the Argentine ant (small and black with only an occasional tiny bite) sets up shop inside the walls or under an establishment such as an apartment building or a college dormitory, it is there to stay.<br /><br />What Leland does so very well in this book, and what makes it superior to some other books I have read, is integrate the alien species into the historical and cultural experience of the American people.  In his chapter, \\"Out of Africa,\\" he details \\"How Slavery Transformed the American Landscape and Diet.\\"  I had to laugh when I read that watermelon is not native to America but comes from Africa, as do peanuts and Bermuda grass, sesame seed and of course the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) also known as the black-eyed pea.  I had to laugh because I recalled Randy Newman's satirical song encouraging Africans to come to America in the early days of the republic for \\"the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake\\"!<br /><br />Naturally, it is not in any way surprising that many of our foods come from other lands since most of the world's cuisines have found a home in American.  Rice is not native, although the so-called \\"wild rice\\" is.  Wheat comes from the Middle East as most people know, while potatoes are native to the Andes in South American.<br /><br />In the chapter \\"Cowboys and Their Alien Habits\\" Leland recalls the familiar story of how the horse was once native to America but had gone extinct here before Columbian times, and then was accidentally reintroduced by the Spanish explorers after which it revolutionized the Plains Indians' way of life.  (p. 92)  Also alien are the cowboy's cattle, including the Texas longhorn; and if we go back far enough even the \\"Indians,\\" the so-called native Americans are not native.  Sad to say many of the true natives, like the giant sloth and the cave bear and the great mammoth went extinct coincidental with the arrival of the first humans from across the Bering Strait.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this book and others like it, is that there is never enough.  The way plants and animals have moved around the world and the way they have changed the lives of people is a continual source of fascination.

No, Terry Southern (who wrote the script for Kubrick's Cold War satire) did not make up the name.  There really is a General Stubblebine and he really did work hard on training himself to walk through walls and to levitate, and he really did talk to Brit journalist and film maker Jon Ronson about his various parapsychological ideas.<br /><br />To get a sense of what Ronson is up to, it helps to have read his previous book, Them: Adventures with Extremists (2002) in which he disarms various wackos, from would-be jihad warriors to Klu Klux Klan grand wizards, by turning them into almost lovable comedic figures.  Here nobody comes off as exactly lovable (although there are plenty of chuckles), but somehow one gets the sense that crazy as these warriors are, they are only the fringe on the patchwork quilt of state.<br /><br />The goats in the title refers to \\"Goat Lab\\" a secret enterprise housed in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The idea is to keep a herd of de-bleated goats (100 strong and de-bleated so that they don't make a lot of noise that passers-by might hear) around so that special forces and other military operatives can do various things with them including staring them to death.  The idea is that if some people can kill goats just by staring at them, think what they can do to Al Qaeda!<br /><br />Yes, your tax dollars do go to pay for this.  But, as Gen. Stubblebine, who is also into psychic healing, says \\"You cannot afford to get stale in the intelligence world...You cannot afford to miss something when you're talking about the intelligence world.\\" (p.6)<br /><br />Indeed.  And I suppose this is how such shenanigans are justified by the higher ups.  I mean, what if we're wrong?  What if Al Qaeda or the ayatollahs get there first?  Think about that!  And I suppose that the powers that be in the US military are somewhat sensitive to the charge of restrictive, in-house thinking.  So perhaps that is why people like Gen. Stubblebine get to be generals because somebody has to think outside the box.<br /><br />Also thinking outside the box was General Stubblebine's superior officer, General John Adams Wickham, then army chief of staff, who was not impressed with the bent fork that Stubblebine presented to him at a black-tie party.  He concluded \\"that Satan had somehow taken over General Stubblebine's soul.  It was Satan, not General Stubblebine, who had bent the fork.\\"  (pp. 76-77)<br /><br />Leading theoretician of outside the box military thinking would be Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Jim Channon who produced the First Earth Battalion Operations Manual.  He's a guy the military wanted to lead a Warrior Monk unit into Iraq. (p. 254)  Warrior Monks absolutely know how to stay cool when the bullets are flying, and they have no dependence on lust or on status.  They can subsist on grains and nuts for extended periods of time and they don't need any Budweiser.<br /><br />Another interesting character is Major Ed Dames (who would later become a regular on the Art Bell syndicated radio show spinning lurid tales of disasters and such to come).  One time when there wasn't a lot of official military psychic work to do, Major Dames took to spying on the Loch Ness monster.  He concluded that the monster was the ghost of a dinosaur.  (pp. 73-74)  Sounds right.<br /><br />Amazingly (or appropriately) enough Ronson also looks into David Koresh's Branch Davidian cult, as well as the Heaven's Gate suicide comet riders--or would be riders.  He examines the use of \\"silent sound\\" and other methods employed by the military to break down prisoners to get them to talk, including blaring songs from Sesame Street and Barney the purple dinosaur and some Guns and Roses rock and roll (\\"Welcome to the Jungle\\"!).  You talk about your torture methods!  One gets the sense that stuff like this ought to be barred by the Geneva Convention.  Ronson also manages to give us some info about the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, forcing this reader at least to conclude that the techniques used there were the result of planned military PsyOps orchestrated by people a lot higher up the chain of command than Private Lynndie England and her cohorts.<br /><br />In what turned out as a kind of counterpoint Ronson interviewed army Colonel John Alexander who opined that a lot of what Ronson found of interest \\"has no basis in reality.\\"  When asked what silent sounds are, he replied, \\"It sounds like an oxymoron to me.\\"  Too bad we don't know whether he said this with a straight face or not.  Ronson reports that \\"He gave me a hard look, which seemed to suggest that I was masquerading as a journalist but was, in fact, a dangerous and irrational conspiracy nut.\\"<br /><br />I'm sure everybody in the military's psychological operations are having a good laugh reading this book, just as Ronson intended, but I wonder how the strait-laced commanders feel about it.  Of course they will ignore it, but this book, folks, does NOT make the military look good.  And that is an understatement.gle\\"!).  You talk about your torture methods!

92140:US	49786731	R1RRQUXY5XN9JJ	0767918436	934092098	More Than Human: Embracing the Promise of Biological Enhancement	Books	5	29	31	N	N	Brave new world or genetically-enhanced pipe dream?	The basic thesis of Ramez Naam's book is that with our ability to shape (especially to enhance) our biological nature through the tools of our culture--in particular, genetic engineering--we will transform humanity into \\"a plethora of forms,\\" which will eventually result in thousands if not millions of new species.  Naam contends that we will spawn \\"a new explosion of life as sudden and momentous as that of the Cambrian explosion\\" some 570 million years ago. (p. 233)<br /><br />That's the upside.  What is also possible (although Naam does not dwell on this) is that with biological enhancement tools that are presently coming into discovery and use, we may transform ourselves into beings who will have satisfied their every desire, and with that satiation, have put an end to desire.  The result may very well be the end of human evolution, biological or cultural.  And following that, the end of the species that began as a big-brained walking ape six million years ago.<br /><br />Or none of the above.<br /><br />This is the exciting part.  We have no idea where cultural evolution is going to take us.  We have no idea whether we will develop the ability to stave off natural disasters (rogue comets; nearby supernovae; unstoppable pathogens) or overcome our propensity to self-destruction in the form of perpetual war or the poisoning of our environment.  Yet, modern Luddites and social conservatives notwithstanding, we will indeed use the tools we develop to initially prevent and cure ailments and deficiencies, and ultimately to enhance our abilities to enjoy and to get the most out of life.<br /><br />This is what this book is all about.  Naam begins with the fuzzy distinction between using genetic engineering to heal or to enhance, and makes two telling points: (1) it is often impossible to distinguish between a procedure done as part of the healing arts, or one done to enhance our abilities; and (2) whether we like it or not, given human nature (as it now exists!) if the enhancement tools are there, promising greater intelligence or greater beauty or longer life, then we humans will inevitably use such tools.  If the Bush administration or some other Luddite-mentality government tries to suppress these tools, people will just go elsewhere.  And those societies that fall behind will fall very far behind.  The genetically enhanced will inherit the earth, and indeed it isn't much of a stretch to imagine a future in which those who have enhanced themselves are so far in advance of those who have not as to constitute superior beings.  Will the Luddites become pets?<br /><br />More immediately--keeping these ideas in mind--will it only be the rich who will benefit?  Naam argues--and I think convincingly--that yes, at first only the rich will use the tools to better themselves and their children, but then lagging only ten or twenty years behind will come the total mass of humanity.  Naam compares this process to that in the present day pharmaceutical environment in which initially the new drugs are very expensive, but after they go generic they become affordable to the masses.<br /><br />There is so much in the book that I will not be able to get to even a fraction of it.  So let me say that Naam has anticipated a lot of the criticism that will be leveled at his position and he has done a good job of answering it.  The idea that we can somehow stop genetic engineering to save our human nature is shown as bogus since human nature is an ever evolving, ever changing abstraction.  Even the concrete species itself (which is us) has changed mightily over the eons from Australopithecus to homo sapiens.  And whether we lift a finger or not, we will eventually change again or go extinct.  That is the main point.  We cannot stop change.  We cannot hope to preserve the present human \\"endowment.\\"  We can only hope to engage change, and with our intelligence make life better for ourselves and those to come, people who will be different from us, and going far enough into the future, very different from us.<br /><br />For the here and now, Naam sees biotech and neurotech enhancements as \\"investments in valuable human capital.\\" (p. 76)  I believe this is the primary reason the United States must overcome the backward mentality of the Bush administration and support not only more stem cell research, but encourage a greater investment in all forms of biological engineering.

108448:US	49786731	R3PV8R0L5TA6Y1	1580420842	808466577	Championship Hold'em (The Championship)	Books	4	19	20	N	N	Like listening to two great players chat about the game	Although Tom McEvoy and T.S. Cloutier are world class players this is not a world class poker book.  They repeat themselves a lot and and even contradict themselves a little, and they do ramble on.  One gets the sense that somebody miked them up and had them just talk about how to play various hands in various positions in various circumstances, mostly limit hold'em and in tournaments.<br /><br />For the not really booked up player this might be exactly right, but for the experienced player a lot of the advice is old hat.  McEvoy and Cloutier recognize as much because on a couple of occasions they apologize for the repetition and advise the reader to take what they're saying as a \\"refresher.\\"<br /><br />There is more than some merit to this advice.  Anybody who has played poker for any length of time knows that you can go through stages where you drift from correct play to careless play to downright bad play.  You are winning day after day, and you start to get overconfident and play more hands than you should.  Next thing you know you're raising with ace-rag and calling with J9 offsuit and leading into the flop with second pair, no kicker.  Reading this book will get you back to reality and tighten up your loose play, because believe me McEvoy and Cloutier do NOT play rags.  Well, except when they know you're going to toss...<br /><br />Generally, just about everything they say is correct or at least debatably correct.  Nonetheless I want to take exception to a couple of things, and to point out where what they say is only part of the story.<br /><br />Here's a good example.  Cloutier says, \\"I never--and I emphasize never--call a bet on the end just because of the size of the pot. (p. 213)<br /><br />Well, if the pot is ten grand and your only opponent coyly pushes fifty bucks into the pot, you're gonna call.  And when I say \\"you\\" I mean T.J. Cloutier as well.  You're also going to call if it's a limit game and your lone opponent flips his last dollar chip into a five-hundred dollar pot.  What Cloutier really is saying is that he reads the other player and the action.  He recalls what experiences he has had with this player while he considers what his opponent's likely hand is, and that all of these considerations are more important than the size of the pot.<br /><br />Here's another.  Cloutier says, \\"If there is more than one other player in the pot and you try to bluff on the end in limit hold'em, you might as well just donate your money to charity instead.\\" (p. 215)<br /><br />In a sense this is just an exaggeration to make a point.  But if you look deeper you can see that this cannot be right.  True, trying to steal the pot with a bet on the river is a losing proposition in limit hold'em.  However, if everybody only bet the goods on the river there wouldn't be much of a reason to call except in those cases where it's unclear who has the best hand.  Furthermore, if you NEVER bluff at the pot on the river, you are--in the nicely expressed words of David Sklansky--\\"giving away too much information.\\"<br /><br />Here's a third: Cloutier describes a situation in which you raise preflop with AJ and the flop comes rags and you have two opponents who check to you.  You bet and they toss.  Cloutier says, \\"You might have the best hand, don't get me wrong, but you're still bluffing with the best hand.\\"  Actually, what you're doing is semi-bluffing.  You have two overcards, and a not unreasonable expectation that you do indeed have the best hand at the moment.  Why give a free card for one of your opponents to snag a pair?<br /><br />And then there's the \\"free card\\" play.  Cloutier makes the very excellent point that \\"If you're going to make this play, you had better be drawing to the nuts.  You don't want to be drawing to a jack-high flush and raise to get a free card in a multi-way pot.\\"<br /><br />Amen to that.  However, when you are in last position and raise with a four-flush on the flop you are making a play for a half-priced card, and if the play works, the card you're getting for half price is the river card NOT the turn card.  (You can simply call and see the turn card for the flop bet.)  You pay an extra flop bet (half the size of the turn bet) in the hope that everybody will check to you on the turn and you can check to see the river for \\"free\\"--or actually for the flop bet you raised with.  Another point to understand here is that when you are drawing to the nuts and there are three or more players in the pot with you who will just call, you are actually getting proper odds for your raise.<br /><br />All in all an interesting if not entirely instructive book.  One of the best features is their advice on how to play twenty \\"practice tournament\\" hands from AA to some rags including 75 unsuited.  There's some good advice on tournament strategy and how to play in various kinds of games, tight, loose--no fold'em hold'em--and how to play against various types of players, maniacs, super tights, etc.  There are some interesting poker stories.  One of the best is about Cloutier being dealt AA in a $100/$200 hold'em game in San Jose.  The flop came A-Q-9.  T.J bet and got called by one player.  The turn was a five.  Again it was bet and call.  The river was a four.  Cloutier doesn't give the river betting, but you can be sure it was something like bet/raise!/call because he concludes by telling us that the Asian businessman he was playing against showed him three-deuce!y for a half-priced card, and if the play works, the card you're getting for half price is the river card NOT the turn card.

Essentially what Huber and Mills are telling us is this: we will not run out of energy until the atoms of the universe dissipate into the final stage of entropy some trillions of years from now.<br /><br />More immediately, as the oil patch runs dry we will convert the hybrid-electric engine (now coming hugely onto market) to the electric engine, which will get its power from electricity generated from coal and nuclear plants, and when we run out of coal and uranium, fusion will be practical and then something else--after all, matter is energy and vice-versa, and with a sufficiently advanced technology, we should be able to extract the energy even in a lump of rock.<br /><br />They are right, we are not about to run out of energy.  I give them a \\"duh\\" on that.  The sun still has five billion years to go.  Furthermore, energy is really just an exploitable contrivance between the relatively hot and the relatively cold.  What is important, as the authors never tire of mentioning, is the \\"ordering\\" of energy.  That is, how energy can be concentrated and aimed at some kind of useful enterprise, such as a laser beam or a logic gate in a computer and not dissipated into the atmosphere as heat.  (Although they insist that this dissipation, this \\"waste,\\" is not only okay, but to be celebrated as evidence of our technological prowess.  What they should be saying is that the less we dissipate, the less we pollute, the more technologically adept we are.)<br /><br />Here's another of their pronouncements: \\"As we have seen, most of the energy we consume is used to process and purify energy itself.\\"  This quote is from page 138, but you'll find essentially the same expression several other places in the book.  In fact, there is a lot of deliberate repetition as though the authors are giving a didactic seminar to some corporation's employees (or massaging the CEO)--which is what I suspect they sometimes do.  This may account for the fact that they often sound like they want to stand up and shout: \\"American workers you are the most productive in the world--rejoice!  Now get back to work.\\"<br /><br />Yes, most of the energy we consume is used to process and purify energy itself.  Ergo, the more energy we use the more energy we use.  Or if that isn't clear, try this: energy use increases because energy use increases.<br /><br />This tautology is not without (again) its didactic merit.  The first large-scale use of the coal-powered steam engine was to pump water out of coal mines.  In other words, energy was used to gain more energy.<br /><br />In the same vein (sorry), on page 136 the authors have a graph showing that the United States, the wealthiest nation on earth, has the highest per capita energy consumption while lesser nations are less wealthy and use less energy.  The authors conclude, \\"The more energy a nation uses, the richer it gets.\\"<br /><br />A tautology employed to catch our eye is one thing, but confounding cause with effect is quite another.  Measuring energy use is already measuring wealth.  Wealth and energy use are positively correlated because they are inseparable.  People are poor in Bangladesh not because they don't use enough energy.  They don't use enough energy because they can't afford to.<br /><br />The real reason per capita energy use has increased in this country is because we have gotten wealthier.  And the reason we have gotten wealthier is mostly related to globalization and free trade, to increased productivity because of technological advances, to education and science, to the greater employment of women in the workplace, and to the use of cheap labor, both from poorly paid illegal immigrants and relatively cheap outsourced labor.  This is not to mention the exploitation of the natural resources of other countries and indirectly their cheap labor.<br /><br />Another \\"point\\" Huber and Mills make is that a greater use of energy in, for example, gas-guzzling SUVs is not necessarily wasteful since more powerful engines using more fuel gain for their users time.  Yes, if you go 90 miles per hour you will get where you're going sooner than if you chug along at 65--that is, unless you're on the freeway at rush hour.<br /><br />There are a few slurs in the book aimed at people the authors don't think are too bright, such as greens and environmentalists.  One of those slurs with the most ironic quality is the one aimed at George Orwell.  After attempting to dismiss Orwell's dystopian vision in \\"1984,\\" the authors write that all kinds of non-dystopian things were happening \\"While Orwell was typing...\\" (p. 135)  The implication one gets is that Huber and Mills are writing, composing and edifying while George Orwell was only \\"typing.\\"  The irony is not so much that these two gentlemen are not in the same league as Orwell as writers and thinkers, but that Orwell's vision is upon us this very day with poverty, pollution and perpetual war, whether Huber and Mills notice it or not.<br /><br />One more point about which the authors are dead on right.  We won't run out of oil because as oil becomes scarce its price will no longer be competitive with other energy sources and so there will always be some crude left in the ground.  QED: we won't run out of oil.<br /><br />If you want to know about peak oil, read Beyond Oil (2005) by Kenneth S. Deffeyes.  If you want a contretemps to the views of Huber and Mills, I recommend Brian Czech's Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train (2000).  And if you're interested in the prospect for a hydrogen economy, The Hype about Hydrogen (2004) by Joseph J. Romm is excellent.s not to mention the exploitation of the natural resources of other countries and indirectly their cheap labor. <br /> <br />Another \\"point\\" Huber and Mills make is that a greater use of energy in, for example, gas-guzzling SUVs is not necessarily wasteful since more powerful engines using more fuel gain for their users time.

Graham's point is that had any one of the failures been instead successes, 9/11 would likely never have happened.<br /><br />The failure of the intelligence community is now well known and well documented.  Mainly it has been a case of not so much incompetence (although there was plenty of that) but of (believe or not) \\"a failure to communicate.\\"  That is, the CIA would not tell the FBI what it knew and vice-versa, and neither would tell other law enforcement and intelligence agencies what they knew.  The reason: mainly turf control.  Institutionally, the CIA never wants to tell anybody anything since any revelation may have the effect of revealing sources or methods, which would tend to lessen their ability to gather information in the future.  The FBI on the other hand wants to arrest people and have them prosecuted--although of course they don't want to make an arrest if they think they can get somebody higher up.  Furthermore, government agencies tend to withhold information to keep hidden incompetence or failure.  The Bush administration is notorious for this tactic; indeed the Bush administration does not share with the American people one iota of information unless it has to, or unless, in the rare instance, such information is entirely flattering to the White House.<br /><br />The failure of the Bush administration is unfortunately not so well known or understood as is that of the intelligence community.  Part of the problem is a failure NOT emphasized in this book, that is, the failure of the press to report the news as it is rather than as the White House would have it.  I'll skip the failure of the Fourth Estate for now, as Graham has, and concentrate on the most massive of all failures reported in this book, the failure to engage the enemy in the war on terror.  As Graham makes clear, what Bush has done with his invasion of Iraq is divert resources from the war on terror, using our military and hundreds of billions of our dollars in an exercise in utter futility, an exercise in shock and awe, full of sound and fury, signifying exactly, as Shakespeare had it, nothing.  Instead of going after Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda when we had them on the run in Afghanistan, Bush let bid Laden escape and instead went after the bogeyman Saddam Hussein.  The direct result has not only been that the terrorists who actually were responsible for the murders of 9/11 are still free to direct more acts of terror, but in Iraq, Bush has created \\"a laboratory for terrorists\\" (p. 222) and \\"a giant recruiting poster for radicalized Islamists\\" (p. 219)<br /><br />To put it bluntly, the Bush administration in effect is helping the terrorists.  Why?  The obvious reason is just sheer stupidity, ignorance and incompetence, but it is increasingly being hinted that George W. Bush is so much under the thrall of the Saudi princes who have the ability to one day make George W. a really, really rich man (instead of just a run of the mill millionaire) that he continues to allow them to financially support terror and does nothing about it.  Graham of course does not say this, but it is only a step or two from what he does say to this conclusion.<br /><br />Here's what Graham does say.  Noting that \\"...a section of the report [from a declassified CIA report on terrorism] related to the Saudi government and the assistance that government gave to some and possibly all of the September 11 terrorists\\" had been blacked out,  he writes,  \\"Again, it was as if the President's loyalty laymore with Saudi Arabia than with America's safety.\\"  (pp. 215-216)<br /><br />One also recalls, as Graham notes on page 106 that immediately following the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration allowed \\"more than 140 Saudis--including members of the bin Laden family\\" to be flown out of the United States.  This despite the fact that the FAA had ordered all (other) private flights grounded, and despite the fact that none of the Saudis was interviewed by the FBI.  Most of them were no doubt not involved in the attacks, but nonetheless they might have had information that would have helped the investigation.  I'm sure the reader does not have to be reminded that most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals.<br /><br />I want to make two other points: One, if the Bush administration and the administrations that follow do not use America's resources wisely in combating terrorism (instead of increasing it), we will almost inevitably experience a nuclear attack on one of our cities, most likely Washington D.C. or New York.  It is not enough to throw bodies and money at some perceived evil in the Middle East as if to puff out our chests in a macho manner.  Fighting terrorism requires skill, knowledge, hard work and dedication.  Bombs and troops on the wrong ground will not get it done.<br /><br />Finally, why, oh why, have we not heard any more about who planted the anthrax in the mail immediately following the September 11th attacks?  Graham reports only that \\"no connection has been established between the anthrax attacks and the terrorist attacks of September 11.\\" (p. 134)  I think he knows a lot more than he is letting on, and that there was a connection between Al Qaeda and the anthrax attacks that is being covered up, perhaps so as not to alarm the public.  See Cole, Leonard A. The Anthrax Letters: A Medical Detective Story (2003) for more details.oyalty lay more with Saudi Arabia than with America's safety.\\"  (pp. 215-216) <br /> <br />One also recalls, as Graham notes on page 106 that immediately following the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration allowed \\"more than 140 Saudis--including members of the bin Laden family\\" to be flown out of the United States.

147276:US	49786731	R201VDYFEEIAHB	0385500580	569055645	The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into our Genes	Books	4	43	44	N	N	Is "spirituality" an instinct?	Perhaps this book should be called \\"The Faith Gene\\" instead of \\"The God Gene.\\"  Geneticist Dean Hamer himself admits that \\"The God Gene is in fact a gross oversimplification...There are probably many different genes involved...\\" (p. 8)  Later on he writes, \\"I believe our genetic predisposition for faith [notice: not \\"God\\"] is no accident.  It provides us with a sense of purpose beyond ourselves and keeps us from being incapacitated by our dread of mortality.\\" (p. 143)  Note also that the book's subtitle declares that \\"Faith is Hardwired into Our Genes\\" while on page 211, Hamer declares that we are \\"Softwired for God.\\"<br /><br />Hamer's problem with definitions and usage arises because he is trying to take an abstraction such as \\"spirituality\\" or \\"transcendence\\" or \\"faith\\" or a belief in \\"God\\" and measure this abstraction with personality tests or by observing broader forms of  human behavior.  Furthermore he wants to make a useful distinction between religiousness and spirituality, between the extrinsic and intrinsic expression, the former being mostly public, such as church attendance, and the latter mostly private, such as prayer or meditation.  Having done this he then wants to find a gene or some genes that code for spirituality.  This is like trying to catch the ether in a hairnet.<br /><br />Nonetheless it goes almost without saying that however ill-defined such abstractions may be, they do in fact refer to something real.  A belief in an afterlife, in souls and inherited karma, in gods and poltergeists, heavens and hells, in things mystical and extrasensory, in a reality beyond a purely material and animal existence is universal to all human societies, past and present, and would seem to be as necessary as the very air we breathe.  (Gurus, churches and religions exploit this human necessity.)<br /><br />Consequently it is not so far-fetched to look for the predisposition for such beliefs in our genetic code, genes that have been selected by the evolutionary process.  The question remains however, exactly what behavior is it that is selected and found adaptive in an evolutionary sense?  Hamer thinks it is some sort of personal transcendence--that is, spirituality as opposed to religion as such (see page 215).  However I think there is reason to believe that what is selected is the more profane aspects of religion and spirituality.  To put it bluntly, what the genes (interacting with the environment of course) code for are tribalisms such as following a leader and being willing to die for the good of the tribe, and in general following the authority of tribal ways and means, believing what the shaman says, what the priest says, what the ayatollah tells us, and what the documents of the tribe declare as true.<br /><br />Edward O. Wilson in his book, On Human Nature (1978)--highly recommended, by the way--argued that the ability of the individual to conform to the group dynamics of religion was in itself adaptive.  He added, \\"When the gods are served, the Darwinian fitness of the members of the tribe is the ultimate if unrecognized beneficiary.\\"  (opus cited, p. 184)<br /><br />Still there is a sense in which it is possible to see the genetic predisposition toward faith and religion in a more morally positive sense.  Hamer believes that \\"God genes...provide human beings with an innate sense of optimism.\\" (p. 12)  Clearly life must be worth living, and faith provides us with any number of compensations for a hard life: promise of an afterlife, a rebirth to a better station, karmic comeuppance for transgressors, and karmic reward for our perceived good behavior, punishment for sin, etc., are artifacts of faith and are the main tenets of many religions.<br /><br />However as to the specific gene that Hamer comes to identify, the VMAT2 gene, which influences the flow of monoamines in the brain, it could be said that this gene is not so much the \\"God gene\\" as the \\"dope gene,\\" the gene that helps us to get high.  On page 77 he allows that \\"There might be another 50 genes or more of similar strength.\\"<br /><br />In addition to Hamer's central argument, there are aspects of this book that are interesting and valuable in themselves.  The chapter on \\"The DNA of the Jews\\" is absolutely fascinating and gives us a good idea of what is possible by using the changes in either the \\"y\\" or \\"x\\" chromosomes to trace human migrations and intermarriages.<br /><br />I also like the distinction that Hamer makes between spirituality and religion.  We all know people who are spiritual, but don't go to church (or temple or mosque, etc).  And we all know people who attend church regularly but are about as spiritual as hyenas.  (I won't mention any White House occupants, past or present!)  And it is clear that there are agnostic scientists who are very spiritual persons indeed.<br /><br />However, the weakest part of the book involves Hamer's attempt to adequately define spirituality and to distinguish it from religion.  He calls in the psychology and psychiatric establishments to help out.  I don't think they help much.  It is a daunting task to even define \\"God\\" adequately.  In the final analysis he goes with the idea of transcendence.  However what we humans want to transcend is our animal nature (and sometimes the evidence of our senses and our experience!).  Part of the reason we wear clothes and otherwise cover up while imagining that we have souls and are made in the image of God is to make our animal nature less obvious.  For human beings it is not sufficient to be just animals.  We are (or should be) spirit as well.

Taoism has \\"the way,\\" and the Buddha famously turned aside questions about God as being beside the point, while the ineffable God of the Vedas is nothing that a believer in a personal god would recognize at all.page 77 he allows that \\"There might be another 50 genes or more of similar strength.\\" <br /> <br />In addition to Hamer's central argument, there are aspects of this book that are interesting and valuable in themselves.  The chapter on \\"The DNA of the Jews\\" is absolutely fascinating and gives us a good idea of what is possible by using the changes in either the \\"y\\" or \\"x\\" chromosomes to trace human migrations and intermarriages. <br /> <br />I also like the distinction that Hamer makes between spirituality and religion.  We all know people who are spiritual, but don't go to church (or temple or mosque, etc).  And we all know people who attend church regularly but are about as spiritual as hyenas.  (I won't mention any White House occupants, past or present!)  And it is clear that there are agnostic scientists who are very spiritual persons indeed.    <br /> <br />However, the weakest part of the book involves Hamer's attempt to adequately define spirituality and to distinguish it from religion.  He calls in the psychology and psychiatric establishments to help out.  I don't think they help much.  It is a daunting task to even define \\"God\\" adequately.  In the final analysis he goes with the idea of transcendence.  However what we humans want to transcend is our animal nature (and sometimes the evidence of our senses and our experience!).  Part of the reason we wear clothes and otherwise cover up while imagining that we have souls and are made in the image of God is to make our animal nature less obvious.  For human beings it is not sufficient to be just animals.  We are (or should be) spirit as well.  Hamer actually declares that \\"Spirituality...is, in fact, an instinct.\\" (p. 6) <br /> <br />Finally, faith does not require a god.  Taoism has \\"the way,\\" and the Buddha famously turned aside questions about God as being beside the point, while the ineffable God of the Vedas is nothing that a believer in a personal god would recognize at all.	2005-07-26

Written by Greg Behrendt (your eternal big brother) and (love's labors always lost) Liz Tuccillo of TV's Sex and the City,\\" \\"he's just not that into you\\" is just the sort of book that Miss Lonely Hearts can curl up with on a Saturday night with a tub of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream (ah, I wish I could) instead of the usual Harlequin romance.  I mean YOU are worth it!<br /><br />This sort of pandering by Greg and Liz to the unlucky-in-love who find Sex and the City the highlight of their wretched (but ever hopeful) lives is nothing short of Huckster Street smarmy with a purpose--the purpose being to separate YOU (who deserve love and happiness) from your hard-earned money, which is deserved by Greg and Liz because they are just so darn clever and pander so shrewdly to the susceptible reader--which makes me think that before working on Sex and the City they wrote TV commercials for diet foods or hair shampoo, or whatever the commercial is that insists, \\"YOU are worth it!\\"<br /><br />The deeper problem with this book is that the women who \\"write\\" the letters to Greg are not real women but ideas of women from Greg's imagination.  Sure they were based on people he knows and he probably even quoted a line or two from some of them verbatim, but they are not real people.  And their equally fictional men are all very much alike in that they have only a phony sensitivity for women and really only care primarily about their own desires and fulfillment--and note that they, too, are products of Greg's mind.  Some men will tell you the truth about how they feel.<br /><br />A second problem is that his facile answers of what to do (usually, dump the loser) are too simplistic and don't allow for the compromises that characterize all human relationships, especially those that lead to successful marriages.  No one is perfect, and people really do need to be forgiven, and they need a chance to grow.  Most of the (fictional) women in the book are in their twenties and thirties, a time of real social and emotional growth by both men and women, and so it is not always wise to give up on a relationship.  People do get to the point where they are not likely to change much, but usually that takes place later in life.  I am not, repeat NOT, excusing some of the behavior of the men described by Greg's \\"women.\\"  There is never any excuse for abuse or neglect.  I am only saying that if a guy misses a call or forgets your birthday, yes, he is not Wonderful in All Things, but remember few of us are.<br /><br />As for Liz Tuccillo, who writes the \\"Why this is hard\\" rebuttals to Greg's pronouncements, I think she too needs to understand that love is a two-way street, a case of give and take.  She's had trouble holding onto the kind of male she finds attractive.  She's 41, still single, still dating, and it could be said, still looking for Mr Goodshaft, whom she finds all the time.<br /><br />You want to know why?  Because she's masochistic?  Maybe.  Because she's possibly neurotic and married to her work?  Maybe.  Whatever the reason, she needs to develop a realistic appreciation of actual men, not just those she imagines are alpha males.  Maybe she needs to find some short, balding guy that still lives with his mother and make him happy.  Maybe she needs to be kind to omega males, and keep searching through the all too depressing heap of omega males until she finds one that isn't half bad.  Omega males need love too.  And it could be said that \\"not half bad\\" is appropriate if you're 41-years-old, never been married and have a \\"been-dumped\\" rap sheet as long as the closing credits to a Hollywood epic, and especially if you are the type of person who thinks just because you are successful at work, you are a great catch.<br /><br />Greg's point seems to be that most guys are jerks and Liz's experience seems to proves it.  But what they're missing is the ecologyand economics of the old dating game.  You get what you're worth.  You knew that in high school.  Top jock scores with prom queen, NOT unsocial geek who picks his nose in public gets to bed down the head of cheer.  (And by the way, these stereotypes are not necessarily the ideals that we should be looking for in mates.  The king and queen of the hop in later life sometimes find sadly that they reached their peak in high school.)  And if all you are getting are a bunch of losers, guess what?  YOU are the loser.  And maybe you need to work on upgrading your own personality and make yourself someone who has a lot to offer.  Or at least alter your taste in males.<br /><br />I've got some advice: Give the garage mechanic a bath.  Flirt with the nerdy bank clerk.  Tell the fry cook he looks cute when the sweat runs down his nose.  Take a course at the local junior college in some kind of class that might be filled with MEN, home repairs or electrical wiring or basic construction, not women's issues or dance aerobics for fatties.<br /><br />Regardless of how good Greg and Liz are with the one-liners (and they are good) you can get better relationship advice elsewhere than in this cutesy, narrowly-conceived book.  There's a whole shelf at the library of books written by people with some real experience in human psychology who really do \\"understand guys.\\"the ecology and economics of the old dating game.

(By the way, both pronunciations, sloth with a long \\"o\\" to rhyme with \\"both,\\" and sloth with a short \\"o\\" to rhyme with \\"moth\\" are correct.)  It's one of the seven deadly sins and this is one of seven books on them commissioned by the Oxford University Press and the New York Public Library.  The books are all short and neat and beautifully presented.  Each grew out of lectures sponsored by Oxford and the library.<br /><br />Here we have Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein championing the cause of sloth as she parodies self-help tomes (she has apparently read a few) while satirizing the mass culture (and of course herself) to the reader's delight.<br /><br />Wasserstein is not so much knockdown funny as she is entertaining.  There are a few belly laughs and a number of chuckles, but mostly there is the sense that she is actually saying something of value about who we are and where we're going.<br /><br />Clearly Wasserstein knows human foibles and she knows the seduction of the mass culture and especially that nasty admonition from others (especially your parents) to \\"make something of yourself.\\"  Ironically, while Wasserstein has indeed made something of herself, here--tongue only partially in cheek--she strongly advises you to just hang out on the couch.  She has an \\"Activity Gram Counter\\" that limits you to 50 grams of activity a day.  Eating a Krispy Kreme donut along with Sleepytime tea costs you 5 grams, the same as watching the Cartoon Network on TV, while reading the New York Times will set you back 30 grams.  Not to worry, reading People Magazine rates a minus 5 grams, but watch out for those \\"Great turn-of-the-century Russian novels,\\" the reading of which costs you a whopping 100 grams a session.  In essence this is a celebration of sloth as the way to health and happiness, a stress-free life, a better world, and most importantly, a better YOU.<br /><br />I think the book was mostly successful and I enjoyed reading it.  However Wendy's assumption of a male self-help guru persona was not consistently maintained and should never have been employed since (1) it added nothing; (2) could not in any way disguise Wasserstein's unique voice; and (3) made for some confusion since it was obvious that the most telling observations came from a femme point of view.  And this despite the fact that some of the humor revolves around an ambiguous sexual orientation; e.g., her persona claims that in high school he dated both men and women and believed that he \\"was going to be a father and a mother\\" and as president of the US \\"would have a charming First Lady\\" by his side \\"and be escorted by a poet laureate husband.\\"  (Random thought: if either Hillary Clinton or Condi Rice becomes the first woman president of the United States, will either's husband be the \\"First Gentleman\\"?)<br /><br />Accompanying the text is some charming artwork by Serge Bloch, most of it line drawings, one of which appears on the cover, that of an amazingly relaxed and blissful stick-figure man in a hammock.<br /><br />Wasserstein claims that reading this book only costs two activity grams and that rereading it is a \\"Sloth Zone Activity\\" resulting in a negative 25 grams.

159600:US	49786731	R3LND6J861F273	0881926752	230899728	The Nature of Plants: Habitats, Challenges, and Adaptations	Books	5	20	20	N	N	A beautiful book	Most of the color photographs are by co-author Rob Lucas.  They are just sumptuous--stunning even--and carefully chosen, and illustrative of the great diversity of plant life on earth.  There is a slight bias in favor of the unique biota of New Zealand which is understandable since Lucas is from New Zealand.  He and his colleague, UC Berkeley botany PhD John Dawson, have written several books on the flora of New Zealand, one of which won the Natural Heritage Prize.  This book too ought to win some sort of prize since it is so gorgeously illustrated, so engagingly written, and so carefully edited.<br /><br />They take the widest possible focus in introducing the reader to plants from around the world and from many different habitats, from deserts to swamps, from the Arctic to the Amazon.  They begin in the first chapter, \\"The Freeloaders: Plants Using Plants,\\" with parasitic plants such as the tree-dwelling epiphytes, of which the familiar mistletoe is an example.  This sets the tone for the book, the idea being to show how plants make a living in the world and how they interact with other plants and with animals, and how they meet the challenges of their environments.  In other words, as the title has it, the authors explain and illustrate \\"The Nature of Plants.\\"  As such this book is an excellent introduction to the nontechnical aspects of botany, giving the reader the sort of information about plants that would especially appeal to weekend gardeners and others (like myself) who love plants but have had no academic training in botany.<br /><br />However, this is no \\"plants for dummies\\" sort of book.  Scientific nomenclature is used throughout, and precise numbers about plant sizes and other aspects of their lives, including rainfall and temperatures, are given in both metric terms and US equivalents.  References are made to more comprehensive academic tomes, and there is a glossary of specialized terms.<br /><br />Here is a short notice of facts that I found especially interesting:<br /><br />It is well known that fire can be the catalyst for the germination of some kinds of seeds, and indeed, there are seeds that germinate only after a fire.  On page 136 the authors explain that \\"In some pines, the tips of the woody scales of the cones are glued together with resin.  Fire melts the resin, and the scales are able to separate.\\"<br /><br />They also report that \\"it has been discovered that smoke alone can break the dormancy of seeds of many heathland species in South Africa and Australia.\\"  Even more surprising is that in the chaparral in California (where I have hiked many times) \\"It is believed that some of the shrubs manufacture toxins that leach into the soil with rain and inhibit the germination of seeds.  Fire destroys these toxins, and the seeds then germinate abundantly.  In following years, the herbs steadily diminish as shading increases and toxins from the shrubs build up in the soil.\\" ( p. 135)<br /><br />We have all heard of a swarm (or \\"plague\\") of locusts, but the one the authors describe here is truly incredible: \\"One such swarm,\\" they write, \\"in eastern Africa was described as being more than 30 m (100) feet deep on a front 1.6 km (1 mile) wide that took 9 hours to pass by.\\"  Imagine that you are a poor farmer with a crop just ready for harvest, and then the locusts descend.  What could you do?  (p. 207)<br /><br />By the way, there is an amazingly beautiful photo on the opposite page (206) of a cabbage tree moth on a dead cabbage tree leaf illustrating not only the moth's camouflage but some of the incredible beauty that nature is capable of.  The colors are fantastic.  As lovers of flowers know, no chemist can match the ability of nature to produce color in such vivid and arresting hues.<br /><br />As I was reading this and admiring the beautiful photos I couldn't help but think about plants as our benefactors, and to marvel at how they have come to an accommodation (in some cases a clear symbiosis) with thepesky animals that want to eat them, and how they have in many cases learned to use the animals to their advantage as pollinators and seed dispersers.  It gives me hope for humankind to think that if plants can make such clever give-and-take arrangements (without a hint of rancor) with those who would be their enemies, surely we can do the same with our fellow humans.iosis) with the pesky animals that want to eat them, and how they have in many cases learned to use the animals to their advantage as pollinators and seed dispersers.

161438:US	49786731	RW57VJTUAGKPD	0743259912	450699116	The Male Biological Clock: The Startling News About Aging, Sexuality, and Fertility in Men	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Thoroughly professional and up to date	It should be noted that this is more narrowly focused than the title would suggest.  Dr. Fisch's book is not so much about \\"the male biological clock\\" as it is about the male biological clock as it relates to male sexual performance and fertility.  As such it is an excellent book for those men who are concerned about being able to father children and to perform well sexually.  And it is not just for the older male. There is a lot of useful information for younger males as well who are having problems with conception and performance.<br /><br />This is also a good book for the female partner because it emphasizes that infertility is often a male problem and not a female problem as is usually thought to be the case.  In fact, Dr. Fisch believes that 40% of infertility problems are on the female side, 40% on the male side, with the remaining 20% of undetermined or shared origin.  If you're a woman and suspect that the fault might be his, you might buy him this book.<br /><br />Dr. Fisch uses the phrase \\"male biological clock\\" to emphasize that even though men do not go through a menopause as such as do women, their sexual biological clock does indeed gradually run down.  However, as Frisch phrases it, \\"Not all men are created equally biologically.\\" (p. 18)  Instead, some are as sexually capable as a thirty-year-old at eighty, when others are like seventy-year-olds when they are in their thirties.  Fisch gives reasons and explanations for this, and presents some things you can do about it.<br /><br />His discussion centers around four \\"key physical factors.\\" They are \\"semen,\\" \\"sperm,\\" \\"testosterone,\\" and \\"erections.\\"  There are chapters devoted to these factors as well as ones on sexual health in general and a final chapter on \\"Working as a Team,\\" which is about sexual partners helping one another to overcome dysfunction.  Fisch's treatment is precise, focused, a bit clinical (but that is good), and authoritative.  There are a number of helpful charts and biologically correct drawings to illuminate the text--which somehow reminds me of a book I found in a neighbor's bookcase many years ago when I was an impressionable teenager.  It was called, \\"What You Can Do about Sex after Sixty.\\"  All the pages were blank.<br /><br />How the times have changed.  If that book were to be \\"written\\" today, the \\"Sixty\\" in the title would have to be changed to, say, \\"Eighty.\\"<br /><br />An important part of this book is devoted to how couples might go about solving their infertility problems.  Dr. Fisch describes various procedures, evaluates them and reveals how much they cost.  There's even a chart on page 89 showing how much it costs to have a baby using four different types of treatment.  He also explains who might benefit from testosterone treatment and who might not.  He describes how Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis work and if they're \\"right for you\\" while weighing the efficacy of other methods to achieve the same thing.<br /><br />There are some surprises.  A side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., Prozac) is that while their antidepressant qualities might take \\"weeks to kick in, their orgasm-delaying effects happen within about four hours.\\" (p. 83)  This is good for young men with premature ejaculation problems, but not so good for older guys because SSRIs \\"can interfere with both erectile function and the ability to achieve orgasm.\\" (p. 75)<br /><br />Another interesting fact is that being overweight can cause testosterone levels to drop.  Dr. Fisch explains that \\"Excess body fat does this because testosterone is normally broken down in the body's fat cells; hence, if you have a lot of fat, your body breaks down testosterone extra-quickly, leading to a deficiency.\\"  He adds that \\"abdominal or 'belly' fat [the old spare tire] has a greater capacity to break down testosterone than other types of fat.\\"  (p. 47)<br /><br />Bottom line: a thoroughly professional, carefully written, closely edited, and easy-to-read introductionto a subject of interest to men (especially middle-aged men) with sexual and fertility problems.  Reading this book first before going to the doctor might save you a lot of time and money, and at the very least can help you to ask the right questions.o-read introduction to a subject of interest to men (especially middle-aged men) with sexual and fertility problems.

170776:US	49786731	R1AKPA24WOZF06	0131856278	89233050	Number: The Language of Science, The Masterpiece Science Edition	Books	5	42	46	N	N	Postmodern mathematics?	Einstein called this \\"the most interesting book on the evolution of mathematics which has ever fallen into my hands.\\"<br /><br />Number was first published in 1930 with the fourth edition coming out in 1954.  This is a republication of that fourth edition (Dantzig died in 1956) edited by Joseph Mazur with a foreword by Barry Mazur.  It is an eminently readable book like something from the pages of that fascinating four-volume work The World of Mathematics (1956) edited by James R. Newman in that it is aimed at mathematicians and the educated lay public alike.<br /><br />Part history, part mathematics and part philosophy, Number is the story of how we humans got from \\"one, two...many\\" to various levels of infinity.  Strange to say it is also about reality.  Here is Dantzig's concluding statement from page 341 in Appendix D: \\"...modern science differs from its classical predecessor: it has recognized the anthropomorphic origin and nature of human knowledge.  Be it determinism or rationality, empiricism or the mathematical method, it has recognized that man is the measure of all things, and that there is no other measure.\\"<br /><br />Or more pointedly from a couple of pages earlier: \\"Man's confident belief in the absolute validity of the two methods [mathematics and experiment] has been found to be of an anthropomorphic origin; both have been found to rest on articles of faith.\\"<br /><br />These are inescapably the statements of a postmodernist.  I was surprised to read them in a book on the theory of numbers, and even more surprised to realize that if mathematics is a distinctly human language, it is entirely possible that beings from distant worlds may speak an entirely different language; and therefore our attempts to use what many consider the \\"universal\\" language of mathematics to communicate with them may be in vain.<br /><br />And this thought makes me wonder.  Is the concept \\"two,\\" for example, (as opposed to the number \\"2\\") really just a human construction?  Would not intelligent life anywhere be able to make a distinction, just as we have, between, say, two things and three things?  And if so, would they not be able to count?  And would not then the entire edifice of mathematics (or at least most of it) follow?<br /><br />I wonder if Dantzig was not in contradiction with himself on this point because earlier he writes (p. 252) \\"...any measuring device, however simple and natural it may appear to us, implies the whole apparatus of the arithmetic of real numbers: behind any scientific instrument there is the master-instrument, arithmetic, without which the special device can neither be used nor even conceived.\\"  Does this not imply that measurements (by any beings) and therefore numbers have an existence outside of the human mind and do not rest on \\"articles of faith\\"?<br /><br />As to the numbers themselves (putting philosophy aside) we learn that the two biggest bugaboos in the history of number are zero and infinity.  It took a long, long time for humans, as Dantzig relates, to accept the idea of zero as a number.  Today zero is also a place-holder.  But what does it mean to say that there are zero pink elephants dancing about my living room?  I can see one cow in the yard, or two or three, but I cannot see zero cows in the yard.<br /><br />Of course, today it is easy to see that zero is a number that is less than one and greater than minus one.  I have one cow and I sell that one cow.  Now I have zero cows.  (Curiously, note that the plural noun \\"cows\\"  is grammatically required.)  However, the imperfect fit within the entire structure of mathematics that zero has achieved may be appreciated by realizing that every other number can be a denominator; that is, three over one equals three, three over two equals 1.5, etc., but what does three over zero equal?<br /><br />It is a convention of mathematics to say that division by zero is \\"undefined.\\"  There is no other number about which the same can be said.<br /><br />I used to think when I was young that infinity was the proper answer to division by zero.  For Dantzig this is clearly not correct because to him infinity is not a number at all but a part of the process.  He writes, \\"the concept of infinity has been woven into the very fabric of our generalized number concept.\\"  He adds, \\"The domain of natural numbers rested on the assumption that the operation of adding one can be repeated indefinitely, and it was expressly stipulated that never shall the ultra-ultimate step of this process be itself regarded as a number.\\"  Of course he is talking about \\"natural\\" numbers.  He notes in the next sentence that in the generalization to \\"real\\" numbers, \\"the limits of these processes\\" were \\"admitted...as bona fide numbers.\\" (p. 245)  In other words, part of the process became a number itself!<br /><br />The culmination of Dantzig's argument here is that infinity itself is a construction of the human mind and exists nowhere (that we can prove) outside of the human mind.  He believes that the basis for our belief in the existence of infinity comes from our (erroneous) conception of time as a continuum.  Dantzig notes that Planck time and indeed all aspects of the world are to be seen in terms of discrete quanta and not continuous streams.<br /><br />Ultimately, Dantzig gives this sweeping advice to the scientist: \\"...he will be wise to wonder what role his mind has played in...[a] discovery, and whether the beautiful image he sees in the pool of eternity reveals the nature of this eternity, or is but a reflection of his own mind.\\" (p. 242)d. <br /> <br />I used to think when I was young that infinity was the proper answer to division by zero.

She claims to have been sexually abused by her adoptive father, but one can clearly see in Casey's mesmerizing narrative that it was the adoptive mother who was not only a psychological abuser, but something of negative role model for the kind of controlling, selfish, neurotic, abusive, sociopathic murderess that Celeste would become.<br /><br />The primary victim of the story is Steven Beard, a self-made Texas millionaire who in his seventies had recently lost his beloved wife of over forty years.  (Of course, there were many victims of Celeste.  As with most sociopaths, almost everybody who knew Celeste was victimized in one way or another.)  He is the \\"old fool.\\"  He falls for her even though she is young enough to be his granddaughter; and like so many of her men, even though he begins to see (after it's too late) that she is evil, he can't let her go.  Part of the reason is that he also fell in love with her identical twin daughters, Jennifer and Kristina, who helped to rejuvenate his life by giving him a purpose as their stepfather.  One can only feel sorry for such a man, and think how ironic it is that before he lost his wife and met Celeste he was in charge of his life, a successful man who was well-liked and admired.  But Celeste laid him low.<br /><br />Celeste is an interesting study, a kind of femme fatale on steroids.  The portrait that Casey draws of her in these pages is that of an attractive and vital woman with a gift for persuasion, for acting, for bullying, and for the confidence game; a woman with a pathological need to control others and to acquire money and to spend it recklessly; a woman with a terrible need to be surrounded by people, but a woman with no love for anyone but herself.  She was also a sexual predator who used and disposed of men at will, a woman as experienced in sex as a prostitute.  Furthermore, she had the manic/depressive's bipolar nature that drove her from the depths of depression to the heights of reckless abandonment--sometimes almost simultaneously.<br /><br />People like Celeste tend to die young or end up in prison.  Somebody kills them or they kill themselves, or they get caught and exposed.  Celeste got caught.  Ironically, what did her in was the person she felt she had the most control over.  That is, her \\"favorite\\" daughter, Kristina, who was so in thrall of \\"Mommie Dearest,\\" as the twins liked to call her, that she would do whatever her mom told her to do and could not, no matter how hard she tried, ever go against her mom.  She was psychologically cowed in one way and in another way she formed part of a dependency relationship in which she, the daughter, found herself doing everything she could to help her mother get safely through another day.<br /><br />Add to this mix Tracy Tarlton, a middle-aged lesbian with a history of mental illness who fell madly in love with Celeste, and what we have is a scenario in which a kind of turbo'ed madness runs amuck.  As the story nears its climax there is a nice natural irony that develops when Celeste hires Donna (n&eacute;e \\"Don\\") Goodson who cons her out of several thousand dollars by pretending to hire a hitman to kill Tracy.<br /><br />One wonders what might have happened had Celeste not been stopped.  Presumably she would have spent all her inherited millions and then found a new victim.  However she was caught, and clearly the central event that led to her being caught was when Kristina finally saw the light and was able to escape from her mother's psychological dominance.  Casey points to what she considers the turning point on page 325 when Kristina hears her mother say, \\"I hired somebody to kill Tracy.\\"  That statement ends Chapter 16 and begins Chapter 17.  It a demarcation point before which Kristina's loyalty was to her mother and after which it was to herself.  Yet one suspects that for Kristina to make this transformation of loyalty, she had to have help and she had to have some kind of ongoing relearning experience.  One suspects that Justin, Kristina's boyfriend, was the person who gave her the strength to overcome her mother's psychological dominance.  Once Celeste lost control of Kristina, her whole world fell apart.<br /><br />Bottom line: She Wanted It All is one of the best true crime tales I've ever read.  I promise all true crime fans that once you open the book and start reading you will burn some midnight oil.  I would have read all 448 pages in one fell swoop except that I do have an occasional life.

Books	4	7	8	N	N	Dr. Lee is the real Charlie Chan	There are five cases in this book examined in detail by the illustrious Dr. Henry Lee.  They are<br /><br />The Concetta \\"Penney\\" Serra Case<br /><br />The Skakel-Moxley Case<br /><br />The JonBenet Ramsey Case<br /><br />The Lisa Peng Case; and<br /><br />The Suzan Barratt Case.<br /><br />I'll look briefly at two of them.<br /><br />The longest chapter in the book is on the JonBenet Ramsey case.  Lee gives a comprehensive summary of events from a forensic point of view including a lot of material about the rift between the Boulder police and the district attorney's office, and the problems they had with the intensive media coverage.  I didn't learn anything new, having read several books on the case, but I would note that twice Lee mentions that the blow to the head that JonBenet suffered was \\"fatal.\\"  This is significant since it means that the ligature application around her neck was not the cause of death.  This would be another bit of evidence indicating an elaborate attempt at a coverup.<br /><br />I was disappointed that Lee would not venture an opinion on who killed JonBenet, although at one point he indicates that he advised the District Attorney, Alex Hunter, that she may have died as the result of an accident during some kind of domestic quarrel.  The conclusion that many who followed the case came to was that Patsy Ramsey lost her temper (perhaps over JonBenet's bed-wetting) and either hit JonBenet with some instrument--a golf club, a flashlight--or shook her so hard that JonBenet hit her head on something like the porcelain toilet.  Unable to revive her child, Patsy Ramsey panicked, and in her distraught state of mind devised an elaborate coverup which she presented to her husband.  Although he should have known better, John Ramsey decided to go along with the coverup.  What they should have done of course was to own up to the accident.  However, by applying the ligature around JonBenet's neck (presumably Patsy did that), they had burned their bridges and so were stuck with the transparent story.  Fortunately for them the incompetent police so compromised the crime scene that they were never able to gain enough evidence to prove that the Ramseys were responsible.  See Sgt. Steve Thomas's book  Jon Ben&eacute;t: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation (2000) for an authoritative report on the case.<br /><br />(For those who cling to the intruder story put out by John and Patsy Ramsey, I can only say the coverup letter and the coverup ligature seem fantastically out of place in such a scenario.  However, even though I am fairly sure that the Ramseys in some way \\"did it,\\" I would not convict them from the evidence I have seen since there is \\"reasonable\\" doubt about what actually happened.  Furthermore, I believe they stupidly covered up an accident--or at worse a \\"manslaughter.\\"  They didn't mean to kill their daughter.)<br /><br />In the Skakel-Moxley case, Dr. Lee is a bit more forthcoming in his opinion (perhaps because Michael Skakel was actually convicted of the murder of Martha Moxley).  Still it is fascinating to read how carefully Dr. Lee presents his opinions.  I followed the case and I've read Mark Fuhrman's book on the subject, Murder in Greenwich (1998).  (Yes, he too from the O.J. Simpson trial.)  One of the things that Dr. Lee does in this book is emphasize the sheer brutality of the murder as he describes in lurid detail how Skakel killed her with a golf club, hitting her so hard that the club broke; and then he stabbed her with the broken end of the club.<br /><br />Two quick points:<br /><br />One, notice that what these two cases (and others) have in common is poor police work by cops who were seemingly in awe of the wealth and status of the accused and their families and connections.  In other words, if you're rich and famous, it is easier to get away with murder (literally).<br /><br />Two, Dr. Lee makes the very excellent point (in his usual careful style) that our over reliance on confessions often does not make for justice.  He writes, \\"questions raised about confessions by an increasing number of writers and scholars today only serve, in my scientist's opinion, to underscore the importance that forensic and scientific evidence will play in courtrooms in the years ahead.\\" (p. 118)<br /><br />Oh, and yes, Dr. Lee is very much taken with himself, but I think he has license.  He really is a brilliant and enormously dedicated forensic scientist, so much so that he is sometimes hired by either the prosecution or the defense just so that he will then not be able to work for the other side!  (Actually, it has happened that Dr. Lee has worked for both sides of a case, although I don't believe simultaneously.)  He is a frequent visitor on Court TV and other media where his insights into cases are very much worth hearing.<br /><br />Bottom line: interesting book, very much worth reading, especially if you haven't taken a detailed look at these cases.not make for justice.

181296:US	49786731	R28PWLBGZEFEOK	193211193X	52766024	Degunking Your Email, Spam, and Viruses	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Internet Gunk 101 and then some	This is the third book on email, spam and viruses and such that I've read in the last couple of weeks, and it is the best.  One of the other two, Black Hat: Misfits, Criminals, and Spammers in the Internet Age (2004) by John Biggs, covers much of the same material as covered here but not in as much depth, while the other, Spam Kings (2005) by Brian McWilliams, is more a narrative about the personalities in the spam world than a how-to.  (Nonetheless both books are good.)<br /><br />Duntemann's book has a kind of \\"Dummies...\\" or \\"Idiots...\\" feel to it with lots of sidebars and photos of computer screens and tips and hints and numbered lists, and even some \\"Gunkbuster's Notebook\\" pages; but Duntemann's treatment is more comprehensive than usually found in an introductory book.  He goes into considerable detail not only on how to \\"degunk\\" your email, but explains how email filters work and how spam, viruses and worms propagate, and what you can do about them.  He also looks at various scams and the scary subject of identity theft and advises on how to not fall victim.  This book will work for beginners and the experienced alike.<br /><br />It will be noted that Duntemann doesn't directly address the problems that plague users of the big Internet Service Providers like Yahoo! and AOL, mainly because some of the very measures he recommends are currently being used by the big providers.  One of my email addresses is at Yahoo! (Duntemann recommends that you have at least two email addresses) and it gets a lot of spam.  But I don't see any of it because Yahoo! has a spam filter that puts it in my bulk folder which I almost never open.  I didn't think much of this until I learned how email filters work.  I used to think that somehow the ISP identified spam by the number of identical emails sent to its customers (and they may do that); but after reading Duntemann's explanation I now realize that filters usually work on key words and other bits of evidence in the actual email.  Certain words like \\"free\\" and \\"mortgage\\" and especially \\"unsubscribe\\" (a near-certain indicator of spam since spammers hope you'll click on that to prove that your email address is a live one) trigger the filters.  Another technique, Duntemann explains is so-called Bayesian filtering which uses a \\"statistical analysis of message length and the distribution of words present in a message\\" to arrive at a probability of the message being spam.<br /><br />But this made me wonder if--and Duntemann warns about this possibility--if some legitimate emails were being caught as spam.  So I checked my Yahoo! bulk filter and didn't find any.  My guess is that the latest filtering tools used by the big ISPs like Yahoo! and AOL are even more sophisticated than those that Duntemann describes in this book.<br /><br />Duntemann also warns against spam control methods that don't work.  Surprisingly, one of these, in his opinion, is making spam illegal.  I've always liked that idea, but after reading Duntemann's argument, I'm convinced that it doesn't work, can't be enforced, and only the good guys would comply with such a law.  Duntemann points out that the \\"much ballyhooed [but gutted] CAN-SPAM Act,\\" passed by Congress that went into effect January 1, 2004, \\"had no effect that can be measured.\\"<br /><br />There is also a chapter on how to \\"Avoid Becoming a Spam Magnet!\\"  Naturally the first rule (and this should be the Golden Rule of the Internet) is \\"Don't patronize spammers.\\"  But also don't respond to \\"surveys\\" or \\"dating service\\" spams \\"which,\\" as Duntemann explains, \\"only exist to verify your email address and will lead to even more spam.\\"  And whatever you do, DON'T EVER \\"unsubscribe\\" to a spammer's mailing list.  Spammers love it when you do because that makes your email address valuable to them, either for their own spamming or to sell to other spammers.  (Yes, I repeated that.  Actually I should also repeat \\"Don't patronize spammers!\\" with an exclamation mark.  After all,junior's not going to get any bigger no matter what pills you take, and there's no such thing as a reliable \\"Spanish fly,\\" etc., etc.)<br /><br />Throughout the book Duntemann gives email addresses and the names of software that can help you in your fight against spam, worms, viruses, and scams.  He recommends using \\"disposable email addresses when dealing with all but the biggest and most reputable online commerce sites.\\"<br /><br />By the way, I always thought that the reason Microsoft's Outlook Express, its Internet Explorer, and in general Microsoft products were more subject to hacking than other software was that Microsoft's code wasn't as good as say Linux's or that of some other email providers.  But if I am reading Duntemann correctly, the real reason is that Microsoft is the biggest target.  Why write a virus that can only affect a fraction of the computers on the Net when you can write one that will attack the near-monopoly?<br /><br />Bottom line: Internet Gunk 101 in a book.  Definitely worth the plastic.fter all, junior's not going to get any bigger no matter what pills you take, and there's no such thing as a reliable \\"Spanish fly,\\" etc., etc.) <br /> <br />Throughout the book Duntemann gives email addresses and the names of software that can help you in your fight against spam, worms, viruses, and scams.

This is an example of a genre that I might call \\"naive literature.\\"  The term is not necessarily derogative or dismissive.  Think of it as akin to the \\"primitive\\" in the arts in which we find a great artist at work who is innocent of some of the developments in technique such as perspective or depth perception.  Henri Rousseau can be seen as an example of such a deliberate artist.<br /><br />Or this book can be compared to an officially unacknowledged genre in the book business.  Call it \\"fictional nonfiction\\"; that is, a book is produced in which the author writes an account of a strange event or series of events that he or she swears actually happened.  In other words, a novel or story presented as nonfiction.  A famous example is Communion: A True Story (1987), originally published by William Morrow and then brought out in paperback by Avon Books.  Communion, which famously (or infamously, depending on your point of view) became a New York Times bestseller is a first-person account of an alien encounter written by novelist Whitley Strieber.  Hailed as \\"Convincing!\\" (and more) in many reviews, Communion was a compelling narrative allegedly transformed from the writer's personal journal.  It was only some years after the fact that Strieber confessed that the events were essentially fictional.<br /><br />Here in Raechel's Eyes we have not only an alien encounter of truly astonishing dimensions, but in Part II we have a series of  hypnotic regressions purporting to support the events in Part I.  Helen Littrell is hypnotically regressed by Dr. June Steiner, \\"a graduate of The Institute of Transpersonal Psychology and The American Institute of Hypnosis.\\"  There are some interviews with others, including Helen's husband and her daughter Marisa.  One thing is clear: there is not the slightest chance that Helen Littrell (no relation, by the way) will someday tell us she made this all up.  She is entirely sincere.<br /><br />Of course, I am sincere too, and have my doubts about the authenticity of her experience, or at least about her interpretation of her experience.  However, I have no interest in debunking the regression or questioning the veracity of Helen Littrell's memories.  Certainly her story is compelling and engaging.  I don't even want to question the authenticity of anything in this book.  What I want to do is point to the phenomenon itself: to the very human need to transform ourselves from the limited human creatures that we are to something beyond.  All the alien encounter stories that have flooded the market over the past five or six decades have but one thing driving them: that is, the expression of a desire to be more than human.<br /><br />I believe that many years from now, our successors will look back on this time--from the middle of the twentieth century onward--and recognize the phenomenon of books like Raechel's Eyes as harbingers of our transformation.  First there is the desire to be other than what we are, and then may come the reality.  In my view this transformation will not come from a hybrid mating with aliens as this book would have it (although it may), but more likely we will meld with the artifacts of our culture, through both bioengineering and the development of machine intelligence, so that we become cyborgs, beings both biological and artificial.<br /><br />Will Raechel's Eyes be picked up by, say, Avon Books and packaged toward bestsellerdom?  It might, but there are some problems.  First, I would say it needs to be cut by about half.  I get a lot of books by well-meaning and even talented amateurs that suffer from the author's mistaken idea that every incident, every piece of dialogue, every gesture and nuance of expression, no matter how trivia, must be presented in order (I guess) to insure some kind of veracity.  Raechel's Eyes is a splendid (if I may) example of the overwritten book.  Yet, it may be that the power of Raechel's Eyes (I love the spelling of her name) lies in the very superfluity of authors' expression.  Regardless, a good editor might cross out the excess verbiage and possibly transform the narrative into something that will capture the imagination of a substantial segment of the book-buying public.  Certainly authors Helen Littrell (mother of Marisa, the blind girl who becomes Raechel's roommate) and freelancer Jean Bilodeaux, whose writing skills are evident, have put together a most interesting story that will appeal to many readers.  The ending is striking and dramatically beautiful.<br /><br />Nonetheless, let me cite one of the problems.  While the authors admit that \\"Conversations are reconstructed\\" from Helen Littrell's memory, this admission is inadequate because not only has the dialogue been augmented to an astonishing degree, sometimes approaching clairvoyance, but even the inner thoughts of the characters are revealed.  One is left with the sense that this is an imaginative novel masquerading as \\"THE STRANGE BUT TRUE CASE OF A HUMAN-ALIEN HYBRID\\" (to quote from the blurb on the cover).<br /><br />One last point.  There is an interesting subplot involving Helen's relationship with her abusive, alcoholic husband, and her intense desire to free herself from him.  This desire is vividly expressed in these italicized thoughts from Helen on page 75: \\"Once we've parked, I'll ask him to get the beer...When he does this, I'll reach into my open purse and take out his police Smith and Wesson .357 Magnum, slip up behind him, put the barrel against his head and watch it explode.  There's no way I can miss at point-blank range.\\"<br /><br />It might be concluded that Helen was in part driven toward the alien experience by her need to free herself from the dominance of this man she wanted to kill.  Sometimes our minds find solace in escape, and that desire to escape sometimes wonderfully drives our imaginations.<br /><br />On the other hand, perhaps all of this is literally true.

194234:US	49786731	R3QOE5J23RUPDP	0520239229	587921950	Frozen Earth: The Once and Future Story of Ice Ages	Books	5	92	96	N	N	Fascinating account of ice ages and how they were discovered	This is an absolutely fascinating account of the various ice ages that have periodically taken over the earth.  From the ancient \\"Snowball Earth\\" (sometimes called \\"Slushball Earth,\\" 550 to 850 million years ago) in which the entire planet was more or less frozen from pole to pole, to the \\"Younger Dryas,\\" a cold spell beginning 12,800 years ago and lasting for about 1,200 years, to  \\"Little Ice Age\\" in Europe (700 to 150 years ago) to the \\"year without a summer,\\" in 1816, UCSD Professor of Earth Sciences Doug MacDougall chronicles the ebb and flow of glacial advance and retreat in a most interesting and informative manner.<br /><br />Much of this is a historical account of how scientists discovered the past ice ages through geology and the study of cores taken from the Antarctic, the Arctic, from the sea floor, and from still standing glacial ice packs.  MacDougall explains how these cores are read to reveal climate changes in the past based on evidence from isotopes, pollen, and bubbles of trapped atmospheric gases.  It is really amazing how much information can come from such minute bits of evidence.<br /><br />In the early chapters MacDougall recalls the first scientists who became aware of the earth's climate in previous ages--Louis Agassiz, James Croll, Milutin Milankovitch and others.  MacDougall recalls their efforts to get their ideas accepted by the geological establishment.  It is fascinating to see how gradually it was realized that great rocks had arrived at various places, having been carried there by ancient glaciers.  A particularly interesting story is how the Channeled Scablands of the Columbia Plateau in Washington were created when the glacial Lake Missoula sudden broke through the melting ice and drove an immense wall of water clear to the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />Part of his concentration is on the glacial and interglacial periods that have characterized the environment during the rise of the genus homo and especially the last 150,000 years or so during which homo sapiens have evolved.  Chapter Ten, \\"Ice Ages, Climate, and Evolution\\" is devoted to how the advance and retreat of the ice affected the evolution of hominids and other animals and plants.<br /><br />For those of us who might be worried about global warning it is perhaps refreshing to be warned that we are still living in an ice age.  MacDougall writes, \\"We are in a warm period, one of the many interglacial intervals that have occurred throughout the Pleistocene Ice Age [now three million years old].\\" (p. 233)<br /><br />Near the end of the book MacDougall looks at today's climate and takes into account the warming due to human activities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels.  But he is not alarmed.  He notes that the atmosphere on the planet Venus (surface temperature 485 degrees Centigrade, more than hot enough to melt lead) is almost all CO2 while that on earth is less than four-tenths of one percent CO2.  No runaway greenhouse effect seems likely here any time soon.  MacDougall explains the carbon dioxide cycle on earth and assures us that most CO2 is locked up in limestone. (p. 238)<br /><br />While he seems unconcerned about global warming (taking the very long view) he does remark that \\"It is difficult to comprehend how further additions [of CO2] to the atmosphere at current rates could fail to raise global temperatures and possibly influence the course of the [current] Pleistocene Ice Age.\\" (p. 241)  Still he ends the book with this (possibly understated) possibility: \\"...mankind may inadvertently bring the Pleistocene Ice Age to a premature close, ushering in another long period of ice-free existence for our planet.\\"<br /><br />Which brings me to the question, if the earth does become more or less permanently as hot and muggy as a Jurassic swamp, what will it mean for human beings?  There will be less land available since the melting of the glaciers would raise sea level some 60 meters, drowning New York and London, not to mentionmuch of Florida and a host of South Pacific islands, Bangladesh, and other low-lying lands.  Will we live most of our lives indoors in air-conditioned buildings?  Will the verdant plants and fantastic diversity of creatures characteristic of tropical jungles be all around us?  Will dragon flies be as big as birds?<br /><br />On the other hand, suppose, as MacDougall intimates, that the forces affecting the earth's climate dwarf our puny doings.  In that case the present interglacial will come to a close and the immediate future will be cold as the ice once again advances from the poles.  As MacDougall points out, the air will be dryer with all that water locked up in ice, and great parts of the planet will be desert and the winds will blow the sand around the globe (as happened before during such periods as evidenced by the core samplings).

In that case the present interglacial will come to a close and the immediate future will be cold as the ice once again advances from the poles.  As MacDougall points out, the air will be dryer with all that water locked up in ice, and great parts of the planet will be desert and the winds will blow the sand around the globe (as happened before during such periods as evidenced by the core samplings).

A more motley crew of miscreants and their enemies would be hard to imagine.<br /><br />Sickie number one would be Davis Wolfgang Hawke (aka \\"Bo Decker,\\" \\"Michael Girdley,\\" etc.) one-time founder and leader of his self-styled Neo-Nazi group, the Knights of Freedom.  He got started in Web hustling by selling knives and Nazi paraphernalia on Ebay.  When it was discovered that his birth name was Andrew Britt Greenbaum and that his father was Jewish, he quite naturally lost a lot of cache with his Neo-Nazi followers, and so he closed down his storm trooper Website and turned to spam.  He discovered that he had a natural talent for writing the sort of copy that sells sex pheromones, pyramid schemes, porn, and other spam \\"products,\\" and before he knew it he was hiding stashes of hundred-dollar bills all over his various digs and the nearby countryside.<br /><br />Sickie number two would be Brad Bournival, Hawke's geeky chess-playing protege who made a million dollars spamming penis enlargements pills and such.  Other sickies include big-timer Scott Richter of OptInRealBig who followed 9/11 and the anthrax attacks with flag and gas mask spamming, a kind of low-life huckster with a genius for turning public events into personal wealth.  Also mentionable is the really sad Thomas Cowles who hustled mass mailing software but got thrown in jail for criminal contempt of court after allegedly stealing some computer equipment from South Florida spam king Eddy Marin.<br /><br />The white hats include Susan \\"Shiksaa\\" Gunn, Piers \\"Mad Pierre\\" Forrest, Francis Uy, Pete Wellborn, Steve Linford and others, many of whom frequented the antispam Web newsgroup Nanae.  Compromised and perhaps characteristic of a third category of spam-world denizens would be Karen Hoffman, one-time spam fighter who crossed over to the dark side to work for spammers.<br /><br />What is really amazing is just how readable this book is.  McWilliams has the narrative talent of a novelist, and the investigative skills of a top drawer journalist.  I found this bizarre story of greed and human depravity in cyberspace as \\"unputdownable\\" as a best-selling true crime tale--which it is.

199757:US	49786731	R3EQB73FRNCW3O	1590593790	362924353	Black Hat: Misfits, Criminals, and Scammers in the Internet Age	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Readable intro for the neophyte	While reading this breezy introduction to the unlikely but inevitable cloak and dagger cyber world of hackers and spammers, encryption and \\"things that go ping in the night,\\" I had a terrible sense of estrangement mixed with fear and loathing simply because I knew and know jack diddly about hacking and how to protect myself against it.  So I suppose this book is a start, lesson one in Cyberspace judo.<br /><br />There are eight chapters, covering such topics as spam and spyware, worms and viruses, scams and counterattacks against the black hats.  In one chapter Biggs explores the \\"Dear Friend,\\" advanced-fee fraud, often referred to as the \\"Nigerian potentate scam,\\" or simply \\"419\\" since it is section #419 in the Nigerian Criminal Code.<br /><br />You might recognize this con as the outrageous come-on that promises you a nice percentage of some many millions of dollars if you will allow an abused princess (or such) of some African country to use YOUR bank account for a transfer of the millions.  (Right!)  Of course you'll be asked for a few thousand dollars up front...  Biggs writes that \\"in 2002 over 16,164 Americans, including 74 who reported losses totaling $1.6 million, reported being suckered by 419 scams.\\" (p. 72)  Biggs actually found one guy, a Dr. Shahla Ghasemi, who admitted to personally losing $400,000 to the scam. (p. 77)  But Biggs also shows how he and some others had a lot of fun by leading these would-be scammers along with encouraging emails and baited bits of information.<br /><br />Biggs also introduces us to some notorious hackers and spammers, \\"Ebola Monkey Man,\\" Marc Maiffret aka \\"Chameleon,\\" and Alan Murray Ralsky, \\"the spam king of Detroit,\\" for example.  There are some black and white photos of Web pages and persons, including one of Patrick Kroupa aka \\"Lord Digital\\" caught in dark light  in front of his lap top, looking for all the world like a cross between Darth Vader and a young Bobby Fischer.  (There is an element of glorification in this book that may be off-putting to some.)<br /><br />There is also something eternally juvenile about the nether world of Internet \\"hax0rs\\" and spammers, something gloriously amateurish about their pursuits and values.  Why hack?  To make a buck, to gain fame, to win the heart of the prom queen?  No.  Because it's fun and because it's there?  Yes, oh, yes.  Why spam?  Well, in the case of spam, if somehow the monetary reward could be removed, that is, if somehow people would NOT reply to spammers and their scams, then spam would gurgle to a trickle.<br /><br />In other words, the nefarious world of black hats and white hats, phreaks and crackers, acne-sprouting adolescents in trailer parks and spam king millionaires in Cancun is an all too human world doing what humans do best.  That is, trying to rip each other off while puffing out their chests.<br /><br />John Biggs draws a distinction between amateurs (e.g., \\"script kiddies\\" and \\"punks\\"), and the pros who go after Citibank and other places where the money is.  Script kiddies create nothing \\"but are just stupid enough to be dangerous\\" (p. 125) while the pros can, if they like, toss their black hats and don white ones and become hired guns who hack for the establishment.<br /><br />He also makes a distinction between \\"free as in freedom\\" and \\"free as in free beer\\"--a very nice distinction new to these ears.  There is freedom of expression, and there are free things worth having.  Be sure you know which is which.  I should also note that Biggs's mantra throughout is \\"open source, open source, open source.\\"  (As opposed, I imagine, to \\"Microsoft rox, dude!\\")<br /><br />Personally I think somebody like Gilbert and Sullivan ought to make a comic opera of the whole scene with dance numbers and catchy tunes.  The Net is in a sense a soap opera in which you can play a part.  All it needs is a musical score.<br /><br />Like many books that have their birth on or about the Internet, Black Hat is full of flashy terminologyand tortured syntax, missing words and choppy organization characteristic of quick and easy netstyle communications, featuring not fully professional editing.  Nonetheless this book is definitely worth reading if you are, like me, pretty much an amateur Cyberian.  A more engaging and professionally accomplished (but more narrowly focused) intro to this world is Spam Kings (2005) by Brian McWilliams, which I also recommend.lashy terminology and tortured syntax, missing words and choppy organization characteristic of quick and easy netstyle communications, featuring not fully professional editing.

201265:US	49786731	R1449L5IL1F9QA	0830832025	628381942	Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage	Books	2	18	43	N	N	Part of the problem	Meic Pearse is a traditionalist and a Christian.  He defines the \\"clash of civilizations\\" in terms that at their core relate to his belief in the moral and spiritual infallibility of the Bible.  Thus on pages 77-79 he defines human rights in terms of Biblical scripture, concluding that the sort of human right \\"that is claimed simply by virtue of one's existence\\" to be \\"not derived\\" from \\"Scripture\\" and therefore not something he is in agreement with.<br /><br />We can see that Pearse IS in agreement with the Muslim belief that laws come from God and not from human beings themselves.  So it is not surprising to read this: \\"Normal people (that is, the rest of the world)...cannot exist without real meaning, without religion anchored in something deeper than existentialism and bland niceness, without a culture rooted deep in the soil of the place where they live.\\" (p. 29)<br /><br />Nicely expressed, but I wonder, do these \\"normal people\\" that exist outside the West--would that include humanists and agnostics, Buddhists and Hindus, Taoists and Zen Buddhists, Jains and Vedantists--indeed mainstream Christians, Jews and Muslims--or is he just referring to the subset of people who follow the fundamentalist expression of the Middle Eastern religions?<br /><br />It is also not surprising that Pearse echoes the reaction of some fundamentalist clerics in the West. e.g., Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who declared after the World Trade center was hit by terrorists that essentially we had it coming.  This view is one that I find abhorrent because, while it does not exactly condone such murderous acts, it tries to shift the blame from the murderers themselves to aspects of the American culture that they--Pearse, Robertson, Falwell and others, along with the fundamentalist Muslims--find threatening to their world view.<br /><br />In truth, Pearse's is a rearguard action against not just Hollywood and commercial America (the usual whipping boys), but against the basic tenets of democratic society.  We can see this in his statement that \\"human rights are essentially an invention of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment\\" whereas, \\"Traditional systems of morality worked on the principle of obligation: act this way; don't do that; you must; you shouldn't.\\" (p. 64) Again he is in strong agreement with the traditionalist interpretations of the three Abrahamic religions.<br /><br />My problem with those who worship \\"the Bronze Age God of battles,\\" with those who find their authority in ancient texts and their behavioral guidance in tribalism, including intolerance of other points of view and the use of violence to resolve differences, is their utter irrelevance to, and ignorance of, the real issues the world faces today.  The fundamentalist interpreters of religion are Dark Age relics of a mentality that cannot possibly come to grips with the very real challenges of science, globalism and the postmodern world.  How a God that has a bad temper in whose image it is insisted that we were made, a God that apparently has a beard and an alimentary tract (what would he need that for?), a God that seems not to have any kind of grip on his world, but must resort to suicide bombings and tanks and guided missiles in order that His will be done--how can such a God of the tribe and superstition hope to cope with the 21st century?<br /><br />Pearse seems to think that people who do not accept this God and his authority are atheists (he uses the term again and again to describe those in disagreement with his views) who hold values \\"not as an alternative to traditional values but as a negation of them--as anti-values, in fact.\\" (p. 29)<br /><br />This then is the problem.  It is not so much that Pearse is in disagreement with Western culture.  It is much worse than that.  What he perceives as Western culture he calls \\"an anticulture.\\"  In other words, he and those who think like him have values and culture.  Those who disagree with his primitive view of religion,do not.  He sees only the culture of the mass media and the mass mind.  He doesn't seem to realize that people like David Hume and John Locke, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, existed, and he clearly turns his back on the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights in which men are declared to have inalienable rights.  In other words, Pearse would be a Christian fundamentalist Muslim--if such a creature existed, finding authority not in science or the Declaration of the Rights of Man, or in the cultural traditions coming out of the Enlightenment, but instead following only the authority of Scripture--which of course means following the authority of Scripture as interpreted by the clerics currently in power, as it had always been until the rise of the modern world.<br /><br />Finally I don't think \\"they\\" hate us so much as Pearse likes to imagine.  The anti-Americanism that we see expressed today is largely a result of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq and the unilateralism of his attitude.  After all, it could be said that they \\"hate\\" us in Europe too.  America still has an enormous amount of good will in the world, and we are looked upon by hundreds of millions of people as the best hope for humankind and admired for our democratic way of life and our system of government with its checks and balances and its respect for individual human rights--something that authoritarian people like Pearse do not fully appreciate.the mass mind.

The National Forum on People's Differences.\\"  Some of this is a little too delicate for an Amazon review, but let me give it a try.<br /><br />Do women (pass gas)?  Replies range from \\"Of course...\\" (dodo brain) to \\"men tend to pass a higher volume of gas than women--about 120 cc (cubic centimeters) per passage to just 90 cc for women\\" while \\"women have a higher concentration of the dreaded hydrogen sulfide in their outbursts, which makes their odor intensity greater.\\"  So now you know.  (But unmentioned is the inflammatory test beloved by adolescents with cigarette lighters...)<br /><br />\\"Why do Christian networks and shows feature people with really big hair and lots of makeup and gaudy, overdecorated sets?\\"  I always wondered that myself.  According to one guy (\\"MIKE, 42, Humanist gay male), the target audience seems to be \\"trailer park trash\\" from the Bible Belt \\"where big hair and tons of makeup seem to never go out of style.\\"  Professor Anson Shupe from Indiana University adds that the Trinity Broadcasting Network, etc. have \\"done their polls and market research, and they know what sells\\" and \\"The big hair and ornate sets have a certain appeal to these televangelists' biggest audience segment: lower-middle-class, middle-aged females.\\"<br /><br />One more: \\"Is it true that when women are together they talk in much more graphic, detailed and intimate terms about sex and their sexual partners than men do?\\"  Answer: it depend on who you ask, but according to Milano's expert, Aline Zoldbrod, \\"I think men like to imagine women having all these intimate discussions about their sexual relationships, but women are as private as men.\\"  Hmm.  Another truism of my youth blown to smithereens.<br /><br />The book is divided into nine chapters from \\"COLOR-BLIND: Race and Ethnicity\\" to \\"ON THE JOB: Work.\\"  Within the chapters are sections headed by a question, followed by some answers from people who responded on the website (e.g., \\"DEBBIE K., 29, married female\\"), concluded with what Milano calls a \\"Y?Check\\" in which he cites an authority or two on the subject at hand (or in hand, as the case may be).  Tacked on to the end of the chapters are some questions they are working on, with no answers yet.<br /><br />And, yes, SIZE does matter.  (But you knew that.)<br /><br />Bottom line: adult, levelheaded and informative, mostly PC, but not overly so with some chuckles and some surprises.lown to smithereens. <br /> <br />The book is divided into nine chapters from \\"COLOR-BLIND: Race and Ethnicity\\" to \\"ON THE JOB: Work.\\"  Within the chapters are sections headed by a question, followed by some answers from people who responded on the website (e.g., \\"DEBBIE K., 29, married female\\"), concluded with what Milano calls a \\"Y?Check\\" in which he cites an authority or two on the subject at hand (or in hand, as the case may be).

206136:US	49786731	R1MRBIBHEVQDE9	0465043550	915965329	The (Mis)behavior of Markets	Books	3	45	50	N	N	Not as valuable as might be expected	What celebrated mathematician (inventor of fractal geometry and the famous Mandelbrot Sets) Benoit Mandelbrot discovered when analyzing market behavior is that the markets tend to go to extremes.  Instead of deviating from an average in a well-mannered linear way (as one might see in a Gaussian bell-shaped distribution) prices tend to rocket up and down according to a power law.  In other words the variance in price movements is greater than economists realized, which means that the chance of ruin for any investor is significantly higher than was generally believed.<br /><br />Furthermore, Mandelbrot discovered that market price distributions have a fractal quality to them in the sense that a chart of price movements on an hourly basis looks pretty much the same as a chart of price movements on a daily or a monthly or even a yearly basis.  Additionally, the charts of commodity prices, for example, will look the same as those of currency exchanges or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Just as a coast line has a ragged edge when viewed from the perspective of someone looking at a map, and a very similar ragged edge when viewed from an airplane, as well as seen on foot, down to the smallest of crags and crannies, so too do stock market prices.<br /><br />This is an interesting discovery, but, as Mandelbrot warns in an abstract \\"to the scientific reader,\\" it is one that \\"will NOT bring personal wealth.\\" (My emphasis.)<br /><br />Well, what a disappointment.  But not a surprise.  What this knowledge does do, Mandelbrot hopes, is to better inform investors of the underrated risks of investment and the greater chance of financial ruin should the downside \\"fat tail\\" of the fractal curve come to pass.<br /><br />I have no doubt that Mandelbrot knows what he is talking about; however I wonder if the significance of his discovery is as important as he thinks it is.  Perhaps the academics underrated risk, and maybe the same is true of many investors, but I suspect the practical players knew and know the truth.  One doesn't have to look further back than October 19, 1987 to see a one-day drop in the stock market of truly gargantuan proportions, a drop so great that the probability of it actually happening was, as Mandelbrot observes, near the edge of the impossible.<br /><br />Yes, markets do go to extremes.  Bubbles develop and burst and individual stocks have market values totally out of line with their assets, revenue and profits.  One had only to live through the go-go high tech market of the 1990s to know that.  Mandelbrot claims that part of this inexplicably erratic behavior is due to the markets having a memory of sorts.  He calls it \\"dependence,\\" an hitherto underappreciated quality.  The standard model of market behavior insisted that today's price movement is an independent event.  At least that is Mandelbrot's assertion.  Personally, I think most experienced traders know that today's price is affected by price movements in the past if only because traders themselves have memories.  But more than that market prices seem influenced by the past because some of the same mechanisms, phenomena and conditions still prevail.<br /><br />For example, on pages 184-185 Mandelbrot recalls that in 1982 IBM hired then small Intel to make its microprocessors and a company headed by the unknown Bill Gates to provide its software.  He then observes \\"the fates of these three companies are still intertwined.\\"  He calls this \\"long dependence\\" and \\"a pillar of fractal geometry.\\"  However most investors would merely note that IBM, Intel, and Microsoft are in similar businesses whose stock prices rise and fall more or less together because of that.  If IBM had started up a pretzel factory in 1982 would their stock prices be correlated?  Mandelbrot seems to imply that they would; but I think it may be that he is so enamored of the magic of his fractals that he sees what he wants to see.<br /><br />But maybe he is right.  Maybe there is some ghost of influence in the past that would to some extent intertwine the market movements of the pretzel company started by IBM with that of IBM itself.  If so, I would like to know the mechanism at work.  Mandelbrot allows that he doesn't know what that might be.  Again I think it is in the memory of the traders.  Mandelbrot acknowledges as much on pages 185-186 when he mentions the old traders who had experienced the crash of 1929 and were therefore more cautious than they might have been without such a memory.<br /><br />And this is really the bottom line about market behavior: the extremes to which markets go is largely the direct result of the extremes to which the minds (and hearts and souls) of the traders go.  Human emotion is why some high tech stocks had greater market caps than Dow Jones blue chip companies even though the upstarts had no earnings.  Human emotion is why tulip bulbs were once worth more than gold.  And human emotion is why markets crash so suddenly, seemingly without rhyme or reason.  And human emotion is why the distribution curves of market prices have fat tails, Mandelbrot's fractal discoveries notwithstanding.<br /><br />Bottom line: interesting and well written (co-author and professional journalist Richard L. Hudson had a lot to do with that, I suspect) but of dubious utility for the practical investor.me ghost of influence in the past that would to some extent intertwine the market movements of the pretzel company started by IBM with that of IBM itself.

Hogan, science fiction writer, and now the author of a book that in six densely argued chapters presumes to (1) supplant biological evolution with so-called Intelligent Design; (2) refute Big Bang cosmology; (3) unconfirm Einstein's relativity; (4) argue that Emmanuel Velikovsky (his childhood hero) is more likely right than the scientific and history establishments that labeled him a crackpot; (5) dispute the orthodox on global warming, ozone depletion, and the dangers of DDT while championing the use of nuclear power and the right type of asbestos; and (6) question the medical opinion that AIDS is caused by HIV.<br /><br />Wow.  Could he be right?  I mean, could he be right in every case?  In a couple?  In one?  If so, James P. Hogan is going to have one of the most glorious \\"I told you so\\" experiences ever.<br /><br />I read most of this book.  I admit to skipping through the chapters on cosmology and relativity since I have no way of judging whether Hogan knows what he is talking about or not.  I am disposed to believe that the so-called AIDS industry, like the cancer industry, with which I am familiar, could be putting the money before the science and quite possibly have the syndrome wrong.  Possibly.  As for global warming, ozone depletion, DDT, nuclear power, and asbestos, I will only say I have read many arguments both pro and con, and while I believe Hogan is not on the side of the angels, I will admit that his side does have some valid points.  Certainly the use of nuclear power to generate electricity is a lot safer than the average person thinks and, regardless, with the rise in the price of oil, we will be building more nuclear plants, like it or not.<br /><br />What I really want to get to is the chapter on biological evolution since I believe that here at least Hogan's misapprehensions are fairly obvious.  He begins well enough, making a clear distinction between induction and deduction while championing the cause of evidence over theory.  But as I turned the pages I began to see some misunderstandings creep in.  For example on page 39 Hogan writes (arguing against Darwinian speciation) that \\"a single occurrence [of a mutation] is...likely to be swamped by the gene pool of the general population and disappear.\\"  This is true and argues against the rise of new species by mutation within large populations.  However, speciation typically occurs in small isolated populations.<br /><br />Next there's Hogan's argument that the fossil record does not support speciation by natural selection since the \\"intermediate\\" forms are just not there.  Leaving this interpretation of the fossil record to the side--he thinks the forms are not there; the paleontologists think they are--let's look instead at his claim that the fossil record is sufficiently complete to testify against our missing anything important.  He writes \\"formations containing hundreds of billions of fossils\\" have been uncovered.  He adds,  \\"The world's museums are filled with over 100 million fossils...\\" (p. 24)  Sounds like a lot, doesn't it?  However, going back 500-600 million years when multicellular organisms first began to appear we can see that 100 million fossils would account for one fossil every five or six years over the entire planet.  Clearly that is only the barest fraction of a fraction of the number of creatures that lived.<br /><br />And then there is this on page 47: \\"Either these programs [\\"genetic\\" programs] which defy human comprehension in their effectiveness and complexity wrote themselves accidentally out of mindless matter acting randomly; or something wrote them for a reason.\\"  Putting aside the anthropomorphic idea of \\"for a reason\\" and also to the side Hogan's opinion that \\"their effectiveness and complexity\\" \\"defy human comprehension\\" there is the totally wrong idea that the genetic code or the organisms themselves are the result of \\"matter acting randomly.\\"  It is precisely the point of Darwinian evolution that random forces are not the effectors of change but instead change comes about through the mechanism of natural selection, which is decidedly NOT random.<br /><br />Also Hogan writes that once \\"the improbabilities of a situation become too vast...and the specifications too tight...chance is eliminated as a plausible cause, and design is indicated.\\" (p. 55)  Yes, chance is definitely eliminated as \\"plausible\\" when the numbers get really big, but design is not necessarily indicated at all.  Indeed, \\"design\\" is a purely anthropomorphic idea based on what humans do.  We design things.  Nature does not.  The use of the term reveals a top down sort of thinking, reminding me of Soviet style economies.  Organisms grow and evolve without need of anyone moving the pieces around.  Many scientists today believe that matter is self-organizing, and that biological creatures are examples of this organizational property at work.<br /><br />Throughout Hogan argues that changes in form or adaptation do not signal species change.  He cites the well-known example of moths turning from white to black under the environmental pressure of the sooty industrial revolution in England, and avers that the moths had that ability all the time and were not on the verge of becoming another species.  He emphasizes this point by claiming that nobody has ever witnessed one species turning into another.  Well, nobody has ever seen grass grow either.  We humans are not capable of that sort of thing.  What we can do is notice after some passage of time that the grass has indeed grown, and that at one time there were only small mammals running around the nests of dinosaurs, and now there are elephants and people and blue whales.  Speciation happened whether anybody saw it or not, and no designer is required.<br /><br />It is obvious that Hogan has spent a lot of time and energy reading about science.

219850:US	49786731	RZVPVX7SI4X32	0814731619	597658074	The Real Price of War: How You Pay for the War on Terror	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The economic costs in detail and personalized	Joshua Goldstein is a political scientist with a special interest in war and international relationships.  In this modest volume he itemizes the economic costs of war in general and historically and shows specifically how much the average household in America is paying for the war on terror.  (That would be $500 a month according to a \\"bill\\" he presents to \\"The Smith Household\\" on page 16.)<br /><br />His position is nonpartisan and his tone is measured, factual and amazingly calm.  It's apparent that he didn't think the war in Iraq was necessary, and it is clear that he thinks the Bush tax cuts put too much of the financial burden for the war on terror onto the shoulders of Americans of modest means.  He shows that historically the rich have paid a larger portion of the cost of war than they are paying for the current war.  This would only seem right since they have more to lose financially speaking.  He also thinks we ought to pay for the war as the expenses arise and not put off the cost by borrowing or through deficient spending as the Bush administration has done.  That way just increases the total cost of the war because we have to pay interest on the money borrowed.<br /><br />Regardless of how the war is financed Goldstein shows that there will be an additional cost in terms of inflation.  He sees inflation as one of the \\"hidden\\" costs of war, and relates a \\"History of War-Induced Inflation\\" on pages 76-81, and then asks, \\"Will the War on Terror Trigger Inflation?\\"  His answer is most likely.  However, it will not be as bad as the inflation that began during and following the Civil War, World Wars I & II, and the Vietnam War, mainly because the cost of the war on terror is nowhere near as great in terms of total GDP.  As an example of the kind of inflation we have experienced in the past, Goldstein points out that the dollar was worth $18.19 in today's terms in 1915 before WW I began and worth only $9.18 in 1920, two years after the war was over. ( p. 79)<br /><br />Goldstein believes \\"Americans are in denial about the substantial war costs we face.\\" (p. 161)  He would like to see us get over the denial and to urge our government to spend more money on the war on terror so that it might be won more quickly and in the long run cost us less.  To this end he recommends increasing expenditures so that the average household would pay another $100 a month so that the \\"bill\\" would be $600 a month. (p. 196)  Goldstein believes there is no such thing as \\"a war without sacrifice\\" and wants the Bush administration to be more open about that fact and to become more Churchhillian (if you will) in asking the America people to make the necessary sacrifices.  Obviously, by detailing the costs of the war on terror and making that cost personal with his \\"bill\\" to the average American household, Goldstein is attempting to do this himself.  I think it's a good idea; however, if the average American household had to write a check for $600 a month to the government rather than having that money just disappear from their living standard (either today or down the road) I think Mr. and Mrs. Average American would balk.  One wonders if that is not Goldstein's veiled point, although his expression would deny that.<br /><br />Of course the real \\"real\\" cost of war goes much deeper than the economic.  The lives lost, the injured and maimed, the waste of human effort and the displacement of energies from something productive and life-affirming are most significant.  Goldstein is not to be faulted for leaving these out since such matters are not part of his thesis, and that is fine since every book should have an end as well as a beginning.  However, I cannot read about the subject of war without thinking about its \\"real\\" significance in human affairs beyond not only the economic and the personal costs, but the species-wide costs as well.  And I would ask not just \\"what price war?\\" but what can we do about it?  As an instrument of the tribal structure, has war insured that those tribes that committed themselves to its unrestricted use are the ones that have survived (and are \\"us\\") or is it the case that those tribes that survived are guaranteed to eventually go the way of the swordsman?tribes that committed themselves to its unrestricted use are the ones that have survived (and are \\"us\\") or is it the case that those tribes that survived are guaranteed to eventually go the way of the swordsman?	2005-06-01

Rose is a brain scientist whose speciality is in the neuroscience of memory.<br /><br />He is also a prolific writer on evolutionary biology.  He is a proactive opponent of a strictly reductionist stance in biology and a stern critic of what he sees as a genocentric approach to psychology and what it means to be human.  Some of his books (most notably Not in Our Genes  (1984) written with Richard Lewontin and Leo Kamini, and Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology (2000) which he edited with Hilary Rose) are more about the politics of evolutionary biology than about the science; but here Rose keeps his political views mostly in the background.  The result is an informative book that helps us to understand what science is learning about how the brain works and about how it can be affected by outside agents.<br /><br />After an introductory chapter he begins with the nitty-gritty of how the brain came to be and how it might be understood--from proto-cells in the pre-biotic soup to axons, dendrites, synapses and brain \\"structures.\\"  His theme throughout is that the brain cannot be understood except as a process continually in motion.  He argues that how our brains developed cannot be appreciated through an isolated study of the genetic blueprint.  Instead we must look to the brain's developmental history in interaction with the environment to determine what it is and how it works and why.<br /><br />The middle chapters move from the brain to the mind, from the nuts and bolts of neurology to the experiential human being living in an environment in part created by itself.  Rose touches on the \\"mystery\\" of consciousness and the paradox of free will.  He finishes with some conjectures about what kinds of pharmaceutical agents are to come, what kinds of invasive procedures might be employed in attempts to combat various diseases or to cope with the effects of ageing or to help make us \\"better than normal.\\"  The final chapter is on \\"Ethics in a Neurocentric World.\\"<br /><br />Although Rose does not spell out how the mind differs from the brain--I take it he presumes a dictionary definition--much of the book is concerned with the distinction.  The brain is the flesh and blood; the mind is the experience, is how I read him.  I want to add that the distinction between brain and mind can be seen as similar to the distinction between sex and gender.  Sex is biology.  Gender is the cultural expression of that biology.<br /><br />He objects to viewing the brain as composed of \\"modules\\" directed by genetic imperatives.  He writes that \\"...life is not a static 'thing' but a process\\" (p. 62)  We are forever changing.  The Steven Rose of 30 is not the same as the Steven Rose of today.  He is a different person because of what has happened to him during the ensuing decades, and how he has reacted to what has happened, and what he has learned.  And if Steven Rose were somehow cloned, that Steven Rose would be different still because of the different environments--pre-natal and afterward--in which he would grow.<br /><br />He speaks of \\"patterns of activity\\" in the working brain.  He doesn't like the use of \\"modules\\" such as a supposed \\"reading module\\" or \\"reading instinct.\\" (p. 134)  However it is really impossible to write about something as foreign to our everyday experience as the workings of the brain without resorting to metaphor and analogy.  Something is like something else.  Something is compared to something else.  This is how we learn.  So instead of modules, Rose employs variously, \\"a collection of mini-organs\\" (p. 149); \\"brain regions\\" (p. 157); \\"brain...structures\\" (p. 133), etc.  In fact he uses the term \\"modules\\" himself on, for example, pages 149, 156, 158.  Furthermore his railing against the use of our experience in the \\"Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation\\" during the Pleistocene by evolutionary psychologists is partially contradicted by his acknowledgment that we are indeed shaped by our environment as we in turn shape it.  It is clear to me that where Rose and the evolutionary psychologists differ is in their perception of how much the environments since the Pleistocene have changed us.  Steven Pinker, Edward O. Wilson and others think \\"not all that much,\\" while Rose thinks \\"a whole lot.\\"  The truth, one can imagine, lies somewhere in between.<br /><br />It should be noted that one of the unsolved problems in evolution is knowing how fast evolutionary change can take place.  Stephen Jay Gould spoke of rapid change after long periods of stasis while others have disagreed; but no one can say how much we have changed biologically since the Pleistocene.  It is known that large populations are strongly resistant to evolutionary change because mutations quickly get swamped in the huge genetic pool.  My feeling is that in populations as large as ours, little evolutionary change is taking place.  The environment is constantly changing, but the selective pressure usually brought about through starvation, disease, and competition from other species is really not much in evidence.  And so I tend to side with those who believe we haven't changed all that much.<br /><br />Steven Rose is a wise and caring man who sometimes forgets his manners when speaking about those with whom he has sharp disagreements.  But in this book he is at his best and most well-behaved.  Let me finish with perhaps the wisest of his observations.  He is speaking of the increased \\"powers of surveillance and coercion available to an authoritarian state.\\"  He warns, \\"The neurotechnologies [now available and to come] will add to these powers, but the real issue is probably not so much how to curb the technologies, but how to control the state.\\" (p. 302)use of our experience in the \\"Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation\\" during the Pleistocene by evolutionary psychologists is partially contradicted by his acknowledgment that we are indeed shaped by our environment as we in turn shape it.

Bush based on psychoanalytic theory is itself highly suspect.  Yes, there are still many psychiatrists who believe in the Freudian or quasi-Freudian construct.  Justin Frank is one of them, although, as he acknowledges throughout the book, he is especially devoted to the theories of child psychoanalyst Melanie Klein who wrote among other works, The Psychoanalysis of Children (1932).  And yes there are still institutes devoted to psychoanalysis.  But with the growth of neurological science and cognitive and evolutionary psychology, the number of institutes and practitioners is decreasing as the \\"science\\" of psychoanalysis and its clinical efficacy are found wanting.  It will not be long before psychoanalytical theory will be nothing more than an embarrassing relic from the past, like blood-letting and frontal lobotomies.  Among the younger clinicians and theorists, that time has already arrived.  If you talk to people in academia they will tell you that psychoanalytic theory is treated more or less as literature, not anything resembling science.<br /><br />Still there is merit in taking a detailed and thorough look at the president's past, as Frank has done here.  He has used news reports, memoirs by friends and members of the Bush family (he had especial fun with Barbara Bush's memoir), Internet sites, and TV and radio interviews to put together a portrait of the president that is highly unflattering to say the least.  The problem is that George W.'s behavior doesn't have to be filtered through any psychobabble to be recognized as troubling--again to say the least.  The many lies that he habitually tells, the disregard he shows for human life, the acute ignorance he displays about environmental concerns, his elitist mind set, his inability to admit mistakes, and his sense that God is speaking personally to him are all reasons for us to be concerned.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you can read this book strictly for the information while putting Frank's theories about Oedipal complexes and the like to the side, it is fascinating.  One doesn't have to bring Oedipus Rex into the mix to realize that George W. was dead set on outdoing George H. W., nor does one have to resort to an ego/id/superego construction to note that George W. is not aware of some of his subconscious motivations.  When he landed that jet on the aircraft carrier while announcing \\"Mission accomplished\\" no one watching on television needed any special training in human psychology to understand that in some respects this was a child acting out a fantasy and that he was emotionally quite distant from the actual death and destruction that his actions had caused.<br /><br />Curiously as I was reading I found myself more in sympathy with George W. Bush, the person, than I had ever been.  He had a lot of expectation placed upon his shoulders.  Not as bright as his father, nor even as bright as an average Yale undergraduate, he was nonetheless expected to attend Yale and do well.  He then went onto Harvard Business School where of course he was not a star.  He couldn't compete academically, and so pathetically he continued his childish habit of making fun of others, pinning offensive nicknames on them and bully them with his sense of entitlement and privilege.  How sad.<br /><br />And while Frank was pinning the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder label on George W., I began to think, hmm, that certainly wasn't much of deficit considering that George W. overcame it to the extent of becoming President of the United States.  And as far as his so-called dyslexia goes, that too is not only not a detriment, but a plus since it endears him to millions of people who are not exactly eloquent themselves.  And as for his drinking, I couldn't disagree with Frank's position more.  He tries to make a distinction between those who have stopped drinking and \\"are in recovery\\" and those who \\"are abstaining on their own\\" withthe implication that the latter are not really free of the effects of alcoholism.  Indeed, reading Frank one gets the sense that alcoholism is some kind of mental illness different from the chemical imbalance that modern science recognizes.  My understanding is that alcoholism is a disease of brain chemistry that is cured by not drinking, period.  Alcoholics cannot drink because the effects of the alcohol on their brain chemistry leads to increasing dependence on increasing consumption leading to disability and disease that comes from habitual over consumption.  George W. Bush is to be commended for not drinking, and should not be burdened with any condemnation because he didn't do it through AA.<br /><br />Obviously I don't think that George W. Bush is a good president and in fact I agree with those, like Dr. Frank, who believe he is dangerous and a threat to our way of life.  However I don't think Frank's diagnosis of Bush as a megalomaniac (see p. 200 and following) adds anything to our understanding.<br /><br />For those interested in finding out more about what makes George W. tick, I want to recommend three of the books that Frank relied upon in putting this treatise together since I believe they present a less cluttered and sharper portrait of the president.  They are: The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)Leads America (2004) by Eric Alterman and Mark Green; The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception (2003) by David Corn; and The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder (2001) by Mark Crispin Miller.<br /><br />Bottom line: a fun exercise in Bush-bashing, entertaining and (mostly) readable, but to be taken with a grain or two of salt.wn\\" with the implication that the latter are not really free of the effects of alcoholism.

Like bacteria in a petri dish of nutrients, people multiply until they have overrun and despoiled their resources, and then the population crashes.  Historian and novelist Ronald Wright (not to be confused with Robert Wright, author of e.g., The Moral Animal) explores in some fascinating detail examples as ancient as Sumer and as recent as Easter Island and the Americas.<br /><br />The main resource is arable land which soon or late becomes exhausted.  We exhaust the soil with continual planting, or we irrigate the soil until the salt content becomes so high that crops will not grow on it, and then we abandon it to the winds and move on.  Or we pave it over with roads and buildings.  There are exceptions of course, China and Egypt have maintained continuous civilizations for several millennia, but Wright argues they were able to do this because in the case of Egypt, the Nile continually revitalized the soil and prevented the Egyptians from building on it because of the yearly floods.  In the case of China he argues that it was a fortuitous circumstance that allowed the Chinese to grow crop after crop on the same land for century after century because the land had topsoil hundreds of meters thick, blown there by ancient winds.  Exhaust one layer, let it blow away.  No problem, the next layer is fertile.  Not so almost anyplace else in the world.<br /><br />Wright begins before agriculture, which would be before civilization of course.  The hunters and gathers of the Upper Paleolithic period, Wright avers, killed off their way of life in \\"an all-you-can-kill wildlife barbecue.\\"  He explains, \\"The perfection of hunting spelled the end of hunting as a way of life.  Easy meat meant more babies.  More babies meant more hunters.  More hunters, sooner or later, meant less game.\\" (p. 39)  The mastodons, the giant bison, the giant sloth, the great herds of horses...they constituted the nutrients of the petri dish, and the hunters the bacteria.<br /><br />We are aware that this happened in North America.  We have found the bones.  And it happened in Russia where great dwellings were constructed from the tusks and bones of the woolly mammoth, hunted to extinction.  But Wright points out that this happened in western Europe as well.  The cave paintings of the Cro-Magnons \\"falter and stop.  Sculptures and carvings become rare.  The flint blades grow smaller, and smaller.  Instead of killing mammoth they are shooting rabbits.\\"  He adds that the hunters at the end of the Old Stone Age \\"broke rule one for any prudent parasite: Don't kill off your host.  As they drove species after species to extinction, they walked into the first progress trap.\\" (pp. 39-40)<br /><br />Progress as a trap--that is also Wright's thesis.  With the discovery of agriculture and the rise of civilizations, were people better off?  Wright answers in the negative, calling agriculture and civilization \\"a series of seductive steps down a path leading, for most people, to lives of monotony and toil.\\" (p. 47)  Elsewhere Wright points out that the bodies of people living in the first agricultural societies were stunted and there was more evidence of malnutrition compared to the bodies of the hunters and gathers.  (Too much reliance on a monoculture starchy diet can do that.)  They were also smaller in stature, and according to some recent ideas, not as smart.  We are domesticated animals.  We have domesticated ourselves. (Or, our staple crops have domesticated us.)  Domesticated animals are not as smart as wild ones.  So it is said.<br /><br />Wright goes on to cite the experience of the Maya whose civilization collapsed as did that of Sumer and for much the same reasons.  He writes, \\"As the crisis gathered [the crop failures], the response of the rulers was not to seek a new course...  No, they dug in their heels and carried on doing what they had always done, only more so.  Their solution was higher pyramids, more power to the kings, harder work for the masses, more foreign wars.  In modern terms, the Maya elite became extremists, or ultra-conservatives, squeezing the last drops of profit from nature and humanity.\\" (p. 102)  Compare this to the infamous story of Easter Island.  Almost exactly the same thing happened.<br /><br />Wright applies this scenario to the modern world.  He calls the invention of agriculture \\"a runaway train, leading to vastly expanded populations but seldom solving the food problem because of two inevitable (or nearly inevitable) consequences.  The first is biological: the population grows until it hits the bounds of the food supply. [Which is what is happening today.]  The second is social: all civilizations become hierarchical; the upward concentration of wealth ensures that there can never be enough to go around.\\"  He adds that the Chinese have an illustrative saying, \\"A peasant must stand a long time on the hillside with his mouth open before a roast duck flies in.\\" (p. 108)<br /><br />Referring to the United States, Wright calls our prosperity (the greatest in human history, by the way), a \\"two-century bubble of freedom and affluence.\\"  We tend to think of it as normal and even inevitable, but he calls it \\"an anomaly: the opposite of what usually happens as civilizations grow.  Our age was bankrolled by the seizing of half a planet, extended by taking over most of the remaining half, and has been sustained by spending down new forms of natural capital, especially fossil fuels.\\" (p. 117)<br /><br />Wright's is an eloquent and persuasive argument.

He's playing out the string at the Shady Side Retirement Home, a low-rent district type of establishment where the food is bland and to be mushed, and the resident rooms are small with shared bathrooms at the end of the hall, where TV re-runs in the dayroom make up the intellectual sustenance of life, and where everybody is more or less just waiting around to die.  He is the narrator.<br /><br />Enter Vicenzo Calabrese who was once a millionaire, but because he turned over his accounts to his (not so loving) children has become something of a pauper himself, dumped by son and daughter into Shady Side.  So instead of living out his life in relative luxury at, say, Leisure World, Vicenzo has joined the destitute.  He is the hero.<br /><br />Mix in a sadistic, 300-pound orderly from hell, Don Blass, the kind of guy who likes to beat up on old people and toss cats out of windows to smash on the concrete, the kind of guy who delights in inflicting grievous harm on the small, the weak and the helpless, the sort of sickie who steals panties from 90-year-old women.  (I don't even want to think about what he does with them.)  This would be the villain.<br /><br />Add a lazy, fat and corrupt retirement home manager, Shelly, with dictatorial powers.  Throw in some poker-playing, TV-watching residents with varying degrees of senility and general decrepitude, and the cast of characters is complete.<br /><br />Okay, not exactly the sort of novel Hollywood usually takes options on, and certainly not the sort that garners six-figure advances.  In fact, reading this was a ironic experience for me personally since some years ago I wrote a short story about a mediocre writer who had taken up ghost-writing and offering literary services to pay the rent.  One of the manuscripts he edited was from a retired WAC veteran entitled \\"Quiet Days at the Retirement Home.\\"  I meant it as a joke.  Well, Garrick is not joking, and he didn't just dash this off as some kind of \\"Grumpy (or Grumpier) Old Men\\" comedy.  What Garrick is about is trying to show that old people, especially those without resources, who are typically shoved off to the side in our youth-dominated culture, are still human and capable of living meaningful lives and even capable of heroism.<br /><br />But for most of them (and \\"they\\" will be \\"us\\" someday--or \\"consider the alternative,\\" as the saying goes), life is tough and when something bad happens it hurts a lot, and--as Garrick's narrator puts it, \\"Old people don't bounce back.  They sink.  Whether it's a broken hip or a broken heart, old people are generally down for the slow, painful count, not to be saved by any bell, no matter who is supposed to be ringing it.\\" (p. 185)<br /><br />So this is a story about a couple of guys who didn't sink.  It's especially about one guy, the aforementioned Vicenzo who rises above the wretched circumstances of the body's decline and has the strength and courage for one last hurrah.  But most centrally this is a story about the narrator himself, a guy who isn't exactly Mark Twain or even an old Huckleberry Finn.  He's pretty much an ordinary joe who in his way counterpunches against the fates and stays out of the limelight.  He's a guy whose wife cheated on him and left him, a guy whose only son died in the first Gulf War, a guy who has outlived all his friends and has no family.  Sad.  The kind of guy about which can be said (and in fact Keith himself says it): \\"I know for a fact that no one ever said a bedtime prayer that included ...and God bless good ol' Keith Blanchett.\\"<br /><br />Well, I think one Max Garrick Jr. is, through this novel, blessing both Vicenzo and \\"good ol' Keith Blanchett.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line: a little slow in development, a little overwritten in parts, a bit amateurish, but ultimately redeeming, the sort of story that makes you hate thevillains and root for the good guys to carry the day.kes you hate the villains and root for the good guys to carry the day.	2005-05-18

If you are involved in a child custody dispute, the first thing you should do is get a copy of  Hardwick's SourceBook, and then read the letters in this book.  You will be amazed at the information the SourceBook contains.  It is one of those \\"invaluable\\" sources that really is invaluable.<br /><br />\\"Dear Judge\\" is an entirely different sort of book but one with a similar intent, that of seeing custody disputes from the child's point of view.  Hardwick has compiled a selection of their actual letters to judges (whom they--usually!--hold in the highest regard) and published the letters in this little book.  She has excluded those that are too heart-wrenching, or as she phrases it, are \\"too dispiriting to print.\\"  What the letters have in common is the innocent and (nearly!) guileless efforts of the children to have their voices heard.  Unfortunately, while most of these letters were actually read by judges, the judges were often unable to consider the requests of the children because, as Hardwick puts it, \\"Any communication arriving on a judge's desk that has not followed the proper procedure, cannot be considered by the judge.\\"<br /><br />What struck me most poignantly about what the children wrote is the fact that for the most part they don't blame either parent, nor do they take sides in the dispute, but instead concentrate on telling the judge what is wrong with the custody arrangements that were agreed to and offer ways to fix the situation.  In some cases the children just express how unhappy they are because of the divorce and how much they love both their parents and how much they wish there was some way to get the parents to stop fighting and hating each other.<br /><br />That is the essence of what these kids are expressing.  While the parents are emotionally bent on WINNING at all costs and sometimes filled with hatred toward the other, the children are caught in the middle because the parents often forget what is best for the child.  The bottom line in all custody disputes (as Hardwick emphasizes in her SourceBook) is the welfare of the children.  What this little book does is remind us of that fact.  Here's a little letter that says it all:<br /><br />\\"Dear Judge,<br /><br />I don't think what is going on for me is the same as what is going on for my parents.<br /><br />I don't know who is right.  I don't care who is right.<br /><br />Clare C.\\"<br /><br />Another child writes,<br /><br />\\"Dear Judge,<br /><br />I think my mom and dad are fighting because of me.  Could you put me in a new family so my mom and dad can be happy again.<br /><br />Sandy S.\\"<br /><br />Another:<br /><br />\\"Dear Judge,<br /><br />Please tell my Dad to come home.  My mommie cries all the time and it scares me.  I don't know if we are going to be alright if he doesnt come home soon.<br /><br />Tell him I love him and will be a very good girl.<br /><br />Emily L.\\"<br /><br />Or simply,<br /><br />\\"Dear Judge,<br /><br />Please don't forget me.<br /><br />Emily S.\\"<br /><br />In an inadvertent way that is enormously eloquent, the following letter reveals the psychological damage that a hateful divorce can visit upon a child:<br /><br />\\"Dear Judge,<br /><br />Please don't not make me choose.<br /><br />William\\"<br /><br />I think a lot of good might be done if every parent currently caught up in an acrimonious custody dispute would simply take a few minutes to read through these letters.

248522:US	49786731	RSLC0P927UZVG	0805077081	78592508	Science Friction: Where the Known Meets the Unknown	Books	5	38	45	N	N	Clever title; terrific book	This may be a bit esoteric for the general reader, but for those with more than a passing interest in science and its struggles with both the true believers from without and the heretics from within, this is a first class read.  Skeptic magazine publisher Michael Shermer addresses the friction within science in 14 well polished essays ranging in subject matter from playing psychic for a day to what to call rational skeptics to an in-depth look at the work of the late Stephan Jay Gould.  Ten of the essays previously appeared in Skeptic or other magazines or journals.<br /><br />Shermer's style reminds me somewhat of Gould himself since both men write readable prose that sometimes tends toward the ornate, replete with allusions and asides as well as a tendency toward a fine examination of relevant minutia.  I was in particular somewhat surprised and amused at Shermer's lengthy, but fascinating treatment of the controversy over skeptics calling themselves \\"Brights\\" (Chapter 2, \\"The Big 'Bright' Brouhaha\\").  It seems that while fussing over whether the cause of rational skepticism is being held back by the lack of an agreeable label to pin on practitioners, somebody came up with the tag \\"Brights.\\"  Oh boy.  Shermer and others embraced the term enthusiastically.  However, one doesn't need a PhD in human psychology to realize that some people (\\"dims\\"?) might find the label arrogant and delusive.  Turns out that most rational skeptics themselves rejected the term, and I presume it is now as dead as the dodo--however not before Shermer and others gave it more than the good old college try.  It would appear that as objective as one can be about the self-serving delusions of others, when it comes to ourselves, we sometimes can't find a mirror anywhere in the house.<br /><br />My suggestion is to live with the term \\"skeptic\\" or \\"rationalist\\" and realize that as such we will forever remain a minority within the human community--although I did kind of like the suggested term \\"eclectic\\" and think it appropriate and agreeable to wear although its meaning is not precisely descriptive of what a rational skeptic is or should be.<br /><br />One idea that appears in depth in this book is what Shermer, whose doctorate is in the history of science, sometimes calls \\"contingent-necessity.\\"  One recalls that Gould often spoke of contingence in evolution and famously remarked that if the earth's history were played out again, chances are we wouldn't be here.  Certainly the mass extinction that killed off the dinosaurs is an example of the kind of contingency he had in mind.  But Shermer takes the reader further and explains that \\"History is a product of contingencies (what might have been) and necessities (what had to be).\\" (p. 155)  He gives a number of examples to explain what he means.  The QWERTY typewriter keyboard arrangement can be seen as an example of a contingency that we got stuck with (pp. 138-140), while the keyboard itself was more or less a necessity.<br /><br />Shermer goes on to explore the phenomenon of \\"self-organized criticality\\" (from chaos theory).  I found it especially interesting that he identified various mass hysterias as chaotic phenomena with their own self-organizing and feedback mechanisms.  On pages 142-147 he recalls the witchcraft hysteria in Europe and the colonies from 1560-1620 and then demonstrates a striking parallel with the Satanic cult/false memory mass delusions from the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.  One is reminded of flying saucer sighting and alien abduction phenomena that followed similar patterns, and in fact Shermer mentions these as well.<br /><br />One the best chapters in the book is \\"The New New Creationism: Intelligent Design Theory and Its Discontents\\" in which Shermer demolishes the new new argument from design and reveals the intellectual vacuousness of intelligent design in a most delightful manner.  This chapter alone with worth the price of the book.  Quite simply, Shermer exposes the naked True Believer once again hiding behind a curtain of pseudoscience.<br /><br />Now it could be said that Shermer is something of a true believer himself--a true believer in science.  In thinking about this recursive irony I am reminded of the admonition towards moderation in all things including moderation.  (Properly speaking this is a paradox, a paradox of self-reference, as pointed out long ago by Bertrand Russell.)<br /><br />But can science be taken in moderation?  Is it possible to say that, well, we need to be scientific about most things, but then there are (shall we say) \\"affairs of the heart\\" to which science has properly speaking nothing to say--or indeed, should it not be the case that science and religion must forever be on separate planes?  Personally, like Shermer, I am a rational skeptic and believe that science is a tool that can be applied to all of our affairs, in business and politics, history and religion, and even in choosing a mate, while recognizing that, left to our own devices, we tend to follow the scientific method willy-nilly, by starts and fits, by happenstance and sometimes only when it is thrust upon us by dire necessity.<br /><br />Yes, in religion as well.  Which is why Shermer is an agnostic (the only rational conclusion, based on the evidence) while I personally believe in a God without attributes (which raises the ironic question, does a God without attributes really exist?).<br /><br />Here is a final word from Shermer, typical of his clear thinking and expressive prose: \\"...truth in science is not determined vox populi...a scientific theory stands or falls on evidence, and there are few theories in science that are more robust than the theory of evolution.  The preponderance of evidence from numerous converging lines of inquiry (geology, paleontology, zoology, botany, comparative anatomy, molecular biology, population genetics, biogeography, etc.) all independently converge to the same conclusion--evolution happened.\\"  He calls this a \\"convergence of evidence\\" and adds that \\"By whatever name, this is how historical events are proven.\\" (p. 174)d a curtain of pseudoscience.

Well, tells a lot, anyway, and tells it in a most colorful manner resulting in one of the most entertaining poker books I've read.  (The absolute most entertaining is Positively Fifth Street (2003) by James McManus.)<br /><br />Gordon and his co-writer, Jonathan Grotenstein give us the world of poker from its history, to how to play, to a fantastic finale at the World Series of Poker No Limit Hold'em Championship written in the second person.  One gets the sense that Gordon actually experienced this adventure, and is telling it in the second person so that the reader's involvement is enhanced--that is, until we get to the final hand, which results in a \\"suck out\\" unlikely enough to rival any from the movies (with the possible exception of the final hand in The Cincinnati Kid 1965).<br /><br />Phil Gordon knows poker and not just as a TV host.  He's a professional player who's won tournaments on the World Poker Tour and once finished fourth in the WSOP Championship.  His knowledge and experience show in the advice he gives on how to play and in his general comments about the game and the players.  When he talks about e.g., showing cards or revealing \\"tells,\\" he often includes a story from his own experience illustrating the point being made.  In his third person fantasy at the World Series of Poker, he has YOU showing your hand after a daring bluff that so rattles the guy who threw away the winner that the poor soul goes on tilt.<br /><br />But it's not all color and tall tale.  Included is some very good advice on how to play the game, some of it psychological and some of it technical.  An example of some table psychology is the \\"Presto!\\" phenomenon presented on page 145.  What you do is play pocket fives and deliver a bad beat to another player (right, but don't hold your breath).  Just after he calls your river bet you cry out \\"Presto!\\" and flip over your pocket fives.  Gordon claims that this is so much fun that you can get a whole table doing it--and by the way, \\"creating a lot of 'dumb' money\\" in the process.  (I want to be there when Gordon flips over his set of fives crying \\"Presto!\\" and the other guy shows him a set of sixes.)<br /><br />An example of some good technical advice is this: \\"Playing ace-[rag]suited from early position is probably okay at most low-limit tables but can be a recipe for disaster in a game full of tight, aggressive players who will raise you--and usually beat you--with a better ace.  Same goes for hands like J-10 offsuit and wired sixes.\\" (p. 155)<br /><br />One of the nice features of the book is \\"Your Defining Moment\\" in which Gordon sets a poker scene at a decision point and then asks you what you would do.  Then he gives his answer.<br />For example, say you find yourself in a ten and twenty hold'em game with your boss.  (How awkward is that?)  You make an inside straight on the river.  Should you raise him? (p. 149)<br /><br />Even though this is an excellent book, I must point out some slips.  Gordon writes that somebody using a computer figured out that Q7 unsuited, the so-called \\"computer hand,\\" is \\"the worst of the profitable hands.\\"  (p. 61)  He adds that it \\"is a pretty awful holding, and there's not a winning poker player in the world who would play it with any regularity.\\"  True, but the real significance of Q7 unsuited is not that it is \\"the worst of the profitable hands.\\"  Rather Q7 unsuited is the median strength hand.  Half of the 169 poker hands are stronger and half are weaker.  That is NOT the same thing as imagining that Q7 is some kind of minimal winning hand.<br /><br />Gordon's statement that Chris Moneymaker \\"hadn't set foot in a brick-and-mortar, real-life cardroom before the 2003 WSOP\\" is incorrect.  If you read Moneymaker's book on his unlikely elevation to the championship, you can see that although most of his experience was on-line, he did play in clubs prior to his entry into the tournament, and in fact arrived in Las Vegas a little early to practice in the clubsthere.<br /><br />Also in general Gordon's stories about poker in the old clubs in California are a little off.  His tale from the mid-1970s about \\"Mr. Grey\\" being told by a floorman that all eight people seated at a game were \\"in cahoots, waiting for an unlucky ninth to join their game\\" is almost certainly not factual. (p. 137)  For one thing splitting a sucker's money eight ways isn't much of a pay day, and furthermore, how long could such a ruse be maintained?  Additionally, Gordon's reference in the same chapter to a $30/$60 draw poker game is at odds with my memory.  First of all \\"California draw,\\" as he calls it, was seldom spread since only the experts really liked the game.  Mike Caro, the self-styled \\"Mad Genius of Poker,\\" tired to get the game spread at the old Horseshoe Club, but with almost no success.  The \\"tourists\\" preferred the easier to play jacks or better, or low ball.  Second, when the state law against bets larger than $20 was finally lifted in the 70s, the big draw games were typically $5 ante with $25/$50 limits, not $30/$60.<br /><br />Finally, if you're wondering about the confused \\"Answer\\" to your \\"Defining Moment\\" against Grandma on pages 62-63, just note that Grandma is NOT holding the eight of diamonds as shown on page 63.  She is holding the eight of spades as shown on page 62.  And yes Grandma should play a bigger game.<br /><br />Sayeth the River Master: a good read with some good advice from a couple of guys who know and love the game.the old clubs in California are a little off.

It is to me like embracing yes and no at the same time, like believing and not believing in the same instant, like being and not being as one.  Yes, Virginia there is something beyond our understanding.  And the wonderful thing about the postmodern world is that we know for a certainty (in as much as we can be certain about anything) that we really don't understand this world we have been thrown into.  QM proves it.  As Al-Khalili points out again and again, even the top physicists turn away when certain questions are asked and let them pass because they have no answer.<br /><br />But I don't think it really matters what we think.  The plain truth of the matter is that from our perspective as macro-creatures in a macro-world, with macro-minds and macro-mind modules molded by the evolutionary mechanism for a macro-world, quantum physics just doesn't make sense--or I should say, it makes good sense if we ignore the fact that the sense it makes is totally different in some very fundamental ways from the world in which we live.<br /><br />Einstein understandably abhorred the spooky action at a distance--the strange entanglement of particles which has no basis in our conception and no basis in any science prior to QM--and worse yet, no explanation.  (We prove things we don't understand.)  As Al-Khalili makes clear no one knows how to account for the fact that no matter how far apart two entangled particles get, they seem to be in instantaneous \\"communication\\" with one another.  Theoretically they could be on opposite sides of the universe.  Well, the phrase \\"opposite sides of the universe\\" is meaningless, as is so much of our terminology when applied to the very, very large or the very, very small.<br /><br />And \\"communication\\" is the wrong word since instant communication would in effect be information moving in excess of the speed of light, which is still impossible.  (I wouldn't bet the ranch on it staying that way, however.)  Yet, what other word is there?  No one knows!  Measure the spin of one entangled particle and you can bet that ranch that the other particle will have the predicted spin.  Hocus-pocus, abracadabra--or something like that.<br /><br />All of which tells me--all of what little I know about quantum mechanics--that the world is not as we think it is, and that down, down the dimensions to a very deep, deep \\"place,\\" way, way tinier than we can imagine, way, way tinier than the Planck limit, there is--well, by definition, zero, but by imagination possibly a wondrous world so far beyond our ken that it might as well be magic.  Indeed, it is surely beyond our notions of magic whatever, however, wherever, whenever it is.<br /><br />Despite the wonderful color photos and drawings and fanciful artwork, and despite the detailed and even laborious explanations, I am afraid that Al-Khalili's book is not going to unperplex the perplexed.  Frankly, QM cannot be understood; it can only be appreciated.  And it can only be fully appreciated by those who understand the math.  This book, in keeping with a long-standing book-biz tradition contains no math, or at least very little.  Well, Schrodinger's equation appears on page 63, and is parsed, as it were, but not solved.  It's really there more for decorative effect than anything else, as part of the artwork.<br /><br />But quantum mechanics can be used.  The amazing thing is that applications based on our understanding of it are used everyday all over the world in lasers, computers, CDs, DVDs, rockets to the moon, etc.  In other words, it's the same old story.  We know enough to employ the ideas for our benefit, but not enough to come to a full understanding or a final theory.  My guess is we never will.  Scientific knowledge expands like a widening circle in a pond of water as we know more and more about the very large and the very small and the very distant in time and space; but the pond is unimaginably large, large beyond the limits of our senses and our instruments, possibly infinitely large.  And so the circle expands and expands but never reaches the shore, possibly because there is no shore.<br /><br />Incidentally, of course neither the infinitely large nor the infinitely small are allowed in either cosmology or quantum mechanics.  There is the Big Bang and no knowledge of what there was before the Big Bang, and of course there is nothing smaller than Planck and the \\"logic\\" of QM would allow.<br /><br />Or is there?<br /><br />The strength of this book is in the colorful and imaginative artwork and in the mini-essays from physicists such as Paul Davies, Chris Dewdney, Ron Johnson and others along with Al-Khalili's enthusiastic text.  But if you think relativity was strange--well, comparing the strangeness of relativity to the strangeness of QM is like comparing the complexities of tick-tack-toe to those of three-dimensional chess.<br /><br />By the way, Al-Khalili assures us on the copyright page (alluding of course to the \\"diabolical\\" Erwin Schrodinger) that \\"No cats were harmed in the making of this book.\\"ts, possibly infinitely large.  And so the circle expands and expands but never reaches the shore, possibly because there is no shore.

Geologist Kenneth Deffeyes sets a likely date: Thanksgiving Day, 2005.  I have read other sources and they agree that half the oil in the ground will be out of the ground by a similar date or not later than about 2010.  True, there are others who give it another decade or so, but they are in the minority.  At any rate, Deffeyes has his old mentor's curve to support his view.  M. King Hubbert was the guy who predicted with startling accuracy when US oil production would peak (early 1970s).  Deffeyes uses the same methodology to predict the peak for world oil production.<br /><br />The bugaboo here of course is that world oil demand will not decrease, but with the rapid industrialization of places like China and India, it will increase, perhaps dramatically.  The result?  Higher oil prices, of course.  In fact, Deffeyes's book, written last year, effectively predicted the current spike in oil prices!  Clearly he is a man to listen to.  But the salient point is in his title: \\"Beyond Oil.\\"<br /><br />Metaphorically, he sees us gazing down from Hubbert's peak (which is exactly where we are) looking back and looking forward and asking, just what will the world be like \\"beyond oil\\"?  Ah, yes, like the baby suckling the bottle, we will soon or late, abruptly or with planned gradualness (but always with some kind of real discomfort), have to give up our dependence on cheap oil and switch to something else.<br /><br />What Deffeyes does so very well in this intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable book is first give us the background on oil, where it came from, and explain in detail why it's clear that production is about to decline.  It is interesting to note that the Hubbert/Deffeyes method allows us to chart how much oil is left simply by gauging past and current production.  I was surprised at this, because who is to say how much is left in the ground; but Deffeyes's point is that oil exploration and production has been so extensive world-wide that just by reading the production we can realize what is left.  In other words, if the oil were there, it would have been discovered and drilled for.  This is not to say that there are not some (small) fields left undiscovered.  There are a few, no doubt, but like puddles added to a great lake, they won't affect the overall picture.<br /><br />Then he explores the extent to which we can switch to natural gas and/or coal to create electricity and to run our transportation systems.  The US has some of the largest coal reserves in the world along with China and Russia.  But the problem with coal is pollution and toxins and the cost of filtering them out at the smokestack.  China right now uses coal for almost everything, including cooking family meals, and the clouds, reminiscent of those that choked London during the Industrial Revolution, are gathering thickly over Chinese cities.  But Deffeyes notes, \\"...we likely will be forced to choose either increased pollution from coal or doing without a significant portion of our present-day energy supply.\\" (p. 98)<br /><br />Next he looks into the possibility of greater production from tar sand, heavy oil and oil shade.  Canada has huge reserves, we have substantial ones, but the question is cost of extraction and refinement.  Deffeyes delineates the difficulties.<br /><br />Finally he comes to nuclear power.  His expression strongly suggests that we need to rethink our attitude toward the nuke (and possibly learn to love it!).<br /><br />There is also a chapter on the so-called \\"hydrogen economy.\\"  I have read a couple of books on the prospects for fuel cells using hydrogen as a \\"clean air\\" replacement for gasoline and I can tell you that for several reasons we are long, long way from that reality.  Deffeyes succinctly reiterates that view.<br /><br />The final chapter, \\"The Big Picture\\" is most interesting.  Deffeyes, who is a gifted teacher as well as being a seasoned geologist, points to another, perhaps more acute shortage (albeit many years in the future): mineable phosphate.  He brings this up to make the point that the coming oil shortage is just another obstacle along the way that we clever humans will have to negotiate.  He also notes that global per capita oil production peaked long ago in 1979! (p. 177)  We are producing people faster than oil.  Another topical point: world oil consumption is about 25 billion barrels a year; US consumption about a fourth of that.  The reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge equal about 5 billion barrels, or as Deffeyes puts it, the equivalent of world use for two or three months.<br /><br />Some Deffeyes-isms:<br /><br />\\"Trade in your Hummer or Porsche Cayenne; find some other way of publicizing your testosterone.\\" (p. 8)<br /><br />On his discovery of \\"queueing theory\\" (well-known to phone companies and others who have to regulate traffic): \\"All I knew about queueing was that the word had five consecutive vowels.\\" (p. 31)  (Actually \\"queuing\\" is an acceptable spelling.)<br /><br />Commenting on freshmen studying environmental issues \\"through literary, philosophical, ethical, spiritual, or other humanistic perspectives\\" (instead of getting out in the field): \\"We've elevated scientific ignorance to an art form.\\" (p. 169)<br /><br />\\"All policy wonks and all futurologists need to keep a geologist around.\\"  The implication being, somebody who isn't afraid to get his or her hands dirty, and somebody who knows that the oil peak \\"is just one of the geological constraints on our future society.\\" (p. 141)<br /><br />On a very efficient oil drilling site: \\"The crew on site will consist of a driller and a dog.  The driller is there to feed the dog.  The dog is there to bite the driller if he touches anything.\\" (p. 26)nts to another, perhaps more acute shortage (albeit many years in the future): mineable phosphate.

Times and MSN Money columnist Liz Pulliam Weston knows money and she knows credit, and in this information-packed, no-nonsense book she gives you just about everything you need to know about that \\"open sesame,\\" that shibboleth of numbers, that Holy Grail of liquidity--your credit score!<br /><br />First, what is your credit score and why is it important?  It's a three digit number ranging from 150 to 950 (p. 16) that creditors use to determine whether you are a good risk.  If it is low, they won't lend you any money, meaning you can't buy a car or a boat or a house unless you pay cash; and if it is somewhere in the middle, you'll pay higher interest rates than those with a higher score.<br /><br />Second, how can you find out what your score is?  As Weston explains there are three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion that calculate \\"real\\" credit scores (either FICO or NextGen).  You can contact them over the Net or by phone (Weston gives addresses and phone numbers), but here's the rub:<br /><br />\\"Congress recently did give US residents the right to get free copies of their credit REPORTS annually from each of the three bureaus.  But that doesn't include the right to free SCORES; the bureaus can and will continue to charge for those.\\" (p. 25, my emphasis)  The point here is that you can get your credit report for free, but they won't tell you the score!<br /><br />So I checked out some Web sites and found out that they wanted me to sign up for their credit monitoring services after which I would get my score, or I could get the score by itself for a flat fee.  Since I found out my score a couple of years ago when I refinanced my house, I declined the offer.  One thing I didn't like was having to give out my Social Security number to get the score.  As Weston advises, under the heading of \\"Get Stingy with Your Social Security Number\\" (p. 108), you should \\"...keep your number to yourself.  If the business insists that it needs the number, you can either do business with someone else or 'misremember' a digit or nine to protect your privacy.\\"  Hmm.  Never thought of that.<br /><br />However the credit bureaus mentioned above are presumably safe, and at any rate for most people there is no other way to get your score.  (And of course, \\"misremembering\\" won't work in this case.)<br /><br />Third, what information goes into making up your score and how can you improve it?  And finally how can you repair damage done to your credit and lift your score high enough to get credit and good interest rates?<br /><br />Weston goes into detail answering these questions.  She relies on the experience of people who have been there and done that, and upon her personal experience as well as information culled from the many letters and emails she gets from readers.  She makes \\"what makes for\\" good credit scores crystal clear.<br /><br />By the by, it is interesting to note, as Weston does in Chapter 9, \\"Insurance and Your Credit Score,\\" that bad credit can affect what you pay for insurance as well as what you pay for credit.  She writes, \\"Insurers...believe credit is an excellent predictor of whether you'll file a claim--better, in fact, than almost any other factor, including your previous driving history.\\" (p. 130)  So what we have are credit-based insurance scores for all kinds of insurance, auto, home, health, etc.  What insurers have discovered is that there is a strong correlation between low credit scores and high risk (for them).  Although correlation is not causality, and does not in a scientific sense constitute proof, the insurance companies will tell you that they make money from those with high credit scores and lose money (through claims) from those with low credit scores.  Weston even has some stats on pages 132-133 attesting to this fact.<br /><br />Why the correlation?  I think most people would say (and Weston makes this most reasonable surmise) that people who are careless with their money are likely to becareless in other aspects of their lives as well.<br /><br />One more thing: you can get a fair idea of how credit worthy the credit people think you are by the amount of junk mail you receive offering to lend you money!  I have a pretty good score and I must get fifty to a hundred offers a year.  And of course I have no need to borrow; but isn't it always the case: those who least need credit are the ones who can most easily get it, and those who need it the most are the ones least likely to get it!  Life is an eternal Catch-22.<br /><br />By the way, another annoying Catch-22 of the corporate world is revealed by Weston as she quotes \\"Glen\\" whose insurance costs increased because his wife max'ed out her GAP card.  He calls a number and is told that his credit is scored \\"according to how the insurance company wants\\" it to be scored.  He is then told that the insurance company \\"can't discuss the criteria [because] it's proprietary\\"!  Ah, yes, the old proprietary dodge.<br /><br />Anyway, in this age of identify theft and other kinds of information fraud, this book belongs on the syllabus for Personal Finance 101, an ongoing, real-world, absolutely required course for all of us living in the postmodern age.oney are likely to be careless in other aspects of their lives as well. <br /> <br />One more thing: you can get a fair idea of how credit worthy the credit people think you are by the amount of junk mail you receive offering to lend you money!

272438:US	49786731	R3POXOV13FCT95	006076001X	822847348	Moneymaker: How an Amateur Poker Player Turned $40 into $2.5 Million at the World Series of Poker	Books	4	47	47	N	N	A great read for poker fans, but a cautionary tale as well	There are a couple things to keep in mind right from the start in thinking about the phenomenon of Chris Moneymaker, amateur Internet player, who wins the World Championship of Poker in 2003.  One, he really is an amateur, or at least was when he won the coveted bracelet; and two, there's a good bit of luck involved in winning any poker tournament.  No player ever won one without being lucky a time or two, and usually more often than that.  Moneymaker, as this book reveals, was a bit luckier than most.<br /><br />Here's another thing to keep in mind.  It would seem that a poker player who cut his eyeteeth on the Internet game would be at some kind of serious disadvantage to players used to playing live.  I say this because on the Internet the only tells you can pick up (or give away) relate to how long it takes to bet, and, to be honest, these tells aren't very reliable since God only knows what the other player may be doing besides playing poker.  Many players play more than one table at a time, and that can account for the gaps in response when it's their turn to act.  So Chris Moneymaker, a kind of not too sophisticated young guy, an accountant from Tennessee with credit card debt and a wife and kid to support, would not seem the sort of guy who would suddenly discover an incredible ability to read players or to be unreadable himself.<br /><br />But what Moneymaker proves, as he narrates this unlikely tale (filtered through skillful wordsmithing by professional writer Daniel Paisner), is that for one tournament, you may not need all the skills.  Stamina in the five-day tournament, averaging over ten hours of play per day, can be an important factor, especially against the older players.  And Moneymaker had stamina.  But he really wasn't very good at reading the other players.  Again and again he relates how he put the other guy on the wrong hand.  But it usually didn't matter because (1) he either had the best hand going or (2) drew out.<br /><br />What Moneymaker did prove beyond a shadow of a doubt was his ability to run a stone cold bluff through some very strong players with better hands.  That's his gift, and to be honest it's a double-edge one in the poker world.  Normally it is better to be thought of as conservative and close to the vest in your play.  That way when you do go out on a limb, you're not as likely to be called.  On the other hand, if you are known as a bluffer, you are going to get called down a lot.<br /><br />Yet, being known as somebody who will splash chips with nothing, as Moneymaker demonstrated--if handled right--is good because then all you have to do is wait for your good hands and shove your chips into the pot.  You will get played with.  But it takes a real professional, a strongly balanced player to be just wild enough, to be just aggressive enough so that you manage to get called when you have the goods, and to make them fold when you don't.  Some players refer to this as \\"changing gears.\\"  They have, through their previous play, established a \\"table image,\\" and now is the time to take advantage of it.  If you've been betting the ranch on a wing and prayer, now is the time to wait for pocket rockets.  If you've been tossing everything but Big Slick and up into the muck, now is the time to take a flyer on unsuited connectors.<br /><br />But Moneymaker apparently was not able to adjust to his new image and new life as a poker celebrity, as the reigning World Champion--and, as this story makes clear, he spent entirely too much time partying and basking in the glory, and not enough to taking care of business at home and on the felt tables.<br /><br />In other words this is a cautionary tale as well as a great poker read.  The little guy fells the giants, but falls victim to the corruption of the spoils himself.  I feel somewhat sorry for Chris Moneymaker because in reading this book I know he still hasn't a clue--well, he has a clue, but he just hasn't developed the character yet to come to grips with the truth and deal with his sudden, largely fortuitous success.  This book concentrates on the poker playing and only hints at what success has done to Moneymaker's personal life, the drinking, the living on the road, the career change, the failure of his marriage...<br /><br />He's like the guy who won the lottery, not like the guy who reached the pinnacle of his profession after years of hard work.  And it shows.<br /><br />They say if the gods really want to destroy a man, they will give him his fondest wish.  I think this is what happened to the man from Tennessee.  Only time will tell if he can come back from the personal debacle and get his life together.  I wish him well.  His story did a lot for poker, and this is a good book in that he was honest enough to show himself as he really is.  Now he needs to take a good, long study of the guy in the mirror.o come to grips with the truth and deal with his sudden, largely fortuitous success.

My night anyway, since I'm the one doing the reading.<br /><br />Okay, Esquire Senior Editor A.J. Jacobs (who quite possibly during his tenure there rejected one of my stories--but we'll leave that as it may be and move on)--as I was saying, A.J. Jacobs knows that reading the Britannica will not make him the smartest man on the planet.  In fact he knows it will not even make him the most knowledgeable.  (Although he'll definitely go a big one-up on Homer Simpson and Dan Quayle.)  He knows full well that his hare-brained scheme is a purely Quixotic quest, or actually, after reading on page 257 that he once tried to peddle a manuscript analyzing \\"the eerie similarities between Jesus and Elvis,\\" a book-biz hustle.<br /><br />And it is that, but A.J. does it so well and provides (checking the ole laugh-o-meter) a bonafide chuckle every other page, and a \\"lol\\" every third page, and a full-out belly laugh at least once a chapter.  So this is money well-spent since the number of funny books that are actually funny is small.<br /><br />Now, to his actual reading of the EB: it's (according to his report) 44 million words long.  I mean, that is L-O-N-G.  I used to grade papers and I got brain dead after maybe a thousand.  And I read maybe a hundred books a year, and to be honest I can't really read any more.  If he reads five hours a day, 365 days a year, which is approximately what he intended, he will have to read 120,548 words per day.  That works out to 24,110 words per hour or 402 words per minute.  He can do that (although I, for one, can't).  In fact he DID do that.  Ah, but at what cost?  At what comprehension?  At what level?  After all the EB is not exactly the Nancy Drew mysteries or even the oeuvre of Stephen King.  It can get downright DENSE.  And boring.  And irrelevant.  And repetitive.  And who-gives-a-bippy esoteric.  And ten-point type is not easy on the eyes.  In fact, the real test of manhood or intellect or stick-to-it'veness here is all about the eyes.  Mr. A.J. Jacobs must have one great set of peepers.  Long before I became brain dead with all that knowledge I believe my eyes would have rebelled and gone cross-eyed or blind.  A.J. does remark on being cross-eyed in this book.  In fact there are six references in the index to being cross-eyed.  (Great index, by the way.)  Moreover, he reports that Decartes had a thing for cross-eyed women.  Maybe, just maybe, AJ's eyes were trying to tell him something: lay off the ten-point type and go examine a tree or something.  Or check out the skyline or get into a sense-deprivation tank or smell the roses with your eyes closed.<br /><br />Jacobs admits that he scanned sometimes.  He even admits to \\"felony-level skimming\\"! (p. 276)  He allows that he zoned out on occasion, but his eyes kept moving over the words.  Let me give you a clue, big guy.  Take it from one who's been there: that is automatic reading.  The eyes follow the text, but the brain is NOT engaged.  In truth, dude, you drifted off.  That's right, 40 winks.<br /><br />But never mind.  What Jacobs does oh so very well (in addition to the requisite funny man self-effacement--and he IS funny), is tell us about his life.  We learn what kind of kid he was (\\"the world's smartest\\"), what his father is like (wrote 24 books and loves practical jokes), what his wife Julie is like (long-suffering and wise), and what he does and has done for a living (editor at Entertainment Weekly and now Senior Editor at Esquire).  But his best shtick is the novelist's trick of making us want to know how it all turns out.  Does he finish the reading?  Does his wife divorce him?  Does he lose all his friends?  Does he go blind and mad as a hatter?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Jacobs makes us want to know.  He also drops little subplots and scenarios into the narrative.  He tells us that he and his wife Julie are trying to get pregnant.  Well, she is.  He's trying to help.  And he makes the reader want to know how that comes out.  (I could give you the page number when they finally get the call on the test results, but I won't.  I will tell you it is appropriately three-quarters of the way through the book.)

Let me say...okay, I'm NOT going to say anything because I don't want to spoil the plot.  However, what transpires is VERY interesting in an ironic way.<br /><br />And AJ does his homework including field studies.  He goes to a crossword puzzle tournament.  He hangs out at a Mensa meeting.  He meets \\"Jeopardy\\" host Alex Trebek.  He takes his lumps at the Marshall Chess Club, etc.  In short, AJ Jacobs is as serious as death in his quasi-religious quest for knowledge--useless or otherwise.<br /><br />A couple of points:<br /><br />Possibly \\"the best Scrabble word I've encountered in my life\\"--\\"qa\\" (p. 276) is NOT allowed in Scrabble.

Of that there can be little doubt as the US became the dominant social, political, economic and military power in the world.  But do current rapid economic advances by China allow us to suppose that the Twenty-First will be \\"The Chinese Century\\"?  It would appear that Ohio State business Professor Oded Shenkar thinks so.<br /><br />He is clear about the parallel: \\"China's rise has more in common with the rise of the United States a century earlier than with the progress of its modern-day predecessors and followers.\\"  (Read: Japan and the Asian \\"tigers\\": South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.) (p. 1)  He adds, \\"If current trends continue, China will surpass the US to become the world's largest economy (in purchasing-power parity terms) in two decades--possibly sooner.\\" (p. 161)<br /><br />However, as for China dominating the world in the 21st century the way the US has in the 20th--well, I think we can say the crystal ball remains cloudy, maybe even downright muddy.  Consider that prior to the assent of Deng Xiaoping as the Chinese leader, China was floundering under the weight of a Soviet-style economy, and had gone through the disastrous \\"Great Leap Forward\\" and the horrific \\"Cultural Revolution.\\"  When Deng Xiaoping goes the way of all leaders, what makes anyone think that his replacement will be any better than a host of Soviet leaders or equal even to Mao Zedong, whose political and military genius did not preclude his having a disastrous effect on China similar to that of Stalin on Russia?<br /><br />Deng had the genius to free the Chinese economy from the shackles of communism in his famous \\"one country, two systems\\" vision.  Whether such a hybrid vision can long endure is a very good question, and whether Deng's successors will continue his policies is also problematic.  My guess is they will be so focused on gaining and maintaining power that they will allow the country to regress economically.  Furthermore, should China somehow throw off the communist mantle entirely, who is to say it will not--as Russia has done--revert to a corrupt, bandit sort of economy?<br /><br />What this book is mainly about is the way China does business today and how that affects the global marketplace, and in particular what it is doing to the US economy.  Some interesting points:<br /><br />\\"...between 10 and 30 percent of China's GDP comes from piracy and counterfeiting.\\" (p.86)  The question is, how does the rest of the world meet this challenge?<br /><br />\\"A key reason behind the remarkably fast penetration of Chinese products into the US market is a retail landscape increasingly dominated by large retailers.\\" (p. 149)  The largest of these is Wal-Mart \\"which accounts for more than 10 percent of the US imports from China.\\" (p. 150)  Shenkar notes that the Chinese \\"need...large retailers to take their growing production capacity...  Thus, the fates of Wal-Mart and the Chinese industry will remain closely intertwined for years to come.\\" (p. 151)<br /><br />Right now China leads the world in the manufacturing of toys.  It is now or soon will be the number one manufacturer of furniture, and as Shenkar points out, not just low-end furniture, but top-end as well.  Shenkar speculates, \\"Given the general overcapacity in industry and the technological edge of the newer China plants, it is difficult to see how automotive manufacturing in the developed markets such as the United States and Europe will not be affected.\\"  (p. 114)  Furthermore, most TVs made today are made in China, and that includes plasma and high definition models.  The reason for this real \\"great leap forward\\" in manufacturing is first the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and incentives from the Chinese government, and second the vast amount of cheap Chinese labor.<br /><br />But Japan once made the cheapest goods in the world, and then made (as China is now doing) better and better products, and still sold them for less.  However, today, the Japanese economy is stagnate and the reasons are mostly cultural.  From the evidence that Shenkar presents, I think it is easy to guess that China's economy will eventually stagnate as well, and also for cultural and political reasons.<br /><br />There is much to chew on and think about in this book, but what I found myself wondering about was the future of the US as a service economy.  Obviously, even if China relinquishes some of its dominance in manufacturing, it won't be the US with its expensive labor that will take up the slack.  What the US is doing, as Shenkar notes, is becoming more and more dependent on services, especially in technology and education, to maintain its economic supremacy.  He warns that \\"we have no precedent of a major economy that is predominantly dependent on services,\\" noting that successful service economies tend to be small, e.g., \\"Luxembourg, Hong Kong, and Hawaii.\\" (p. 164)<br /><br />What I thought about when reading this is that the US can work as a service economy if it continues to (1) have the best universities in the world; (2) be a great tourist destination (with relatively clean air and water); and (3) be a great place to live (freedom and security can make for some very lofty real estate values!).<br /><br />One thing that Shenkar does not address (although he mentions it in passing) is the horrendous pollution problem that the Chinese already face.

Yet all about him are madmen & such, Pickwickian monsters of depravity--& all about him are poverty & debauchery of the most bestial sort, & all he wants is a fine name to call his own & some legitimacy.  Instead he finds himself a convict in Van Dieman's Land (Tasmania) in a penal colony on \\"Sarah Island\\" in a cell set near the rocks that line the shore, a cell that twice a day fills up with water forcing him to bob like a cork until his head nearly hits the ceiling, & then twice a day is emptied out to allow him to write his tale in cuttlefish ink & blood dipped from beneath his scabs upon a parchment of pages that contain his previously painted fish.  The time is the early nineteenth century.<br /><br />It is the melancholy fortune of a modern Australian forger of antiques (to sell to gullible American tourists) & a kindred imbiber of spirits to discover in a decrepit \\"meat safe\\" this extraordinary book, Gould's Book of Fish, & to be mesmerized by it & its author only to discover that all the authorities in nineteenth century antiquities to whom he presents the book disparage it as a fraud & a fake & show him the door.  And then, what is worse, as he is taking his physick of beer at a tavern it is lost or stolen, at any rate disappeared from him, so that it haunts his memory to a great distraction until at length he is forced to rewrite from memory the entire oeuvre.<br /><br />Thus we have the premise & the frame for this rather extraordinary historical novel from Down Under.  It is a wicked tale of the debasement of humanity, spun out in a humorous & satirical style reminiscent at once of the great novelists of the nineteenth century, of Hawthorne & Dickens & Melville with backward glances at Voltaire, set in a milieu that suggests adventures in distant lands with pirates & various other scallywags, infused with the peculiar spirit of nineteenth century science, which Richard Flanagan both deprecates & celebrates.  Overlaid is a veneer of artistick struggle & accomplishment culminating in the portraits of fish.<br /><br />Yes, fish.  These fish (& a lobster & two sea horses) are reproduced in this beautiful volume in color prints at the beginning of chapters so that one can see how Flanagan's narrator (& himself) were taken with the artistry of the painter.  The type in the pages of this book (which is interestingly enough published by Grove Press) is set in wine vermillion & sea creature green & in octopus black & some other colors--I believe.  The beguiling colors fade & return on these old eyes like faint visions, depending on whether I am using artificial light to read by or have the advantage of the sun streaming in.<br /><br />In short, this is an extraordinary read, like nothing else coming out of the publishing factories these days, original to a startle, fascinating & funny, a work of art that gives one once again a reason to read fiction.d with the peculiar spirit of nineteenth century science, which Richard Flanagan both deprecates & celebrates.

291462:US	49786731	RCTG1PBRDJJU4	1586481932	773787961	Lipstick Jihad: A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America and American in Iran	Books	5	64	68	N	N	Between two worlds	This beautifully written memoir will appeal to expats all over the world who, as Moaveni puts it, \\"perpetually exist in each world feeling the tug of the other.\\" (p. 243)  It will especially appeal to the young and hip \\"hyphenateds\\" who grew up in America but have always felt lost between two worlds, that of their family's culture and that of their adopted country.  The fact that Moaveni is Iranian-American really doesn't matter because her story will be familiar to all who have had to leave their homeland and grow up in a different world.<br /><br />Moaveni was actually born in Palo Alto, California to secular Islamic Iranian immigrants who did indeed leave Iran during the tumultuous days of the Iranian Revolution nearly thirty years ago.  Her story is about returning to Tehran during the years leading up to 9/11 and working as a stringer and then as a reporter for Time Magazine and other publications.  Hers is a very personal story, as all memoirs are, in which she attempts to capture the estrangement that one feels being, as the subtitle has it, \\"Iranian in America and American in Iran.\\"<br /><br />Thanks to Moaveni's obvious love of language and some very nice editing by Kate Darton at Public Affairs, she has written a most engaging and strikingly vivid account.  To be honest I could not, as the reviewer's cliche has it, \\"put it down.\\"  I read it in one gulp absolutely delighted with Moaveni's vivid, candid and honest narrative.  She is hip, sophisticated beyond her years, stylish, and very well informed.  Her prose approaches poetry and because she is always concrete, it is never boring or estranged from the needs of the reader, as memoirs can sometimes be.  We learn how it feels to be in love in a country where couples may not hold hands in public; how it feels to party in a land where parties are forbidden except as decreed by the state; how it feels to eat a pomegranate in the bathtub after being harassed by secret agents of the ayatollahs; how it feels to be beaten by street thugs (the ignorant Basiji, the brown shirts of the mullahs); how it feels to wear the veil and the chador and to hide one's hair and femininity and to be hit on by hypocritical clerics offering \\"temporary marriages\\"; how it feels to live with \\"the central dilemma of life under the Islamic regime, and its culture of lies--whether to observe the taboos and the restrictions, or resist them, by living as if they didn't exist.\\" (p. 74)<br /><br />Moaveni lets us in on the daily lives of her family and friends as they try to make sense of their place in the world.  We taste the foods that they eat, the highly spiced lamb stews, the sour cherry jams, the lavash-wrapped dates, servings of \\"four-days-in-the-making\\" sweet halvah.  We hear their voices and learn what they think of America, of the mullahs, of the secular society, of how one acts in public and in private.  I was surprised at how Westernized Tehran really is despite the best efforts of the morality police, and yet how tenaciously Iranian are its people.  They speak of the betrayal of the revolution by the ayatollahs, and the failure of the reformers.  They turn out in droves to vote even though their votes have little real political power, only the power of protest.  And I was especially impressed by Azadeh Moaveni's ability to navigate between the cultures without prejudice, giving each its due and each its detriment.<br /><br />I was also impressed with the unhesitant candor of her expression.  She writes lovingly of her maman and her estranged father, but quotes them even while they say things that surely they would not like to see in print.  I also loved Moaveni's independence and courage.  She is a woman who can speak her mind with the voice and insightfulness of a gifted novelist.  Here is an example:<br /><br />\\"As an American, I believed in unconditional love, not the contingent affection one had to earn as an Iranian woman.  Iranian-style love, though extravagant, poetic, and intense,came with a prenuptial agreement.  You had to promise to adhere to tradition, respect boundaries, pretend a great deal, and keep yourself decently coiffed at all times.  You were not entitled to love, it seemed, simply by being who you were; but by fulfilling expectations.\\" (p. 136)<br /><br />Another:<br /><br />She (somewhat playfully) asks the Iranian president's chief of staff, will she become Iran's first female ambassador.  He replies, \\"No...If there are any female ambassadors at all, they will be Islamist, chadori women, certainly not you, a secular, partial Iranian.\\"  Cut to the quick, Moaveni observes, \\"I tried to detach myself from the moment by writing a headline in my head.  Sympathetic Envoy of Vile Government Delivers Horrifying But Irrefutable Proof that Azadeh Is an American.\\"  He reads her face and then \\"held out a plate of green grapes, as though to distract a child gearing up to fling herself to the floor and wail.\\" (pp. 120-121)<br /><br />There is so much in this book that is alive and vital, that is evocative of our times and of a young woman's life at the razor's edge of the great clash of cultures, that it should be high on the reading list of anyone who wants to understand what is happening in the world today as globalization squeezes us all closer and closer together.<br /><br />In a moment of despair, as Moaveni realizes that as a female journalist in Revolutionary Iran, her life leaves a lot to be desired, she thinks, but does not say, \\"...my private misery was highly specialized and therefore irrelevant.\\" (p. 168)<br /><br />This glorious memoir--and I mean \\"glorious\\" in the sense that Moaveni triumphs over both the small-minded \\"ayatollah dinosaurs\\" and mall-minded Americans with her strength, her articulation, and her honesty--proves otherwise.nd intense, came with a prenuptial agreement.

293291:US	49786731	REEYNTD9FDVCD	158042080X	113951946	Caro's Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker	Books	4	22	22	N	N	For the middle stakes players of medium experience	Mike Caro--or \\"MJC\\" as he was known in the early days in the clubs in Gardena, California where he was the king of the rounders--has always been an enigmatic figure in the poker world.  Never a world-class player like Doyle Brunson or Bobby Baldwin--to name two from the older generation--and never a great theoretician like David Sklansky, Caro nonetheless became one of the game's great celebrities mainly due to his fine talent for self-promotion.<br /><br />I was once told by a middle level professional that Mike was \\"a terrible player.\\"  This guy ought to know since he propped the games at the California clubs and had played against MJC many times.  However the truth is Mike was and is a very good player.  His problem was one that often afflicts great minds in many different fields, that of boredom.  One often had the sense when playing against the self-styled \\"Mad Genius of Poker\\" that the game was too slow for him and that the challenges weren't really challenging enough, and he had to do something to liven up the game or--and this was almost always his ultimate goal--to \\"take over the table,\\" psychologically speaking.<br /><br />And so Mike would make the most astonishing plays--good and bad--spectacular calls and lay-downs, such as calling with a skinny pair of jacks at the showdown or showing a seemingly winning hand and tossing it away without calling.  His most famous play at draw poker was to raise the opener before the draw, stand pat, and then when the betting came around to him expose his worthless hand WITHOUT betting.  I heard one of the regulars in the old twenty-straight draw game remark, \\"Why doesn't he just mail me a check?\\"<br /><br />But she did not understand Mike's logic.  Another player, a very good one, did understood very well what Caro was about, as revealed in his pointed comment: \\"I'll tell you one thing about Mike Caro.  He always deserves a call.\\"<br /><br />With his talent for showmanship and his desire to do more than just play cards, it wasn't surprising that as the hold'em and seven-card stud games became legal in California in the eighties, Mike would become the preeminent entrepreneur of poker through his seminars and his assumption of the \\"Mad Genius\\" persona.  He gave lectures, made poker videoes, wrote books and magazine articles, and found inclusion as the draw poker authority in Doyle Brunson's original SuperSystem book from the seventies. This book amounts to a collection of essays based on some of the seminar classes from what he eventually styled as his \\"University of Poker.\\"<br /><br />All in all, Mike has done well for himself at the game.  The question is, has he done well for his students?  My answer is a qualified yes.  In this book (not to be taken as an introductory text, by the way) he offers excellent advice for the small and middle stakes player.  His qualities as a motivational speaker come through very well.  His booster-like enthusiasm and his self-help, psychological approach will benefit many.  Contrary to what some other reviewers have written, this is an easy book to read with some worthwhile advice.  Some examples:<br /><br />\\"Calling as the big blind.  It's much more profitable to play if your call closes the action.\\" (p. 135)  What Caro means is that either there was no raise or the raiser was to your immediate left so that no raise or reraise is possible.  This is an important concept.  If you call a raise from the button after a couple of other players have limped in from early seats you are not only in danger of a reraise after your call, but if it is reraised, the reraiser in an early seat probably has a big hand.<br /><br />\\"When everyone checks on the flop, then again on 4th Street, you can steal a lot of pots from the last position.\\"  (p. 98)  Actually if everybody checks twice, you might have the best hand with little to nothing.  A more sophisticated observation on this situation is that if anybody in the last position bets, you can steal more than a fewpots by raising that bettor!<br /><br />On the same page there is this (written in large white letters in a black box as on a chalkboard--as though Mike IS giving a lecture, perhaps with baton in hand): \\"When you bet from the last position on the flop, you can often see your whole hand for free!\\"  This is Mike's way of expressing the \\"how to get a free card\\" concept.  Usually this is explained in a situation where it has been bet on the flop and you are last with a drawing hand.  You raise so that everyone will check to you on 4th Street.  Then, if you make your hand, you bet, and if you miss, you just check and give yourself a free card.<br /><br />Mike is right though, in passive games (which he always loved) many players will check to you on 4th Street after you have bet the flop, and you can just check behind them and see the river card for free.<br /><br />One more: \\"Many skilled players suffer from FPS (Fancy Play Syndrome).  They'd rather impress weak opponents with unexpected plays than beat them with the obvious winning strategy.  Avoid FPS.\\"  Here Mike could be self-analyzing.  But he's right of course.<br /><br />This is mostly about hold'em, but there is some tournament strategy in the book, and Caro has a chapter on seven-card stud and another on seven-card hi-lo.  His chapter on the subject of money management (which I like to call \\"self-management,\\" since it is all about staying in the game and not going broke) is excellent.<br /><br />All in all this book is definitely worthwhile, but will be somewhat mysterious in places to the absolute beginner, and too fundamental for the experienced professional.pots by raising that bettor!<br /><br />On the same page there is this (written in large white letters in a black box as on a chalkboard--as though Mike IS giving a lecture, perhaps with baton in hand): \\"When you bet from the last position on the flop, you can often see your whole hand for free!\\"  This is Mike's way of expressing the \\"how to get a free card\\" concept.

He is also a stern critic.  I think these qualities are exactly what America needs now at the time of our greatest strength.  What Mahbubani wants is to gently admonish the United States for acting unilaterally and without the benefit of international law, while at the same time remind us all of America's greatness and all that America has done for the world.<br /><br />He emphasizes that the US is not and has not been an ordinary superpower.  Unlike other great states, it has not sought empire or the economic enslavement of the vanquished.  Instead it has rebuilt the enemy, as in Germany and Japan, and as it is presumably trying to do in Iraq.  These extraordinary behaviors by a nation state mark the US as an enlightened nation, a nation that knows that world stability and the economic success of other nations only contribute to stability and the good life at home.<br /><br />\\"America is...an atypical human society,\\" he writes, \\"unlike any other.  Until recently, it has served as a powerful beacon, pointing to a future for all of humankind.  That is its essence, its real mission: to remain true to its soul and remain an extraordinary society.\\" (p. 211)  Mahbubani adds that in other parts of the world, the men who open doors for you...look down in a sort of implicit bow,\\" but that \\"New York doormen never look down.  They look you straight in the eye and behave as total equals...  They may work...in the building\\" and \\"receive tips...but they possess not an iota of inferiority.\\" (p. 210)  He calls this \\"an enormous leap upwards in the human evolutionary ladder.\\"  He believes that \\"America has largely escaped the pernicious effects of class stratification prevalent in the rest of the world.\\" (p. 211)<br /><br />His main point, however, is that America power reaches with its tentacles, both soft and hard, into every country of the world and affects everybody from the poorest to the wealthiest. Yet the only people who have any direct say in what the US does are Americans who can vote for its leadership.  Consequently there is great frustration throughout the world with a power that to some extent controls them, but that they cannot control.<br /><br />Mahbubani believes that it is especially important that America use its military power wisely.  If we do not, the rest of the world will view our \\"soft power\\" suspiciously \\"as an increasingly frayed velvet glove that covers a mailed fist.\\" (p. 197)<br /><br />As an example of the wise use of military power, Mahbubani notes that \\"Global trade continues to grow steadily.  Many reasons explain this: technology, open markets (an ideology spread by American influence), political stability, global trading rules (another American legacy).  But one important factor that is rarely mentioned or recognized is the spread of American military power around the world.  American military power keeps global sea and air routes open.  Any force that tries to disrupt these routes will have to reckon with America.  Since no country can, global trade has flourished.\\" (p. 140)<br /><br />Consequently, Mahbubani argues, the rest of the world benefits \\"enormously and directly from the global American military presence, which costs American taxpayers over $400 billion a year.  But other nations pay not a penny for this.\\" (p. 141)<br /><br />What Mahbubani would like to see--barring a sharing of power--is a foreign policy by the US that understands the extent of its power and uses that power wisely for the benefit of all and not just for narrow, short-term American interests.  He believes that what is good for the rest of the world is good the for the US.  If the rest of the world suffers because of unenlightened US policy, as it sometimes has in the past, the US itself will suffer as well.<br /><br />He makes it clear that the neocon dream of an American Empire is a delusion based on an unrealistic understanding of both America and the modern world.  He writes, \\"With all the military power in the world, America appears incapable of subjugating one medium-sized country in the Middle East because it is incapable of administering the kind of brutal suppression the British applied when they conquered Iraq in 1917.\\" (p. 10)  He adds on page 202, \\"If America cannot tolerate the sight of its soldiers abusing a few Iraqis, how can it build an empire?\\"<br /><br />Then there is the question of legitimacy.  Although they have no vote on who is elected president of the United States, Mahbubani believes that the planet's 6.3 billion citizens \\"are the ultimate custodians of legitimacy in the international environment.\\" (p. 186)  Since most Americans believe in the rule of law and in the idea that some actions are legitimate within its scope and others not, it behooves our government to act accordingly.  Mahbubani's point is that if our use of power (as in the invasion of Iraq) is not seen as legitimate, we will lose prestige and credibility in the world, and with that loss, we will abdicate moral leadership and ultimately become isolated from the rest of the world.  In the \\"Age of Innocence\\" that would have been okay.  China existed for centuries isolated from the rest of the world as did the US (for the most part) until the first world war.  However in the modern world where everyone is so closely connected, such isolation is not possible.<br /><br />A note on Mahbubani's choice of title and his message: \\"The Age of Innocence\\" was before the modern age, before the globalization of the planet.  There is a novel by Edith Wharton with the title The Age of Innocence published in 1920 (but set in the1870s).  With every country in the world affecting not only its neighbors but countries around the globe, there can no longer be any innocence of intent in foreign affairs.rstanding of both America and the modern world.

The title character is the city attorney of Tyger City, Iowa, a Rube Goldberg sort of lawyer/inventor/entrepreneur/politician--an all-America sort of guy, I guess, in lampoon.  He has this unusual quality not of invisibility, but of fuzziness: nobody can describe what he looks like, even if he has just left the room.<br /><br />The hero--or at least the protagonist--of the novel is Christus, a young man in his thirties or thereabouts who, like Garrison Keeler's Guy Noir, is just trying to find some answers to life's persistent questions.  Christus grew up in an orphanage and while a soldier in Vietnam spent a significant amount of his time hidden under the floorboards of the barracks kitchen writing a novel.  His occupation is digging holes, and this is how he happens to be in Tyger City and how he happens to have gained the acquaintance of Albert, the mystery man.  He bought a piece of land from Albert in which to dig a hole.<br /><br />Christus's first person narrative takes us from one unsatisfactory incident--e.g., making love in the ancestral house of Dear Abby and Ann Landers during a storm-tossed night, yet never really falling in love--while he recalls his past in Vietnam and at the orphanage and on the road.<br /><br />One theme might be loss of face, since Albert's face can never be recalled, and the one true love of Christus's life he abandoned because she had lost her face in an accident.  But this loss of face is not loss of pride.  Instead it is loss of identity, loss of who one is.  Albert is nobody, an absurdist notion of the American male in his middle years.  And Christus's true love also lost her identity (at least for Christus) when she lost her beauty.<br /><br />Naturally Oldis's protagonist is trying to find himself.  Like Sisyphus he finds sustenance and meaning in repetitive manual labor, emphasizing the purely physical nature of our existence.  Digging a hole in the ground while searching for absolutely nothing is, in a sense, the equivalent of writing a novel or pushing a rock up a hill only to have it roll down at the end of the day.  If this were a play it would be something from the Theatre of the Absurd spun out by Ionesco or Pinter or Beckett.<br /><br />But not to give Oldis too many accolades: his metaphors are fine, if sometimes too much reached for, and his sense of narrative pace is agreeable, and his familiar theme of alienation cannot (in my mind) be overdone.  However, I didn't find his mix of realism and burlesque satisfying.  The gritty reality of, for example, the scene at the bus station with Robert the sweeper doesn't mix with the later courtroom scene in which not only is the action totally unrealistic, but even the dialogue is highly unlikely.  I also did not care for Christus's sense of guilt because I don't think it was ever resolved.  In a sense the novel does not end, but moves on.  Christus does not find the love he lost, and neither does he find absolution, he simply leaves town, his issues unresolved.<br /><br />But perhaps this is Oldis's point: just as Sisyphus must, when the new morning comes, again push that rock up the hill all the while knowing that it will roll down again when day is done, so too must Christus.  Therefore, it would seem, as Camus and Sartre and the existential philosophers have it, life itself is absurd, and the only meaning we can make of it is the meaning that we ourselves put into it.  Yet Christus, as the novel ends, gives no hint that he realizes this.  It is as though the author of the novel knows, but his narrator does not.  In this sense one can say we have an \\"unreliable narrator\\" who on one level is aware of his surroundings and the events in his life, but on another level is not aware of his purely existential position or the absurdityof what he sees.  He believes that \\"Judas, the humanist, will win,\\" that the strong and brave shall inherit the earth (although the Bible says otherwise).  In the final scene, Christus is listening for a voice that will call him home.  One senses that this is the voice of a God that he never found.  One almost expects a crucifixion, a resurrection, and a return to the Father.<br /><br />Two metaphors from this very metaphoric book, one beautiful, the other bathetic:<br /><br />\\"[T]hunder boomed like the laughter of a hearty man.\\"<br /><br />\\"The storm was feeling its oats.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line: a quick and easy read, poetic at times, very much worthwhile, but like salad on a winter's night, a bit unsatisfying.e absurdity of what he sees.

Furthermore, nearly everybody knows that genes work in concert with the environment to shape our biology and our behavior.  Indeed, there is nary an evolutionary biologist outside of Bob Jones University who thinks that some kind of endowment, fixed or otherwise, is the exclusive determinate of who we are.<br /><br />But Eldredge seems unaware of the modern understanding.  Not only is he tilting at windmills, he is setting up and trying to knock down straw men that don't exist.  Let's look at some of his accusations.<br /><br />He wants us to know that the drive to eat and stay alive is more fundamental that the drive to reproduce.  He calls this the primacy of economics over sex.  This is fine, but I know of no evolutionary biologist, anthropologist or sociobiologist who thinks otherwise.  They do not mistake the blueprint for the building.  Of course in the mass culture a simplistic imbibing of Darwinism and a literal grokking of the metaphor of the selfish gene does exist.  It is therefore perhaps a shame that some of this book does not appear in say People Magazine to set the general public straight.<br /><br />Eldredge notes that reproduction is NOT the purpose of life and posits the existential view that if life has a purpose \\"it is simply to live.\\" (p. 46)  But \\"purpose\\" is entirely an anthropomorphic notion and has no place in evolutionary biological thinking.<br /><br />He wants to emphasize the cooperative nature of organisms as opposed to the idea that nature is competitive.  He writes that \\"overt, no-holds-barred competition in the mating arena is, in the last analysis, relatively rare.\\"  And then on the very same page (66) he more or less contradicts himself by writing that male birds \\"stake out a territory (usually constantly defended against intruding males)...\\"  Note that even using such ideas as \\"defended\\" ushers us into the land of metaphor.  The birds actually react instinctively to the close proximity of other males and try to chase them away.  WE think they are \\"defending territory.\\"<br /><br />Eldredge is saying that the males are not fighting over females or sex but are holding onto valuable real estate--that is, their behavior is economic and not sexual.  In a nut shell this is his point: life is lived primarily as an economic venture.  What counts is getting enough to eat while avoiding life's many pitfalls.  He believes it is a mistake to go further and add that the purpose of these behaviors is to reproduce.  Again the bugaboo here is that word \\"purpose.\\"  The truth is that all organisms once they have secured the necessities of life try to reproduce.  This is NOT the same thing as saying that is their \\"purpose.\\"<br /><br />What I especially dislike however is not Eldredge's insistence on what should be obvious, but the surly manner in which he attempts to dismiss certain of his colleagues and his attempt to ridicule ideas he either doesn't understand or thinks are being applied too broadly.  His dismissive labeling--\\"hard-core evolutionary genetics,\\" p. 130; E. O. Wilson's \\"consilience gambit\\" (why is it a \\"gambit\\"?) p. 249, \\"ultra-Darwinism,\\" etc.--cannot stand for cogent argument.  Particularly offensive is his repetition of what he calls \\"the Pleistocene cop-out.\\"  His argument here is that evolutionary psychologists explain current human behavior in terms of what worked on the savannas of Africa during the period of evolutionary adaptation.  What he attempts to show is that our behaviors are culturally directed and not dances choreographed by genetic puppeteers.  The truth is ourbehaviors are the product of both cultural and genetic influences working in concert.<br /><br />Nonetheless our genetic heritage IS in no small part the product of our experience during the Pleistocene, and it is part of the genius of evolutionary psychology to recognize this fact.  Curiously Eldredge reveals that he understands this because on page 190 he writes (referring to Olduvai Gorge in East Africa), \\"It is the last best vestige of the environment that produced us, giving us insight into the very conditions in which our bodies--and behaviors--were shaped by evolution.\\"  That is pure evo psych, but apparently what Eldredge appreciates on one page is not always evident on another!<br /><br />This is not to say that this book is without merit.  Very well done is Eldredge's answer to the idea that rape is evolutionarily adaptive.  (It is not: it is socially abhorrent for one thing; and since we are social animals, the rapist's behavior has met and will continue to meet with the severe disapprobation of society to the rapist's reproductive detriment.)<br /><br />Also very much worth reading is Eldredge's exploration of infanticide and his explanation for its near universal practice throughout human history--although his point that it is not adaptive in an evolutionary sense is flawed.  Sometimes it is better to have fewer children so that the ones we do have gain our full economic attention.  The fact that this was often achieved through infanticide does not alter that general argument.<br /><br />It is a shame that Eldredge's emotional need to discredit evolutionary psychology mars what could have been a useful exercise.  He should have concentrated on arguments against rape as an evolutionary adaptation and eschewed the mistaken and gratuitous attacks on his colleagues.  His general concern that those not expert in evolutionary biology sometimes overrate the genetic human endowment and underrate the cultural influence is a good one; but this point has to be made without straw men and ad hominem attacks, otherwise the author loses credibility and begins to sound more like a radio talk show host than a reputable scientist.influences working in concert.

305250:US	49786731	R1ESUF6UWPBM53	1880685086	825219304	Hold 'Em Poker	Books	5	82	83	N	N	Terse, but packed with power	Hold'em Poker is a revision of Sklansky's classic from 1976.  It was the first authoritative poker book to actually give starting hands in hold'em.  Sklansky arranged the hands into eight groups and gave recommendations on which ones to open with depending on position.<br /><br />In this edition he has revised the groups and corrected some minor errors.  For example, 7-6s was then both the #30 hand in Group 5 and the #53 hand in Group 8.  That has been corrected.<br /><br />In addition to being the first book devoted exclusively to hold'em, Sklansky's little gem is perhaps the best introductory book on hold'em ever written, and then some.  Sklansky does a masterful job of introducing the reader to the game, pointing out how it differs from other poker games, narrows in on the community card essence of the game, and then, amazingly enough, gives the reader information and ideas of considerable value to even seasoned players.  Even if you have been playing hold'em for some time, and even if you have read Brunson's SuperSystem, I still recommend that you spend some time with this book.<br /><br />Sklansky writes in a deceptively terse style so that the ideas and concepts are plainly stated without elaboration.  This has frustrated some readers because in some cases what Sklansky is saying is clear at first blush, while in other cases the text seems cryptic.  There are three reasons for this.<br /><br />One, Sklansky thought of himself primarily as a teacher and deliberately left out some explanations while inviting readers to work out the reasoning for themselves.  Serious players who want to improve their game will benefit from this approach.  Take out a deck of cards and deal out some hands if necessary.  For example, near the end of the section on \\"Odds and Implied Odds\\" he explains why it is often correct to call with a small pair before the flop.  He notes that you'll often \\"win a nice pot if your card flops.\\"  He adds without further explanation, \\"Get out if it doesn't, unless you make an open-end straight.\\"  He wants you to work that out.  If you do, you will come to note (after some study) that a draw to an open-ended straight that figures to be the nut is enormously better than an inside draw to the bottom end.  I would add that if you have two sixes, the board 754 is significantly better than 987.  Sklansky doesn't mention it, but in this latter case, you should usually not draw, but toss.<br /><br />Two, like all experts writing for a general readership, Sklansky unconsciously takes some ideas for granted since he himself knows them so very well, but doesn't realize that the less experienced reader needs more explanation.  I've read many books by experts in all sorts of fields from cosmology to Scrabble, and I can tell you that this is a common phenomenon.  What the expert needs when writing a book for a general readership is a very good editor who is less than expert him- or herself.  So, yes, this book would benefit from the work of a top notch editor.<br /><br />An example of Sklansky's not explaining something that would be cryptic to most players comes from the \\"Semi-Bluffing\\" section of the \\"Strategy\\" chapter.  First he notes that \\"If you never bluff on the flop or fourth street, you are giving away too much information when you do bet.\\"  Then he writes, \\"Rather than try to guess when to bluff, it is much better to use your cards to randomize your play.\\"  He is referring to semi-bluffing situations described in the proceeding paragraphs rather than a seat-of-your-pants bluff when you feel you haven't been bluffing enough.  However, his use of the word \\"randomize\\" recalls a technique some pros use.  Say it is correct to bluff one-fourth of the time in a certain situation.  Everything else being equal, how do you decide?  Take the first card on the flop.  If it is a spade, bluff, otherwise don't.  That will randomize.<br /><br />Three, the expert is always aware of his learned colleagues looking over his shoulder;and so to some extent writes for that readership as well.  We can see this in Sklansky's almost exhaustive treatment of how to play heads-up on fifth street in the \\"Strategy\\" chapter.  Sklansky is anticipating knowledgeable critics familiar with saddle-point ideas from Game Theory, which are applicable to heads-up decisions on the river.  You might profitably skim this section and save its intricacies for graduate school!  But be aware that the top experts understand it very well.<br /><br />I found it strangely synchronistic in rereading this book to fall upon Sklansky's ideas about the pause as a \\"tell.\\"  As Internet players know, how long it takes you to respond may give your opponents some information about your hand.  Sklansky writes, \\"If a good player does not pause at all after he has bet and has been raised...he is most likely on the come for a flush or straight if such a hand is possible.  With almost any other hand in this situation he has to pause to consider either folding or reraising.\\"  This is exactly the sort of \\"tell\\" that still exists in Internet play, and Sklansky's reasoning is as sound today as it was when he wrote this in the seventies.<br /><br />This is not only a classic, but a book that almost thirty years after its creation is still very much worth reading.  The fact that he devised his strategies originally for a game with only a single blind and an ante (the Las Vegas 10&20 hold'em game circa 1975) should be kept in mind.  Yet the ideas and strategies are mostly still of great value.  I played cards with Sklansky and I can tell you he is a very good player, but more than that he is a great theoretician who understands the game better than many world champions.

AQu is a good hand, but it doesn't play well when it gets raised preflop, as can happen in an early seat.  Most players I think would rather have JT suited since you can either get away from it fairly easily or play it confidently and sometimes win a large pot.  AQ unsuited too often has to pay off to AK or KK.  AQ is a tough hand to play as Doyle Brunson has said many times.<br /><br />Warren's list of the top 40 hands \\"Based on Earning Power\\" on page 195 can also be quibbled with.  First of all he doesn't explain how he came up with the \\"earning power\\" of the hands.  I think we would all dearly love to know that!  I know of no authority including David Sklansky who has come out and explained how \\"earning power\\" might be reliably figured.<br /><br />In truth, there is no easy formula, as Sklansky explained many years ago in his ground-breaking Hold'em Poker (1976).  It is easy enough to figure or \\"Monte Carlo\\" which hands will win in a showdown against x number of players, and many people have done that.  But to suggest (as Warren does) that, for example, AQ unsuited (he calls it \\"mixed\\") has more earning power than 99 is not only debatable but suspect.  The same could be said even more strongly about his listing K8 suited before Q9 suited.  K8 suited is the sort of hand that can be played with confidence only when the ace of the your suit is on the board.  If you flop a king you have a horrible kicker, and if you flop an eight you don't have much of a pair and you have second kicker.  And you can't make a straight using your two cards.  Sklansky, for example has Q9 suited two whole groups above K8 suited.  I think Sklansky is right.  Warren must like kings since he has K7 suited above pocket sevens, which again is very wrong according to most authorities including Sklansky.<br /><br />I could continue to quibble with other bits of Warren's advice, but instead I want to zero in on a couple of things he says that reveal his limitations as a poker authority.  On page 67 he writes that \\"... [AK unsuited] is sometimes more valuable to me than a pair of Aces in the pocket.\\"  He \\"explains\\" (further up the page): \\"Let's say you win 100 total bets with each hand.  With AA you lose 40 bets to other hands for a net win of 60 bets.  With AKu...you win the same 100 bets as with AA but because you don't make anything on the flop you throw it away and you lose only 30 bets...for a net win of 70 bets.\\"<br /><br />This implies that AK unsuited is a stronger hand than AA, which is absurd.  Notice the fallacy in the assumption that both hands (\\"Let's say...\\") win 100 bets.  As nearly every hold'em player knows, AA wins many more bets that AK suited or unsuited.<br /><br />Most revealing, however is this from page 87: \\"Cards can and do run in cycles.  The theory of large numbers says so.  If you experience a period where [when] it seems like nothing but the low cards are winning the pots, then it is a perfectly legitimate strategy change to start playing low cards.\\"<br /><br />This is a variant on the hoary \\"gambler's fallacy,\\" in which it is imagined that somehow the cards (or the dice or the roulette wheel, etc.) or any independent event has a memory.  What the theory of large number says about independent events is that whatever happened in the past has no effect on the future--except where something is rigged or (e.g.) there is some kind of mechanical defect, like an unbalanced roulette wheel or loaded dice.  If you start playing low cards in hold'em all you will do is increase the probability that you will lose money.  Warren adds that playing low cardsfor a while would be good \\"so that you don't get a reputation as strictly a high card player.\\"  This is okay advice, but he adds that \\"The trick is knowing when the cycle ends and low cards should not be played anymore.\\"  Let me give that an exclamation mark!  That is like saying the trick is knowing when the run of black at roulette ends or knowing when to quit.  Ah, if ONLY we knew such things we would know the future!<br /><br />Bottom line: not for sophisticated players.for a while would be good \\"so that you don't get a reputation as strictly a high card player.\\"  This is okay advice, but he adds that \\"The trick is knowing when the cycle ends and low cards should not be played anymore.\\"  Let me give that an exclamation mark!

However--and really this is what is important--if you're new to online play, this is the book you want to peruse.  It's very basic, almost painfully so in some respects, as all \\"Dummies\\" books are; but whether you are a neophyte poker player or an expert, this book will give you everything you need to know to begin playing online.<br /><br />Notice I am not talking about reading the book from cover to cover.  As the authors say in their introduction: \\"Read any chapter at any point.  Feel free to skip around.\\"  They do a good job of giving the links and naming the sites--playing sites and sites associated with online poker.  They explain how you can deposit money and they alert the reader to some of the dangers of online play.  They even give advice on how to play.  However, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this might not be the best book to buy if you are interested in becoming a better player.  What advice they do give is generally good although not of world class quality.<br /><br />Here are a couple of examples that the causal player might want to skip:<br /><br />[First, there's their analysis of a hold'em hand they observed being played at the $3 & $6 level (p. 138).  I won't rehash the hand, but will observe that their conclusion that \\"Player 1 may have had A-K, or a large pocket pair, but dropped the hand when the other players clearly showed the board had paired\\" is faulty in several places.  One, of course, is that the board had not paired.  What they mean is that the bet, raise and re-raise action after the flop of 9s 10s Qd indicated that at least one of the players had a queen in hand and therefore had a pair.  The fact that Player 1, with 17 bets in the pot, giving him 17 to 2 odds on his money by calling the raise and reraise, did NOT call strongly suggests that he did not have AK, since if he had he would have had two overcards and a draw to the nut straight, which has something like a 40% chance of improving on the river to a hand that could very well win the pot.  It's hard to say what he had.  It looks like he misplayed his hand.  Furthermore, the authors don't give us the full story.  At the showdown they reveal that the winner had AQ and won with just a pair of queens and the top kicker.  They remark that the site folds the caller's cards because \\"the runner-up doesn't show.\\"  That's correct, but if you are in the hand and refer to the record of the hand that is sent to your computer on sites like PartyPoker, it will show all hands still in play at the showdown, and you could find out what the runner-up had.]<br /><br />[Another example is on page 190 in the box discussing 2-2 vs. A-K.  They say that it's a 50/50 proposition, but then contradict themselves by pointing out what most players know, namely that the deuces are a slight favorite head-up.  Then they muddy these waters by saying, \\"The true odds vary from 50.3 percent versus 49.7 percent in favor of the pocket deuces to 53.2 percent versus 46.8 percent for the deuces, depending on the suits involved.\\"  Note that this is quote, unquote.  It's a little unclear exactly what they are saying, but trust me the deuces are always the favorite.  Their point (apparently) is that if the deuces are in the same suit as the aces, then, should four of either of those suits fall on the board, the deuces will always lose, thereby lessening their small advantage.  However since one can never know until the hand is over just which suits the other player is holding, the proper way to figure the odds is to ignore the suits, since the distribution is not only unknown, but evens out over the long run.  Furthermore, they are relying on the calculator at Card Player's Internet site, which is a Monte Carlo simulation, not an actual calculation of the odds.  For most purposes, a simulation of a few thousand hands is sufficient.  However, the real odds can only be figured out mathematically, which nobody these days, it appears, bothers to do.  Well, I'm sure David Sklansky still figures his odds.]<br /><br />These quibbles aside, Harlan and Derossi's book is well worth the investment, especially if you are a total newbie.  They cover just about every aspect of the experience that a beginning online player would want to know about.  Here's an example of their guidance under the subheading \\"Grappling with the Psychological Basics\\" on page 70: \\"From a psychological point of view, the biggest differences between online play and the brick-and-mortar world include the radical increase in the speed of play and a heavy (mental) disassociation from the money you put in play.\\"<br /><br />The plain fact of the matter is that when the dollars seem like virtual dollars (although they are not) there can be a tenancy to bluff too much, to play too loosely, and perhaps to play at a higher game than one can afford.<br /><br />Another good (and very different) introductory book on cyberspace poker is John Vorhaus's Killer Poker Online, which I also recommend.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you really are a beginner at poker, I recommend you buy a computer game and practice with that for a while, and then--as the authors recommend--play at the \\"play money\\" games that the online poker sites offer before you risk any real money.purposes, a simulation of a few thousand hands is sufficient.

Here's an example of their guidance under the subheading \\"Grappling with the Psychological Basics\\" on page 70: \\"From a psychological point of view, the biggest differences between online play and the brick-and-mortar world include the radical increase in the speed of play and a heavy (mental) disassociation from the money you put in play.\\" <br /> <br />The plain fact of the matter is that when the dollars seem like virtual dollars (although they are not) there can be a tenancy to bluff too much, to play too loosely, and perhaps to play at a higher game than one can afford. <br /> <br />Another good (and very different) introductory book on cyberspace poker is John Vorhaus's Killer Poker Online, which I also recommend. <br /> <br />Incidentally, if you really are a beginner at poker, I recommend you buy a computer game and practice with that for a while, and then--as the authors recommend--play at the \\"play money\\" games that the online poker sites offer before you risk any real money.	2005-03-10

Often.  Remember if you're losing (and most online players are, to put it bluntly, losers, who, guess what, LOSE) the only person you can really blame is yourself.  What Vorhaus does is make objective the very subjective experience of self-analysis in relation to the game of poker and attendant psychology.<br /><br />Poker is a game that lives within the very heart of the rapacious human soul.  Because it is about money (and money is the electricity of the human enterprise) and because it is highly psychological, in that we ask not only what is the other person up to, but also what does the other person think WE are up to, poker is perhaps the quintessential human game.  Vorhaus in this book, in contrast to most books on poker, goes to the very heart of the personal psychology of poker.  After all people playing poker GET INVOLVED.  They sweat BB's and they go on TILT.  They rant at the screen and pepper their opponents with \\"trash talk\\" chat and other lies.  It's an emotional game.  A bad beat on the river in a huge pot can cause many an otherwise level-headed person to go bananas.  Vorhaus, who cut his teeth in the California casinos, in particular at the spacious Commerce Casino (\\"The King Of Clubs\\") just down the road from his residence in Monrovia, hands out tips, exhortations, and advice, makes observations--some of them rude and off the wall--and using his own very extensive experience, attempts to guide the average Internet poker junkie into his or her own mind to see why he or she is a guppy amongst the sharks, as the case may be.<br /><br />Vorhaus himself is obviously a very good poker player, but he is also a very good writer, and that is what makes this book interesting.  There's not a whole lot of strategy, and you won't learn much about which hand to play in which position, or how to play JT when A, K, rag flops or whether to check the nuts on the river.  You will learn, for example, about \\"feste verstellung\\" (German for \\"fixed idea\\").  What does this have to do with playing poker?  Well, many players believe all sorts of bizarro things about why they win or lose, and in believing them they lose track of reality and end up massively focused on such delusions as \\"the game is fixed,\\" \\"I'm playing against 'bots,\\" \\"the river always kills me,\\" etc., ad nauseam.  Vorhaus observes (and this is a splendid example of how well he writes): \\"The fixed idea...stands squarely between a person's perception and his outer reality, warping incoming information like a black hole bends gravity and light.\\" (p. 167)<br /><br />What Vorhaus insists upon is keeping records of both how your opponent's play and how you play yourself.  Say you run salty for a while at a game you usually beat.  You feel you have been unlucky, that you just haven't been holding any cards.  Normally in the brick and mortal world, barring a photographic memory, you can't really be certain what happened exactly.  Your feeling could be a fixed and erroneous idea.  It could be that you got outplayed, or that you fell into some bad habits like playing too many marginal hands or betting second pair into four players, etc.  But on the Internet you can actually go back and see exactly what cards you held and how you played them.  Vorhaus recommends that you do exactly that.  Good-bye subjectivity, hello science.<br /><br />Here's another example of Vorhaus's vivid style:  He's talking about Internet poker as a \\"time sink.\\"  You're waiting for your spouse to finish dressing, sitting \\"in the front hall impatiently tapping your shoe.\\"  \\"Not to worry,\\" writes Vorhaus.  \\"Internet poker is there to swallow up those few stray minutes and put them to entertaining use.  So stay at your computer until the tapping shoe is on the other foot!\\" (p. 223)<br /><br />So this book is more (and less) than an introduction to the online game.  For those strictly interested in a step-by-step, very basic introduction to Internet poker I recommend Winning at Internet Poker for Dummies by Mark Harlan and Chris Derossi.  For those interested in \\"Money Management,\\" \\"Mood Management,\\" \\"Mind\\" and \\"Data Management\\" (titles of some of Vorhaus's chapters) I recommend you not miss this excellent and eye-opening look at what it's like immersed in the virtual, but very real world of online poker.  It's a place where the players are all in alias, and the chips don't roll around the table, but flash electronically from seat to seat, while the cards fly through cyberspace like limbs in a kung-fu movie.roduction to Internet poker I recommend Winning at Internet Poker for Dummies by Mark Harlan and Chris Derossi.

Instead it is all reciprocity and enlightened self-interest.  This reminds me of when I was a sophomore in college.  We used to argue passionately about three things: the nature of women, whether the Pope believed in God, and whether it was possible to act otherwise than in one's own self-interest.  We concluded that women were an enigma wrapped in a mystery, etc.; that it wasn't clear whether the Pope believed in God or not; and that, barring mistakes, we always acted in our own self-interest. We further concluded that \\"altruism\\" was a word without real meaning, that the Pope was an amoral political animal, and that women were, regardless of their nature, VERY interesting.  But we were sophomores.  Matt Ridley is all grown up, and what interests him in this book is not so much the origin of virtue (although he does get heavily into that) but the restoration of the conservative agenda.  Alas.  He argues from biology (our nature) to what ought to be politically.  This is doubly \\"alas\\" because Ridley preaches mightily against this very delusion, calling it a \\"reverse naturalistic fallacy\\" (p. 257).<br /><br />David Ricardo and Adam Smith are brought into the fray, Hobbes and Machiavelli.  Ridley takes arguments from game theory and political science and the world of high finance to make his point that virtue as it is ordinarily understood does not exist.  He goes on to call for less government and more local autonomy, a return to a dream state of  \\"everything small and local\\" (p. 264).  As he does, Ridley comes dangerously close to taking on all the trappings of a right wing radio talk show host, spouting the virtues of Newt Gingrich and Margaret Thatcher on his way to becoming something like a high-toned Rush Limbaugh.<br /><br />Alas, how sharp was his rapier and how telling his prose when Ridley stuck to revealing our social and sexual hypocrisy as he did so delightfully in The Red Queen (1993); but how obvious are his prejudices when he steps into the political arena.  He actually argues that tried old irrelevancy of the embarrassed right wing, that even though Hitler was bad, very bad, he was better than Stalin.  Thus on page 258 we have (referring to the doctrine of acquired characteristics embraced by the Soviet state): \\"Unlike the genetic determinism of Hitler, Stalin's environmental variety went on to infect other peoples.\\"<br /><br />Ridley even argues that Hitler got his ideas from the communists.  \\"Hitler was merely carrying out a genocidal policy against `inferior', incurable or reactionary tribes that Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels had advocated...\\" (p. 253).  So caught up in his cause is Ridley that he begins to contradict himself and argue for the kind of  idyllic fantasy world that he condemns in Rousseauians.  Thus in his chapter entitled \\"The Power of Property\\" he waxes nostalgic for the \\"egalitarian\\" conservation systems of New Guinea fishermen and Maine lobster men before the interference of big government.  On page 262 he talks about \\"The collapse of community spirit in the last few decades, and the erosion of civic virtue...caused\\" by \\"the dead hand of the Leviathan.\\"  But on the very next page he declares, \\"I hold to no foggy nostalgia that the past was any better.  Most of the past was a time of authority, too...\\"<br /><br />Yes, Matt, it was.  The authority of the war lord, of the feudal lord, of a system of social, political and economic imprisonment so oppressive that the average person never got further than a few miles from the place of his birth and had little to no chance of rising above the economic and social station of his birth.  It was \\"small and local\\" with a vengeance.  The tyranny of the feudal lords in Europe and, e.g., the war lords in China is conveniently ignored in Ridley's political fantasy.  He claims that we have it better today only because of superior technology (p. 263)forgetting that our system of representative democracy in Republican form is also an improvement over the absolutism of the tribe.  The sad lesson here is, that even a man as adroitly talented and as intelligent as Matt Ridley becomes just another propagandist when he ventures into an area in which he is emotionally involved.<br /><br />Still there is a lot to enjoy in The Origins of Virtue.  His discussion of the prisoner's dilemma is the best I've read, although his analysis of the \\"wolf's dilemma\\" (p. 55) is faulty.  I won't go into it here, but \\"the tiny chance\\" that he refers to is overwhelmed by the fact that each player has only a five percent chance of  \\"winning\\" by pushing his button since he has to beat 19 others to the punch.  Consequently the best strategy is the obvious, don't push that button!  (But check this out for yourself.)<br /><br />His discussion of how the division of labor has enriched our world is interesting; his analysis of how we detect cheaters and how that is an instinctive human talent is persuasive; and his delineation of the nature of gift giving and receiving and how it relates to our innate sense of reciprocity is valuable as it shines light on the nature of  \\"virtue.\\"  In fact, his entire argument is eminently worth reading.  His glorification of trade (with which I agree) and his put down of ecologists (with which I disagree) is tolerable.  Most fun though--recalling the Matt Ridley of The Red Queen--is in all the sacred cows he slaughters along the way: the New World Indians (ouch!), Margaret Mead, the so-called \\"tragedy of the commons\\" theory, the Noble Savage, even poor Chief Seattle is revealed as a slave-owner whose public reputation is largely the product of a screenwriter's imagination.

He has the easy style of a confident journalist and the wide knowledge of an accomplished scholar.  He is learned without being stuffy.  He proves too that he is a master of analogy and metaphor, understanding that we learn through comparison.  I have the sense that he spent a fair amount of his free time looking for apt comparisons to illuminate the ideas of genetics for the general reader.  Some examples:<br /><br />On page 276 he describes the idea that there is a living thing with no DNA as \\"about as welcome in biology as Luther's principles in Rome.\\"<br /><br />Or on page 241 talking about apoptosis, in which our cells are programmed to commit suicide: \\"the body is a totalitarian place.\\"<br /><br />He even asserts on page 174 that we cannot hope to understand the process of embryotic development without \\"the handrail of analogy.\\"<br /><br />My favorite is this from pages 247-248 where he is talking about gene therapy and an engineered retrovirus that doesn't work: \\"it lands at random...and often fails to get switched on; and the body's immune system, primed by the crack troops of infectious disease, does not miss a clumsy, home-made retrovirus.\\"<br /><br />Add a sharp wit and an infectious enthusiasm for understanding human behavior and one can see the reasons for his success as an interpreter of the biological sciences.  In Genome, Ridley has found a structure and an approach that allows him to wax speculative and philosophical about matters of particular interest to him and to most people.  The result is that the reader is treated to a lively mind at work trying to understand ourselves and this world we live in.  He uses the 23 chapters, each emphasizing one aspect or our genetic makeup and each dedicated to one of our 23 pairs of chromosomes, to explore such matters as intelligence, instinct, the nature of disease, the effect of stress, the development of personality, memory, death and immortality, etc., and of course sex and--always an important question for Ridley--free will.<br /><br />Some highlights:<br /><br />The chapter on stress includes two startling assertions: One, that low status in the pecking order (instead of high cholesterol), lowers our resistence to microbes in our systems, and is the prime mover in making some of us more susceptible to heart attacks (p. 155); and two, that aggression is not caused by high testosterone levels but the other way around (p. 157).  On page 171 he makes a similar assertion, namely that serotonin levels (as found in monkeys) are the result of dominate behavior, not the other way around, as has always been thought.  These are exciting ideas since they suggest that we can improve our condition through our behavior (akin to \\"method acting,\\" I suppose).  Ridley's arguments strike me as convincing, but see for yourself.<br /><br />In Chapter 21, he gives us a brief history of eugenics, noting, by the way, that during its heyday the name \\"Eugene\\" became popular in England.  He spares eugenics practitioners and true believers not at all.  He rips them up in true (and uncharacteristic) PC style, and then gets to his point.  He likes eugenics but not the way it was practiced with the state coercing the individual.  Instead Ridley would like (quoting James Watson on page 299) \\"to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users\\" instead of governments.  He calls this \\"genetic screening\\" and cites the virtual elimination of cystic fibrosis from the Jewish population in the United States as a positive employment of screening from the private sector.<br /><br />In Chapter 22 he tackles free will, beginning with a joke about there being a gene for free will.  Clearly Ridley is in favor of free will, but reading between the lines one see that he knows he is on shaky scientific ground.  He quotes the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy on (David) \\"Hume's Fork:  Either our actions are determined, in which case we are not responsible for them, or they are the result of random events, in which case we are not responsible for them.\\"  Ridley believes it is better to imagine the we are guided in our actions by our genes than by our conditioning.  He sees nurture as being a more tyrannical dictator, if dictators we have, than our genes.  This is not surprising since politically speaking Ridley hates the collective.  He would love to have proof of the existence of free will since that is where his heart lies, but I hope that someday he will be comfortable with the understanding that whether we have free will or not (or whether \\"free will\\" is even a meaningful concept), one thing is clear: we have the ILLUSION of free will, and that illusion is all compelling.  Also, as Ridley notes, society must treat its members as having the ability to make free choices or the whole system of law collapses.<br /><br />Perhaps the most amazing feat of our genome is the one Ridley writes about in Chapter 12, that of \\"Self-Assembly.\\"  To me that is the really stupefying trick of our genes, to assemble themselves from the code.  The twists and turns of such an enormously complex undertaking is, to me, as remote from our understanding and experience as the many dimensions of super string theory.<br /><br />Other popular writers on science looking for the secret of Matt Ridley's success should note that he gives the reader value both in terms of knowledge and entertainment.  He works hard at meaningful communication.  He wants the reader above all to understand what he is saying.<br /><br />Even though I sometimes disagree with him, I always learn something new and interesting from reading his books.se we are not responsible for them, or they are the result of random events, in which case we are not responsible for them.\\"  Ridley believes it is better to imagine the we are guided in our actions by our genes than by our conditioning.

There's a lot of laugh-out-loud, self-deprecating/self-promoting verbal hijinks in this thoroughly enjoyable comedic romp through do-gooder land.  Queenan assures us that he is the kind of guy who would tear the wings off the backs of flies and feed them to his pet rat while keeping the juicier parts for himself, and laugh while he was doing it, the kind of miscreant that would mock Mother Teresa for dressing dowdy or Jesus Christ for having a bad temper or Ramakrishna for liking the boys a little too much.  In other words, the man's a moral degenerate.<br /><br />So what to do about it?  How about a complete moral make-over?  How about emulating the vapor-headed targets of his mean-spirted satire, bleeding-heart liberal mush heads like Susan Sarandon, Jimmy Carter and Paul Newman?  How about BECOMING that which he trashes?  How about actually committing \\"random acts of kindness and senseless acts of beauty\\" and writing a book about it?<br /><br />Oh my.  Sounds pollyannaish at best, downright pinko at worse.  Rush Limbaugh and the editors of various right-wing rags are sticking sweaty fingers under their necktied collars in clammy anticipation of such a sell-out.  Fear not.  Bottom line is there's a book contract to fulfill, and anyway the title assures us that Queenan sees the light long before he descends too far into that tunnel of delusion.  All philanthropy is, after all, just advertisements for oneself, demonstrating for the huddled masses that one has the wherewithal to afford such largess.  And all do-gooders are at heart just guilty consciences seeking cheap redemption.<br /><br />Joe starts with an inventory of his \\"personal vileness\\" and finds that over the past twelve years in various publications he has penned \\"47,678 nasty remarks...2,537 ad hominem attacks, 1,123 gratuitous asides, 342 cases of pure slander, and 564 examples of unconscionable cruelty\\" (p. 19).  Then he recalls \\"A Short History of Goodness, from Jesus Christ to Sting\\" in which he employs one of his primary comedic devices, the incongruous juxtaposition of the names of the holy and revered with the assorted targets of his discontent, e.g., Mahatma Gandhi with Ben & Jerry of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Desmond Tutu with Kim Basinger, and the cute commingling of Albert Schweitzer with Julia Roberts.  (He didn't actually make this last coupling, but I'll do it for him, since such a joining is entirely within the spirit of his intent.)  Then he throws out the toiletries manufactured by companies that use animals in experiments and buys himself some socially conscious Tom's of Maine toothpaste, etc.  Here he employs another of his very clever comedic devices, namely that of damning by exaggeration (a neat variation on the time-honored damning by faint praise), e.g., mentioning Ben & Jerry's opus, \\"Double-Dip\\" with the \\"Bhagavad Gita.\\"<br /><br />Then he regales us with tales of actually acting out random acts of kindness and senseless acts of beauty,  which he abbreviates as \\"RAKs\\" and \\"SABs.\\"  Particularly poignant was his search for a subway minstrel whom he would help by improving the poor man's faulty rendition of Schubert's \\"Ave Maria.\\"  His experience with the Harvard-educated Indian-American physicist who wanted Queenan to send him a pro bono copy of an obscure Elvis Costello CD is a tale almost too redeeming for the otherwise ironic tone of this book, and incidentally a tale all writers will particularly enjoy.  Additionally, because Queenan is a particularly splendid example of that very rare creature, a successful free-lance writer, all those who aspire to write for a living will benefit by reading between the lines here for tips on how to write magazine articles for fun and profit.  I would guess that Queenan's secret(aside from being a truly gifted wordsmith) is a consistently energetic self-promotion on all fronts.  Either that or buying Microsoft when the Dow was at 3700, as he reports, and then faking it.<br /><br />Queenan is also a master of the unexpected and ironic congruence.  A nice example is his giving \\"Krispy Kremes, shrink-wrapped\\" to a dissident in Washington D.C.'s Lafayette Square only to notice that the protester had not yet actually partaken of his heart-felt gift, occasioning Queenan to optimistically observe that \\"in the fullness of time he might see fit to open them.\\"<br /><br />I must admit I laughed out loud several, maybe even numerous, times while reading this very clever put-down of the icons of pop culture, and enjoyed it all thoroughly, especially the part where he sends Linda Tripp a care package of organic groceries.

But does one set out to write aphorisms, or do they just happen as a by-product of the writer's overall expression?  In the case of Shakespeare, surely the latter is the case.  On the other hand there is the example of Ambrose Bierce who as a journalist, beginning in 1877 deliberately composed aphorisms for inclusion in his The Devil's Dictionary (1911), first published in 1906 as The Cynic's Word Book.<br /><br />John King, aphorist, follows Bierce's example in this attractively presented collection of original apothegms, stating in the Preface that for more than a decade he sought to capture \\"observations from daily life\\" that struck him \\"as ironic, or otherwise noteworthy...\\"  The result is Captive Notions--a concise and apt title for a venture at once modest and a wee bit daring.  Adding to the agreeable publication is the clear and modest design of the book and the sensible organization of the sayings into various categories (\\"Character,\\" \\"Economics\\"...\\"The Law,\\" etc.) arranged alphabetically.<br /><br />But  I say \\"daring\\" because most collections of aphorisms have been culled from the works of the great--great writers, great poets, great (or infamous) politicians, philosophers, etc., ...Jesus, Marx, Woody Allen, Churchill, Emily Dickinson, the Buddha, and Lao Tzu, to name an eclectic few.  It would seem to take a brave person to presume to place a volume on the same shelf as the collected wit and wisdom (briefly expressed) of the world.<br /><br />Well, John King (and the charmingly named Little Philosophies Press) do presume, and the question is, how goes the venture?<br /><br />As both a connoisseur of epigrams and such, and as a sometime writer of them myself, and now as a venomous critic (ha!) I get to pass judgment.  In a word I can tell you he does a bang-up job.  (Well, two words.)  Some examples:<br /><br />\\"Any job is impossible if you're thorough enough.\\"<br /><br />\\"In life as in sports, no amount of talent makes up for being out of position.\\"<br /><br />\\"Honesty reveals our flaws, but tends to upstage them.\\"<br /><br />\\"The better one's decisions, the fewer required.\\"<br /><br />\\"Souls are more often sold for luxuries than for necessities.\\"<br /><br />\\"Business pays homage to the invisible hand while seeking to escape its grasp.\\"<br /><br />\\"Advantage compounds.\\"<br /><br />Of course not everything is so agreeable to our apprehension.  In particular I would note this discordant joke from page 51: \\"The inbred are full of themselves.\\"  And in some places King waxes more than a bit didactic, especially with the aphorisms directed at parents on pages 52 and 53.  Also in the chapter on economics, he even gets a little long-winded, as with this:<br /><br />\\"An American professional sports league is to its host cities like a fickle lady of high station, routinely keeping a handful of suitors in the wings in case one of the first-stringers fails to treat her and her retinue in the style to which they have become accustomed.\\"<br /><br />Nonetheless, he is right.<br /><br />There is an index and a brief bio.  I was very much impressed to learn that King is still playing full court basketball in his seventh decade.  I thought I was something by making it into my sixth.  Anybody who can still get up and down the court in his sixties (and creak out of bed the next morning) is a man well worth listening to.

Also in the chapter on economics, he even gets a little long-winded, as with this: <br /> <br />\\"An American professional sports league is to its host cities like a fickle lady of high station, routinely keeping a handful of suitors in the wings in case one of the first-stringers fails to treat her and her retinue in the style to which they have become accustomed.\\" <br /> <br />Nonetheless, he is right. <br /> <br />There is an index and a brief bio.  I was very much impressed to learn that King is still playing full court basketball in his seventh decade.  I thought I was something by making it into my sixth.  Anybody who can still get up and down the court in his sixties (and creak out of bed the next morning) is a man well worth listening to.  King's sayings are wise and pithy and reflect the judgment of a seasoned jurist, which King is.	2005-02-26

What he came up with is a wide-ranging collection of 25 articles on various aspects of sound--what it is, how we hear it, how it affects us, how it can be produced and altered, and how it can fool us.  Some of the articles are rigorously scientific and technical, while others really are anecdotal and personal.  Most significantly there is a wealth of information about the manipulation of sound, and there is some history of the development of our understanding of sound.<br /><br />Most of the material is aimed at people who have an intense interest in audio, and audio reproduction and development, and who already have some knowledge.  However this book also works well for a rank beginner (such as myself).  The articles are clear and well-presented with many black and white illustrations, tables, diagrams, and mathematical formulas, not to mention programming code!  There is a glossary and there is some overlap in the \\"anecdotes.\\"  For example, after a brief overview of the book, Greenebaum begins with an introductory-like article on what sound is and how we measure it.  This is followed by a more technical article by Hesham Fouad entitled \\"Understanding the Decibel.\\"  This in turn is followed by Greenebaum's essay on \\"Sound Propagation.\\"  His exploration of the physics involved is clear and easy to read.<br /><br />One of the many things that I discovered is that \\"When we speak on the telephone, a portion of our voice output is intentionally played back to us through the earpiece.\\"  Derek DiFilippo and Greenebaum explain in their article, \\"Perceivable Auditory Latencies\\" that \\"If we didn't have a clear sense of hearing ourselves speak, we would tend to talk louder and louder because we [would] assume that the listener on the other end...[wouldn't be able to] hear us either.\\" (pp. 74-75)<br /><br />I also learned (from Oscar-winning sound director Randy Thom in his article, \\"Designing a Movie for Sound\\") that the wise film maker should make his movie with sound in mind pre-production, not as something added on afterward.  As Thom points out, in the great cinematic experiences, \\"the visual and aural elements are working together so well that it is nearly impossible to distinguish them.\\" (p. 406)  He mentions the opening of Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) and the bird attack scene in Hitchcock's The Birds (1963), and the opening of David Fincher's Seven (1995) as examples.  And I can't help adding the striking opening sequence from Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (1973) as another preeminent example of how sound can be as important, or even more important, than visuals in making a scene a lasting experience.<br /><br />Included with the book is a CD that you can listen to with examples of sounds keyed to the discussions in the articles.  The effect of latency (\\"the time between human input to a system...and system output,\\" p. 65) and many other sound phenomena are demonstrated in the most effective way possible--by hearing them.<br /><br />Special mention might be made of writer Adrienne Ross's personal contribution, \\"Understanding Hearing Losses and Hearing Gains...,\\" which truly is an anecdote, beautifully written about her discovery of a hearing defect that she had lived with most of her life without realizing it.  The fact that she had compensated for the defect by using her other senses, dramatically demonstrates how our experience of sound is not isolated from our other sensual experiences.ener on the other end...[wouldn't be able to] hear us either.\\" (pp. 74-75)  <br /> <br />I also learned (from Oscar-winning sound director Randy Thom in his article, \\"Designing a Movie for Sound\\") that the wise film maker should make his movie with sound in mind pre-production, not as something added on afterward.

349000:US	49786731	R24PV6MP1EQCNW	0671042181	960077538	Everything Scrabble	Books	5	69	69	N	N	Don't leave home without it	This is the updated and revised edition from 2001, a make-over of the book from 1994.  This is a much better book than Edley's The Official Scrabble Puzzle Book from 1997.  There are puzzles here as well, but there is just so much more INFORMATION that I would put this book in another league.  No aspiring tournament player can afford to be innocent of the knowledge in Everything Scrabble.<br /><br />Of course authors Edley (three-time national Scrabble champion) and Williams (National Scrabble Association executive director) do NOT tell all.  I mean something has to be held in reserve, some tricks and traps and secret knowledge just in case they get the itch to play tournament Scrabble again.  In a way I am reminded of poker books rather than chess books.  Chess book authors can go ahead and tell all (except for their opening preparations!) because in chess it isn't so much what you know as to what depth and how fast you can calculate.  The authors here are more like poker players in that they tell you some of the tricks but they hold back the really esoteric stuff because in Scrabble, knowledge really is power, including knowledge of your opponent.<br /><br />Scrabble is a game that can be seen as intermediate between poker and chess as far as luck and skill go.  Unlike chess there is a clear element of chance involved in any given game--although not as much as in a comparable amount of poker playing.  And unlike poker there is a considerable element of calculation needed on any given move.  Tournament games run 25 minutes for each player, but there are situations that arise where you could spend half an hour on a play and still not exhaust the possibilities.<br /><br />Where Scrabble differs from the other two games is in the amount of pure, before-game knowledge needed to play a strong tournament game.  This book helps in that department.  For example you absolutely need to know all the 96 two-letter words by heart (pages 19 and 20 and again on page 324 for good measure).  And don't even think about playing without knowing a whole slew of Q-words, with and without the \\"u.\\"  But what really separates the tournament players from the amateurs is knowledge of a large number of esoteric and unusual Bingo words like (Lord help us) \\"areolae\\" or the ever-popular (NOT!) \\"zooecia.\\"  (From the lists in Appendix 4).<br /><br />The first part of the book is \\"Getting Better Quickly.\\"  This is for beginners and near beginners: using the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (essential, by the way, for settling disputes and normalizing play); shuffling the tiles in your rack to make words appear; using the twos; introduction to rack management, etc.<br /><br />Part 2 is called \\"Advanced Play\\" and gets deeper into rack management, what to leave for the next turn and what to play, when to exchange tiles; how to spot \\"phoneys\\"; and whether to open the game or keep it closed.<br /><br />Part 3 is devoted to puzzles.  Part 4 introduces the reader to the world of Scrabble tournaments and clubs (a nice feature) and Part 5 contains the appendices: word lists, history, trivia and some psychology.  There's even a glossary.  Very interesting is Chapter 22 with 28  \\"Examples of Outstanding Scrabble Game Play.\\"  Included (Example 27) is an eight-tile overlap play (two words side-by-side eight letters long so that each letter is a hook!).  Also included are some psychological plays that turned the game around or almost did.  Some insight into actual endgame play is featured.<br /><br />Some interesting facts: the highest scoring tournament game was the 1,108 points put up by Mark Landsberg (770) and Alan Stern (308) in Los Angeles in 1993.  (I just noticed that the numbers don't add up: so Stern's \\"308\\" is probably a typo and instead should be \\"338.\\") Landsberg's 770 points was also the highest single score in a tournament game.  In home games we used to play that you could recycle the blanks if you had the letter in your rack and it was your turn.  In those games scoring 700 points happened a time or two.  :-)  Top single tournament play was BRAZIERS for 311 points by T.A. Sanders in a Tyler, Texas tourney in 1997.  (I would like to see how that arose.  I presume a corner triple word score was left hanging with a word to hook the \\"s\\" to, while running the other way was a single letter at the side of the board allowing the eight-letter play to cover two triple word scores.  Obvious tip: never, but never (or only when you absolutely must) should you make a word that leaves a single letter tantalizingly out there along the triple letter score sides of the board.  Trust me on this one: that is gambling big time.  However, if you're a hundred points down, what the hey.  Maybe you can set YOURSELF up!<br /><br />What this book does NOT contain is any information on how to beat the infamous \\"Maven\\" from the computer Scrabble program.  If you crank that baby up to \\"Champion\\" (a 2100 rating), Maven simply uses her entire vocabulary and \\"Bingos!\\" like somebody's Aunt Hilda with twenty cards at the Friday night church fund-raiser.<br /><br />Okay, is this book worth the plastic?  Trust me, it is.  Get two, and give one as a present, but only after YOU have read it first!ur turn.

352555:US	49786731	R2ITFEXOLAPNOD	0198520964	996590645	The Pursuit of Perfection: Aspects of Biochemical Evolution	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Difficult but rewarding	One imagines that in the great expanse of time from the formation of the earth until before the first fossils appeared (something like a couple of billion years) a veritable riot of biochemistry took place as proto-cellular life searched for the most efficient and economic chemistry to run its replicators.  And as these replicators gathered other molecules to form amino acids and proteins, helped along by molecules serving as maidservant-like enzymes, their biochemical reactions became more and more efficient until self-sustaining cells featuring \\"organizational invariance\\" were well established.<br /><br />Cornish-Bowden calls this process \\"the pursuit of perfection.\\"  He asks the question, are metabolic pathways and the enzymes employed in living systems optimized, or is it the case that the evolutionary mechanism hit here and there on something that worked, and stayed with it?  In other words, are the ways that living cells use chemistry to run their systems Panglossian?  Is the chemical world inside the cell, in general, the best of all possible ways it could be?<br /><br />Cornish-Bowden, who is director of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Marseilles, France, argues that such is indeed the case.  (See his direct statement on page 14.)  His technique, relying to some extent upon the work of Spanish biochemist Enrique Melendez-Hevia (to whom this book is dedicated) is to postulate mathematically what an optimal metabolism might be and then to compare that to how the cell actually operates.  Cornish-Bowden points out that optimal metabolism in the cell is not necessarily the most efficient in the lab since the reactions within the cell are constrained by a complex environment that includes hundreds of other reactions taking place at the same time.<br /><br />Part of Cornish-Bowden's purpose is to demonstrate that, although enormously complex, biochemistry is not so complex as to require design by a supernatural being.  Indeed, he argues that biochemistry is the direct result of how matter and energy work, and that some calculations of how \\"unlikely\\" it is that amino acid sequences used by living systems could arise by chance, are exaggerated.  I think it would have been good if Cornish-Bowden had also emphasized that chance really has nothing to do with it, since many creationist and intelligent designer types still think evolution is postulated to proceed by chance.  It does not.  The majority view among scientists that I have read (and Cornish-Bowden is certainly among them) is that the biochemistry of life, however complex, is a direct result of the nature of matter and energy as they react in certain environments.  The exact manifestations of the evolutionary process are contingent (the word that Stephen Jay Gould preferred) on the unraveling through time and space.<br /><br />Another of Cornish-Bowden's purposes here is to present his ideas to a more general readership than biochemistry usually receives.  He takes care to make the text as readable and accessible to the general reader as possible.  In this, however, I think he is up against some nearly insurmountable difficulties.  The problem is that, however carefully the author presents complex arguments involving technical matters using specialized terminology, that author, however talented, will not reach a general readership because the reader will not have the time or the inclination to STUDY the arguments.  And, alas, many of Cornish-Bowden's arguments are highly technical and require study to fully appreciate.<br /><br />Furthermore it is almost impossible for a working scientist to write for a general readership within his area of expertise without being aware that other scientists in his field are looking over his shoulder.  Consequently, the scientist is careful to make the many qualifications necessary and to cite the exceptions--in other words, to be rigorous.  And rigor in science requires dotting i's and crossing t's in a manner that will often appear as Greek to the nonspecialist.<br /><br />For myself (your typical, limited, non-specialist) I took his detailed explanations at face value.  I turned the pages when the argument got too specialized, and ultimately I concerned myself with his conclusions.<br /><br />Here are some interesting ideas that I gleaned along the way, ideas that make this book definitely worthwhile:<br /><br />Most important perhaps is the idea that advances in understanding biochemical evolution are leading the way toward a more powerful understanding of how evolution works.  For example, it is the study of DNA, augmenting the sketchy fossil record, that has fixed modern human origins in Africa between fifty and a hundred thousand years ago.<br /><br />Another interesting idea that Cornish-Bowden emphasizes is that \\"the sort of perfect correlation [between prediction and result] that would delight a physicist should arouse suspicion in a biologist.\\" (p. 146)  In order words, biology is a bit messy and inexact in comparison to physics, and should a one-to-one correlation arise, it might be the case that the correlation is a tautology or a mathematical artifact.<br /><br />I also liked his very intriguing description of cancer as a \\"parasitic species that lives out its entire evolutionary history from speciation to extinction during a fraction of the lifespan of its host.\\" (p. 150)<br /><br />Important too is the distinction that Cornish-Bowden insists upon between \\"complicated\\" and \\"complex.\\"  Noting the property (from complexity theory) of \\"emergence,\\" he explains that a \\"system is complicated if it contains many components...,\\" but to be &lt;complex> \\"a system needs...in some sense to be more than the sum of its parts.\\" (p. 130)<br /><br />Finally, I liked the way he explained how bacteria find food, a kind of movement he calls \\"a biased random walk.\\"  In essence the bacteria moves onward if things are getting better, but when things are getting worse \\"it stops quickly and tumbles,\\" thereby randomly changing direction.

359267:US	49786731	R1X7SNDIV6J401	0679756973	941603910	An Anthropologist On Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales	Books	5	223	227	N	N	Extraordinary; a work of genius	These are true tales from a clinical neurologist's notebook, but this isn't just any neurologist.  Oliver Sacks, author of the justly celebrated, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986) and Awakenings (1973), which was later made into a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams, and other works, is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity.  He has a style that is both affecting and fascinating, yet studiously objective, a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations, historical comparisons and wisdom.  Part of the power of these tales, and of all of Sacks's work, is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality.  This makes for a compelling read.  If you've never read Sacks before, you are in for a very special treat.<br /><br />These tales are paradoxical because \\"Defects, disorders, diseases\\" can bring out \\"latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life, that might never be seen or even be imaginable, in their absence.\\"  It is this \\"'creative' potential, that forms the central theme of this book\\" (from Sacks's Preface, page xvi).<br /><br />The first tale, \\"The Case of the Colorblind Painter\\" is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty-five, and the effect this had on his life and work.  The second, \\"The Last Hippie\\" is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties.  Sacks tells this sad, pathetic story with vivid detail, and characteristically ends it with a footnote, a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears.  (Don't skip the footnotes!)<br /><br />The third tale, \\"A Surgeon's Life,\\" is an amazing account of a Canadian surgeon with Tourette's syndrome.  It is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination.  Dr. Carl Bennett, riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder, compulsions that cause him to throw things, to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner, to flail, jump and jerk about, nonetheless became a very successful (and beloved) doctor of surgery.  Sacks scrubs up with Dr. Bennett and goes into surgery with him, during which, miraculously, the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery.  Sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children, sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls, and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be.<br /><br />The fourth tale, \\"To See and Not See,\\" is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing.  This sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain.  This tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination.<br /><br />In the fifth tale, \\"The Landscape of His Dreams, we meet a gifted artist, Franco Magnani, who from memory alone recreates his home town of Pontito, Italy through his paintings.  He has a nearly photographic, three-dimensional memory, but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty-one, he cares only to re-create his Pontito, not the people or events, but the houses, the masonry, the stones, and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail.<br /><br />The chapter \\"Prodigies,\\" focuses on an autistic artist, Stephen Wiltshire, whom Sacks is determined to befriend and understand.  In this tale, and the concluding tale, \\"An Anthropologist on Mars,\\" Sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it (at least in my interpretation) as an alternate view of reality, a view with its own strengths and weaknesses, a world that is just as true and valid as the \\"normal\\" one.  Of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme, and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society.  Yet, perhaps that is society's loss.  I even got the sense, in reading these concluding stories about autism, that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary \\"strategy\\" trying to emerge, that is, a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work.  I would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic, with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration, are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness, and that humankind is the better for it.  Incidentally, the last tale about Temple Grandin, who is a professor of animal studies at Colorado State University, is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society, yet remains autistic.  She is the one who says she sometimes feels, because of her different perspective, like \\"an anthropologist on Mars\\" when she views \\"normal\\" people.  Sacks allows us to see why.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition, written with grace and a deep sense of humanity, not to be missed.n modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society.

360394:US	49786731	R1TFKLPFUOZAN0	157322653X	556394661	Breath Sweeps Mind (Tricycle Book)	Books	4	16	17	N	N	A good beginning	This collection of short essays drawn from larger works is about Buddhist meditative practice, and as such it stresses what Buddhists call \\"insight meditation.\\"  There is a wide range of authors presented here, from the Buddha himself via excerpts from various sutras, to thirteenth-century Zen Master Dogen, to Tenzin Gyatso (the Fourteenth Dalai Lama), to American teachers like Jack Kornfield and Charlotte Joko Beck.  The idea is to teach the beginning student how to meditate and to get that instruction from a variety of sources in the Buddhist world, Tibetan, Zen, Mahayana, and Hinayana.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts, \\"What Is Meditation?,\\" \\"Why Meditate?,\\" and \\"How to Meditate.\\"  In Buddhism one meditates primarily to gain insight into the human condition and to learn how to alleviate the dissatisfaction therein (The Four Noble Truths).  Therefore, meditation is a technique that leads to liberation.  Also, as Tibetan master Sogyal Rinpoche puts it on page 7: \\"It is a practice that at once transcends the dogma of religions and is the essence of religions.\\"<br /><br />I think the considerable value of this book lies mainly in Part III, \\"How to Meditate.\\"  What is presented by the various authorities is a meditative practice that stresses a singular focus on the breath.  It should be emphasized that, unlike yoga meditation, which I practice, one does not attempt to control the breath in any way in Buddhist meditation.  One simply and dispassionately observes its rise and fall, and realizes that the individual is just part of a larger, universal phenomenon.  In Buddhist meditation one becomes part of the process and aware of the illusionary nature of the individual ego.<br /><br />However I think it is somewhat disingenuous to leave out the fact that meditation leads to bliss and to that peaceful state of mind that passeth all understanding.  Buddhists however seldom point to this aspect of meditation since the goal is to go beyond the thrall of the pair of opposites, \\"beyond all attachment and aversion to this life\\" as the Buddha in the Anapanasati Sutta has it.  However, Zen Master Man-an lets slip this truth on page 152: (when one meditates) \\"Body and mind will spontaneously produce great joyfulness.\\"  In yoga this is called \\"bliss\\" (ananda).  It is interesting to note (and insightful) that in neither tradition--indeed in no tradition that I know of save the left-handed path of tantra--is the word \\"pleasure\\" used.<br /><br />One can get the pure essence of the Buddhist meditative practice by turning to the above-mentioned Anapanasati Sutta (or \\"The Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing\\") on page 144, and read and study the Buddha's words.  However it helps to have commentary and guidance from other practitioners, which is why this book contains them.  A fine example of this guidance can be found in the chapter \\"Taming a Wild Elephant\\" by the Venerable Sri Lankan, Henepola Gunaratana.<br /><br />Here we find an approach more in tune with what is taught in yoga with explanations on why certain techniques are used.  For example, Gunaratana explains why there is a singular focus on the breath.  In part it serves as a \\"reference point from which the mind wanders and is drawn back.  Distraction cannot be seen as distraction unless there is some central focus to be distracted from.\\" (p. 153)  He adds that because the breath can be slowed down or sped up by an act of will as well as left to itself, \\"there are lessons to be learned here on the nature of will and desire.\\" (p. 155)<br /><br />Gunaratana likens the process of learning to meditate to taming a wild elephant (from the Pali canon, which reminds me of the ox-herding allegory from Zen in which the ox is one's self that needs taming).

A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, and as the authors illustrate on page 24, a nanometer is about ten hydrogen atoms wide while a typical biological cell is thousands of nanometers wide.  It is useful to understand that nanotechnology is then about manipulating the very small irrespective of the technological field or science involved.<br /><br />This is an important point and one the Jack Uldrich and Deb Newberry emphasize throughout this breezy and readable introduction to how nanotechnology is going to change our lives over the next couple of decades.  Manipulating the very small, molecule by molecule, and even atom by atom, will prove enormously useful in a wide range of industries, from space exploration and the airline business to the modification of foods to the treatment and prevention of disease.  Consequently what this book is about is not only building ultra-turbo'ed computers and superslick surfaces for airplanes and submarines, but about genetically modified foods and stem cell research.<br /><br />This book just skims the surface of what is going on and gives the reader some idea about where the action is and what is likely to develop in the next few years.  Starting in 2003, they project what products and services are likely to be available today (Chapter Five: \\"2004 & 2005: Faster, Smaller, Cheaper, Better\\"); a few years from now (Chapter Six: \\"2006-2008: The Avalanche Begins\\"); a decade down the road (Chapter Seven: \\"Taking Control\\"); and on into the future (Chapter Eight: \\"2013 & Beyond: The World Becomes Smaller and Smarter\\").<br /><br />Their book-business spin is how these changes will affect YOUR business.  The watchword is \\"disruptive,\\" because a new nanoengineered product has the potential for putting present day businesses OUT of business.  Just as the internal combustion engine changed the landscape of America, and electricity transformed our world in ways that nobody at the time could reliably predict, the products and services made possible by the manipulation of the very, very small, will (very soon) change the way we live in ways we cannot fully predict--which suggests the question, Which are the horse and buggy businesses of today?<br /><br />Since this book is aimed at readers interested in the possible impact of the nanoworld on their businesses, the authors suggest how many advances will play out:  First, the military or the space program or a large corporation will develop at high cost the new technology.  Then, as the technology is seen to work, it will spread to \\"very high-end niches\\" such as in sports and recreation (yacht racing and mountain climbing, for example) where people are ready to pay a high price for just a little improvement.  From there the technology will be taken up by \\"high-end markets\\" (fancy cars, expensive cosmetics, etc.) and from there as the price continues to fall \\"to everyday products (e.g., kitchen appliances, bikes, and toys)...\\" and so on. (p. 166)<br /><br />Conservative people the world over are understandably upset at some of the prospects.  By manipulating individual biological cells and their attendant chemistry, we might be able to grow new limbs and organs for our bodies, possibly including a whole new YOU.  Food products will be modified to include imbedded vitamins and pesticides (this is already being done), but also medicines and even contraceptives.  We will be able to wear or have implanted in our bodies super-fast computers.  Indeed, it may happen that we will become the cyborgs of science fiction, making it hard to tell where our genetic biology ends and our enhanced body begins.  We may in fact cross over some unmarked threshold and become something other than human.<br /><br />While the authors are not looking this far ahead, it is interesting to note that Chapter Seven is subtitled \\"Taking Control.\\"  The irony here is that with identity tags (\\"nanosensors\\") imbedded in every product (and possibly into EVERYBODY) we ourselves will not be taking control.  Rather the technology will be taking control of us.  Remember that biological evolution on this once lifeless planet began with chemistry, and now the products of that chemistry (us) are reaching out to control the planet.  Might not our technology some day control us?<br /><br />Oh, Brave New World,/ That has such things in it!--to paraphrase Shakespeare (from The Tempest).<br /><br />In the final chapter the authors do address the ethical, philosophical and social aspects of nanotechnology-enabled advances in our lives and warn that many people will be against them (indeed many people already are against them).  It will not be a case of a technology taking off smoothly.  Whether the best technique or product wins out in the marketplace (as the Qwerty keyboard, VHS technology, and Microsoft showed us) may depend on how resistant people are to change, how intrenched one technology is, and how the politics play out.  The brave new world of nanotechnology will transform the planet, no question about that, but when and how is, as the authors advise, entirely unclear.<br /><br />Nonetheless the authors emphasize the positive aspects of the great changes to come.  They see nanotechnology giving us cheaper energy, solving our fresh water and pollution problems, enabling us to live longer and better lives, etc.  Personally I welcome the excitement and change to come, and I envy those younger than I who will see a lot more of it.tity tags (\\"nanosensors\\") imbedded in every product (and possibly into EVERYBODY) we ourselves will not be taking control.

368873:US	49786731	R34ZRVUFNXMAQH	0674069250	732155394	The Bhagavad Gita	Books	4	29	29	N	N	A secular rendering with a valuable interpretation	The value of this venerable edition of India's \\"Song of the Blessed Lord\\" lies primarily in the extensive, chapter-by-chapter interpretation of the Gita by the late Harvard University scholar and professor Franklin Edgerton that follows his translation.  His comments, written over sixty years ago for inclusion in the Harvard University Press's \\"Oriental Series\\"--a multi-volume attempt to bring the sacred and philosophic writings of the East to the West--cover 90 pages and amount to the best secular interpretation of the Gita that I have read.  His translation of the Gita itself however is far from the most agreeable since it is largely denotative and does not attempt to bring the poetry and the spirituality of the Gita to English speakers.  In the original publication of this book (as Volumes 38 and 39 in the above-mentioned \\"Oriental Series\\"), a poetic translation by Sir Edwin Arnold was included.  It is sadly absent from this volume.<br /><br />Furthermore, many of Edgerton's ideas about the religious value of the Gita will not sit well with Hindus.  Personally, I find his strictly profane and philosophic critique illuminating and a nice counterbalance to other interpretations.  For those new to the Gita I would recommend reading some other translation along with this one so as to simultaneously get the feel of the poetry and spirituality along with a literal translation.  I especially recommend these four:<br /><br />Bolle, Kees W.  Bhagavadgita, The: A New Translation (1979)<br />Easwaran, Eknath. Bhagavad Gita, The (1985; 2000)<br />Mitchell, Stephen. Bhagavad Gita: A New Translation (2000)<br />Nikhilananda, Swami.  Bhagavad Gita, The: Translated from the Sanskrit, with Notes, Comments, and Introduction by Swami Nikhilananda (1944; 6th printing 1979)<br /><br />(See my reviews at Amazon.)<br /><br />One thing that must be said to the reader about to embark upon a first-time reading of the Gita is simply this: Do NOT take the words in a literal sense.  Although Arjuna sits before a great field of battle as he examines his doubts about the value of proceeding and as he listens to Krishna urge him on, do not think that this is a work about \\"Krishna's Counsel in Time of War \\" as one academic has it.  What is in doubt is how to live one's life and what to think of, and how to face death.  This is what Krishna (as Arjuna's charioteer) is at pains to explain to the young \\"strong-armed slayer of the foe.\\"  Furthermore, it is good to realize that Krishna's argument, as beautiful and insightful as it is, is not a rationally coherent one in the Western sense of argument.  Instead Krishna considers various points of view and compares them as guides on how to live and how to die.  He presents four of the five traditional yogas: jnana yoga, karma yoga, bhakti yoga and raja yoga.  Tantric yoga, or the so-called \\"left-handed path,\\" is not presented in the Gita.<br /><br />(Note, by the way, that Edgerton is one of those old-fashioned translators who makes a point of not using the word \\"yoga.\\"  \\"Discipline\\" is used instead.  Thus instead of the \\"Yoga of Action\\" in Chapter III we have the \\"Discipline of Action.\\"  This bit of silliness is explained in part because when Edgerton wrote his translation the word \\"yoga\\" was still quite exotic and not very well understood by English-speaking readers.)<br /><br />Another thing to understand is that Krishna's central message of renunciation (seemingly ironic since he is advising Arjuna to fight) is not easily appreciated without some extensive study and practice.  A central idea, shared by Buddhists, is that we do not exist in the way we think we do, that we are not \\"alive\\" and conscious as the individuals that we think we are--and therefore we \\"do not die\\" and cannot be either slayer or slain.  This also takes some considerable study and insight to appreciate, especially for those of us brought up in the Western tradition influenced by the three great religions of the Middle East.<br /><br />Finally it is counterproductive to concern oneself with the apparent contradictions in Krishna's counsel.  As Edgerton explains (referring to the early Upanishads, upon which the Gita is based): Claims to \\"an absolute and complete truth about man and the universe...are to be understood as tentative, not final\\" and such claims may find contradiction in \\"an adjoining passage.\\"  Edgerton adds that this \\"trait of intellectual fluidity or tentativeness\\" is also found in the Gita. (p. 109)<br /><br />I would add that the expression in the Gita is primarily symbolic, as it is in all venerable religious works, and that one must read (and study!) between the lines to fully appreciate what is being said.<br /><br />One final point.  Edgerton asserts that the early Hindu thinkers \\"sought to control the most fundamental and universal powers by knowing them.\\"  He adds that the Sanskrit word \\"vidya\\" means both \\"knowledge\\" and \\"magic.\\"  Consequently there is the idea in the Gita that knowledge is indeed magic that allows the knower to overcome the infirmities of this world.  On a personal level I am convinced--at least for myself--that knowledge of who we really are does in fact conquer death, and it is literally true, as Krishna's says, that we do not die.ntradictions in Krishna's counsel.

371194:US	49786731	R2E4FLRN6AGNXI	1574888498	892390637	Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror	Books	5	10	19	N	N	Authoritative, obsessional, even brilliant at times	This book is primarily about Osama bin Laden, his psychology, his utterances, his demonic vision for jihad and what that means to the Western world, and especially to the United States.  Anonymous (actually CIA analyst Michael Scheuer) is obviously an expert on bin Laden.  I would even say that he is obsessively devoted to the study of bin Laden; but this is good since bin Laden is indeed a horrendous threat to the US; and furthermore it is good that somebody has the motivation, the ability and the desire to learn as much as possible about this Hitler of the Muslim world.<br /><br />The two most important points that Anonymous argues are (1) that to dismiss bin Laden as a madman or simply a crazed mass murderer is a mistake for which we will pay dearly; and (2) that a further attack against the US by Al Qaeda, probably involving weapons of mass destruction, is nearly inevitable.<br /><br />This latter assertion is revealed almost inadvertently in Chapter 5: \\"Bin Laden Views the World: Some Old, Some New, and a Twist.\\"  Our author advises us that bin Laden has prepared the Muslim world and its clerics for the horrendous loss of civilian lives to come in the US (while absolving himself of Islamic moral blame) by giving us the opportunity to embrace Islam and accept Allah as the one true God before Al Qaeda unleashes its attack.  Anonymous quotes bin Laden as saying: \\"I urge you [Americans] to seek the joy of life and the after life and to rid yourself of your dry, miserable, and spiritless materialistic existence.  I urge you to become Muslims...\\" (p. 154)  Bin Laden further lays the responsibility for his coming mass murder at the hands of the American people by saying that since America is a democracy, the crimes committed by its elected leaders are the responsibility of the people who elected them.  He urges us to elect leaders who will convert to Islam.<br /><br />The problem with this for Anonymous's main thesis (that bin Laden is not a madman but a brilliant military and political strategist) is that only a madman would seriously present such a proposition.  Anonymous himself realizes its absurdity and writes that bin Laden does not really expect us to comply.  His pronouncement is merely for the consumption of those Islamic clerics who may have scruples about killing innocent Americans.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with Anonymous's argument is that he claims that bin Laden would not be attacking the US if we were not on Islamic soil and had not done nasty things to Muslims.  We are on Islamic soil and we have done nasty things to Muslims; however just reading bin Laden reveals that he and his kind would wage war against the US and other \\"infidels\\" and \\"crusaders\\" merely because such people do not accept the Muslim religion.  Islam has always been a religion of conquest and intolerance.  Anonymous knows this perhaps better than I can even imagine, yet he seems to have gotten lost in the very thick foliage of his arguments so that he misses the larger picture (a huge forest) that screams out to us that for people like bin Laden there is only total conquest or death.  There is only his vision of God and what is right and what the true religion is--on the one hand--and godless evil on the other.<br /><br />What Anonymous makes clear (at least to me) is that bin Laden wants more than anything a religious war with the West, especially with the US, and will work to his dying day to bring that about.<br /><br />Some lesser points that Anonymous makes so very well:<br /><br />We are losing the \\"war\\" in Afghanistan and that will be obvious before long.  Indeed no one (but The Christian Scientist Monitor, Anonymous notes) really covers that on-going war anymore.  Anonymous believes that an Islamic regime in Kabul is inevitable regardless of what the US attempts to do. (p. 47 & p. 58)  Since Bush and the media have conspired to keep Afghanistan off the front pages and out of the nightly newscasts, I think our mole-ish author is entirely correct.<br /><br />We will lose the \\"peace\\" (how absurd that word sounds in context) in Iraq and be driven out of the country.  Anonymous is certainly on target here as of this writing since the Bush administration is calculating its \\"exit strategy\\" as even the most diehard neocons are beginning to realize what many of us knew long ago, namely that the cost in terms of lives and dollars to long occupy Iraq is more than the American people will tolerate.  It can even be said that it is not an exaggeration to call Iraq another Vietnam; it is an understatement.<br /><br />An interesting but somewhat minor point that Anonymous makes is that part of bin Laden's strategy is to weaken the US economy by making us pay enormous security costs (called \\"Aborting the American economy\\"--see page 102) .  I wonder about this, but clearly the way Bush is throwing money at the problem in such a scattered and uninformed way does give one pause.<br /><br />There is much, much more to react to and to appreciate in this most interesting book.  Anybody who wants to understand what is going on in the so-called war on terror needs to read this book.  It is one of the best I have read on the subject, notwithstanding the exaggerated admiration and respect that Anonymous seems to have for bin Laden.  Indeed, it is no wonder that Anonymous cannot use his real name since some of his nearly adoring statements about bin Laden would be intolerable to his superiors.  Of course, Anonymous believes that his admiration for bin Laden is like that of field commanders for the wily enemy commander.  I think he goes a bit beyond that, but you judge for yourself.sh author is entirely correct. <br /> <br />We will lose the \\"peace\\" (how absurd that word sounds in context) in Iraq and be driven out of the country.

Some of this book is about Osama bin Laden and the war on terror, and some of it is about Timothy McVeigh.  Vidal finds some similarity in their motives.  But this is not so much a defense of McVeigh (or bin Laden) as it is an \\"appreciation\\"--that is, an appreciation of their frustration with the (sometimes) violent behavior of the United States government.<br /><br />There are seven \\"chapters\\" (they are not numbered as such) amounting to seven essays by a past and present master of the form.  Some of the material appeared in Vanity Fair or The Nation, and some of it was--Vidal suggests--not published because of prior censorship (after 9/11) by the corporate-sponsored American media.<br /><br />Vidal argues (1) that McVeigh did not act alone; (2) he was not crazy or mentally deranged; and (3) what he did was at some level understandable.  With the same logic, one could say that what bin Laden and Al Qaeda did was understandable; indeed Vidal intimates as much.  He quotes McVeigh's psychiatrist as saying that McVeigh killed all those people in Oklahoma City partly in revenge for what the Janet Reno-led feds did at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, and partly \\"to make a political statement about the role of the federal government and protest the use of force against the citizens.\\" (p. 104)<br /><br />Consequently, from his summer villa in the south of Italy, the one-time enfant terrible of American letters sees McVeigh and his heinous crime as a consequence of what our government is doing to us.  He writes that \\"Since V-J Day 1945...we have been engaged in what the historian Charles A. Beard called 'perpetual war for perpetual peace.'\\"  He adds that \\"each month we are confronted by a new horrendous enemy at whom we must strike before he destroys us.\\"<br /><br />In support of this contention, Vidal lists all the military operations that America has been involved in since WWII beginning with the Berlin Airlift (1948-49) to the bombing of Kosovo in 1999.  It takes 20 pages to list them all.  They include the Korean War, the Vietnam War, operation \\"Desert Storm,\\" and the various \\"drug war\\" operations, and even some continental US operations with which I am not familiar.  He credits the Federation of American Scientists with compiling the list.<br /><br />It can be seen that this interpretation of American foreign and domestic policy is straight out of Orwell's 1984 in which Big Brother, in order to perpetually solidify his power and keep the citizenry in constant fear and distraction, maintained a state of constant war with a foreign enemy.  This psychology works well on the tribal mind that we all share.  We consciously and subconsciously feel that first comes defense of the nation (our tribe right or wrong!) against foreign enemies, and then, and only then, do we turn our attention to what our government is doing to us.  However, if the war is perpetual, then we never confront our leaders because to do so would be unpatriotic.  Vidal notes that only congresswoman Barbara Lee of California voted against giving President Bush additional powers to fight terrorism.<br /><br />This mass psychology seems so simple and so totalitarian that we cannot believe (1) that it fools anybody, and (2) that our democratically-elected government would dare to use such a tactic.  But Vidal is here to assure us that it's real, that the totalitarian state is in the making right before our very eyes.  The culprits are the masters of corporations who have acquired the ability to buy and keep all politicians so that they might do the corporate bidding.  Vidal notes that the present Bush administration is just the current instrument of this conspiracy (a somewhat unplanned, de facto and unconscious conspiracy, by the way) of socially conservative Christians, empire-dreaming neocons, and the corporate power structure.  He observes, \\"The Bush administration...[is] eerily inept in all but its principal task, which is to exempt the rich from taxes...\\" while it goes about its \\"relentless plundering of the Treasury...\\" (pp. 10-11)  I guess I should observe that this is in some sense \\"fortunate\\" since Bush's general incompetence will probably prevent him from being the first dictator of the United States--not that he doesn't otherwise have the Right Stuff.<br /><br />Okay, the real question here is, what if Vidal is right?  Are we headed the way of Imperial Rome, toward dictatorship and the inevitable decline and fall?  Will our children and grandchildren live in a country under heavy surveillance while their standard of living plummets because of the weighty burden of maintaining an empire from which we gain little tribute, an empire maintained at a frightful cost in dollars and lives lost?<br /><br />Personally I already see the decline of American power and influence.  Already, as the Euro rushes past us in value (drug dealers in Latin America are reported as now preferring the Euro to the greenback--will Japanese investors be next?) we can see our civilization crumbling with the potholes in the streets, the growing slums of our cities with the homeless at nearly every downtown corner, with a looted treasury, a frightfully weak dollar, and a soon-to-be worthless social security.  Who is watching the store?  It used to be said that when the democrats get into office they give it away, while the republicans steal it.  Now it would appear that there is little difference between one party and the other.  There is only the subversion of democracy by the power elite.

385591:US	49786731	R1Y2DN0WQYCZOZ	0198507925	778263295	Magic Universe: The Oxford Guide to Modern Science	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Amazing book	Almost all my free time during the past two weeks has been devoted to reading this extraordinary book.  I thought that I would read just a selection of the (119) essays (over 700 pages!) on the cutting edge of science, but after reading two or three I was so enthralled that I turned to the beginning and read all the way through.  Why?  Simply because this is easily the most readable and knowledge-packed book on science that I have ever read.<br /><br />The range of topics (organized alphabetically from \\"Alcohol\\" to \\"Volcanic Explosions\\") that science writer extraordinary Nigel Calder reports on is impressive, from the very small at the subatomic level to the very large at the edge of the universe, to the very old near the beginning of the Big Bang, to the very new as the genomes of species are being read.  The depth and breath of Calder's knowledge is extraordinary, but that's not the best part of this frankly amazing book.  What Calder does so very well is convey that knowledge in a way that makes science fascinating.<br /><br />He calls his essays \\"stories.\\"  He usually begins with a bit of atmosphere, letting us know where the research is being done and who the people are making the discoveries.  And then he may dip back into time and give us a brief historical precis.  After that Calder takes us right up to the very edge of discovery, and sometimes even beyond, as he tries to make sense of where the research is going and what effect it will have on our lives.  His prose is full of excitement and fascination, and yet he is no pie-in-the-sky enthusiast.  Indeed, as he says in the Introduction, he's wary of scientific hype and dogmatism, and aware \\"that thrilling discoveries can tiptoe in, almost unnoticed,\\" and so his tone is sober and largely objective.<br /><br />The result is no modest accomplishment.  Very few other people in the world could have written this book.  Perhaps no one else could have.  Calder's requisite knowledge comes from a lifetime of reading, editing and reporting on science in the press, in magazines and on television.  He negotiates a fine path between pleasing scientists and those who read about science.  He must be both accurate and intelligible--and, as far as I can tell, he is both to an amazing degree.<br /><br />Yet there is, as he allows, a certain subjectivity inevitable in such a momentous task--the task of guiding the educated reader to a knowledge of what is happening in a host of scientific disciplines.  The science must not only be reported on, but it must be interpreted; and, as anyone who has ever interpreted anything more difficult than the leaves at the bottom of a tea cup knows, the interpretative waters are murky and full of danger.<br /><br />Before I suggest a couple of places where Calder may have gone wrong--and believe me no one could write a book like this and not be wrong in at least a dozen places--let me say that I would not have--could not have--read this book unless I was enormously impressed with what I was reading.  One does not devote so many hours to one book--especially considering the reading schedule that I have--without the belief that the time is very well spent.<br /><br />I am not qualified to critique Calder's interpretation of what is likely to come from a bigger and faster supercollider, or whether epigenetic heredity can explain the rapid development of new species, or a hundred other ideas that Calder comments on.  Even those people at the horizon of a particular discipline cannot be sure.  But I very much like the fact that Calder sometimes takes a critical stance and sometimes dares to put his reputation on the line by evaluating the discoveries.  He has no chair at university to maintain, nor is he in the employ of any organization or government.  So he is free to say what he wants as long as it is intellectually responsible.  In fact, that is one of the most agreeable features of his writing.<br /><br />When he avers that \\"Evolution proceeds mainly asa result of changes in the control of pre-existing genes,\\" (p. 414) as he assumes a nongradualist view of evolution, one can agree or disagree, but be glad that he does indeed interpret the work being done.  However when he takes a tone that suggests, as he does several times in the book, that environmentalists are largely alarmists while reminding us that so far Malthus has been wrong, one must demur.  Or when he tells \\"conservationists\\" that \\"a sensible policy\\" (for reducing the killing of African animals for bushmeat) would be to \\"help... [indigenous people] find alternative sources of affordable protein,\\" one wonders why he misses the better advice of helping them to find better methods of birth control.  Artificially feeding a population that has grown too large for its larder is not going to solve the problem in the long run, and indeed is only going to extend the pain to generations to come.<br /><br />These quibbles aside, this is a book not to be missed, a delight, an adventure in reading, and easily one of those books that the scientific-minded person most certainly would like to have on that desert island.<br /><br />Let me close with an example of Calder's understated, dry wit.  He is talking about Homo erectus.  He writes, \\"Although this species then spread successfully across Eurasia, and was a skilled predator, it went on making the same old hand-axes for more than a million years--which suggests a certain lack of imagination.\\" (p. 411)<br /><br />One more.  Here he is being sly as he refers to \\"a vacuum at the heart of biology, which leaves the survival of the fittest as an empty tautology.

Most of it is derivative, especially from Svatmarama's Hatha Yoga Pradipika, yet it can be considered an archetypical work in two places, in the purification techniques in the first chapter and in the last chapter on samadhi.  However some of the rather bizarre purification techniques such as drawing water up into the colon are not to be recommended to the modern practitioner, at least not in the way Gheranda presents them.  Nonetheless the Gheranda Samhita is considered, along with the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Shiva Samhita, one of the three classic texts on hatha yoga.<br /><br />Some years ago I read a translation of this work published by the Kaivalyadhama Institute (Lonavla, India) in 1978 which included critical commentary by the editors, Swami Digambarji and M. L. Gharote, and upon which Mallinson has some acknowledged reliance.  What we have here is the text in Sanskrit followed by Mallinson's English translation.  The often cryptic text is augmented by photos of a buff and supple woman demonstrating the asanas and mudras.  Mallinson also provides an introduction setting the work historically and noting influences, such as the Vedantic.  He eschews commentary, he writes, because \\"commentary and elucidation are for the practitioner's guru.\\" (p. xvi)  Indeed the Gheranda Samhita is written in such a terse manner that a guru's elucidation would be required for all but the most experienced practitioners.<br /><br />Mallinson also notes that the Gheranda Samhita is a work of ghatastha yoga not hatha yoga.  \\"Ghatastha\\" refers to the body; and while hatha yoga is also concerned with the body there are important distinctions, most significantly the absence of the ethical considerations, the niyamas and the yamas as presented in Patanjali's eight-limbed yoga and as required by most modern teachers, including the illustrious B.K.S. Iyengar.  However the practice and the goal of both hatha yoga and the yoga presented in the Gheranda Samhita are the same: the union of the individual soul (atman) with the ineffable (brahman)--i.e., samadhi, or transcendence.  Instead of the niyamas and the yamas Gheranda begins with the purification techniques.  One gets the sense in reading these that the practitioners of India were plagued by parasites (as indeed they were).  Consequently it was a first order of business to get rid of them or at least reduce their numbers so that the yogi could practice without distraction or discomfort.<br /><br />But what is this concentration on the body all about?  To really appreciate hatha yoga (as opposed to karma yoga, bhakti yoga, jnana yoga, and tantra yoga--the other classical yogic ways to liberation) it is necessary to understand that the body is at once the mantra, the mandala and the palace to the hatha yogin, a fit vehicle for contemplation and study, although not quite right for worship.  It is at once the manifestation of the food sheath--the level on which we live, where we are both the eater and the eaten--and the holder of the soul, the atman which is to the ineffable brahman as a drop of water is to the ocean.<br /><br />But more than this the body must be in shape, free of disease and discomfort so that the aspirant might achieve meditation and samadhi and enter into the union with brahman.  Or perhaps it is enough to say that hatha yoga or ghatastha yoga leads to meditation.  Where one goes from there is usually understood as being beyond words (as in Zen Buddhism, for example).  Mircea Eliade writes in his Yoga: Immortality and Freedom (1958) that this concentration on the body (which is part of the tantric tradition and is the core of the Gheranda Samhita) is paradoxically \\"the most reliable and effective instrument at man's disposal for 'conquering death.'  And since liberation can be gained even in this life, the body must be preserved as long as possible, and in perfect condition,precisely as an aid to meditation.\\"  (opus cited, p. 227)<br /><br />Mallinson comments that Gheranda seems at times a follower of Shiva and at other times a devotee of Vishnu.  One sees in this the somewhat garbled and patchwork nature of this nonetheless important work.  It is my belief that the text we have to work with is a rather imperfect copy of a larger work that may or may not have existed in manuscript.<br /><br />Mallinson and the people at YogaVidya are to be commended for bringing this text to the attention of the modern yoga practitioner since all other translations that I know of are out of print and hard to come by.  I have one small complaint.  While it is traditional to use the word \\"secret\\" in such phrases as \\"The great Vatasara...\\" or this great dhauti\\" or (some other) practice \\"is to be kept secret,\\" it would be more nearly correct to write that the practice in question is \\"private.\\"  The practices are not secrets, per se, but things that should be done in private.  This is in tune with the idea that the hyperbole used by Gheranda or Svatmarama such as \\"destroys all diseases\\" or \\"allows the yogi to escape death\\" could more realistically be qualified with the phrase \\"while the practice is maintained.\\"<br /><br />One other quibble: in the 22nd verse Mallinson has, \\"Standing in water up to the navel, draw out the shakti nadi...,\\" wash it and \\"put it back in the stomach.\\"  Actually, I believe what is supposed to be drawn out and washed is the intestine.  \\"Shakti nadi\\" is a euphemism and so is \\"stomach.\\"  On the other hand, I suspect that even the most accomplished practitioner of old never actually achieved the practice (or long survived it!), so perhaps Mallinson's expression is as correct as is necessary for this largely symbolic practice.dition, precisely as an aid to meditation.\\"  (opus cited, p. 227) <br /> <br />Mallinson comments that Gheranda seems at times a follower of Shiva and at other times a devotee of Vishnu.

403007:US	49786731	RSQ0GFCLQZRJ1	0394536487	113206874	The Spooky Art: Some Thoughts on Writing	Books	5	17	19	N	N	The horse's mouth	It has been many years since I have read Norman Mailer.  He made a sensational literary debut with the publication of his World War II novel, The Naked and the Dead in 1948.  Since then he has been among the most celebrated writers, and by his own estimation one of America's greatest novelists, although I believe he still realizes that he has yet to fulfill his life-long ambition to write the so-called Great American Novel.  (Actually I think Nathaniel Hawthorne and Mark Twain preceded his efforts here with respectively, The Scarlet Letter and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.)<br /><br />This is not the first time Mailer has written on the art of writing.  During a period beginning after the publication of his third novel, The Deer Park in 1954 until he returned to the form in 1965 with An American Dream, Mailer wrote nonfiction almost exclusively, and in my opinion became a literary star because of the transition.  I recall his first book-length nonfiction venture, Advertisements for Myself (1959), in which in addition to shamelessly tooting his own horn, Mailer also gave advice on how to write effectively, and of course on how to be a literary lion.  I thought at the time it was his best work.  In a sense he is like others of his time--Gore Vidal comes to mind--literary men who made the transition from novelists (a dying male breed because of a dying male readership) to interpreters and critics of the mass culture even while remaining true to their first love.<br /><br />Mailer followed up his successes with dozens of books, including more novels along with the various nonfiction works about people (Marilyn Monroe, Picasso, Lee Harvey Oswald, etc.), things and events (Of a Fire on the Moon; The Executioner's Song), especially political events, Miami and the Siege of Chicago; The Armies of the Night, etc.  As always his work is characterized by a terrific energy and an obsessive devotion to Words on Paper.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that he only felt really comfortable with himself as a writer when he had written 10,000 words that day.  I can tell you from personal experience it is very difficult to write ten thousand words in one day; but the really hard part is to do it on consecutive days or indeed to keep up with anything close to that production for any length of time. Yet, for the real writer who cannot help but write--and Mailer was and is such a writer--the meditative euphoria that comes with being lost in one's work so completely is wonderful and quite addictive.<br /><br />Here Mailer writes about writing of course, concerning himself with things like writer's block, and how to build character and whether to use the first person or the third, or how to use real people in your fiction.  He gives tips to young writers, as a writer in his eighties might, and certainly he is a writer to be listened to.  He advises on how to use your subconscious in writing.  He notes that if you declare that you are going to be at your desk the next morning to write, your subconscious will take note and help you out by preparing in advance.  If however you should \\"wake up in the morning with a hangover and cannot get to literary work, your unconscious, after a few such failures to appear, will withdraw.\\" (p. 142)<br /><br />The two-fisted machismo for which the short of stature Mailer became famous (or infamous) comes out in places in this work (e.g., he likes to compare writing with being an athlete and on page 104 he even talks of keeping in shape).  Thoughts on his lifelong preoccupation with sex, narcissism, masturbation and such also appear.  There is a chapter on film, one of Mailer's many intense interests.<br /><br />But there is sound advice on The Literary Career and what he calls the \\"Lit Biz.\\" (Of course some of this is pass&eacute;, since the literary world has changed quite a bit since he had to worry about such things.)  There is his reaction to sudden fame after the publication of The Naked and the Dead, which he reminds us was \\"number one on the best-seller list for several months.\\" (p. 115)  In fact, this is such a terrific book on the writer's life and craft (he doesn't especially like the word \\"craft\\") that I sorely wish it had been available when I was a young man.  Make no mistake about it.  What Norman Mailer doesn't know about writing and making a success of writing is probably not much.  But of course his success came mainly through hard work and an almost maniacal belief in himself over many decades and through many trials and tribulations, some of them of his own making.<br /><br />This book is also about life in the twentieth century by a man who lived it full speed ahead, and about other writers and other celebrities he has known or read.  In the final analysis, this is a personal book by a man given to writing personal books, a book by a man who is among our finest writers, and a book--like almost all of his work--to inform, to entertain, and to admire.which he reminds us was \\"number one on the best-seller list for several months.\\" (p. 115)  In fact, this is such a terrific book on the writer's life and craft (he doesn't especially like the word \\"craft\\") that I sorely wish it had been available when I was a young man.

Their prose is direct, clear and hard-hitting, and their book is a devastating indictment of the Bush administration's environmental polices.<br /><br />Exhibit #1 is the big lie.  As Pope and Rauber put it, the Bush administration's strategy is to \\"Say one thing, do another\\" and \\"Never admit what you're up to.  Rather, assert the opposite repeatedly and despite all available evidence.\\" (p. 24)  The interesting thing about this is, what could be more authoritarian and anti-democratic?<br /><br />Bush's so-called \\"Clear Skies\\" proposal, which is aimed at circumventing the Clean Air Act, is an excellent example of the big lie and of the Orwellian doublethink employed by Bush's people.  The authors quote Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords as saying, \\"The President says one thing, but does another...With a straight face he talks about protecting resources for our children--even as he abandons the federal protection of land and air and water as fast as he can.  Does he think we don't notice?\\" (p. 78)<br /><br />Actually we don't, most of us anyway.  It very hard for most people to believe that the President can call for \\"Clear Skies\\" and \\"Healthy Forests\\" while deliberately fostering the opposite.  Yet, that is exactly what Bush does as this book so clearly and overwhelming demonstrates.  The question might be why?  Don't the people in the Bush administration love their children too?<br /><br />Strange as it may seem the faith-based logic of the administration has Higher goals.  It believes first that it is essential to reduce the size and effectiveness of government.  Bush wants to make government less popular by making it less effective (see Chapter 13).  But more than this is an underlining rationale that simultaneously desires a return to a social Darwinian ethos while believing that the Second Coming will make all of this irrelevant anyway.  Reagan's Secretary of the Interior James Watt, who would fit nicely into the Bush administration except for his candid expression, put it like this when asked if it might not be wise to save something for future generations: \\"I don't know how many future generations we can count on until the Lord returns.\\" (p. 25)<br /><br />Meanwhile, no more \\"nanny state.\\"  Let's bring back the \\"social Darwinian notion of the struggle for existence as 'red in tooth and claw.'\\" Only \\"this time...the predators\\" will be \\"ruthless corporations, not carnivores.\\"  Let's \\"Stop coddling the public.  Only wimps and trial lawyers worry about parts per million.\\" (p. 23)  Indeed, there is the idea that winning is its own justification, even if you cheat to win, and the devil take the hindmost.<br /><br />Consequently it is not greed alone that is powering the Bush pollution machine.  It is instead a kind of spiritual arrogance that allows the employment of a deliberate strategy of ignorance, as the authors see it, a strategy that allows Bush to reward polluters and others who desecrate America, without qualm, all in the name of a new sort of laissez faire mentality combined with a belief that this earth, this country and our lives are just stopping places on the way to the coming rapture.  With this kind of mentality it doesn't matter what science says.  The studies are really irrelevant.  Junk science is as good as real science; indeed, the only science that matters is the science that agrees with the polluters.<br /><br />Pope and Rauber detail in sharp focus how the Bush administration has perverted the scientific method and in effect substituted false rhetoric and lies for scientific experiment.  But it is not enough to allow the contamination of our country by big corporations.  It is also necessary that laws be passed that protect those corporations from being sued by people who may be harmed by their pollution.  Therefore it is a top priority this year for the White House to see that laws arepassed limiting the ability of citizens to sue those who pollute or otherwise harm them.<br /><br />In addition to the indictment, the authors present a way to reclaim America's future as outlined in Chapter 15.  Clearly at the top of the list of how to save America is to ENFORCE the Clean Air Act!  The authors also want the Superfund tax restored so that polluters will have to pay for their own clean-ups instead of putting the burden on taxpayers.  This is included in the \\"Ten Commonsense Solutions for the Next Twenty Years\\" that they present beginning on page 228.<br /><br />To the commonsense solutions I would offer this: we need more journalists trained in environmental concerns and publishers who are not afraid to actually report what the administration is doing.  If a wider public actually knew the extent of the despoiling of America being undertaken by George W. and friends, they would cry out long and loud and maybe something could be done about it.  The authors offer, in an appalling Appendix beginning on page 241, a list of what Bush has done to the environment since taking office in 2001.<br /><br />Messrs. Pope and Rauber are to be commended for their work in trying to counteract the horrors committed by the Bush administration, and Sierra Club Books and the University of California Press are to complimented on helping to produce such an outstanding and extremely important book.<br /><br />And yes, rivers should NOT catch fire, nor should those who drop their waste on the rest of us get away with it.o pollute or otherwise harm them.

407384:US	49786731	R1F75GBGC3X4XH	1560255854	717894827	Imperial America: Reflections on the United States of Amnesia (Nation Books)	Books	4	23	26	N	N	Some old essays, some new, but all pure Gore	One wonders what Gore Vidal is up to in this modest collection of (mostly) previously published essays.  But one sees after some reading that Vidal's point is, he said it first!  America is an imperial power and has been (according to Vidal's calculation) since 1898.<br /><br />I don't blame Gore for making sure that all this bandying about \\"the American Empire\\" that has arisen since George W. and the neo-cons took over the country is old news, already keenly seen by himself decades ago.  Certainly the twice- and thrice-published essays presented here are proof that as usual Gore Vidal is one prescient political observer, not to mention that he is one very fine essayist.  Note well the subtitle of this book: \\"Reflections on the United States of Amnesia.\\"  Gore is here to tell us that yes we have forgotten our history, and yes what will follow is predictable.  Did not Rome go from a republic to a dictatorship with a fabulous empire to so much dust in the wind?  (Of course it took a while, so what's to worry?)<br /><br />The first two essays, \\"State of the Union: 2004\\" and \\"The Privatizing of the American Election\\" are new.  In the first, Vidal continues his practice of imagining that he is the head of a shadow government by presenting his own \\"state of the union\\" address.  As usual he finds that not all is well in the heartland and something definitely stinks to high heaven somewhere inside the Beltway, and not just in the Oval Office itself.  In the second, he chimes in on the shiny new  observation being heard from an increasing number of pundits (myself included) that the new (and very old) strategy in American politics is to STEAL THE ELECTION.  He notes that Republican-appointed jurists decided the 2000 election in favor of--believe it or believe it not!--the Republican candidate.  Furthermore, Vidal hints darkly that all those shiny new voting machines have the capacity to decide elections in non-democratic ways (i.e., by the programmer's algorithmic sly of hand).<br /><br />The last essay, \\"Interim Report: Election 2004\\" is also new, although it is not, measured by the usual Vidalian standard, all that great an essay.  It is perfunctory due mostly to the fact that it was written earlier in the year before even most of the primaries had been held.  In other words, this book itself is a bit premature.  Perhaps Gore should have waited until after the election to write about the election!<br /><br />Ah, but such is the thrall in which Gore Vidal holds literate America, that even recycled and perfunctory essays by arguably our leading political essayist, are so eagerly anticipated that, like new cars rolling off the assembly line, they are served up ahead of time to quench the craving.<br /><br />Still \\"Interim Report...\\" is a fun essay in that Gore calls for the impeachment of George W. for lying to Congress and the nation.  He cites six lies.  For a more nearly complete indictment of the mendacious president see Alterman, Eric and Mark Green. The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)Leads America (2004) or Corn, David. The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception (2003).<br /><br />Well, is this book worth buying?  If you are not familiar with the political essays of Gore Vidal, I would definitely say yes.  These eleven essays include some of his best, notably \\"The State of the Union: 1980\\" which appeared in the August, 1980 edition of Esquire magazine, and \\"Armageddon\\" which appeared in both The Nation and The (London) Observer in 1987.  What is particularly interesting about \\"Armageddon\\" is that what he says about the rapture-intoxicated Reaganites and the fuzzy faith-based thinking of their leader applies even more so to the present occupant of the White House.<br /><br />For those already familiar with the sharp wit and uncompromising expression of Gore Vidal, I would point out that seven of the eleven essays previously appeared in his biggest and best collection of essays, United States Essays, 1952-1992, a book I highly recommend.  I think Vidal, more than almost anyone else I have read understands how the American political system really works.  There are others who understand it equally well of course, but those people, like, e.g., Henry Kissinger, Richard Nixon, and the senior George Bush, etc., were too much involved as players to ever write candidly about a system in which they have swum about like predatory fish.  One of the nice things about Vidal is that he is not beholden to a political past (he failed as an office seeker), nor is he an instrument of the system itself.  So he can be candid and say unpopular and disagreeable things.  And, as anyone who has ever read him knows, he absolutely loves to rock the political boat even if we are navigating through excrement-filled waters.  Here he is on a familiar theme, the (less than a) dime's difference between the political parties and who really runs the country:<br /><br />\\"...[W]hat has evolved over the years are two pieces of electoral machinery devoted to the acquiring of office--and money.  Since neither party represents anything but the interests of those who own and administer the country, there is not apt to be much 'choice' in any election.\\" (p. 126)<br /><br />This central truth about the way our system operates is lost on most voters.  One suspects however that among the nearly fifty percent of the electorate that doesn't bother to vote in most elections, there are a few who know why they don't bother.  And certainly Gore knows and is pleased to tell us.almost anyone else I have read understands how the American political system really works.

And certainly Gore knows and is pleased to tell us.	2004-12-30

Is this just heredity or good luck, or is there something we can do to keep our mind and memory from going the way of Alzheimer's?  Dr. Khalsa thinks so.  In fact he presents quite a program for rejuvenation.  The question is, does he have the goods in this book to help YOU?<br /><br />To be honest, I don't know, but I read the entire 454 pages with interest and mostly approval.  Not being a brain scientist myself, nor a doctor of medicine, I can only offer a layman's reaction.  Generally speaking, Khalsa sees the brain as another organ in the body that can benefit in the same way that the rest of the body can benefit.  He offers the exciting prospect (along with some evidence) that even old people can grow new dendrites, in effect increasing their brain power.  Especially interesting to me were his memory tests (that you can take yourself) to determine whether it is likely you are on your way to Alzheimer's or dementia, or just having a bad day.<br /><br />There are four elements of his \\"brain longevity program\\": exercise, nutritional therapy, stress management, and pharmacology.<br /><br />Exercise increases blood flow to the brain that in turn increases nourishment to the brain and allows for better removal of waste products.  Khalsa believes that exercise also increases the supply of the \\"nerve growth factor\\" (NGF) hormone to the brain while enhancing neuronal metabolism. (p. 324)  He reports that brain cells may die because they do not receive enough NGF.  Certainly if one follows a sedentary lifestyle it would not be surprising to learn that with reduced blood flow, the brain becomes undernourished.  So exercise--YES!<br /><br />Okay, what about \\"nutritional therapy\\"?  Yes, that's the usual program of cut out the animal fats, eat less in general and eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Good for the body, good for the brain.  He also recommends nutritional supplements like ginkgo biloba and ginseng.  He is concerned about free radicals in the blood which he believes contribute to the ageing process, and shows us how to reduce their number.  Obviously, being overweight is a health risk, but Khalsa believes that being overweight also impairs cerebral circulation and creates millions of free radicals which can damage cells everywhere in the body including in the brain.<br /><br />What really hit me was the importance of \\"stress management.\\"  Khalsa believes that excessive and chronic production of cortisol (which the adrenal glands secret in reaction to danger and other stresses) is \\"so toxic to the brain that it kills and injures brain cells by the billions.\\" (p. 8)<br /><br />And then there's pharmacology.  Khalsa likes to go natural first, but when the situation is acute, he is not opposed to prescribing medicine.  He especially likes deprenyl which he calls \\"the memory drug.\\"  He has a lot to say about neurotransmitters and their function and how they break down.  He sees a connection between depression and subpar brain function, and believes that curing depression can rejuvenate the brain by itself.  He recommends DHEA for some of his patients who have low levels of that precursor hormone in their systems.  Indeed, he notes that hormonal deficiencies can figure prominently in memory and cognitive loss.<br /><br />What sets this book apart from others I have read on the subject of health and well-being is the completely holistic approach taken by Dr. Khalsa.  He is both a medical doctor trained in Western medicine and an alternative physician trained in the ancient ways of the East.  He acknowledges the lack of experimental proof for some Eastern practices and medicines, but still believes they can be effective even if we are not sure how they work.  After all, what has worked for millions of people for thousands of years must have something going for it.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts.  First there is the story of his discovery of the brain longevity program.  Then there is Part Two on \\"How the Brain Works,\\" followed by Part Three, \\"Designing Your Own Brain Longevity Program.\\"  I can tell you that, skeptic that I am, I am nonetheless already at work on following Khalsa's guidance, and I am altering my lifestyle to incorporate parts of his program.  One thing is clear to me: his program can't hurt, and there is a fine chance that it will do a lot of good.<br /><br />But you judge for yourself.  Even if you don't follow any of the program you will benefit from reading this excellent book because it includes so much information about health.  Additionally, there is a lot of sound psychology and even some spiritual insight that Khalsa provides.  Here are a couple of nuggets, the first is what one might expect, and the second an example of Khalsa's wide-ranging knowledge base:<br /><br />\\"One quick word about the so-called Recommended Daily Allowances: NONSENSE!  I believe they're just too low.  These daily allowances, until recently, were called Minimum Daily Requirements.\\"  (p. 243)<br /><br />\\"Visual sensory memory, called iconic memory, is employed by circus knife-throwers as they try to convince their audiences that they're actually throwing knives.  In fact...the knives they 'throw'--which barely miss the person strapped to the target--are actually punched through the target from behind.  However, when the audience watches a knife 'leave' the thrower's hand, they swivel their heads toward the target...In reality, all they see is the iconic afterimage of the knife.\\" (p. 138)<br /><br />I didn't know that, and there's a lot else I didn't know about how our brains work and don't work until I read this book.

427799:US	49786731	R2MT10H2FIBWEC	0618013245	839611881	The Economics of Innocent Fraud: Truth For Our Time	Books	5	78	80	N	N	Some of this is not so innocent	This book is a 62-page essay on fraudulent aspects of the current economic and political reality in the United States as seen by an illustrious economist and one of the most influential men of our time.  Noteworthy is the fact that John Kenneth Galbraith was 95-years old when he wrote this a year ago.  Judging from the wisdom and clarity of his expression, I can only say (to recall a line from a Meg Ryan movie, if you will): \\"I'll have what he's having.\\"<br /><br />I identified ten \\"frauds\\" as I was reading, but I think I may have missed one or two.  Before I list them and comment, let me quote the last line in the book because I think it is important: \\"War remains the decisive failure.\\"<br /><br />Why Galbraith chose the word \\"decisive\\" is something of a puzzle.  Decisive for what or for whom?  Is he implying some sort of \\"decision\\" as regards humankind?  Does he think we are going the way of the dodos?  For myself it is clear that unless the war system is ended, most human beings will never progress beyond a tribal mentality, and will continue to suffer what Galbraith calls \\"death and random cruelty, [and the] suspension of civilized values...\\" (p. 62)<br /><br />The \\"innocent\\" frauds that Galbraith calls to our attention are actually not all that innocent.  What he means by \\"innocent\\" is that for the perpetrators, there is \\"no sense of guilt or responsibility\\" as though the fraudulent were children.  Indeed from the perspective of Professor Galbraith's extensive experience and learning, many of the people who run our economies and our political systems are children.  At any rate, there is a somewhat lofty and even grandfatherly tone to this treatise.<br /><br />The first \\"fraud\\" is the use of the euphemistic \\"market economy\\" instead of the slightly stained \\"capitalism\\" to describe the present economic system.  (By the way, Galbraith does not number his frauds.  I do it for the sake of keeping them straight in my mind.)<br /><br />The second is the fact that in the modern corporation, ownership--that is, the stockholders--have little to no authority while the professional managers call all the shots including setting their own compensation (fraud #7).  Galbraith attributes this to the fact that corporations have become so vast and complex that the relatively unsophisticated ownership cannot really understand how to run the enterprise and so must yield to management.<br /><br />Fraud number three is one that interests me a lot.  Galbraith writes, \\"Reference to the market system as a benign alternative to capitalism is a bland, meaningless disguise of the deeper corporate reality--of producer power extending to influence over, even control of, consumer demand.\\" (p. 7)  This really is one of the most pressing problems of our time because the corporate power, through its ability to influence and control its legions of employees and the media, also has \\"influence over, even control of\\" who runs for office and who is elected in national and state governments.  Indeed, in fraud #8 Galbraith notes that \\"A large, vital and expanding part of what is called the public sector is for all practical effect in the private sector.\\" (p. 34)  He specifically identifies the \\"defense\\" industry as being largely controlled by defense contractors in the private sector.  Elsewhere in the essay, Galbraith refers to \\"the control of consumer choice and sovereignty\\" indicating that he understands that the control extends to the electorate. (p. 13)<br /><br />Fraud number four is the way we hypocritically value \\"work.\\"  For some it is toil and for others it is a pleasure and indeed largely the reason for living, and yet how differently we are compensated, with those who need it least often getting the most in financial reward.<br /><br />Fraud five refers to the corporate bureaucracy.  While corporate people sneer at government agencies as being bureaucratic, large corporations have become just as bloated or even more so.  (Chapter V: \\"The Corporation asBureaucracy.\\")<br /><br />Fraud #6 is the phony celebration of small businesses and family farms in the political rhetoric.  Galbraith comments, \\"For the small retailer, Wal-Mart awaits.  For the family farm, there are the massive grain and fruit enterprise and the modern large-scale meat producer.\\" (p. 25)<br /><br />Fraud #9 (I've mentioned numbers 7 and 8 above) is the fraud of economic predictions.  Galbraith observes: \\"The financial world sustains a large, active, well-rewarded community based on compelled but seemingly sophisticated ignorance\\" (i.e., stockbrokers, stock analysts and other financial prognosticators).  He  adds, \\"...those...who tell of the future financial performance of an industry or firm, given the unpredictable but controlling influence of the larger economy, do not know and normally do not know that they do not know.\\" (p. 40)<br /><br />Finally there is the quaint fraud of the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, which Galbraith claims have no real effect on the economy.<br /><br />For an interesting book on the corporation as a psychopathic entity (yes, psychopathic) see, The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power by Joel Bakan.  In fact Galbraith should read this book.  It would further part of his thesis.<br /><br />In part this modest book is a succinct warning about how corporations are becoming more and more powerful as they gain greater and greater control over our lives.  Perhaps what Galbraith is saying in his laconic way is that there is a very real danger that bit by bit we are on the way to a nation controlled not by a democratic electorate or even by republican checks and balances, but by an oligarchy of corporate power.businesses and family farms in the political rhetoric.

One sees in this journal of a year (1999-2000) in the life of a religious Jew in Israel the timeless struggle of a man to know the good, and to do it.  For Shalom Freedman the essential moral question is how does one act in accordance with true \\"derech eretz\\"?  That is, how does one go about treating others with respect, consideration and compassion in accordance with \\"the will of God\\"?<br /><br />It would seem that the Golden Rule of doing unto others as one would wish be done unto oneself would be a necessary and sufficient guide.  Indeed in the Talmud it is written: \\"What is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor.  That is the whole Torah.  The rest is commentary.\\"  Freedman goes a bit beyond this; indeed his year-long \\"experiment\\" in derech eretz is that of a man seeking some kind of perfection of behavior toward his fellow human beings.  Of course it can be said--and Freedman is well aware of this--that such an endeavor is itself a sign of something other than derech eretz.  On the one hand, some people might find this an exercise in moral one-upmanship, while others might view it as delusive or even egocentric.<br /><br />Yet the experiment, because it is published rather than private, takes on greater significance.  To do good just for the sake of being good is perhaps just a gesture.  But to do good with the intent of showing others what the struggle is all about, and to do this with real self-examination and then to share it with the world--such an intent lifts the entire enterprise to another level and justifies it.<br /><br />The reader can ask (and I found it hard not to) \\"to what extent did Freedman succeed and to what extent does this publication itself further the cause of derech eretz?\\"  Indeed, this is the question that I believe Shalom Freedman himself is asking.  He writes, \\"I know that despite all my efforts in the past year, I have not helped people in any significant way.\\" (p. 273)<br /><br />This is perhaps too modest; and perhaps it is born of the terrible uncertainty that is the burden of Israelis, who live everyday knowing that the end of their struggle is nowhere in sight.  While Freedman writes of his \\"intense concentration on the minor encounters of everyday life\\" (p. 273) all about him are momentous and violent events.<br /><br />Again Freedman is well aware of this seeming disconnectedness.  While he worries over whether he missed saying a kind word to a friend, or whether he gave enough to a beggar in the street, the state of Israel is in a life and death struggle for its survival.  Yet--and this is the whole point of this venture--such things go hand in hand because the Jewish people cannot win the larger war and lose their soul (and neither can Americans, by the way), and derech eretz is at the very soul of any civilized society.<br /><br />I must say however that I would not describe derech eretz as \\"doing the will of God\\" as Freedman does (p. 164).  I am uneasy at being told what is the will of God, and I don't believe that other persons, regardless of how pious they may seem, can say what pleases or does not please God.  But this is a complaint that I would register against any religion that imagines that God is personally involved in their daily lives.  This is simply my belief.  I wish Freedman and all the priests and preachers and other clerics would say instead that what is pleased is themselves and their view of life as taught in their traditions.  To presume to speak for God grates on the ears and rankles the soul.<br /><br />That point aside, I am in deep sympathy and in substantial accord with Freedman's beliefs.  I believe, as many do, that charity not only begins at home, but that it is incumbent on us as human beings to treat those people around us with courtesy, consideration and compassion; and to fail in this is to fail in the most fundamental way as human beings.  Indeed, if Freedman's example were universally followed, the world would overnight turn into something close to a heaven on earth.  Alas, how far we are from such a world!  And yet how little it would take from each and every human being to bring it about.<br /><br />Freedman's moral struggle and self-examination make this a most interesting read, but I also gained from the insights into the daily lives of the religious Jews of Israel that Freedman provides.  He steers a middle road between the ultra-Orthodox, who are largely out of tune with the modern world (in somewhat the same way that fundamentalist Christians and Muslims are), and the secular society that sometimes seems but an extension of the American mass culture.<br /><br />Here are some examples of Freedman's fine spiritual insight:<br /><br />\\"I know how it is when you are alone, and suddenly someone listens to you and makes you feel that you are a human being again.\\" (p. 201)<br /><br />\\"...[M]odesty, humility and walking humbly before God are the foundations of my faith.\\" (p.206)<br /><br />\\"Perhaps what I primarily mean by derech eretz is simple decency and kindness.  In this sense, it is not something of which to make a big deal, but rather something that one does naturally and comes to expect of others, as basic civilized human behavior.\\" (p. 51)<br /><br />\\"...[T]here are those who, upon receiving offers of help, might come to hate those who are extending it, for they see in those people a freedom and power that they themselves do not possess.\\" (p. 51)<br /><br />And finally here's something that relates to post 9/11 United States: \\"The dilemma of how to maintain our strength while preserving our humanity is one that we are faced with all the time...\\" (p. 194)ething close to a heaven on earth.

Perhaps it's a US congressman.  Most people I know either haven't a clue about the subject, or are rationalists and are well aware that the intelligent design argument is scientifically vacuous and actually a religious power play, or they are religious true believers themselves and uncritically accept the notion that the universe was designed by a supernatural being whom they call God.<br /><br />In other words, all the close and detailed analysis done by Shanks in this book--and trust me, he really addresses the question in the most thorough way--isn't about to persuade anybody one way or the other.  Most people won't--and could not even if they tried--read it.  It is entirely too finely meshed in technical detail about matters of no particular interest to them: cosmology, quantum mechanics, probability theory, biochemistry, thermodynamics, etc.  Yet the book had to be written just for the record, one might say.  All the pseudoscience served up by the creationists and the intelligent designers needed to be answered thoroughly, and Shanks has done that in a most impressive manner.<br /><br />Shanks takes the intelligent designers seriously and presents their arguments, and then, piece by piece, refutes them.  Frankly, I believe he gives them more attention than they deserve.  After all, how seriously can one take a man (leading intelligent design theorist, William Dembski, for example) who writes: \\"My thesis is that all disciplines find their completion in Christ and cannot be properly understood apart from Christ\\" (quoted on page 157)?  I mean, isn't it enough to just quote such a person?  He's a true believer and all his \\"arguments\\" are merely attempts to justify his belief in a supernatural being and supernatural causation.  No amount of counter argument from logic or scientific experiment or from the multitudinous conclusions of the various sciences is going to sway him one iota.<br /><br />But of course Shanks is not aiming his arguments at Dembski or his colleagues.  Rather, like the good teacher he is, Shanks wants it spelled out for his students and for students everywhere just how absurd and wanting is the case for intelligent design.  He is writing for those not yet entirely corrupted by religious propaganda and as yet innocent of the weight of the scientific evidence.<br /><br />Why, one might ask, are the religious fundamentalists so intent on attacking Darwinism?  Is it because they are uncomfortable with being closely related to apes, as were the Victorians?  They probably are, but the real reason is that \\"Darwin's theory of evolution can be viewed as a sustained refutation of the argument from design...\\" (p. 24)  Before evolution it was a mighty mystery as to how species arose, and any argument was as good as another, with the hoary argument from design being especially agreeable; and therefore pronouncements from the clergy held not only psychological, social and political sway over the masses, but intellectual sway as well.  Darwinism changed all that, with the result that the Church lost an enormous amount of power and prestige--power and prestige that it has been desperately trying to regain ever since.<br /><br />Noteworthy is the fine introduction by Richard Dawkins who has fought long and hard himself against the stupidities of the creationists and intelligent designers.  Note well his sharp and decisive tone: \\"Intelligent Design 'theory' is pernicious nonsense which needs to be neutralized before irreparable damage is done to American education.\\" (p. x)<br /><br />That really is the bottom line.  All that we have learned from science and rationalism is under attack from the forces of ignorance, mostly right-wing religious fundamentalists who would substitute their authoritarian mumble-jumble for reality in anattempt to seize the reigns of political power and usher in a return to the Dark Ages with themselves at the throne.  Professor Shanks is to be commended for his efforts to prevent such a catastrophe, as unlikely as such a catastrophe might be.reality in an attempt to seize the reigns of political power and usher in a return to the Dark Ages with themselves at the throne.

I mean generally.  In each specific case a cause of death is usually made: heart attack, cancer, gunshot wound, etc.  But as far as why human beings in general die rather than go on living indefinitely, the answer is murky.<br /><br />It used to be the case (and perhaps still is) that coroners would cite \\"natural causes\\" as the cause of the death of certain old people.  However in some places this is no longer allowed since science has established that there is no such thing as the nebulous \\"natural causes.\\"  If the medical examiner looks closely enough it will always be found that some part or parts of the body failed for one reason or another and should be cited as the cause of death.<br /><br />Some people think we die (theoretically) because it is good for the species.  Some people think we die because it is programmed into our cells to die.  Others think we die because our bodies wear out.  These are proximate reasons perhaps, but they do not explain why the evolutionary mechanism does not allow us to be immortal.  The authors recall the idea that death is a byproduct of sexuality, noting that dividing nonsexual bacteria, for example, are theoretically immortal (as are cancer cells).  They also point out that many species (salmon, for example) die immediately after reproduction.  They cite studies showing that such species may go on living if they do not reproduce.  Furthermore, they note that natural selection works most effectively when the organism is at or near sexual maturity.  The further the organism gets from the onset of sexual maturity, the less effect natural selection has on making it adaptive; that is, making it healthy and effective in warding off dangers from the environment.<br /><br />This is really a fine explanation for why we die, and one that is cited by all the authorities I have read.  Put another way, what it means is that the evolutionary mechanism \\"cares\\" less about older organisms that are no longer sexually reproductive than it does about younger ones that are.  Or put still another way, the harmful mutations that would be selected against in younger organisms are not selected against in older individuals because those individuals are so few in number, relatively speaking; (and more generally), because they produce so few offspring, the effect of their genes is small in the overall gene pool.  I think it can be added that the young are better adapted (if only slightly, and in general) to the environment and therefore should be expected to out-reproduce the old.<br /><br />If this is not clear, let me say that I did not understand these subtle points for a long time.  Furthermore, they seem to beg the question of why the evolutionary mechanism does not allow organisms to continue to reproduce as they get older.  In lobsters, the authors point out, their reproductive capability actually increases with age, and indeed this is understood as being one reason they live relatively long lives.<br /><br />A more profound way of looking at this conundrum was suggested by G.C. Williams who explains that a flying fish always falls back into the water and that natural selection does nothing and needs to do nothing to return the fish to the water.  (Gravity does it!--and note that gravity is in this example analogous to the natural forces--accident, predation, disease, etc.--that will eventually kill an organism.)  What natural selection works on is making the fish more effective at staying in the air longer.  Eventually however the fish must return to the water.  The authors explain, \\"Natural selection gives the organism the means...to remain alive longer than if it were abandoned only to physical forces...these means are inevitably limited.  Again, they can only delay the final outcome.\\" (p. 188)<br /><br />The authors further explain that \\"natural death has no value in and of itself [giving the lie to the good-for-the-species argument]; its existence is simply the result of a central biological pointlessness to repair systems that would prevent aging.  All...organisms...are doomed to exist temporarily...and the time they have to procreate cannot be extended indefinitely.  Natural selection 'judges' each organism by the yardstick of procreation...  The goal is successful reproduction...[even if it leads to a shortened lifespan].\\"  Consequently, \\"[w]ithout going to the extreme examples of mayflies or salmon, this arrangement leads the organism to neglect itself just enough so that aging and natural death occur.\\"  (pp. 182-183)<br /><br />Another point is that programmed cell death (apoptosis) is NOT the cause of the death of the organism.  In fact, apoptosis works in exactly the opposite direction: the death of certain cells is for the betterment of the organism, as the authors argue in Chapter Six.<br /><br />This is the fourth book I have read on this subject.  The other three books are: Austad, Steven N. Why We Age: What Science Is Discovering about the Body's Journey Through Life [1997)]; Clark, William R. A Means to an End: The Biological Basis of Aging and Death [1999]; and Hayflick, Leonard. How and Why We Age [1994].

All...organisms...are doomed to exist temporarily...and the time they have to procreate cannot be extended indefinitely.  Natural selection 'judges' each organism by the yardstick of procreation...  The goal is successful reproduction...[even if it leads to a shortened lifespan].\\"  Consequently, \\"[w]ithout going to the extreme examples of mayflies or salmon, this arrangement leads the organism to neglect itself just enough so that aging and natural death occur.\\"  (pp. 182-183) <br /> <br />Another point is that programmed cell death (apoptosis) is NOT the cause of the death of the organism.  In fact, apoptosis works in exactly the opposite direction: the death of certain cells is for the betterment of the organism, as the authors argue in Chapter Six. <br /> <br />This is the fourth book I have read on this subject.  The other three books are: Austad, Steven N. Why We Age: What Science Is Discovering about the Body's Journey Through Life [1997)]; Clark, William R. A Means to an End: The Biological Basis of Aging and Death [1999]; and Hayflick, Leonard. How and Why We Age [1994].

I particularly recommend the material on pages 194-202 where Edley suggests that you develop the habit of asking yourself questions before making a play.<br /><br />For example, question number one is, \\"Do I have a bingo?\\" (A good first question!) Question number two is the obvious, Which bonus squares are available, but question number three really gets to the nitty-gritty of good play: \\"Can you 'hook' any words?  Look at every word already on the board and ask yourself if any single letter can be added to the front or back to form another word.\\"  Also important is question number four: \\"What will my 'leave' be after I've made my play?\\"<br /><br />Too often the beginning player does not pay enough attention to the tiles he or she is going to be stuck with after a play.  Sometimes, Edley advises, it is better to make a lower-scoring play in order to leave oneself with tiles likely (with a little help) to form a bingo.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is devoted to Scrabble puzzles on various themes, e.g., \\"Placing your letters on hot spots\\"; using the J, Q, X and Z; two-, three-, four- and five-tile plays, etc.  There is a diagram of the Scrabble grid with some plays already made.  Underneath the diagram are the letters in several different racks.  You are asked to find the best play.  Edley recommends that you do the puzzles by setting them up on your own Scrabble board.  I think that is the best way as well since the diagrams in the book are in black and white and so the bonus squares are not colored, and are highlighted only by the letters \\"DWS,\\" \\"DLS\\" (\\"Double Word Score,\\" \\"Double  Letter Score\\"), etc.  This makes it hard to get a quick feel for where to look.  At least that was my experience.<br /><br />A handy feature is the list of the 97 two-letter words allowed in official Scrabble tournaments on page 7.  (I think that has been changed to 96 with \\"da\\" now being disallowed.)  Interesting features include the weighed scores for answers to the various puzzles.  For example, for the puzzle on page 93 there is an \\"expert\\" score (for five racks) of 155, a \\"good\\" score of 145, and an \\"average\\" score of 120.  But Edley also gives his score of 164 and challenges you to beat it.<br /><br />There are 800 puzzles, so this book will last through many a long winter's night; however this is not as good a book as the more substantial Everything Scrabble (revised 2001) by Edley (along with John D. Williams, Jr.), which I also recommend for the serious Scrabble player.official Scrabble tournaments on page 7.  (I think that has been changed to 96 with \\"da\\" now being disallowed.)

446747:US	49786731	R2E2XYESAYYMM9	1400050669	951260070	The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception	Books	5	41	44	N	N	Tales of a serial liar	The only thing wrong with this book is that there is no chance that more than a minuscule percentage of the electorate will read it, and most of them will be the already knowledgeable.<br />Journalist David Corn, who writes for The Nation and other publications in addition to having appeared on many TV and radio news shows, including NPR and Fox News, begins the book with the words, \\"George W. Bush is a liar. He has lied large and small. He has lied directly and by omission.\\"<br /><br />Corn obviously had to get that off his chest and out in the open since that is something he and all the other reporters who have followed the career of George W. know only too well; and yet it is something they have seldom felt free to say in so many words.<br /><br />Corn recalls all the major Bush prevarications, from the weapons of mass destruction that weren't there, to the tax cuts that emptied the treasury for his buds, back to the 1990 Harken Energy (a kind of mini-Enron) insider trading scandal that saved George W. from what would have been another business failure. He was on the board of directors of Harken when he sold off his shares two months before the company's stock took a 20% nose dive after its losses became public. Bush denied trading on inside information. Because the SEC consisted of mostly friends of his father, George W. was given a clean bill of heath. Imagine what would have happened to him if his name had been, say, Martha Stewart.<br /><br />In the final chapter, \\"Conclusion: How He Gets Away with It (So Far)\\" Corn attempts to explain why Bush's lies haven't hurt him. He blames the press for not having the gumption (maybe I should just say \\"guts\\") to contradict the president or to print the unvarnished truth themselves. Instead of a mealymouthed \\"Analysts Discount Attack by Iraq\\" (as in the Washington Post headline had it) or \\"CIA Warns That a US Attack May Ignite Terror\\" (as in the New York Times), Corn wonders why they didn't write, \\"CIA Suggests Bush Misleads Public on Threat from Iraq.\\" Furthermore, before Bush was \\"elected\\" and was still campaigning, \\"Howell Raines, then the editorial page editor of the New York Times, ordered Paul Krugman...a harsh Bush critic, not to use the word 'lie' when assailing Bush's proposals.\\"<br /><br />Clearly the print media abdicated its responsibility to inform the public. In some cases the reporters refrained from asking hard questions and from writing candid stories because they were afraid they might not get their name called during the next presidential press conference, or because they were afraid of criticism that would come from Bush's supporter. But in other cases the direction to go easy on Bush came from higher management and ownership. The press, quite frankly, in a de facto sense was not, and is not, free. I think this is one of the big problems in this country today, and it is getting worse.<br /><br />Even worse is the sad state of television news where the programs are under the watchful eyes of not only Rupert Murdoch types but also the sponsors of the programs who will not tolerate the president being called a liar. Even worse the news people not only quote Bush's lies, they broadcast him telling them as mini infomercials, often without a word of contradiction or warning that what you are hearing is not the truth.<br /><br />The question arises, does Bush know he is lying? Maybe he does, but believes it's for a greater good. Or maybe, since no man sees himself as a scoundrel, his hypocrisy is so self-deceptive that he doesn't realize the extent of his mendacity. Corn speculates that Bush is \\"a binary thinker who views the world in black-and-white terms.\\" (p. 320) Such people inevitably fall into self-deception because the world is not just black and white, and the truth is not, you're either for us or against us. Instead the truth varies according to circumstance and point of view, and there are many shades in-between.<br />By the way, another even more detailed and forceful book on this exact subject with an almost identical slant is The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)Leads America (2004) by Eric Alterman and Mark Green, which I also highly recommend.<br /><br />Bottom line: a no-holds-barred look at the mendacious president, a two-faced master of deception and falsification who is doing Machiavelli proud. Our only hope is that the information in this book will somehow trickle down to the larger electorate, and the truth about George W. Bush will become common knowledge.most identical slant is The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)Leads America (2004) by Eric Alterman and Mark Green, which I also highly recommend.

It is also fascinating to learn that a stroke can leave a person with the inability to see things on one side of the visual field--which is what happened to &#34;Mrs. S.&#34; as recalled in the chapter, &#34;Eyes Right!&#34;--and yet not realize that anything is missing. In both cases there was nothing wrong with the patient's eyes; it was the brain's processing of the visual information that had gone haywire.<br /><br />Neurologist Oliver Sacks, who has a wonderful way with words and a strong desire to understand and appreciate the human being that still exists despite the disorder or neurological damage, treats the reader to these and twenty-two other tales of the bizarre in this very special book. My favorite tale is Chapter 21, &#34;Rebecca,&#34; in which Dr. Sacks shows that a person of defective intelligence--a &#34;moron&#34;--is still a person with a sense of beauty and with something to give to the world. Sacks generously (and brilliantly) shows how Rebecca taught him the limitations of a purely clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment. Although the child-like 19-year-old didn't have the intelligence to &#34;find her way around the block&#34; or &#34;open a door with a key,&#34; Rebecca had an emotional understanding of life superior to many adults. She loved her grandmother deeply and when she died, Rebecca expressed her feelings to Sacks, &#34;I'm crying for me, not for her...She's gone to her Long Home.&#34; She added, poetically, &#34;I'm so cold. It's not outside, it's winter inside. Cold as death...She was a part of me. Part of me died with her&#34; (p. 182). Rebecca goes on to show Dr. Sacks that they pay &#34;far too much attention to the defects of...patients...and far too little to what...[is] intact or preserved&#34; (p. 183). Rebecca was tired of the meaningless classes and workshops and odd jobs. &#34;What I really love...is the theatre,&#34; she said. Sacks writes that the theatre &#34;composed her...she became a complete person, poised, fluent, with style, in each role&#34; (p. 185).<br /><br />Another of my favorite stories is Chapter 23, &#34;The Twins.&#34; These two guys, idiots savants, &#34;undersized, with disturbing disproportions in head and hands...monotonous squeaky voices...a very high, degenerative myopia, requiring glasses so thick that their eyes seem distorted&#34; (p. 196) had the very strange ability of being able to factor quickly in their heads large numbers and to recognize primes at a glance. They could also give you almost instantly the day of the week for any day in history. One day a box of matches fell on the floor and &#34;&#60;111,&#62; they both cried simultaneously.&#34; And then one said &#34;37&#34; and then the other said &#34;37&#34; and then the first said &#34;37&#34; and stopped. There were indeed 111 matches on the floor (Sacks counted them) and three times the prime number 37 does indeed equal 111! (p. 199). Later he discovered them saying six-figure numbers to one another. One would give a number and the other would receive it &#34;and appreciate...it richly.&#34; Sacks discovered that they were tossing out primes to one another just for the sheer joy of doing it.<br /><br />Another of Sacks's discoveries about his patients is that &#34;music, narrative and drama&#34; are &#34;of the greatest practical and theoretical importance&#34; (p. 185). He demonstrates this again and again here and in his more recent book, An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995), which is also an incredibly fascinating book. (See my review here at Amazon.com.) Many people with neurological disorders or deficiencies become whole when engaged in a process such as story, music or drama. The process seems to give them a structure to follow which, for the time being, overcomes their handicap. This is seen remarkably even in a surgeon with Tourette's syndrome who, while performing surgery, was without tics (as reported in the book mentioned above).<br /><br />It's clear that one of Sacks's purposes in sharing his experience is to dispel the prejudice against people who are different because of their defects. One can see that respect for others regardless of their limitations is something Sacks incorporates in his practice and his life. It is one of the many virtues of this wonderful book, that in reading it, we too are moved to a greater respect for others, people who really are challenged in ways we &#34;normal&#34; people can only imagine.in a surgeon with Tourette's syndrome who, while performing surgery, was without tics (as reported in the book mentioned above).  <br /> <br />It's clear that one of Sacks's purposes in sharing his experience is to dispel the prejudice against people who are different because of their defects.

I have also read some books by futurists like Ray Kurzweil and Pierre Baldi (The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence [1999] and The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution [2001], respectively); additionally I have read some of the books that Rees relied upon while writing this book, including, Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution (2002) by Francis Fukuyama, and so most of the things that Martin Rees is worried about are familiar to me.<br /><br />But this book nonetheless broadened my perspective because Sir Martin Rees (the Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, and a distinguished astrophysicist) is persuasive in his argument that there may actually be scientific experiments that should not be tried.  He warns against some kinds of genetic engineering, especially those attempting to change the DNA of dangerous pathogens, and even rates some experiments in physics as of dubious value.  This is a somewhat surprising stance for a reputable scientists to take since most scientists do not relish the prospect of political restraints on their work, and usually afford the same courtesy to practitioners in other disciplines.<br /><br />His call for taking a close look at experiments with a chance of a \\"doomsday downside,\\" however remote, is well taken.  His sense that some biological experiments have such an unsavory \\"yuck factor\\" (e.g., \\"Brainless hominoids whose organs could be harvested as spare parts,\\" p. 78) that scientists themselves should not be alone in deciding whether such experiments should continue, is also an excellent point.<br /><br />Rees is characteristically not dogmatic about any of this. He presents the dangers and the objections typically with the proviso that a wider public than an individual scientist, or an oligarchy of scientists, should participate in the decisions made.  Indeed Rees is an eminently reasonable man who tries to have as few prejudices (or \\"yuck factors\\") about things as possible.<br /><br />He emphasizes the unpredictability of future developments, noting that \\"straightforward projections of present trends will miss the most revolutionary innovations: the qualitatively new things that really change the world.\\" (p. 12)  Nobody before modern physics could have predicted the power of the atomic bomb, nor could the earliest experimenters with electricity have foreseen how electrical power would transform the world.<br /><br />Like the futurists named above, Rees sees a posthuman future for our kind, a future in which cultural evolution transforms humans into something beyond human.  He recalls Darwin, who wrote, \\"not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity\\" and notes that \\"Earth itself may endure, but it will not be humans who cope with the scorching of our planet by the dying sun...\\" (p. 186)  What both Darwin and Rees are acknowledging is that all species eventually become extinct, and so too will humans.<br /><br />The central point of this book I believe however is to be found further down the page where Rees writes, \\"Nuclear weapons give an attacking nation a devastating advantage over any feasible defense.  New sciences will soon empower small groups, even individuals, with similar leverage over society.  Our increasingly interconnected world is vulnerable to new risks; 'bio' or 'cyber,' terror or error.  These risks cannot be eliminated: indeed it will be hard to stop them from growing without encroaching on some cherished personal freedoms.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, this is perhaps the central conundrum of our time made emphatic by the events of September 11th.<br /><br />One of the most interesting ideas in this book is this from page 154: \\"Perhaps complex aggregates of atoms, whether brains or machine, can never understand everything about themselves.\\"  I am reminded here of Godel's incompleteness theorem in which he demonstrated that mathematics cannot have a truly rigorous logical foundation.  I am also reminded of Russell's discovery that the logic of self-referential systems can lead to paradox.  Rees's point here is that we may never really know ourselves.<br /><br />Rees also makes the point on the same page that our machines will accelerate science, perhaps to the point where only machines can understand the new discoveries.<br /><br />Clearly we are finite creatures in a world that we can never hope to fully understand.  Furthermore there will always be dangers that we cannot predict or avoid.  These are sobering thoughts for humans to think.<br /><br />Rees closes by asking if the future will \\"be filled with life, or as empty as the Earth's first sterile seas\\" and he opines that \\"The choice may depend on us, this century.\\"<br /><br />Here I think he is waxing perhaps a bit melodramatic since, while we may have the ability to destroy civilization here on earth, life will indeed go on since it is highly unlikely that we will develop any time soon the ability to destroy all life.

462127:US	49786731	R2FZX48Q91QBW7	0691090653	142068305	Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion	Books	5	19	23	N	N	A thoroughly engaging and candid account	Taiwanese-born Feng-Hsiung Hsu has written a most engaging and readable account of how Deep Blue came to be, and how it defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in perhaps the greatest chess match of all time.  I say \\"perhaps\\" because there are many who still consider the 1972 encounter at Reykjavik, Iceland between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky to be the greatest match ever.  One thing both matches had in common, in addition to a worldwide audience, is two deeply suspicious and idiosyncratic geniuses, Kasparov and Fischer.<br /><br />However, while Fischer's triumph rejuvenated interest in chess, especially in the US, Kasparov's defeat, many fear, may have rung the death knell for the ancient game.  Before Deep Blue's victory, it was easy to imagine that the human mind was light-years ahead of any artificial intelligence.  After Kasparov slunk off mumbling vague charges of human intervention (\\"cheating\\"), it became necessary to face the possibility that machine intelligence was on its way to exceeding that of humans.<br /><br />But what did the match really prove?  According to Hsu himself, the triumph of Deep Blue \\"might be the more important human achievement when all was said and done.\\" (p. 256)  By a \\"more important human achievement,\\" he means, more important than the one that would have been Kasparov's had he won.<br /><br />This I think is the crux of the matter.  Deep Blue, an IBM computer of enormous power, is the product of human minds and human engineering.  Look at it this way: as computers become more and more powerful and their algorithms become more and more sophisticated, there will be no thought at all that a human might compete with them at chess.  It would be like expecting the world's fastest human to beat a motor car in a race.  Or for the world's best human calculator to add numbers faster than a personal computer.<br /><br />In a deeper sense what was destroyed by this match was not human intellectual superiority but the delusion that somehow a board game--even the greatest board game ever invented--is a true measure of human intelligence.  Quite simply, the ability to play chess at the highest level is only one talent, similar to (but different from) the ability to play the violin or to run fast.  More significant is the greater human ability to conceive and build a machine that does something better than humans can do themselves.<br /><br />Hsu's account includes a lot of information about his personal adventures in academia and the corporate structure, including rivalries with others in the race to build the ultimate chess-playing computer.  He is candid, and self-revelatory to a surprising degree, and it is this candor that helps to make this a fascinating read, not only for computer specialists and chess players, but for anyone interested in how the human competitive spirit works.  His portrait of Garry Kasparov--perhaps the strongest chess player of all time--captures the arrogant, suspicious genius at his most human and makes it clear how he came to lose a match he fully expected to win.<br /><br />Ah, the match itself!  The book includes the moves of the games in an appendix, but one can readily see that the match turned on two very strange decisions by the hitherto nearly invincible Kasparov.  Strange to say, it appears that Kasparov lost the match mainly because of poor psychological decisions.  In game two, believing that he was lost, mainly because he believed that the computer would not have made the move it had made had there been a perpetual check available to the human player that would have drawn the game, Kasparov resigned.  However, the machine had erred, and there was a way to draw the game.  Against a human opponent, I believe that Kasparov would have closely investigated that line and found the drawing resource.<br /><br />In the final game again Kasparov made a decision based on what he thought was the nature of the way computers play chess.  He allowed a sacrificial line asBlack in the Caro-Kahn Defense, a line that he believed Deep Blue would never play since computers are notoriously bad at figuring out how to conduct a complicated attack.  Indeed, commercial chess software for PCs typically exclude this line from their opening repertoire so as not to burden the program!  So Kasparov thought in playing 7... h6 that Deep Blue would retreat its knight giving Kasparov easy equality.  Instead Deep Blue plunged in with 8. Nxe6!  Eleven moves later Kasparov resigned--easily one of the quickest defeats of his career.<br /><br />So, with better decisions, based on sound chess and NOT on mistaken preconceptions about Deep Blue's prowess, Kasparov might have won the match.  However, the irony is that it is unlikely that there ever will be another match between the world chess champion and a machine simply because Kasparov and the whole chess world know that the ultimate victory of machine over man, in the arcane test of will and calculation that is chess, is inevitable.  But what we also know is that it doesn't matter.  We still hold races between humans even though our machines can easily out distant them.  And humans will continue to play chess even though they would have no chance against a computer because chess is first and foremost a human sporting event, a test of mental strength and skill much as a boxing match is a test of physical strength and skill.Deep Blue would never play since computers are notoriously bad at figuring out how to conduct a complicated attack.

463685:US	49786731	R2FE8M4LWEOW8G	0595318673	655494008	Dreamtime: A Collection of Short Stories	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Original, engrossing, and strangely real	The eleven stories in this collection have in common a dream-like, supernatural quality of the sinister somewhat reminiscent of the work of Edgar Allan Poe (who actually appears in one of the stories) or perhaps Lord Dunsany (in particular I am reminded of his chilling story, \\"The Ghosts\\") or H.P. Lovecraft (who is mentioned in another story).  The tales are carefully crafted and polished to a fine sheen so that every word is exactly where it should be.  The narratives (all in the first person except for \\"The Pilgrim\\" and \\"Round Trip\\") are distinguished by an urbane, educated voice that is careful to be clear and realistic while giving just enough detail and background to make the story accessible.  A nice tension is established and one is drawn into the mystery and reads eagerly toward the resolution.  Unlike some ultra fancy short stories much in vogue these many years, Steiner's stories clearly do find a resolution.<br /><br />Typically the narrator recalls some strange event.  Perhaps he was caught in a snowstorm (this occurs in two of the stories).  The storm becomes worse and then he finds shelter at a fantastic establishment.  In one of the stories it is at an extraordinarily fancy restaurant, in the other he finds himself at an aristocrat's party in a large and ornate mansion.  In either case it is clear that the first person narrator has entered the dreamtime, perhaps that stage of life before one freezes to death.  But he recovers and looks back, and then some years later, returns to the scene to find some lingering reminiscence of his adventure.  In some cases a historic personage figures in the story--Poe in one story, Leonardo Di Vinci (I believe) in another--or someone the narrator had met before returns in a new guise, as was the case with the 500-pound man on the beach.<br /><br />Steiner draws a fuzzy line between the supernatural and the ordinary, between the fantastic world of our dreams and the mundane reality of our daily lives.  He steers a moderate course between the nervous dreams redolent of childhood reveries and the horror tales of perversion and murder supplied by the commercial establishment, so that, while we are always on the edge of the frightful, we never fall into the abyss of the horrific.<br /><br />In most collections there is some drop off in quality, or there is a clash of style that makes some stories seem out of place (or actually makes some appear as \\"fillers\\").

Here he expands on lectures given at the Institut f&uuml;r die Wissenschaften vom Menschen in Vienna in 1999 to explore and answer the question of why the preeminent culture in the world during the Middle Ages has become the laggard culture of modern times.<br /><br />Lewis' point of departure for the lectures can perhaps be taken from page 152:<br /><br />\\"By all the standards that matter in the modern world--economic development and job creation, literacy and educational and scientific achievement, political freedom and respect for human rights--what was once a mighty civilization has indeed fallen low.\\" (p. 152)<br /><br />The question of course is why?  Lewis' answer points not to Western imperialism nor the much earlier Mongol invasions, believing them to be \\"a consequence, not a cause, of the inner weakness of Middle-Eastern states and societies.\\"  He notes, first that \\"the greatest achievements of the Muslim peoples, notably in Iran, came after, not before, the Mongol invasions.\\" Then he points to the \\"postimperial development of former British possessions...Singapore and Hong Kong...the various lands that once made up the British Empire in India,\\" causing us to wonder why the Middle East did not recover as well.  (pp. 152-152)<br /><br />Lewis makes no clear unequivocal statement about who and/or what is to blame, but it is not Islam itself, he believes, although much of the evidence he presents certainly suggests that some characteristics of Islam are indeed part of the cause, in particular the inability of the Muslim mind to find a way to separate the secular from the religious.  Lewis notes that nowhere in the Qu'ran is there anything like the Biblical injunction to \\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's\\"). (p. 97)  He adds, \\"The idea that...any part of human life is in any sense outside the scope of religious law and jurisdiction is alien to Muslim thought.\\"  A contributing factor in Lewis' view is the imperfect and selective adoption of Western ways, especially the rise of Western-style nation states with autocratic rulers.  He hints that shari'a law itself may also be a factor, writing, \\"There is [in Islam]...no distinction between cannon law and civil law, between the law of the church and the law of the state, crucial in Christian history.\\" (p. 100)<br /><br />In the \\"Conclusion\\" Lewis writes, \\"For others, the main culprit is Muslim sexism, and the relegation of women to an inferior position in society, thus depriving the Islamic world of the talents and energies of half its people.\\"  He notes that still others point very interestingly to \\"the depredations of the goat that, by stripping the bark off trees and tearing up grass by the roots, turned once fertile lands into deserts.\\"  Or to, \\"the exhaustion of precious metals, coinciding with the discovery and exploitation by Europe of the resources of the new world.\\"  In this connection he asks, \\"Why did the discoverers of America sail from Spain and not a Muslim Atlantic port, where such voyages were indeed attempted in earlier times? (pp. 156-157)<br /><br />For Muslims themselves there is the \\"blame game\\" which increasingly points to the Jews and the Americans as the cause of all their troubles.  Lewis notes, \\"For the governments, at once oppressive and ineffectual, that rule much of the Middle East, this game serves a useful, indeed an essential purpose--to explain the poverty that they have failed to alleviate and to justify the tyranny that they have intensified.  In this way they seek to deflect the mounting anger of their unhappy subjects against other, outer targets.\\" (p. 159)  In this regard, Lewis points to \\"the events of 1948--the failure of five Arab states and armies to prevent half a million Jews from establishing a state in the debris of the British Mandate for Palestine\\" as a shock.  He adds, \\"it was bad enough to be defeated by the great imperial powers of the West; to suffer the same fate at the hands of a contemptible gang of Jews was an intolerable humiliation.\\" (p. 154)<br /><br />The situation in the Middle East today is one of irony: the profits from all those oil riches go not to the people but to the ruling elites while the oil itself is used to power the economies of the west and far east.  Meanwhile, the poor get poorer and more desperate to find a target for their frustration.  Eventually, I suspect they will realize that blaming the Jews and the West for their troubles is fruitless and they must take a look at themselves and especially their dictatorial, theocratic, monarchical rulers for a solution.  The day is coming when the great economies of the world will finally give up their oil addiction.  It is too bad that the money from that oil is not now going toward training and educating the people of the Middle East in preparation for that time.of the British Mandate for Palestine\\" as a shock.

466469:US	49786731	RS7RGJVKIHKRT	0974293806	197288993	Poison Darts	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A persuasive and learned voice (in the wilderness?)	This is a two-volume book about a hypothetical contraceptive, the \\"Take It and Forget It Contraceptive\\" (TIFIC) which Russ Finley believes is just what the world needs in order to stem its population and prevent the loss of biodiversity.<br /><br />Here's how a hypothetical TIFIC might work: a vaccine is made that \\"creates antibodies that deactivate sperm cells by interfering\\" with \\"the operation of their little tails.\\" (Vol. I, p. 20)  This works for both men and women.  Fertility would be restored by having both prospective parents take a daily antidote pill until conception is achieved.  Finley's idea is that nearly everybody would want to have the vaccination so that they wouldn't have to worry about unwanted pregnancies--the \\"take it and forget it\\" aspect.<br /><br />In Volume I Finley writes a novel in which a rain forest frog and its tadpole supply the contraceptive and its antidote.  The problem with the novel is that it lacks tension and is rather flat emotionally.  The characters and the story are primarily vehicles for the dissemination of Finley's ideas.  However, Volume Two, which is a collection of Finley's writings on overpopulation and allied concerns, contains some of the best writing on this subject that I have ever read.<br /><br />Finley's main point, and one that few in the environmental debate seem to get, is that we are NOT going to save the biodiversity of the planet by good intentions or any combination thereof, simply because human nature is such that we will always look out for our own welfare first while the welfare of other beings, especially if they are distant, will be of secondary importance.  I once asked a student of mine who wanted to have half a dozen children, if she would be willing to forgo having one of them to save the tigers.  She said no.<br /><br />At least she was honest.  Most people would not even give up the convenience of their SUV for the tigers (if such a thing were possible).  Indeed, another one of Finley's points is that \\"There is no mechanism to shift resources\\" from those who have them in the US to those in, say, Africa, who do not.  He believes that the profit motive and status-seeking behaviors of humans override \\"most ideologies that do not have those drives as part of them.\\" (Vol II, p. 16)<br /><br />Note well that Finley wants our population to stop growing immediately because the more people there are, the more they will expand and bring about the extinction of other forms of life.  Indeed, Finley believes we already have too many people on this planet.  I agree with him and his assertion that both Malthus and Paul Ehrlich will ultimately be proven right, and that sophists like the late Julian Simon will be proven wrong.<br /><br />Here are some examples of Finley's insight and his considerable expertise (page numbers are from Volume II):<br /><br />\\"...[O]verpopulation has always been a local problem...When the people of Easter Island were starving to death, the planet was far from overpopulated.  The archaeological record is rife with example of populations that have crashed because of overpopulation...\\" (p. 24)<br /><br />\\"I prefer a definition that says you have overpopulation whenever you have people living at the subsistence level.  If you assume that people who live on less than $2 a day are at the subsistence level, then roughly half of the people in the world are living in overpopulated boundaries.\\" (p. 53)<br /><br />\\"Once a Chinese peasant can afford a scooter, he will obtain one, and when he can afford an SUV, he will obtain one of those too.  The instinctive urge to continuously seek higher status does not satiate itself.\\" (p. 56)<br /><br />\\"The economic systems available to us fall into a spectrum.  At one end, you will find unbridled capitalism and the use of slaves...As you move toward the middle, you will find regulated free markets.  This is capitalism with rules in place to limit how badly people with power can abuse those who are making them rich.\\" (p. 76)<br /><br />\\"Attempts to reduce CO2 levels are treating the symptoms of what ails our planet, not the cause.  The cause is overpopulation--the needs, and the desires of billions of people...Giving aspirin to reduce the discomfort of a fever--global warming--is not as effective as prescribing an antibiotic--the TIFIC--that would reduce the number of agents that caused the fever--us.\\" (p. 92)<br /><br />\\"...[T]he people in China and India have an average ecological footprint that is many times lower than yours or mine...[Yet] China's and India's destroyed ecosystems are the perfect experiments showing that lowering one's ecological footprint all the way down to that of a rice eating peasant will not save the planet.\\" (pp. 113-114)<br /><br />Finally, let me quote from the Prologue to Volume I: \\"...[How] do you allow people to satiate their status-seeking urges (which are closely related to sexual urges) without allowing them to advertise their prowess with trophies--books, published papers, houses, remodels, or cars?  The answer is revealing--you can't.  Tell people that they must stop having sex and seeking status is no different than telling them that they must stop walking upright.  You couldn't call yourself a normal healthy human if you stopped doing all of those things.  You cannot change human nature.\\" (p. iv)<br /><br />This work would be more effective if Finley would publish the second volume (with the prologue to Volume I) separately.  It would also help if he would hire a professional editor.  His writing is incisive and persuasive, and what he says needs to be heard.  His refutation of Julian Simon was especially instructive.  His metaphor that frogs are the canaries in the coal mine that is our planet (and that frogs can save us) is well taken and alarming.

Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response 2002 and The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Holy Terror 2003) I was favorably impressed with not only his obvious erudition, but with his reasoned tone and his realistic perceptions.  However, in this volume, which is a collection of some of his writings going back to the 1950s, I found myself a bit mystified.  On the one hand there is the brilliance and eloquence for which the venerable historian is well known.  On the other hand, there are some strange and unsettled statements which lead me to wonder if Professor Lewis has not lost some of his fabled acuity.<br /><br />First, there is the inclusion of a very short piece entitled \\"We Must Be Clear\\" that he wrote for the Washington Post a few days after September 11, 2001 in which he is anything but.  Apparently Lewis wants the US to be clear about its intentions in the Middle East in light of the terrorist attacks on 9/11.  He concludes that \\"What is needed is clarity in recognizing issues and alignments, firmness and determination in defining and applying policy.\\" (p. 370)  What this vague and essentially empty pronouncement follows is Lewis's apprehension that some states are \\"friends\\" on two levels, one \\"a deep mutual commitment\\" and the other \\"based on a perception of shared interests.\\" (p. 369-370)<br /><br />One will permit me a \\"You don't say?\\" here.  In this same piece Lewis mentions that Saddam Hussein \\"has made war against three of his neighbors...\\" and that the other states in the Middle East \\"are neither forgetful of the past nor confident of the future.\\"  What Saddam Hussein (and what his neighbors think about him) has to do with 9/11 is unclear.  It's as if Lewis had something he wanted to say, some connection he wanted to draw, but was unable to be clear about it, perhaps for political reasons or because he thought he knew something he wasn't at liberty to share.<br /><br />At any rate, even more disconcerting is the article entitled \\"A Time for Toppling\\" from the Wall Street Journal a year later (September 26, 2002) in which he seems to be a stalking horse for Bush's desire to invade Iraq.  He doesn't however argue so much that Saddam Hussein is a danger to the US, but instead makes the claim that in order to solve the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, it is first necessary to deal with Saddam.<br /><br />There is some legitimacy to this argument, and Lewis recalls Saddam's policy of rewarding the families of Palestinian suicide bombers with stipends of $10,000 to $25,000.  However what is grievously wrongheaded about this \\"toppling\\" that Lewis seems unaware of--as was Bush and the neocons in the White House--is that in invading Iraq, the US would create massively more problems than it would solve, and would only exacerbate the predicament of the Israeli and Palestinian people, since the Arab and Muslim world would rally around a kindred Muslim nation invaded by a foreign power even if it was the fiefdom of a hated dictator.  I am surprised that the usually wise and learned Professor Lewis could write so nakedly in favor of the foolishly aggressive policy of the Bush administration.<br /><br />Personally, I think Lewis revealed here the true heart of the historian: such a person may be incredibly wise and reasonable when he has time to think and rethink an issue and has the benefit of his research and a considerable experience; however when he is called upon to make a quick judgment on events still warm in the doing, his judgment may suffer.<br /><br />So let me recall the Bernard Lewis of the volumes mentioned above and let me quote from a couple of places in this collection in order to balance what would be, on the basis of these two articles, a misconception of the man.  Consider, for example, this statement on the three Abrahamic religions of the Middle East: \\"If we look at them in a wider global perspective, Judaism, Christianity and Islamare different branches of the same religion....Compared with the religions of India, of China and of other places, they are as alike as peas in a pod.\\"  Lewis goes on to make the point that when Muslim and Christian say to one another, \\"'You are an infidel and you will burn in hell,' they understand each other perfectly.\\"  However \\"Such an argument between a Christian or a Muslim on the one side and a Buddhist or a Hindu on the other\\" would have been \\"impossible\\" because \\"They would not have known what they were talking about.\\" (pp. 200-201)<br /><br />This insight is from his essay \\"A Taxonomy of Group Hatred\\" which originally appeared in the Viennese review Transit in 1998-1999.  This is a particularly good essay (published in English here for the first time) in which Lewis doesn't mince words about the human failing called hatred and gives a most interesting psychological and historical take on this most destructive emotion which he allies lamentably with the very essence of the human process of self-identity.  He notes, \\"Loyalty to the tribe, however defined, and hatred of other tribes are at the very core of identity.\\" (p. 203)<br /><br />There are 51 essays arranged in three parts, \\"Past History,\\" \\"Current History,\\" and \\"About History.\\"  There are pieces on such diverse subjects as money, travel and food in addition to the usual political concerns of historians.  Particularly good, because of the insight it affords us into the life of Bernard Lewis, is the Introduction in which he outlines his career as a Middle Eastern historian.<br /><br />I recommend this book for readers who want to increase their knowledge of the Middle East.  Here is Lewis's own justification for such a study: \\"The history of Islam is a vital and essential part of human history without which even 'our' own history is not fully intelligible.\\" (p. 412)y and Islam are different branches of the same religion....Compared with the religions of India, of China and of other places, they are as alike as peas in a pod.\\"  Lewis goes on to make the point that when Muslim and Christian say to one another, \\"'You are an infidel and you will burn in hell,' they understand each other perfectly.\\"  However \\"Such an argument between a Christian or a Muslim on the one side and a Buddhist or a Hindu on the other\\" would have been \\"impossible\\" because \\"They would not have known what they were talking about.\\" (pp. 200-201) <br /> <br />This insight is from his essay \\"A Taxonomy of Group Hatred\\" which originally appeared in the Viennese review Transit in 1998-1999.

Books	5	11	11	N	N	A history from 1920, and then, the prospects	This is an excellent book for those who want to know more about how the ethnically artificial Iraqi state was created by the colonial powers, mainly the British, in the 1920s, and why; and how it \\"progressed\\" toward the Ba'athist dictatorship under Saddam Hussein with attendant intrigues and atrocities.  The first chapter covers the period from 1920 to1958 under the Hashemite Monarchy; the second from 1958 to 1968; the third from 1968 to1988; the fourth begins with the end of the Iraq-Iran War and ends in 2003.  Then there are three chapters devoted to the three main ethnic groups, the Shi'a, the Sunnis, and the Kurds.  There is an epilogue and an index.<br /><br />I came away from my reading with the sense that no matter what is done, Iraq is headed for massive bloodshed resulting eventually in a new Sunni dictatorship or a Shi'a theocracy--neither of which is what the Bush Administration had in mind.  Clearly the authors--Liam Anderson, a political science professor at Wayne State University, and Gareth Stansfield, an expert on Iraqi and especially Kurdish affairs--do not think it likely that democracy will arise out of the ashes.  They give three likely scenarios in terms of options for the United States in Chapter Eight, \\"The Democracy Dilemma\\" (which is where the time-strapped reader might begin reading).<br /><br />The first option they call \\"Democracy Lite\\" in which there is a \\"short-term occupation\\" with an attempt \\"to establish a functioning democratic system,\\" and then a pullout. (p. 191)  The authors argue rather convincingly that this will never work mainly because the various political divisions within Iraq will prevent it, the Sunnis because they fear the Shi'a majority, the Shi'a because they don't really believe in democracy, and the Kurds because they want their own autonomous state.<br /><br />The next option is a long-term occupation (a minimum of ten years).  Here the prospects for democracy are better, but such an occupation is likely to unify the dissident elements of Iraq in an insurgency effort against a foreign power, as has happened in the past.  Indeed, the attacks against Coalition forces and those Iraqis who support the Coalition have increased substantially since this book was finished a year ago.  So the real question then becomes, how long will the American people put up with the cost in dollars and bloodshed before pulling out?<br /><br />The third option is the installation of a puppet regime and the quick withdrawal of US troops.  The authors call this the \\"default option\\" (p. 209) and condemn it as spelling \\"disaster for Iraq\\" and \\"seriously detrimental to U.S. interests.\\" (p. 211)<br /><br />Instead of these three options, the authors opt for a fourth possibility which they call \\"The Managed Partition of Iraq.\\"  The idea here is to give autonomy to the Kurds in the north, and to give the rest of the country to the Sunnis and the Shi'a, or to have that territory divided between them, with the Shi'a controlling the southern portion in a kind of \\"state of Basra\\" with \\"a mixed Sunni/Shi'a state of Baghdad in the center.\\" (p. 222)<br /><br />There are enormous problems with each of these options, as the authors painstakingly point out, and enormous uncertainties.  Clearly the Bush Administration does not agree with--or was unaware of--such obstacles when it embarked on its foolhardy invasion of Iraq.  Certainly, Bush's father knew enough of the history of Iraq and the region to realize that leaving Saddam Hussein in power was the best way to further American interests in the area since we had good control over the weakened dictator.  Bush the Second has ignored the lessons of history (and reality) for his \\"faith-based\\" scenario, which, according to the authors of this tightly argued and finely detailed book, can only lead to a nightmare since the prospect of a democracy any time soon is close to nil.<br /><br />Bottom line: This book can be read in two ways: from the beginning straight through for those of you who want the background information and history of the Iraqi state, or beginning with Chapter Eight where the authors give their take on the prospects for Iraq.  One can also, as in a textbook, read just the \\"Conclusion\\" sections at the end of each chapter, and then read Chapter Eight and the Epilogue.  Since I am not an expert, I found reading the book from cover to cover informative and definitely worth my time.  The presentation is clear, balanced and sharply realistic.ight through for those of you who want the background information and history of the Iraqi state, or beginning with Chapter Eight where the authors give their take on the prospects for Iraq.

482363:US	49786731	RAS3FI0AIZ7HQ	0140230122	590864729	The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size (Penguin Press Science)	Books	5	105	111	N	N	Human consciousness as a metaphor of the computer age	This is a wonderful book translated from the Danish by Jonathan Sydenham, written more or less from a quantum physicist's point of view by a science journalist, but very readable, marred slightly by a Western bias.<br /><br />One of the things learned here is that it takes half a second for our consciousness to be aware of what we're doing.  We don't notice this time lag because the mind back-peddles and makes it appear that we are on sync.  The mind must backtrack so that our system will know when in real time an event took place.  Reactions to things like removing a hand from a hot stove occur faster than our consciousness has time to be aware.  So the mind just reconstructs the event and there is the illusion that we were aware in real time.  We weren't.<br /><br />On page 256 is the example of a bicycle accident which happens too fast for the \\"I\\" to make a decision.  The decision is made for the \\"I.\\"  So, is the \\"I\\" of consciousness really in charge or is that an illusion?  The book's title gives Norretranders's opinion.  I tend to agree.  This is similar to the Buddhist idea that the ego-I of consciousness is an illusion.<br /><br />Norretranders makes a distinction between the \\"I\\" that is conscious and has a short bandwidth of perhaps 16 bits and the \\"Me\\" that is nonconscious and has a bandwidth of millions of bits.  The \\"I\\" thinks it is in charge, but all it has is a slow-moving veto.  On pages 268-269 Norretranders talks about how to get Self 2 (corresponds to the Me) \\"to unfold its talents.\\"  One method is to overload the \\"I\\" so that the \\"Me\\" is allowed to come to the fore.  Give it \\"so many things to attend to that it no longer has time to worry\\" or \\"veto.\\"  Then the inner Me comes forward and plays beautiful music, etc.  Similarly, we could say that the use of mantra, e.g., is effective as a meditation tool since it keeps the very verbal \\"I\\" occupied and allows the inner \\"Me\\" to come forward.<br /><br />Norretranders believes along with Julian Jaynes that consciousness arrived during recorded history or at least sometime during the first millennium B.C.  He also believes that the use of mirrors helped to develop that consciousness.  He notes (page 320) that \\"The use of mirrors became widespread during the Renaissance\\" which he says is \\"characterized by the reappearance of consciousness.\\" (Thus we have our Western bias.)<br /><br />On the subject of the half-second delay in our conscious recognition of what is happening to us (discovered by Benjamin Libet):  \\"If there were not half a second in which to synchronize the inputs, [from our senses] we might, as Libet puts it, experience a jitter in our perception of reality.\\" (p 289)<br /><br />In reference to the title metaphor, we find on page 291: \\"The user illusion, then, is the picture the user has of the machine\\" [ i.e., his body and brain]  \\"...[I]t does not really matter whether this picture is accurate or complete, just as long as it is coherent and appropriate.

Norretranders notes later on that, in this, Christianity may be out of bounds since the half second delay means that our consciousness has no control over what the Me or our nonconscious selves may be thinking.

482560:US	49786731	R9Y9HKW7YOV93	0375400117	823326041	Memoirs of a Geisha	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Veiled reality, beautifully realized	This begins as Charles Dickens might have written it, had he such a vision, continues as a fairy tale, and concludes as a strange and touching story of love spanning decades and ending in happiness and fulfillment.  But primarily this is a fairy tale, and like all fairy tales there is beneath the surface an underlying current of the dark nature of humanity that can only be glimpsed through the use of symbolism.  Just as the wolf in grandmother's bed represents something more than a wolf, so it is with the men attended by the geisha.  And so it is with her as well.  She projects the image of fairy tale beauty and an attentive loveliness, but is in fact a woman of business whose attentions are bought and sold, just as with any commodity.  This is the illusion and the pretense, and the soft, embroidered veil between us and the truth that is paid for.<br /><br />This is also a beautiful novel, charming and witty with just the barest touch of satire, an original work of a cunning genius, as readable as a best seller, as satisfying as a masterpiece.  Although written as realistic fiction and presented as the memoirs of someone who really did exist, the story and especially the action are veiled reality.  Notice that Sayuri is fifteen when she first learns of the significance of her virginity.  Since her captors would have put a very high price on maintaining that virginity until they could sell it, they would have taken very careful measures to ensure that she could not lose it; consequently, being the clever girl that she was, Sayuri would have understood what that meant.  And to suppose that she knew nothing of sexual intercourse until Mameha's story of the lonely eel and the cave...  Well, this is part of the contrivance and illusion maintained by geisha and its tradition.  But make no mistake, the girls know, but their knowledge must be expressed and understood euphemistically.<br /><br />There are a number of other \\"contradictions\\" in the novel that are of no real import because the world of the geisha is the world of illusion and fairy tale.  Although Chiyo never says so directly, she knew quite well what was being done to her sister in the house of ill-repute that she visited in the poor section of Kyoto.  There is something wonderful and alluring about this duplicitous view of human sexuality found in all cultures.  One of the wonderful things about Golden's novel is how he shows us its expression in the Japanese tradition.  When Hatsumomo's vagina is forcibly investigated by Granny and Mother looking for evidence of semen (and Chiyo is about ten years old) she understands what was found because she had seen the man between Hatsumomo's legs in the dim light through the partially opened door.  Adults find comfort in the illusion of a sexless childhood, comfort that can only be maintained through the artifice of self-deception.  Please note that this is not a criticism of the novel; on the contrary.  It is part of Golden's vision to realize that a fairy tale view of Chiyo's sexuality was necessary.  Note also the scenes with Mr. Tanaka when she appears as a naked nine-year-old.  Read carefully we can see that his sexual desire for her is apparent and is symbolically acted out through the device of her sister with the Sugi boy and Mr. Tanaka's bare touch of her cheek.  Incidentally Nitta Sayuri's narrative is coy by design, and it is this structure that allows Golden to so beautifully present this fairy tale world with its illusion of a foreign and bygone reality.<br /><br />But the fairy tale ends three-quarters of the way through, and then begins a counter point as the war and the hardships are brought home to the Japanese people and to Sayuri personally.  Now we have a tale stripped of illusion, devoid of symbolism, replete with the harsh reality of a civilian population with dwindling resources, impending loss, and the sound of bombers overhead...<br /><br />This is the kind of commerically and artistically successful novelthat makes other novelists despair of ever coming close.  The exquisite style, the confident scholarship, the ample energy so gracefully expended, the unerring sense of what is appropriate, the generous and apt use of metaphor, the clever plotting, the rich detail, the sure commercial feel: a publisher's dream, an agent's adrenal rush!

Wilson, one of the most distinguished scientists of our times, and a man I greatly admire, goes perhaps a bit beyond his area of expertise as he envisions a project that is perhaps beyond even the dreams of science fiction.  \\"...[A]ll tangible phenomena,\\" he writes on page 266, \\"from the birth of stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible, however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics.\\"<br /><br />This in a nutshell is his dream of \\"consilience.\\"  It is also the statement of a determinist.  My problem with such a laudable endeavor (and with determinism in general) is this: even if he is right, that the arts and the humanities will ultimately yield to reduction, how do we, limited creatures that we are, do it?  It seems to me that in the so-called soft sciences like sociology, economics, and psychology, for example, and even more so in the world of the humanities and the arts, reduction is so incredibly complex that such an attempt is comparable (in reverse order) of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.  It's ironic that Wilson uses almost exactly this metaphor on page 296 to explain why once the rain forests are chopped down, they're gone forever.  He notes, \\"Collect all the species...Maintain them in zoos, gardens, and laboratory cultures...Then bring the species back together and resynthesize the community on new ground.\\"  Will this work?  Wilson's answer is no.  He writes,  \\"...biologists cannot accomplish such a task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar budget.  They cannot even imagine how to do it.\\"  He adds, still on page 296, that even if biologists could sort and preserve cultures of all the species, \\"they could not then put the community back together again.  Such a task...is like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons.\\"<br /><br />This is exactly how I feel about the consilience of human knowledge.  I cannot even imagine how reductionism could help us to understand a poem.  There is a dictum among poets that \\"nothing defines the poem but the poem itself.\\"  No amount of reduction will allow us to understand what makes the poem tick.  This is because the poem is an experience, a human emotional, intellectual, sensual experience dependent upon not only the literal meaning of the words, but on their connotations, their sounds, their rhythm, their relationships to one another, their syntax, their allusions, their history, their use by other poets, etc., and also what the individual reader of the poem brings to the experience.  Reduce the poem and you do not have an understanding of the poem.  At best you have an essay on the poem, at worst something alien to the esthetic experience.  In essence, I should say that the problem with consilience is that our experience is not reducible.<br /><br />I have read a lot of what Professor Wilson has written, including On Human Nature (1978), the charming memoir, Naturalist (1994), parts of The Ants (1990) and his controversial, but ground-breaking and highly influential, Sociobiology (1975).  And I have read some of his critics, most recently essayist Wendell Berry's Life Is a Miracle (2000) and Charles Jenck's piece in Alas, Poor Darwin (2000).  What has struck me in these readings is the disconnection between what Wilson has written and what some critics have criticized him for writing!  For example it is thought that Wilson is a strict biological determinist when it comes to human behavior.  But here he writes, very clearly on page 126, \\"We know that virtually all of human behavior is transmitted by culture.\\"  Wilson has had to weather more than his share of unfair criticism because, as the father of sociobiology, which some mistakenly see as a furtherance of a rationale for eugenics, he has been made the target of the misinformed.  Additionally, Wilson is not the lovable sort of genius we adored in Einstein, nor the heroic scientist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants.  Some people make it clear that such a man should not presume to tell them anything about human beings and how we should conduct our lives or how we should view ourselves.  But I think they are wrong. Wilson brings unique insights into the human condition, and he has the courage of his convictions.  I think he is a man we should listen to regardless of whether we agree with him or not.<br /><br />Even if its central thesis is wrong, Consilience is nonetheless an exciting book, full of information and ideas, elegantly written, dense, at times brilliant, a book that cannot be ignored and should be read by anyone interested in the human condition regardless of their field of expertise.tist overcoming a terrible handicap as in the case of Stephen Hawking, but a slightly nerdish genius from Alabama who spent much of his life crawling around on the ground and in trees looking at ants.

488323:US	49786731	RO9XTW27E4UEP	0375412883	331182632	The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality	Books	5	20	23	N	N	An outstanding work and a challenging read	In some respects this book is an extension (and a substantial one) of physicist Brian Greene's well-received The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory (1999) in which he attempted the very difficult task of explaining relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory to the educated layperson while keeping the mathematics in footnotes.  Here he covers some of the same ground as he patiently and painstakingly illuminates some of the most important ideas in physics and cosmology, employing new ways to explain the nearly unexplainable.<br /><br />His watchword is \\"reality\\" and his overarching idea is that reality is not as we intuitively think it is.  (p. 5)  This is one of the startling revelations from relativity and the quantum world: namely that our perceptions and concepts built up through evolutionary experience are NOT adequate to understand the world of the very small or the very large.  The dual nature of the particle/wave is the most obvious example, and one that Greene examines at length.  We have no way of intuitively appreciating the fact that elementary particles are not just particles but waves as well--actually probability waves.  But there is also our notion of something and \\"nothing\\" that is being tested by modern physics.  What appears to be empty space is in fact far from empty.  Moreover, space itself has unsuspected qualities, as Greene demonstrates in his discussion of the postulated Higgs fields.<br /><br />Particularly exciting was the way Greene makes inflation credible (\\"the universe could easily have expanded by a factor of 10 to the 30th, 10 to the 50th or 10 to the 100th or more\\" within a time frame \\"as short as ten to the minus 35th seconds\\" p. 284) by positing that before the Higgs field made its phase transition, all quanta had zero mass.  It doesn't take much energy to move something with zero mass.  (Or maybe something with zero mass can't be moved at all.)  At any rate, very shortly after the big bang, space and presumably time, expanded enormously (faster than the speed of light, actually--but, as Greene, assures us, the speed limit on light does not apply to expanding space).<br /><br />In short what Greene does in this book is take the reader to the edge of what can be understood.  What he writes is exciting and awe-inspiring, and he writes so very well, and he works so hard at trying to reach every reader.  However you'll forgive me if I get some of this wrong.  And of course I am compelled to point out (as Greene does himself) that the Higgs field and therefore inflation, not to mention string theory and M-theory, etc., remain as yet in the category of the not proven.<br /><br />Obvious is Greene's faith in the \\"beauty\\" of mathematics to point the way to physical truth.  He recalls the work of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam in predicting the existence of W and Z particles because of the \\"strong faith these physicists had in the power of theory and the beauty of symmetry that gave them the confidence to go forward.\\" (p. 266)  Whether the beauty that physicists see in the equations for string theory, etc., will lead them to a deeper understanding of the cosmos remains to be seen.  Most readers are familiar with what one ugly fact can do to a beautiful theory.<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable parts of the book is Greene's delineation of time and time's \\"arrow.\\"  I have always been fascinated with time and have spent many hours trying to figure out what it is.  Reading between the lines, it would appear that Greene believes that events create time.  Or more precisely, that asymmetry creates time.  He writes \\"If the universe had perfect temporal symmetry--if it were completely unchanging--it would be hard to define what time even means.\\" (p. 228)  Of course this is somewhat circular, but I think I can add that if the universe were completely empty, it would also \\"be hard to define\\" what time means.<br /><br />On the question of \\"Does time havea direction?\\" Greene writes that \\"the laws of physics...show a complete symmetry between past and future.\\" (pp. 144-145)  Yet, in everyday life, time is always aimed toward the future.  An egg splatters.  It doesn't unsplatter.  Why is that?  Greene brings entropy into the picture, noting that entropy has increased since the big bang.  He explains that the unsplattered egg has a very low degree of entropy (that is, it is highly ordered, thanks to DNA, energy from the sun, etc.).  Eggs splatter more easily than they could ever hope to unsplatter because there are an uncounted number of ways that the egg can have high entropy (ways it can be splattered about) but only one (or very few) ways it can be pristine.  In a footnote on page 511 Greene articulates something that I have been waiting to hear from a prominent physicist.  Suppose the universe began to contract, seemingly reversing time's arrow.  Would eggs unsplatter?  Greene's answer: \\"Physical processes (eggs breaking, people aging, and so on) would still happen in the usual direction...\\"<br /><br />What impressed me the most about this book is just how well produced it is.  Greene improves on his previous opus in two important ways.  His explanations are more detailed and more accessible to the average reader; and his information and understanding are more up to date.  Furthermore, the book is beautifully presented with many drawings, a glossary, selected readings for further study, and a fine index.  There are 493 pages of text and 43 pages of notes.

It comes in two forms: one is pressure from government and corporate interests on media and citizens to behave in a way that furthers corporate interests; and the other is from the news media and ourselves, acted out in the form of prior censorship.  Thus the quote from Dan Rather: \\"We begin to think less in terms of responsibility and integrity, which get you in trouble...and more in terms of power and money...Increasingly anybody who subscribes to the idea that the job is not to curry favor with people you cover...finds himself as a kind of lone wolf...Suck-up coverage is in.\\" (p. 99)<br /><br />Media mavens know what their corporate bosses want to hear, and they are loath to go against them.  After all, their jobs are at stake.  So even though reporters and newscasters may be middle of the road or even left-leaning types, their public utterances tend to be in line with what their corporate bosses want to hear.  And as citizens we also know what our government and our bosses consider right behavior, and sometimes some of us are afraid to go against their wishes because, as Lapham points out, we might be found out.  With surveillance cameras on street corners and camera crews filming protest demonstrations, there is a very real chance that protestors will be caught on film.  How would such a photo look alongside a resum&eacute;? is what some people ask themselves; and, in consequence, they stifle themselves.  In chat rooms and discussion boards we often see people using nicknames so that their utterances and their real world personalities cannot be readily connected.<br /><br />In this long essay (parts of which appeared in Harper's Magazine) Lapham spends a considerable amount of time going back into American history and recalling the suppression of dissent by previous administrations.  In particular he shows how civil rights and civil liberties were taken away by our government during times of war or civil unrest.  He compares and contrasts the historical record with that of the Bush administration.  He makes the point that in declaring a \\"war\\" on terrorism, the Bush administration greatly augmented its ability to get around the Bill of Rights.  As Lapham phrases it, \\"by declaring 'war on terrorism' the Bush administration had declared war on an unknown enemy and an abstract noun...[which would be similar to] sending the 101st Airborne Division to conquer lust...\\" (p. 17)<br /><br />He adds, \\"We have a government in Washington that doesn't defend the liberty of the American people, steals from the poor to feed the rich, finds its wealth and happiness in the waging of ceaseless war.\\" (p. 165)  In general Lapham believes that \\"In every instance, and no matter what the issue immediately at hand, the purpose is the same--more laws limiting the freedom of individuals, few laws restraining the freedoms of property.\\" (p. 141)<br /><br />Working hand-in-hand with the interests of property is our mass media, which is controlled by corporate interests either directly or through their ability to withhold advertising dollars.  Lapham, who is the longtime editor of Harper's Magazine and an experienced reporter himself, makes a special point of exposing the failures of newscasters and reporters.  He recalls his days with the White House press corps: \\"I could never escape the impression of a flock of ducks--plump and well-kept ducks, ducks worthy of an emperor's garden--waddling back and forth to the pond on which the emperor's gamekeepers cast the bread crumbs of the news.\\" (p. 98)<br /><br />On the next page he quotes John Swinton, former chief of staff for the New York Times: \\"There is no such thing...in America, as an independent press...We are the tools and vassals for rich men behind the scenes...Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men.\\"<br /><br />Lapham sums it up this way: \\"The media compose the pictures of a preferred reality, and their genius is that of the nervous careerist who serves, simultaneously, two masters--the demos, whom they astound with marvels and fairy tales, and the corporate nobility, whose interests they assiduously promote and defend.\\" (p. 93)<br /><br />Assuming that Lapham is right, what is to be done?  How can we free the press from the corporate influence to the extent that reporters, editors, and newscasters can feel free to report the news as they see it, rather than as their bosses want them to see it?  Clearly the antidote to a government that would suppress liberties and stifle dissent is to elect people who will honor and respect the Bill of Rights.  But the media is another story since it is inexorably bound up with commercial interests.  Lapham does not have an answer to this conundrum.  And neither do I.  It is a curiosity that the Fourth Estate, powerful even during the time of the formation of the American colonies, is a de facto political force that is not part of the electorate and yet can influence elections.  And while it is not part of the government, it can influence government policy.<br /><br />One feels that as long as corporate interests control the media, the media will continue to be an anti-democratic force in our society.  This danger increases dramatically as larger and larger chunks of media fall into fewer and fewer hands.<br />Lapham sums it up this way: \\"The media compose the pictures of a preferred reality, and their genius is that of the nervous careerist who serves, simultaneously, two masters--the demos, whom they astound with marvels and fairy tales, and the corporate nobility, whose interests they assiduously promote and defend.\\" (p. 93) <br /> <br />Assuming that Lapham is right, what is to be done?

Would that it were not so.  But, writing in an incisive, rapid-fire style similar to that of his colleague, retired army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters (whom he often quotes and agrees with) Norval relies on words from the Prophet himself and his many followers as he cites historical and recent events to back up his argument, the main trust of which is that nothing can change bloody Islam and its fanatical hatred of the West.  Let me quote him:<br /><br />Islam is as dangerous a form of despotism, if not more so because of its religious sanction, than the political regimes of fascism or communism which ruled by political and military power while denying the relevance of religion.  Militant Islam is more akin to the despotism of the ancient world, where religion and state were combined so that any opposition was at once heresy and treason, thus making the idea of a \\"loyal opposition\\" impossible. (p. 76)<br /><br />And here he is quoting Muhammad: \\"The Lord destroy the Jews and Christians!  Let there not remain any faith but that of Islam throughout the whole of Arabia...\\"  Norval adds, \\"The followers of the faith have been hewing to those words and have been attempting to impose it on the rest of the world ever since.\\"  (p. 77)<br /><br />He also reminds us of Ayatollah Khameni's words from 1987: \\"We are at war with the United States...If the suffering people of Lebanon have recourse to capturing a few citizens of the satanic power, they have every right to do so...The end justifies the means as long as it furthers the goal of the Islamic fundamentalist--reforming and/or spreading the faith.\\" (p. 67)<br /><br />Finally here Norval is on events from the 12th century: \\"The crusades, far from being an outrageous example of Western imperialism as is taught by our PC educational system, were a reaction to the Islamic invasion of the Holy Lands and centuries of Islamic jihad.  The Islamic invaders had desecrated Christian places of worship and were savagely persecuting Christians.\\" (p. 68)<br /><br />Some of the book is devoted to Noval's ideas on war and how globalization, and what he sees as the weakening of nation states, has radically changed how wars will be fought.  One of his themes is what he calls \\"the new world disorder\\" (p. 129 and elsewhere) characterized by \\"roving banditry\\" and the \\"stationary bandit warlord.\\"  He is relying on the writings of the late Mancur Olson, University of Maryland economics professor, who saw the formation of the nation state as the inevitable result of the biggest bandit (or warlord) wising up enough to become stationary and impose taxes on his subjects rather than just robbing them.  This is perhaps another way of imagining how the unwritten \\"social contract\\" that we learned about in Poli Sci 101 came about.<br /><br />Norval also relies on the thinking of Harvard University's Samuel Huntington, who famously sees the war on terrorism as \\"a clash of civilizations\\"...a \\"revival of the centuries-old clash between Islam and the Christian West...\\" (Norval's words from page 173)<br /><br />With almost all of this I am in substantial agreement, including Norval's charge that \\"The root cause [of terrorism] is not poverty or illiteracy but the presuppositions of Islam\\" (p. 186).  However, where we part company is in this assertion:<br /><br />\\"We are...in the position of being under assault from without by a resurgent Islam, as well as from within as die-hard Marxists promote the suicidal Marxist ideology under the guise of multiculturalism in their continuing campaign to impose a communist paradise on the world.\\"<br /><br />This strange anachronistic statement is quote, unquote from page 198, and reveals that Norval is not playing with a full deck or is still fighting the ghost of the Cold War.  He goes on to quote Martin Van Creveld who opines, \\"Muhammad's recent revival may yet bring on that of the Christian Lord, and He will not be the Lord of love but of battles.\\"  Norval follows this enthusiasm with his own, \\"We cannot return to the glory days of the past, but we can hope that Van Creveld's statement about the revival of the Christian Lord comes true--and quickly at that.\\" (p. 199)<br /><br />Clearly Norval and Osama bin Laden agree on one thing: they are both true believers who want to \\"bring it on.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately I think most of the world (of non-fundamentalists) believe that there is a way around a horrific religious war implied by such thinking.  However, I am not so sure, given the present mindset of the Bush administration, that we are not falling into bin Laden's trap.  Norval complains that a \\"cult of multiculturalism dominates the American elites\\" (p. 198), but in fact it is the \\"born again\\" Christians in the person of George W. Bush and others in his administration that clearly constitutes American elitist power--at least as of this writing.<br /><br />Two other points: (1) this book was written before the Bush administration invaded Iraq (actually Norval obliquely predicted that such an action would help with Al Qaeda's recruiting efforts, as it has); and (2) this book is poorly edited with many typos and a lot of needless repetition.  Norval didn't bother with footnotes or a bibliography.<br /><br />In conclusion let me say that this book, despite its shortcomings, is very much worth reading mainly because if there's one thing Norval knows very well indeed, it is warfare in the mindset of the religious fanatic.\\"Muhammad's recent revival may yet bring on that of the Christian Lord, and He will not be the Lord of love but of battles.\\"  Norval follows this enthusiasm with his own, \\"We cannot return to the glory days of the past, but we can hope that Van Creveld's statement about the revival of the Christian Lord comes true--and quickly at that.\\" (p. 199) <br /> <br />Clearly Norval and Osama bin Laden agree on one thing: they are both true believers who want to \\"bring it on.\\" <br /> <br />Fortunately I think most of the world (of non-fundamentalists) believe that there is a way around a horrific religious war implied by such thinking.

(The exceptions are classics like The Third Man (1949), A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), and others which were produced before the advent of video and DVD.)  The reason, as every veteran film viewer knows, is that most movies shown in theaters today are aimed at a relatively young and unsophisticated mass audience, an audience that demands (producers believe) the sort of film that most of us have grown out of.<br /><br />Turan's book is in five parts, English Language Films, Foreign Language Films, Documentaries, Classics, and Retrospectives.  Characteristic English language films are, Election (1999), Heavenly Creatures (1994), Manny and Lo (1996), Proof (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), to name some that I have seen and reviewed myself, and 66 more.  Some foreign language films are, Autumn Tale (1998), Un Coeur en Hiver (1992), The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), Red (Trois Couleurs: Rouge) (1994), and 39 others.  There are 20 documentaries including, Black Harvest (1994), Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control (1997), The Saltmen of Tibet (1998), etc.  The classics include Das Boot (1981), Once Upon a Time in America (1984), Vertigo (1958), and nine others.  What the selections in this eclectic assemblage have in common is that they are all very much worth seeing--at least the ones that I have seen.  Indeed several of them--Un Coeur en Hiver, Red, Das Boot, A Streetcar Named Desire, etc.--are among the best movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />Turan's reviews are mostly appreciations (which is not surprising since these are his favorite films) written in a clear, informative style infused with the sort of background information and historical perspective that only an expert on film can provide.  Reading this volume is a film education in itself and a pleasure.  And for most people I think the value of the book is consistent with Turan's intent: that is, to point to films that the serious film-goer may have missed and to demonstrate why those films are very much worth seeing.<br /><br />The \\"Retrospectives\\" are essays inspired by \\"a specific film event\\" centered around individual film makers like Anthony Mann or the largely forgotten Frank Borzage, and others; or they are about genres or movements in cinema that Turan wanted to learn more about such as the Yiddish film or the Chinese martial arts film.  There is an essay on \\"Pre-Code Hollywood.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are like me and have to screen three or four films (i.e., actually rent them or buy them) to find one worth watching, then this book is a godsend.  Turan knows quality in film and he tells you why the film is worth watching, and his enthusiasm is contagious.th the sort of background information and historical perspective that only an expert on film can provide.

Panky	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Offensively funny	It's always nice to read a book from the humor aisle that is actually funny.  It's even better when the humor is delivered with cutting edge social commentary.  And it's nice when the author slices up cultural icons and political nitwits with gleeful wantonness.  Patrick M. Carlisle, in the persona of Henry E. Panky, \\"Associate of Arts (candidate),\\" does indeed delivery the belly-laughing goods, or to use his expression, \\"I laughed so hard my small intestine flopped out of my nose and onto my tie!\\" (p. 25)<br /><br />And to be honest I wasn't wearing a tie.  (But you get the picture.)  And the \\"picture\\" is part of what Carlisle is all about.  He wants us to see and feel and taste and hear the lunatic imaginings; and to that effect he writes with particular vividness on issues of cultural significance or insignificance, as the case may be.  For example, there is a nice essay entitled \\"O' Foreskin, Where Art Thou,\\" subtitled, \\"Ever get the feeling that something's, well...missing?\\" You know how the controversy rages today among soon-to-be soccer moms on whether to circumcise or not to circumcise.  Thank you Panky for your thoughts on this important tissue!  (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)<br /><br />I also liked his forthright take on the Ann Coulter phenomenon in a mock essay styled as a letter to Her Highness of Shock Jock Depravity.  Panky writes: \\"Compared to you, Rush is only an obnoxious and orotund orangutan on OxyContin, O'Reilly merely a vehement and imbecilic lout ('Shut up!'), jolly Olly North a grinning, driveling half-wit.\\" (p. 69)  On the next page Panky adds (imagining her toting an assault weapon in her book jacket photo),  \\"...nothing says 'patriot' like a jackbooted, spittle-lipped bottle-blonde fingering a greasy trigger.\\"<br /><br />Ah, to write like Panky!  One of his devices is to blend slightly twisted pop lyrics into the text.  In a missive to Dave Berry (p. 26), Panky laments, \\"...human beings can be so cold.  They'll disconcert you when they squirt you...\\"  Yes, that is a takeoff on Bob Dylan's \\"They'll stone you when you're riding in your car...\\" from \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35.\\"  Or contemplating a drug-induced liaison, Panky sings, \\"the fundamental truths apply as we get high.\\"  (er, \\"As Time Goes By.\\")<br /><br />Another is to come on in a bizarrely inappropriate way, especially with women, as in his \\"courtship\\" of Daphne in the essay entitled, \\"Search Engine of Love.\\"  But his most consistent technique is tongue-in-cheek self-debasement, as on page 30 where he sums up the eternal position of the little guy: \\"...while Karen was a strong, self-assured, varsity-gymnast Valkyrie, I...[was] a squeaking, longhaired, junior high school runt.  Social divides yawn no greater.\\"<br /><br />Panky also laments about things like his baldness and his unrequited love for Meg Ryan (\\"Making the case for a serious relationship.\\")  He recalls his nine weeks at Brown University.  (\\"Even utter strangers naturally sense my Ivy League roots.\\")  And in \\"My Tater Exploded\\" (\\"The margarine ran in rivulets, the salt poured down like rain...\\") he demonstrates the ethereal power of pure bathos.<br /><br />My two favorites pieces are<br /><br />(1) \\"Dubious Tidings from the Big Behind,\\" on the forthcoming Christian \\"Rapture\\": \\"In an cataclysmic instant, millions disappear...leaving behind baseball caps, nose rings, hearing aids and hairpieces. (Please note: The HairClub insists hairpieces shall participate in The Rapture.)\\"<br /><br />(2) \\"Something in the Danish,\\" which is a somewhat bitter lampoon of life within the corporate structure and of various corporate cog denizens.<br /><br />Bottom line: Carlisle is inventing a new art form, the mock essay once removed, which is part essay and part Saturday Night Live shtick.

516280:US	49786731	R19DG0GG2NHSQ	1586482475	787803321	Idiot Proof: A Short History Of Modern Delusions	Books	5	42	49	N	N	"The sleep of reason brings forth monsters"	I've read a number of books* exposing quackery, fake science, business and political fraud, deluded celebrities, lying politicians, the gullible and superstitious public, and the like, and I've enjoyed almost all of them.  What sets this book by Francis Wheen, who is a columnist for the London Guardian, apart from the others is the literary quality of his writing and his sharp cultural insight.  Wheen knows how to turn a phrase, he knows how to be expressive in an effective manner and he knows how to delight the reader with exactly the right barb delivered at exactly the right target with panache and style.  For example:<br /><br />Commenting on a satire of self-help books (especially Deepak Chopra's) by comic writers Christopher Buckley and John Tierney (\\"If God phones, take the call\\"; \\"Money is God's way of saying 'Thanks'!\\"), Wheen observes that their satires \\"serve only to confirm that the genre is beyond parody...\\"  He goes on to say that their second satirical law, \\"God loves the poor, but that doesn't mean He wants you to fly coach\\" is not more \\"hilariously absurd\\" than Chopra's \\"People with wealth consciousness settle only for the best.  This is also called the principle of highest first.  Go first-class all the way and the universe will respond by giving you the best.\\" (p. 47)<br /><br />Reacting to \\"post-modern anti-scientific relativism,\\" Wheen apprehends that \\"For those who regard rationality itself as a form of oppression...there is no reason why scientific theories and hypotheses should be 'privileged' over alternative interpretations of reality such as religion or astrology.\\" (p. 98)  Later he refers to \\"the enfeebling legacy of post-modernism--a paralysis of reason, a refusal to observe any qualitative difference between reasonable hypotheses and swirling hogwash.\\" (p. 111) This is similar to Bertrand Russell's observation, \\"Science is at no moment quite right, but it is seldom quite wrong, and has, as a rule, a better chance of being right than the theories of the unscientific\\" (as quoted on page 98).<br /><br />If only this truth could be more universally realized!<br /><br />On the newfangled terminology of the creationists, Wheen notes that they have \\"adopted a more scientific-sounding phraseology--'abrupt appearance theory,' 'intelligent-design theory'--to disguise the fact that their only textbook was the Old Testament.\\" (p. 100)<br /><br />Incidentally the quote in my subject line (\\"The sleep of reason brings forth monsters\\") is from page seven where Wheen identifies the monsters as both \\"manifestly sinister\\" (try Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Osama Bin Laden and other fundamentalists) and \\"merely comical\\" (e.g., Nancy and Ronald Reagan and their reliance on astrology).  By the way, I lump Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Osama Bin Laden together because of this pronouncement from the TV evangelists just two days after 9/11: \\"What we saw on Tuesday, as terrible as it is, could be minuscule if, in fact, God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve.\\"  So spoke Rev. Falwell.  He attributed the mass murders to God's wrath at \\"the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians...the ACLU, People for the American Way, all...who try to secularize America.\\"  Rev. Robertson responded with a forthright, \\"I totally concur.\\"  (p. 177, and widely reported in the media).<br /><br />Wheen's point is that as rationality goes out the window--and there is increasing evidence, a lot of it presented here, that much of the world has indeed abandoned reason in favor of unreason and religious superstition--monstrous ideas and personages come flying in.  It is ironic in an almost cosmic sense that in the modern world, a world equipped with the stupendous tools of science and technology, most people still follow Bronze Age gods and think like the uneducated followers of warlords and tribal chieftains.<br /><br />A nice way to sum up Wheen's thesis is this quote from Salman Rushdie: \\"In one pan of the scales we now have General Relativity, the Hubble Telescope and all the imperfect but painstakingly accumulated learning of the human race, and, in the other, the Book of Genesis.\\" (p. 101)<br /><br />Needless to say this book will not sit well with a lot of people.  Wheen not only slaughters sacred cows, but attacks the bozos on both sides of the political aisle.  His critique of idiocy in the Bush and Blair administrations (in addition to his frequent recall of the voodoo delusions of Maggie Thatcher and Ronnie Reagan) is to be expected of course, but his devastating devaluation of Bill Clinton comes as something of a surprise.  Here he is on the man who would redefine the meaning of \\"is\\": \\"...a man of no discernible moral scruples who in 1992 interrupted his primary campaign and hastened back to Arkansas to execute a brain-damaged black man, Rickey Ray Rector, solely to forestall any suspicion that he was soft.\\" (p. 191)<br /><br />Add this to the delight that Wheen takes in going after beloved cultural icons like Princess Diana and one sees why some reviewers do not like this book.  Ignore them.  True, Wheen wanders about in idiot land indiscriminately at times, and indeed has pasted together his anti-enthusiasms in places like a patchwork quilt; but his keen lambasting of the spouters of what Bob Dylan called \\"the idiot wind\\" is well worth the price.  Bottom line: this book is a lot of fun to read.<br /><br />(...)the scales we now have General Relativity, the Hubble Telescope and all the imperfect but painstakingly accumulated learning of the human race, and, in the other, the Book of Genesis.\\" (p. 101)    Needless to say this book will not sit well with a lot of people.

At first I thought it was the \\"American Beauty\\" thing, you know, the desecration of middle America through satire that the Heartland will not tolerate in either Oscar-winning movies or attempts at The Great American Novel (such as might be mentioned on Oprah).  Then I thought it was the sheer length of Franzen's tome (as one reviewer so succinctly and dryly observed, \\"He left nothing out\\") and his \\"Look Ma, I'm writing\\" grandstanding.  But along about page 370 or so I realized the truth: yes, it is some of the above, but more than anything it's the sexuality and especially the sexual portrait of Denise Lambert that some people don't like.<br /><br />Did Franzen come up with a living, breathing Portrait of the Lesbian as a Young Woman?  I don't think so.  I don't think that Denise's character and her sexuality were properly integrated.  He has Denise learn her attitude or \\"technique,\\" if you will, from three different older men, a somewhat crude threesome that no self-respecting Sappho would imitate even for contrast.  Her \\"childlessness,\\" (that Enid frets over) is a result of being involved with the wrong men.<br /><br />Additionally, while circumspect and careful to avoid the grossest of crudities in his recollecting of human sexuality, Franzen nonetheless sometimes shows a distinct lack of sensitivity.<br /><br />Furthermore, the depressing story of Alfred Lambert, particularly his physical and mental decline told in excruciating detail, made us wonder about the purpose of life and left us more than a little afraid for ourselves when contemplating our declining years.<br /><br />Could Franzen have used a better editor?  Perhaps.  But what editor would have the confidence to  trim a Great Artist in the Making?  Editors today are largely acquisition experts and salespersons.  Today's novelist is essentially alone.  Maxwell Perkins died a long time ago.<br /><br />Okay, what is the strength The Corrections?  (Incidentally the title refers to not only to the Heartland of America in need of corrections scenario that Franzen so well chronicles, but with the coming \\"correction\\" in the stock market, and the corrections that Enid urged on everyone including herself, and finally the correction of life itself with death.)<br /><br />Franzen's strength is in his vivid and consistent characterizations, his complete narrative control, his sharp dialogue and his inner monologues, as right as rain, and his veracious social and cultural detail.  He recalls the spats of domestic infighting so vividly that we feel we are there (perhaps again).  He can take both sides in equal appreciation and then show us in commentary and steams of consciousness just how delusive are the combatants, just how blind they are to their narrow-minded, selfish behaviors.<br /><br />For example, Gary and Caroline are arguing about whether they should go to his parents for Christmas (the main plot line of the novel).  Caroline faults her mother-in-law: \\"...as soon as I leave the room she's going to...take food from the trash and feed it to my children-\\"  At the same time she tells Gary he is clinically depressed and needs to seek treatment.  Meanwhile Gary sneaks gin and obsesses with control issues.  He feels laughed at in his own home (and he is).  It is all a battle for the upper hand, domestic politics at the front, which means in bed, at the dinner table, using the kids as allies, blaming the in-laws for the bad nurturing and the flawed genetic input.  In other words, life at home next door.<br /><br />Naturally this will not sit well with some people.  Life seen up close and full of warts is not the sort of thing that many people want in their fiction.  They want to be uplifted and made glad.  If they wanted gross reality and the sheen rubbed off they'd go see an art film or visit THEIR in-laws.  So I can understand how some people feel that a sign reading \\"this way liesdepression\\" ought to be affixed to this novel; indeed Franzen's characters leave us uninspired and a little sad realizing how close we are to them.  They achieve a superficial level of self-awareness and then stop.  Cold.  (Do we do that?)  They are the blind, and Franzen has cleverly persuaded us that we the readers are the sighted.<br /><br />There's a lot of sex in this novel, but then again there's a lot of sex in human beings, whether we like it or not.  Franzen's technique is to employ an unsettling honesty.  His inner monologues with Chip and Gary may seem excessive, but if we can recall ourselves at thirty-something we know that sexual obsession was always just beneath the radar of overt consciousness, occasionally rising bodaciously to the surface.<br /><br />In the final analysis I think that Franzen tried to do too much.  Some of his readers are annoyed that they had to read such a long novel, and \\"had to\\" is appropriate because Franzen's narrative is compelling.  We want to finish the book because his characters are interesting and we want to find out what happens to them.  This in itself is a great triumph for a novelist.  I just think that Franzen could have spared us most or all of (for example) Denise's sexual misadventures.  The satire of the seniors aboard the cruise ship was fine and the Lithuanian and biomed excursions familiar but tolerable.  The long drawn-out decline and fall of Alfred and how it affected his family, especially his wife, was really the emotional and thematic heart of the novel: We are flesh; partly sighted, partly blind; we decline, decay, lose our faculties and expire.  Rhyme or reason notwithstanding.<br /><br />Read this book.  You may like it, you may not.  Regardless, it will be hard to deny that this is a genuine novel, an all-too-rare attempt at going inside the human psyche to reveal something psychologically real.  As I like to say, \\"What could be truer than fiction?\\"  Real fiction, that is.ing \\"this way lies depression\\" ought to be affixed to this novel; indeed Franzen's characters leave us uninspired and a little sad realizing how close we are to them.  They achieve a superficial level of self-awareness and then stop.  Cold.  (Do we do that?)

That people like Limbaugh, Coulter, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, George W., Dick Chaney, etc., lie would hardly seem noteworthy, yet Franken has constructed an entire book (with the gofer and research help of some young people from Harvard whom he dubs \\"TeamFranken\\"--photo on page 368 with mini-bios following) that chronicles and exposes their lies while he lampoons them to death (almost literally).<br /><br />What I think Franken had in mind here was a new kind of journalism: what you do is present the facts about the miscreants along with ironic exaggerations, sarcasm, SNL and Mad Magazine shtick, and what you get is an expos&eacute; that's fun to read and affords the reader plenty of belly laughs along with the indignation.  What he sometimes reveals, especially when he waxes maudlin, is the true bleeding heart of a liberal letting it all hang out, as in the chapter on the memorial for Minnesota's Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone.<br /><br />In this endeavor I give Franken a gentlemen's \\"B\\" while noting that if you're on the right this is decidedly NOT a funny book (except perhaps for the tasteless joke about Elton John on page 158).  Otherwise, some of this may be very funny.  If you're the kind of person who actually listens to Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly (why you would want to do that, I don't know--or I should say, HOW you can do that, I don't know), then this will read like a subversive plot to destroy everything sacred in America by some foul-mouth comedian released from his namby-pamby inhibitions, if he had any.<br /><br />I heard about \\"Lies...\\" while listening to NPR's Terry Gross interviewing Bill O'Reilly who was whining about the book and how he was depicted therein, especially his \\"splotchy\\" pix on the cover.  He later whined about how Terry Gross treated him before he walked out on her, claiming that she was a lot nicer to Al Franken when she interviewed him.  I heard that interview too, and it was clear that, doggone it, she did like Franken better.  (I think she couldn't help herself.)<br /><br />Anyway, by now everybody knows the story of how \\"Lies...\\" became a #1 Bestseller thanks to Fox News suing Franken for his use of what they thought was their propriety slogan \\"Fair and Balanced\\" in his title.  The resulting publicity vaulted Franken to the top.  Curious minds (like mine) wanted to know what the stink was all about.  Hey, guys at Fox, smooth move.<br /><br />All right.  All right.  I got too much in the spirit of things there.  Sorry.  Anyway, \\"Fair and Balanced\\" this book is not, and of course Franken used the phrase ironically and as a special dig at the right-wing leaning Fox News people.  He really does have a...bee in his bonnet, if you will, about those shock jocks on the right.  Perhaps he asked himself, How many AM radio talk shows are hosted by liberals?  Try something like close to zero, or zay'row as the French say.  That's nada, and you want to know why?  Because people on the left are different from people on the right.  People on the left like to think of themselves as above such Neanderthal hate-mongering, slogan-yelling, pseudo-righteous blathering and bullying; instead you will find them tuned discretely to NPR or the BBC or catching the latest feminist play at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.  As for real doctrinaire lefties of the bleeding heart variety they can be found listening to Pacifica radio as it spins multicultural music and first person reports from the disadvantaged in Palestine or the jungles of South America.  Liberals do NOT rant and rave or tell barnyard jokes in public. Please.<br /><br />So I don't know how well this will sit with people on the left.  (People on the right will burn it along with their Dixie Chicks CDs.)  But I would like to make an observation.  Most successful political books are highly partisan, and they have a predictable readership: people on the right want it spelled out that liberals are commies and traitors, etc., while people on the left want it noted that George W. was a drunk, dodged serving in Vietnam, and is so immoral that he is giving the US treasury to his friends at Halliburton (that's with two \\"l's\\", taxpayers), Big Oil, Big Pharma, etc., while waging a stupid war for self-aggrandizement and the photo opportunity in fighter pilot gear aboard an aircraft carrier.  So popular political books tend to be one-sided.  This one is no exception.<br /><br />Another thing: doctrinaire conservatives and doctrinaire liberals are swayed not one iota by argument because their beliefs are religious beliefs, held regardless of evidence.  I think the genetic pool of the human species includes genes that can be expressed for change or against change, depending on the early experience of the individual, and these left and right inclinations are not rationally held but are largely genetic.  Ask yourself, have you ever seen a dyed-in-the-wool conservative or liberal swayed by rational argument or the preponderance of evidence?<br /><br />I didn't think so.

520230:US	49786731	R3D48ZGFHZ17OO	0140282025	132792490	The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Inventing the future	While Kurzweil makes it clear that he believes it is \\"inevitable\\" that machine intelligence will exceed human intelligence--see especially page 253--he adds some clarifying \\"Failure Modes\\" on page 256.  The most significant one is the possibility that \\"the entire evolutionary process\\" will be destroyed (think: a supernova in the neighborhood); but there is also the possibility that humans \\"together with...[our] technology may destroy\\" ourselves before we get there (think: replicating Osama Bin Ladens, perhaps as nanobots).<br /><br />But more interesting than the general theme are the implications.  Kurzweil writes, \\"Improving our lives through neural implants on the mental level, and nanotechnology-enhanced bodies on the physical level, will be popular and compelling.\\"  (This is sometime after machines have gotten a lot smarter than we are and can help us with these tasks.)  Kurzweil adds, \\"It is another one of those slippery slopes--there is no obvious place to stop this progression until the human race has largely replaced the brains and bodies that evolution first provided.\\" (pp. 140-141)<br /><br />What Kurzweil is getting at might be expressed with these words, \\"Au revoir, carbon-based, humanoid bipeds!\\"  In effect, he is saying that we will go the way of the dodo.<br /><br />It has long been a staple of science fiction that humans will be replaced by artificial intelligence, what Kurzweil calls \\"spiritual machines.\\"  We are toast, it's just a matter of when. What we didn't know was how and how soon.  Kurzweil has the answer.  We will replace ourselves with the artifacts of our technology, and we'll do it sooner rather than later.  He believes there will no longer be \\"any clear distinction between humans and computers\\" by the year 2099.  At the same time \\"Most conscious entities\\" will \\"not have a permanent physical presence.\\" (p. 280)  We will have become \\"software.\\"  Incidentally there will be no pain or sense of death along the way.  It will happen as gradually and as imperceptibly (to us) as grass growing.  To paraphrase T. S. Eliot:  This is the way our world ends.  Not with a bang, not even with a whimper.<br /><br />One of the striking things about Kurzweil's perception is that our children may live to see such a day, our grandchildren almost for sure.  Wow.  The implications of this spiritual transformation (to conjure up some perhaps apt New Age terminology) are beyond mind-boggling, they are mind-deleting!<br /><br />Yes, get ready to have your mind deleted.  But it will be no big deal.  This will happen some time after it is downloaded into a secure and long-lived spiritual machine.  You won't care.  The old biological you will transpire and the new happy you will live a long, long time.  Or, another scenario is that you will be replaced so gradually that at no time will you realize that you are being replaced.  The incremental changes will all seem positive and life-enhancing.  As Kurzweil reminds us, the atoms in our bodies are replaced again and again as we pass through the events of our lives and at no time do we have any sense of dying.<br /><br />It may seem a bit astonishing but I think Kurzweil is on to something here.  And I'm not the only one.  Futurists around the world are very excited about the prospects that Kurzweil discusses in this book.  For an example of the implications of these ideas and others, you might want to check out the \\"singularitywatch\\" web site.  Site master John Smart believes that the rapidly accelerating pace of technological change is so explosive that as early as the year 2040 our technology will be so far in advance of today's that it will constitute from our viewpoint a \\"singularity.\\"  We cannot see across the event horizon from this side, but even if we could, we would not be able to comprehend what we saw.  In effect, the future is invisible but can be discerned by the implications of our present technology and by an appreciation of what Kurzweil calls the \\"Law of Accelerating Returns.\\"<br /><br />I've always been one for fantastic ideas.  I love the \\"many worlds\\" interpretation of quantum mechanics mainly because of the wondrous way it frees the mind.  To imagine that a new universe is created with every quantum event is about as fantastic as it gets.  The implication of such a mind expansion is that the reality of existence is vastly greater than anything we can imagine, and--guess what?--it is.<br /><br />For this reason alone I consider this a wonderful book, and I will not quibble about Kurzweil's many predictions, nor will I point out that the \\"Law of Accelerating Returns,\\" which he derives from his more fundamental \\"Law of Time and Chaos\\" are laws in the same sense that Moore's Law is a law; that is, not in a scientific sense but in an observational and logical sense.  They are predictions made from limited observations, and like all such predictions are subject to conditions and influences we know nothing about.<br /><br />What is absolutely fascinating about the ideas presented in this book is the way they make us think about what it means to be alive and have consciousness.  The Eastern idea that we don't die and that our ego is an illusion fits very comfortably into a scenario that includes the gradual transformation of ourselves from carbon-based beings to software, or put another way, our gradual transformation to pure information.  For a rationalist, being pure information may be what is meant by being spiritual.<br /><br />In short, what Kurzweil is postulating is nothing less than the end of life as we know it.  For those who imagine that we are the immutable handiwork of a supernatural being, this is a heresy.  For others who see humans as part of a larger process on the way to becoming, this book is something akin to an important sutra.w of Accelerating Returns.\\" <br /> <br />I've always been one for fantastic ideas.

536754:US	49786731	RC17N0H7UV0BX	0553208845	36215520	Siddhartha	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Beautiful, poignant, uplifting: a great novel	This beautiful and poetic novel about the life of the Buddha is not about the life of the Buddha, per se, or so Herman Hesse (it's a German name: the final \\"e' is pronounced like a soft English \\"a') would have us believe.  \\"Siddhartha,\\" meaning \\"the accomplished one\\" is one of the traditional names of the Buddha, but in this novel Siddhartha (from the Sanskrit so that the \\"h's\\" are silent) encounters the Buddha in his travels and gains by what he learns from the Enlightened One.  Yet the life so wondrously depicted here is closely patterned after the traditional life of the Buddha, and where it is not, it is highly plausible.  I think Hesse started out to write a life of the Buddha but at some point realized that his sometimes spiritual, sometimes profane depiction might offend some Buddhists, and so he had Gotama, the Perfect One himself, appear as a separate character while keeping the life and the traditional name for his hero.<br /><br />At any rate, this is one of the great novels of the twentieth century, or any century for that matter.  It begins with Siddhartha's royal birth in India in the Sixth Century BCE into a Brahmin's life of privilege and wealth, continues through Siddhartha's traditional discovery of poverty, death, disease and pain as he wanders outside the royal estates, and his consequent desire to conquer or somehow come to terms with what he sees, things he had been sheltered from since birth.  Thus we have the fundamental tenant of Buddhism: Life is suffering.  The scene where the young Siddhartha confronts his father and stands up all night to show his resolve is one of the greatest \\"coming of age\\" scenes ever written.<br /><br />And that is what really makes this novel: the character of Siddhartha himself.  Hesse has created a seeker who is a real life hero: kind, brave, strong of will and decisive, intelligent, modest, confident, honest, hardworking, unprejudiced, self-questioning and sometimes self-doubting, somebody we can identify with and admire.  He goes through the temptations and the travails of life, sometimes weakening and sometimes distracted, finally finding salvation only after he has tried not only asceticism, but indulgence, not just renunciation, but a Tantric-like embracing of all things social and profane.  In a sense this is a generalized life of the true seeker after spiritual enlightenment, a life that pleases not just Buddhists, but Christians and Hindus and those from other faiths as well because it is a portrait of humanity at our finest and our truest, out of the entangled bank and toward the stars.<br /><br />The deceptive simplicity of the story makes it accessible to readers of all ages and walks of life, and greatly rewards a second and a third reading.  In the United States it is often part of a superior high school curriculum.  It is inspirational not only for the spiritually inclined, but for young people of all ages, and in writing it, Hesse did a service for humanity greater than a thousand sermons.<br /><br />I should add that the English translation of the German by Hilda Rosner is itself a work of art, graceful, balanced, every word so natural that one is unaware that the work was written in another language.<br /><br />The story ends with Siddhartha finding the peace that passeth all understanding, learned from a simple ferry boatman as he listens to the timeless voice of the river as it flows, expressing all that is or has been or will be.th and admire.

Each section is then concluded with indications of how these problems might be solved.  There are some nice cartoons by Sidney Harris to augment the text.<br /><br />The five \\"biggest\\" problems are (from different disciplines and not without controversy):<br /><br />1. The nature and origin of mass.  (Why do some particles have mass while others do not?)<br /><br />It is obvious that we really do not understand the nature of mass from our inability to form a unified theory involving gravity, a theory that would unify quantum mechanics and relativity.  Indeed I think physicists are just whistling in the dark when they talk about particles and fields.  It's clear to even this casual observer that the real nature of particles/waves, particles/fields is not really understood, and perhaps cannot be understood in anything other than a once or twice removed mathematical sense.  We can write equations that describe what we observe, but the intrinsic nature of all phenomena remains veiled.  We avoid infinities in the mathematics of physics as a long-observed and much beloved rule (something like Occam's Razor) with the result that we (necessarily) \\"construct\\" limits on the physical world like those named after Max Planck.  Beyond (or \\"below,\\" or \\"under\\" or \\"smaller than,\\" etc.) those limits is potentially a whole universe of physics much like what might be beyond the Big Bang in cosmology.<br /><br />Authors Wiggins and Wynn acknowledge that the Standard Model of physics has a \\"dark side\\" (p. 30) and that the long-sought Higgs field particle may be a \\"mathematic convenience.\\" (p. 31)  From my point of view everything in physics (and this includes all of string theory) that has not met with experimental proof is possibly a \\"mathematical convenience.\\"  This is not to denigrate physics or physicists.  On the contrary.  What physicists have accomplished toward an understanding of the world in which we live stands as one of humankind's most glorious achievements.  The problem is that (as quoted from J.B.S. Haldane on page 159) \\"the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.\\"  In other words don't hold your breath for the dreamed-of \\"Theory of Everything.\\"  And if it arrives, don't imagine that \\"everything\\" really is \\"everything.\\"<br /><br />2.  How did lifeless chemical reactions become life?<br /><br />The authors present some of the history (Stanley Miller's primordial soup experiment; panspermia, etc.), outline the problems, tell us a little about DNA and RNA, and finish with how the puzzle might be solved and by whom.  I would observe that imbedded within this question is a theoretical bugaboo that first needs to be resolved.  We have to agreeably define what \\"life\\" is before we can hope to make a distinction between very complex but \\"lifeless\\" self-replicating molecules and molecules forming living organisms.  As such, the problem is one of definition as much as anything else.  Clearly if we left out our notion of things living as opposed to things not living, we might discover a step-by-step continuum without a clear demarcation point.<br /><br />3. How do proteins control cells and tissues?  (\\"What is the complete structure and function of the proteome?\\")<br /><br />The authors note that since the genome has been mapped and sequenced, \\"the unsolved problem\\" in biology \\"has shifted\\" to \\"How do protein molecules built from directions provided by [the]...genomes contribute to the structure and function of organisms?\\" (p. 71)  A very complex problem indeed, but at least it is a practical problem and not a theoretical one, and as such (unlike some others in this book) is one that conceivably can be solved through a whole lot of hard work.<br /><br />This is about cells and how they function.  The authors reprise the genome mapping and sequencing story, and then point to \\"Protemics: The Next Frontier.\\"<br /><br />4. Can we predict the weather?  (Or, how accurate can our weather predictions be?)<br /><br />This of course is about complexity theory and why that famous butterfly in the Sahara continues to influence the formation of hurricanes in the Carribean.<br /><br />Quick answer: accuracy will continue to fall off as the square of the distance in time.  Just joking, but clearly the more lengthy the forecast, the more uncertain it will continue to be.<br /><br />5.  Why is the universe expanding faster and faster?<br /><br />Ah, yes.  What IS the nature of Einstein's fudge factor that has recently returned?  I love this one.  The real question is what IS all that dark energy and dark matter out there?  As the authors point out only 4%(!) (see page 129) of all the matter in the universe is accounted for in terms of things seen.  Seventy-three percent is in the form of dark energy and another 23% in the form of dark matter.  It is amazing to realize that over 90% of what exists is stuff we know next to nothing about!<br /><br />A nice part of the book are the \\"folders\\" at the back in which many other interesting issues are briefly presented.  The problems in the \\"Problem Folder\\" are organized according to disciplines, \\"Physics Problems,\\" Chemistry Problems,\\" etc.  There are sixteen ideas in the \\"Ideas Folder,\\" including such things as anti-matter, protein folding, chaos theory, global warming, and so on.<br /><br />Bottom line: Wiggings and Wynn do a good job of introducing the general reader to what scientists at the horizon are working on.  It's really amazing to realize how far we've come as knowledge-seeking creatures, and then to get a glimpse of how incredibly much there is we don't know.they function.

543475:US	49786731	R3EKBNCPFTWSA9	0195159071	492961950	A Brief History of the Mind: From Apes to Intellect and Beyond	Books	5	26	26	N	N	The rise of "beyond the apes" intelligence	The central event in this book is the human mind's so-called \\"big bang\\" which occurred some 90,000 to 50,000 years ago.<br /><br />(These are neurobiologist William Calvin's numbers from page 111 where he notes that \\"it now appears that humans were behaviorally modern before the last great Out of Africa\\" which is now understood as taking place between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago, as determined by the latest tweaking of the mitochondrial DNA dating data.)<br /><br />Professor Calvin leads up to this event by starting with the proto ape that was our ancestor (and the ancestor of modern apes) that lived some seven million years ago.  He takes us from that ape's jungle habitat to the woodlands, where our ancestors learned to walk upright, to the savannahs where they ran down, killed and ate large game animals.  Somewhere along the way we got smart.  But, Calvin wonders, did we get smart enough?<br /><br />He sees a disconnect between our abilities and the world we have inherited.  He asks: \\"Where does mind go from here, its powers extended by science-enhanced education and new tools--but with its slowly evolving gut instincts still firmly anchored to the ice ages?\\"  Are we just a \\"rough-around-the-edges prototype, the preliminary version that evolution never got a chance to further improve before the worldwide distribution occurred?\\" (p. 178)<br /><br />In other words, are we using Stone Age instincts to cope with Information Age problems?  It is interesting to note that in psychologist Keith Stanovich's recent book The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin (2004) he is concerned with the same problem from an entirely different point of view.  He writes about the \\"potential mismatches between the cognitive requirements of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation and those of the modern world.\\"<br /><br />Of course the problem, as both writers point out, is that cultural evolution out-sprints the biological so that our genotypes are still in the woodlands and on the savannahs as the ice ages come and go while our phenotypes have to deal with traffic jams, weapons of mass destruction, and the paperwork for our HMOs.<br /><br />One of Calvin's more intriguing ideas comes from his dictum that \\"behavior invents and...New form follows new function.\\" (p. 159)  He argues that the higher intellectual functions of humans came from the development of a \\"structured suite\\" of brain machinery that \\"is shared in part with some nonintellectual functions.\\" (p. 94)  He sees \\"accurate throwing\\" as part of this structured suite, and argues that learning to hit a moving target (say a small animal), because it involved several parts of the body (hand, wrist, arm, shoulder--and eyes and legs for that matter) in close coordination, several parts of the brain were used simultaneously as well.  Consequently a \\"structured suite\\" developed in the brain that later was used for the development of symbolic language.  What he is saying is that, the syntax of language--that is, the \\"something\\" does \\"something\\" to \\"something\\": the subject-verb-object structure of language that works so magically for us--actually came from the body's experience running down game in Africa.<br /><br />I think Calvin is on to something here because that syntactic structure which is common to people everywhere, regardless of what language they speak, mirrors the action of the world.  What is important in the environment is what is being done or what is happening (the verb), by whom and to whom (or what): the bull gores the lion; the monkey peels the fruit, the wind blows the tree down, etc.<br /><br />Another of Calvin's pet ideas is that education \\"perhaps more than any of the imagined genetic changes\\" is what will best help us cope with the challenges of the modern world. (p. 184)  He argues that if children are exposed to \\"structured stuff\\" at younger ages, and if they can \\"softwire their brains to better handle\\" such stuff, \\"the more precocious children will soon double the amount of structured speech heard by the next generation.\\" (p. 154)<br /><br />Of course our brains are still being \\"softwired\\" after we leave the womb and for some many months afterwards as our experiences serve to strengthen certain neurons and discard others.  It seems, however, that Calvin is getting at something larger here, a kind of quasi-Lamarckian accelerated evolutionary process.  Indeed I think he intends this example as a possible explanation for the \\"big bang\\" that took place in the Pleistocene.  To be honest I have no idea whether he is right or not.  Certainly it is an interesting idea.<br /><br />Interesting is this comment from page 104: \\"[M]uch of [our] higher intellectual function seems half-baked, what you ordinarily see in a prototype rather than a finished, well-engineered product.

It seems, however, that Calvin is getting at something larger here, a kind of quasi-Lamarckian accelerated evolutionary process.

Certainly it is an interesting idea. <br /> <br />Interesting is this comment from page 104: \\"[M]uch of [our] higher intellectual function seems half-baked, what you ordinarily see in a prototype rather than a finished, well-engineered product.

The fact that we \\"won\\" the cold war is seen as fortuitous and irrelevant.  His attack on Edward Teller, Reagan's trusted science advisor, and his phony \\"super excaliber\\" x-ray laser is close to hilarious, and reminds me a little bit of some of the shtick in the film \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\"<br /><br />Park also takes apart the cold fusion delusion which he says went from incompetence to self-deception to outright fraud.  He quotes the science editor of an Italian newspaper who called  Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, the University of Utah scientists who concocted the delusion, \\"fornicating priests\\" for their betrayal of science and for defiling \\"the temple of truth.\\"<br /><br />Other targets include parapsychologists and their statistical \\"proofs\\"; NASA (for its manned space program instead of a robotic program that is both cheaper and more effective); homeopathic medicine, which Park claims is no medicine at all beyond a placebo value; Congress for being duped by the likes of Joe Newman and his infinite energy machine, and others; the media, especially Paul Brodeur of the New Yorker for ranting about a nonexistent connection between electromagnetic fields and cancer, and Michael Guillen of ABC news for TV \\"entertainments\\" that lent credence to a certain James Patterson and his magical energy beads as well as to such notions as psychokinesis and astrology.<br /><br />Park even goes after that darling of public television and the New Age set, best-selling author, Deepak Chopra.  He writes, \\"Physicists wince at Chopra's use of the word quantum in the context of a discussion of cancer.\\"  He suggests that \\"Dr. Chopra's familiarity with quantum theory consists of having read Hawking's enormously popular book on cosmology, A Brief History of Time\\" (p. 193).  He adds on page 208, \\"We cannot help but notice...that the author of Ageless Mind shows unmistakable signs of growing old right along with the rest of us.\\"<br /><br />I like the way Park shows that governmental secrecy is often just a way of keeping incompetence and delusion, fraud and embarrassing mistakes covered up.  He gives not only examples from the U.S. but describes how the French government under Valery Giscard d'Estaing covered up $200-million that was thrown away on a so-called \\"sniffer plane,\\" an aircraft with a device that was supposed to be able to map mineral deposits from the air. Turns out it was just a bold-faced fraud dreamed up by a Count de Villegas.<br /><br />In short, Park has both barrels loaded, takes dead aim and blasts fake science to smithereens.  Unfortunately, somebody else will just have to do it again next week, since everybody knows people love to believe, be it aliens or vast conspiracies or just in the seductive \\"myth of the self-educated genius fighting against a pompous, closed minded establishment\\" (p. 112).  Park is to be commended for writing this book because, as he notes on page 177, \\"It is an axiom in the publishing business...that pseudoscience will always sell more books than the real science that debunks it.\\"  This axiom may be wearing thin since I notice that Voodoo Science has sold well while (e.g.) Suppressed Inventions, a book touting everything Park debunks here (and more), hasn't done so well.

546394:US	49786731	R3L0UNMGRUZNCL	0140245480	245442817	The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature	Books	5	27	30	N	N	Informative, witty and fun to read	This is the book that first demonstrated to me the power of evolutionary psychology to help us understand ourselves.  Published a year before Robert Wright's The Moral Animal, which covers much of the same territory, this is to my mind a more sophisticated and more direct exposition.  Both books are characterized by a sly wit and an incisive expression, but Ridley meanders less among the relics of Freud and Darwin and is less concerned about whether we're moral or not and more concerned with what's sexy and why.  He had a lot of fun with this book and it shows.<br /><br />The \\"red queen\\" is a metaphor for an arms race.  In an arms race both sides run as fast and as hard as they can to stay in the same place relatively speaking.  In evolution the arms race is between parasite and host or between predator and prey.  Both are running as fast as they can just to keep up, because when one gets an advantage, the other finds a counter.  The red queen comes from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There (1871) since that monarch ran as fast as she could but never got anywhere at all.  The red queen is also a metaphor for the theory that there is no \\"progress\\" in evolution, that \\"...species do not get better at surviving...  Their chances of extinction are random\\" (p. 64).<br /><br />Ridley covers a lot of territory here, ranging from sex to the handicap principle to gossip to why our brains are big (to figure out what the other person is up to!).  The Red Queen answers the question, \\"Why is there sex?\\"  Apparently we have sexuality rather than asexuality because of the arms race between microbes and our immune systems.  Sex is a way of storing defenses against parasites in the gene pool of the species and then mixing them anew each generation to fool the microbes.  Without the gene pool and the DNA mixing, the microbes would quickly evolve a way around the organism's defenses; but with sexuality the organism juggles its \\"locks\\" every generation and so is able to keep up with the fast-mutating microbes.  When again the microbes evolve the keys to these locks, the gene pool is mixed again and the organism comes up with an old lock that the microbes again have to evolve a key to.  With the same logic, and in a larger sense, sex has evolved as a means to randomly pit many phenotypes against the environment.<br /><br />Some of the fun is the incisive way Ridley presents the ideas, and the ideas he chooses to present.  For example, note how effectively he demolishes Freud's naive incest taboo theory on pages 282-286.  Also interesting is his presentation of the idea that it is not thinness in women per se that attracts men, but a low ratio of  waistline to hip line that fetches them.  There are chapters entitled \\"Polygamy and the Nature of Men,\\" and \\"Monogamy and the Nature of Women.\\"  In Chapter 9, \\"The Uses of Beauty,\\" Ridley goes into some detail on why men prefer thin and blond women.  And on pages 217-218 he explains why women cuckold their mates: \\"This is because her husband is, almost by definition, usually not the best male there is--else how would he have ended up married to her?\\"  She wants the parental care of her husband and some other man's superior--she thinks--genes.<br /><br />Ridley is rather modest and says that most of the ideas in the book are not his and at any rate many of them will undoubtedly be proven wrong.  This is refreshing to read when I think about all the delusive ideas so proudly trumpeted by popular books on evolution and human behavior in the past.  Desmond Morris's The Naked Ape (1967) and Elaine Morgan's The Aquatic Ape: A Theory of Human Evolution (1982) come to mind, both fine books, but now seen to be substantially mistaken.<br /><br />Written in an engaging and lucid style, The Red Queen really is the best of a number of books on evolutionary psychology to appear in recent years and one that is a delight to read.n and so is able to keep up with the fast-mutating microbes.

It is an updated version of the Concise Science Dictionary originally published by the Oxford University Press in 1984.  This, the latest edition, is from 1999.  It is aimed at professionals and an educated public who want a quick reference to terms in fields other than their own.  Unlike science dictionaries found on the reference shelves of libraries, this book is small enough to fit into a knapsack.<br /><br />As with all specialized dictionaries the task for editors is to decide what to leave in and what to leave out, and how technical to get.  The people at Oxford University Press, one of the preeminent publishers of reference books in the world, have tried to eschew \\"unnecessary scientific jargon\\" while \\"always bearing in mind the needs of the readers\\" (from the Preface).  Nonetheless, many of the entries are highly technical, having been written by experts.  Clearly the editors have decided to err on the side of technical precision rather than anything resembling a dumbing down.  The entry on \\"optical activity\\" for example is a mini essay of about 400 words adorned with a drawing of the D-, L-, and meso-forms of the isomers of tartaric acid along with several cross references to related terms in the dictionary.  A two-page boxed entry on \\"El Nino\\" however is written in language easily accessible to the average high school graduate, as are many other entries including over 160 mini biographies of important scientists.<br /><br />I also use The American Heritage Dictionary of Science, another handy (as opposed to comprehensive) reference and would like to make a quick comparison.  The Heritage dictionary is a hardcover and contains noticeably more entries (16,000+ to perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 for the Oxford).  However the Heritage hasn't been updated since the edition of 1988.  Of course a lot has happened in science since then, which is why I purchased the Oxford paperback.  The Heritage also uses the entries words or phrases in sentences, usually quoting some scientist whereas the Oxford does not bother.  The Heritage also gives the pronunciation of most of the entries (e.g., it's \\"pree'-on,\\" not \\"pri'-on\\" for the mad cow infectious agent) whereas the Oxford does not.  The Oxford is more technical overall--it is especially strong in physics--and of course more up to date.  The entries also tend to be more thorough.  For example, the Oxford has a schematic drawing of a mammalian kidney system whereas the Heritage has only text.<br /><br />There are seven appendices on SI units, fundamental constants, the solar system, the geographical time scale, plant and animal kingdom classifications, and the periodic table.  Curiously, nowhere in the Oxford is the abbreviation SI defined or even noted!  The Heritage gives it as the French Systeme International d'Unites (or International System of Units).  This is actually an indication of how the Oxford assumes a greater scientific sophistication on the part of its readers than does the Heritage.<br /><br />Bottom line here is that this book is practically a must for those who read a lot of science in fields other than their own.  It is better overall than the Heritage because it is eleven years more up to date; and it is a better choice for most people than the more comprehensive hardcover volumes which are significantly more expensive, heavier and take up more space.ritage also uses the entries words or phrases in sentences, usually quoting some scientist whereas the Oxford does not bother.

555617:US	49786731	RCT35UBP5PRPF	1586482297	100470793	Neoconomy: George Bush's Revolutionary Gamble with America's Future	Books	4	51	52	N	N	What's really going on economically speaking	In this modest volume, economic journalist and Harvard-trained economist Daniel Altman attempts to explain what the so-called neoconservatives, who are directing President Bush's economic policies, are up to.  Altman calls it a revolution that will greatly increase the chasm between the rich and the poor and create a new kind of society based not on merit but on inherited wealth and advantage.<br /><br />The neocon's main idea is to abolish taxes on capital and earnings from capital.  Their rationale is that untaxed capital will be more readily invested leading to a rising tide of economic prosperity that will lift all segments of society.  Yes, the rich will get richer, but through \\"trickle down\\" and a booming economy, the poor and the middle class will also gain.<br /><br />Such is the theory.  Because such theories cannot be adequately tested on models, we can only find out if they work by testing them in the actual economy (which may be the real reason economics is called \\"the dismal science\\").  The problem--as Altman advises--is that if they fail the consequences may be horrific.  If the rich get too rich and the poor too poor and the middle class disappears--well, such is the stuff of revolutions, witness Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries.<br /><br />Here are the taxes the neocons want abolished: the estate tax; taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains; and the corporate income tax.  Here's what famed investor Warren Buffet thinks about the abolition of the estate tax:<br /><br />\\"Without the estate tax, you in effect will have an aristocracy of wealth, which means you pass down the ability to command the resources of the nation based on heredity rather than merit.\\" (p. 250)  Clearly he's agin it.  I might add that the ironic example of the very mediocre George W. Bush as president of the United States is perhaps an early example of what Buffet is afraid of.<br /><br />Feeling much the same way is Thomas Piketty, director of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, whom Altman quotes as saying: \\"These new high-income tax cuts, together with all the previous tax cuts (including the repeal of the estate tax), will eventually contribute to rebuild a class of rentiers in the US, whereby a small group of wealthy but untalented children controls vast segments of the US economy and penniless, talented children simply can't compete...  If such a tax policy is maintained, there is a decent probability that the US will look like Old Europe prior to 1914 in a couple of generations.\\"  (p. 241)<br /><br />I don't have any doubt that people like George W. Bush are partially motivated by a desire to create sharp class distinctions and to increase the privilege of their friends and relatives.  But there is more to the lopsided tax cuts than that.  As Altman explains on pages 166-167, one of the effects of the huge tax cuts by the Bush administration is to tie the hands of his successors.  \\"Forced to deal with deficits...they would [read: will] be hard-pressed to spend money on...social programs...  They might even have to raise taxes just to avoid cutting spending.\\"  To put it bluntly: Bush 43 is spending not only our children's and our grandchildren's money, but the money of future administrations.<br /><br />As Altman notes, this strategy was employed before by Ronald Reagan.  Only trouble was, \\"his successor was not a Democrat, but his own vice president, George H. W. Bush.\\" (p. 167)  And, as you'll recall, Bush 41 turned out to be a one-term president, giving way to Bill Clinton.<br /><br />Okay, is Altman's critique correct?  Or are the neocons really working to take the nation to an economic heaven on earth?<br /><br />I'm not sure, and the economists I have read are in disagreement.  This book does not prove anything one way or the other of course.  What Altman does, and he does it admirably with a calm voice and verbal restraint (too much restraint for my taste, by the way) is chronicle what has happenedand point to what we can expect in the future if the neocons get their way.  Obviously, he doesn't like the potential consequences, and neither do I.<br /><br />Bottom line: a nice primer on Bush's economy policies, a bit too leisurely developed, but all told a kind of eye-popping indictment.way.

In a way it is a throwback--with similar effect--to Upton Sinclair's famous novel, The Jungle, about the filth in the Chicago stockyards, except that it is non-fiction (mostly, anyway). John Robbins wants to rub our nose in the filth, neglect and cruelty characteristic of the meat and poultry industries. He wants an end to the mass production and consumption of animal foods.<br /><br /> He begins with some amazing and heart-warming stories about the courage and selflessness of animals and how much they do for us. Then he turns his focus to the way we treat the animals we use for food. It is difficult to read this part of the book, and indeed I confess that I skipped ahead. I already know about those appalling conditions having seen them on TV. Next he argues that we need less protein than the &quot;protein empire&quot; wants us to believe. He goes on to show how we can get all the protein our bodies require through a vegan diet. Then he argues that many cancers can be prevented with a proper diet that excludes animal products while implicating the products of the meat and poultry industries in the development of many diseases, especially the chronic diseases epidemic in the Western world. He concludes with a general manifesto in favor of an agrarian kind of heaven on earth.<br /><br /> I am sorry to report, as other reviews have, that there are many errors and misconceptions in the book. In a minor error on page 176, for example, Robbins writes that &quot;wheat...is 17% protein.&quot; Actually (as the USDA chart on the next page shows) 17% of the calories from wheat are in the form of protein, which is decidedly not the same thing. That chart also shows that 49% of the calories from spinach come from protein, but this does not mean that if you ate a pound of spinach you would eat almost half a pound of protein. Spinach is not 49% protein. It has water and fiber, etc. and it doesn't have a lot of calories.<br /><br /> More important than the outright errors are the misrepresentations in the way Robbins sometimes presents his facts. For example on pages 266-267 he writes that instances of cervical cancer are &quot;highest among women who consume diets high in fat, particularly animal fat.&quot; He adds that &quot;cervical cancer in women in developing countries who began intercourse before age seventeen is two to three times higher than for those who began later.&quot; What he doesn't say (and probably didn't know) is that cervical cancer is caused by a papillomavirus and as such is a sexually transmitted disease.<br /><br /> He also writes about the deforestation of America. The rate he gives from 1967 to 1986 when he wrote the first edition of this book is &quot;one acre every five seconds.&quot; (p. 361) Actually, the amount of forested lands in the United States has increased by quite a bit since 1967 and some of that increase was during the years in question.<br /><br /> I mention these shortcomings because I want to be fair, even though I realize that Robbins is more intent on serving his cause than being fair. I can put that aside because I believe that Robbins has done a fine public service in writing this book because it is a much-needed counterpoint to the billions of dollars worth of pro-meat and poultry industry propaganda and advertising that is constantly intruding upon our lives.<br /><br /> Bottom line: for all its faults this is a classic of environmentalist literature and an extraordinary book that changed the lives of untold thousands of people by persuading them to adopt a more environment-friendly diet. However I wish that there was an updated edition (instead of just a reprint of the edition of 1987) that corrects some of the errors and takes cognizance of what has happened since then.c. and it doesn't have a lot of calories. <br />  <br /> More important than the outright errors are the misrepresentations in the way Robbins sometimes presents his facts.

566059:US	49786731	R3DSXSCZC15E4U	0226770893	186302768	The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin	Books	5	43	45	N	N	Partially a development from the work of Richard Dawkins	This book is largely about what psychologist Keith Stanovich sees as the disconnect in the postmodern world between &quot;maximizing genetic fitness and maximizing the satisfaction of human desires.&quot; (p. xiii) On the one hand we have the &quot;replicators,&quot; the genes that blindly seek only their replication. On the other hand we have the vehicle (the phenotype), i.e., &quot;us,&quot; which carries the genes, which Stanovich believes should seek its own happiness. He sees our brain as composed of two overlapping, but sometimes divergent, systems. One, the more primitive, he calls &quot;The Autonomous Set of Systems&quot; (TASS) and the other he calls an &quot;analytic system.&quot; He calls this having &quot;two minds in one brain.&quot;<br /><br /> The autonomous system is held on a &quot;short leash&quot; by the genes while the analytic system is on a longer leash; that is, TASS reacts to events in the environment almost automatically in close concert with the dictates of the replicators while the analytic system is more removed from innate drives and can analyze situations rationally and can act in terms of what is good for the vehicle rather than what promotes the replication of the genes. Note that these systems usually are in agreement and react to the environment in the same way. Threats to the well-being of the vehicle from predators and other dangers, signal the same avoidance behavior. However, sometimes there is a conflict. The example that Stanovich uses is TASS's need to flirt with the boss's wife, which might increase the replication of the genes, while the analytic system realizes that such behavior probably goes against the best interests of the vehicle (possible loss of job, etc.). Following the counsel of the rational analytic system instead of the urgings of TASS is what Stanovich calls &quot;maximizing goal satisfaction at the level of the whole organism.&quot; (p. 64)<br /><br /> The title of the book comes from Richard Dawkins (and indeed this book is written in partial reaction to and in concert with Dawkins's ideas) who called organisms &quot;survival machines&quot; and &quot;gigantic lumbering robots&quot; in his famous opus, The Selfish Gene (1976). Stanovich wants to free us from the dictates of those selfish genes and so has constructed a &quot;robot's rebellion.&quot; He believes we can use our rationality (our analytic system) to override the sometimes self-destructive inclinations of the more primitive set of brain systems. Stanovich is preeminently a rationalist and believes that right thought leading to right behavior will lead to a more fulfilling and happier life for the &quot;robots.&quot; We need to be on the long leash from the genes, not the short leash, is his idea.<br /><br /> A strong point that Stanovich makes very well is that in the information societies of the modern world many of the talents that served us well in the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptiveness in the Pleistocene are &quot;worthless&quot; when (e.g.) trying to use &quot;an international ATM machine with which you are unfamiliar&quot; or when &quot;arguing with your HMO about a disallowed medical procedure.&quot; (p. 124) He argues strongly that corporations and governments, through their advertizing and propaganda, have become very good at exploiting blind spots in our more primitive brain systems and getting us to do what is good for them and not necessarily good for us. I think this is correct, and that those of us who can see how the players in the modern economy are trying to use us for their benefit will avoid most of the more obvious traps and thereby increase our standard of living and presumably our chances for happiness.<br /><br /> Stanovich devotes a chapter to criticizing evolutionary psychologists for failing &quot;to develop the most important implication of potential mismatches between the cognitive requirements of the EEA and those of the modern world,&quot; as he carefully phrases it on page131. Nonetheless the psychology presented here is mainly a synthesis of cognitive psychology, brain science and evolutionary psychology and as such represents the latest in our attempt to understand ourselves.<br /><br /> He also devotes a chapter to the effects that another kind of replicator, the meme, has on our lives.

As always in science we are increasing our understanding and expanding our knowledge as we move toward a final understanding that will most likely always lie tantalizingly in the distance.es it on page 131.

What physics professor and scientific generalist James Trefil is really talking about is humans and nature, as he says in the Preface, and how to manage the planet (as in the subtitle). Trefil has a &quot;benefits-to-humans&quot; principle to guide us:<br /><br /> &quot;The global ecosystem should be managed for the benefit, broadly conceived, of human beings.&quot; (p. 13 and p. 218)<br /><br /> Note well the qualification &quot;broadly conceived.&quot; Trefil allows that benefits to humans might include &quot;some sort of innate human attraction to complex natural ecosystems&quot; and that we might &quot;prefer scenery that contains both water and a variety of plants and animals.&quot; (pp. 214-215) However he goes on to say that his first reaction to &quot;the heat, humidity, and discomfort&quot; of a rainforest is to ask, &quot;Why would anyone want to preserve THIS?&quot;<br /><br /> Why indeed?<br /><br /> Well, because it's there. Because it's beautiful...etc. Trefil appreciates this answer but assigns a higher value to human utility than to human aesthetics. To be fair, however, his vision of a managed earth includes &quot;both cities and wilderness areas.&quot; (p. 226)<br /><br /> Nonetheless this book will offend environmentalists because of its industry-friendly tone (e.g., Part II is entitled &quot;The Myths of Pop Ecology&quot;) and because Trefil occupies a middle ground between the extremes of a paved earth and a wilderness earth, and also because he assigns such a high value to human life as opposed to the lives of other creatures.<br /><br /> Okay, to some specifics. His idea of the symbolic meaning of the Garden of Eden as a falling from grace is the standard model from Christianity; however a broader view sees it as the symbolic expression of the birth of human consciousness. We were &quot;innocent&quot; and then suddenly we saw that we were &quot;naked.&quot; We became &quot;conscious&quot;--especially of our animal nature.<br /><br /> More important than this difference of interpretation is his idea that we have taken ourselves out...of the process of natural selection--and [have] became something unique in the history of our planet.&quot; (p. 39)<br /><br /> Clearly we are unique on this planet. However to imagine that we have somehow stepped out of the process of natural selection is presumptuous. Our culture--as amazing as it is--is nonetheless itself a product of natural selection. It cannot negate natural selection except in a purely local way. To appreciate this imagine that we have established colonies on the moon and Mars. Suppose then that the earth suffers some horrific &quot;sterilizing&quot; catastrophe, such as being hit by a gigantic meteor. The colonies on the moon and Mars will survive but earth-bound humans will probably go the way of the dinosaurs.<br /><br /> This is natural selection at work. Beings with the ability to occupy niches away from planet earth will be selected in such natural events (including the microbes in and on their bodies) as opposed to those beings who lack such an ability. To make this even clearer, imagine the inhabitants of a similar solar system light years away who cannot for whatever reason leave their home planet. If all life on that planet is destroyed those beings are extinct. Again, this is natural selection at work. We survived. They didn't. Extraterrestrial events are part of the environment that does the &quot;selecting.&quot;<br /><br /> It is not surprising that Trefil wants to make a distinction between &quot;natural&quot; and human. But this distinction is artificial. The title of his third chapter, &quot;Leaving Nature Behind&quot; reflects this distinction. But it is a false distinction--useful yes, but ultimately untrue. We cannot leave nature behind. We are part of nature. Cultural evolution is a subset of biological evolution in a way similar to the way number theory isa subset of mathematics, or that English is a subset of human languages.<br /><br /> There are also some fuzzy conclusions. On page 62 in his zest to go after some &quot;myths&quot; from &quot;pop ecology&quot; he points to what he calls &quot;The poisoned planet myth&quot; and then backs off a little by saying &quot;it's partly true and partly false.&quot; And then he decides that &quot;it's a clear example of the sin-and-retribution theme associated with Noah's flood.&quot;<br /><br /> Well, it's not a &quot;myth&quot; if it's partly true; and his attempt at guilt by association is an example of the sort of logic condemned in undergraduate philosophy classes.<br /><br /> Another example is from page 143 where Trefil is discussing global warming. He writes, &quot;If the warming is due to global trends beyond our control, then all we can do is think about adapting to higher temperatures.&quot; If something is &quot;beyond our control&quot; then we can, by definition, do nothing about it, and his statement is a gratuitous tautology. But what Trefil really means here is that if the warming is caused by nature, as opposed to being caused by humans (as he notes in the next sentence), we can only think cool thoughts. Actually even warming caused by events beyond human control can in fact be mitigated, as Trefil points out elsewhere in the book.<br /><br /> Regardless of its faults this is among the very best science books I have read over the last three or four years. It is just so interesting that the pages practically turn themselves. I think Trefil is able to engage the reader partly because his take on a number of controversial scientific questions is original and surprising, candid and calm, and because he argues his case so very well without giving in to politically-correct notions. In particular his discussion of &quot;The Question of Extinction&quot; (Chapter 8) is informed and convincingly presented. I also found his concluding chapters on &quot;...Choices&quot; and &quot;The Managed Planet&quot; fascinating.<br /><br /> Trefil's engaging style allows the reader to enter into a dialogue as he reads and to feel that both sides of an issue are being presented fairly.

576392:US	49786731	R2CI5QEXLCA4RZ	0787963763	238917987	Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide	Books	4	71	78	N	N	A partial reconciliation	While it is true that one could practice, say, yoga, and practice it well and fairly near completeness and still be a Christian, it is a bit of a stretch to fully immerse oneself in Zen Buddhism and remain a Christian. Or vice-versa.<br /><br /> This is not and cannot be immediately apparent to casual and beginning practitioners of either Christianity or Zen. Certainly however it should be clear to Kim Boykin. And, after a fashion, I think it is. What she has done is reduce Zen to something close to a non-spiritual practice, a &quot;Zen for health,&quot; if you will, in particular Zen for mental and emotional health, and in that way make Zen compatible with Christianity.<br /><br /> As Boykin points out, the central tenet of Christianity, that of salvation, is similar to the Buddhist tenet of right behavior. In Christianity all have sinned, but if we accept Christ, who died for our sins, as our savior we will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. In Buddhism we are not &quot;unsaved&quot; or in a state of mortal sin, rather we are in a state of pain and suffering, some of it psychological. We overcome that state through Right Living, Right Behavior--the famous Eightfold Path. (See especially page 91.)<br /><br /> Boykin goes into the differences and similarities in her third chapter, &quot;Zen Teachings and Christian Teachings.&quot; Basically she resolves all apparent conflicts by stating that &quot;Zen teachings are not doctrines.&quot; This is precisely, exactly correct. Indeed, the central spirit in Zen is to laugh at all doctrines, to find enlightenment through &quot;killing the Buddha&quot; and &quot;no thought,&quot; which are ways to get away from the limitations of the so-called rational mind. Typically a Zen koan presents the student with a logical paradox and demands an answer, an answer that can only be found by transcending the rational mind and all doctrines. So, by this method Boykin can accept any facet of Christianity including the most literal and fundamental and find no conflict with Zen.<br /><br /> So be it.<br /><br /> However, there is no &quot;God&quot; in Buddhism. Consequently for God to have a &quot;son&quot; can only be understood in a symbolic sense. The acceptance of Christ as a personal savior, again can only be done in a symbolic sense. To go even deeper into Buddhist &quot;theology,&quot; if you will, or &quot;psychology&quot; (which I think is the best way to understand these things, at least in the beginning) it is necessary to realize that for the Buddhist we do not even exist in the same way we do in Christianity. In Buddhism the self is an illusion. In Christianity the self is very real and transcends death. Furthermore, there is no concept of karma or reincarnation in Christian theology. Boykin does not discuss either idea, possibly because neither idea is logically compatible with Christianity.<br /><br /> What Boykin does well here is to show how Zen meditation can enrich one's life, how &quot;being here now&quot; and other Zen practices can lead to a fuller spiritual experience, as they have for her. From a Christian point of view, prayer is the most powerful meditation. From another point of view, prayer is simply one type of meditation. Prayer and meditation are both practices, or techniques, if you will, for finding God or nirvana--which to some people amounts to the same thing. Zazen (&quot;just sitting,&quot; i.e., sitting meditation) is certainly a practice that would be compatible with any religion.<br /><br /> So what Zen for Christians is about is using Zen techniques to further one's Christianity. This is fine, but theological speaking, Zen and Christianity are different ways to God and cannot be held as truths simultaneously without some strenuous mental gymnastics. (Or actually in the impish spirit of Zen, they can be held simultaneously in the mind with the greatest of ease!) A striking example of this discordance can be seen on page 40 where Boykin recites a prayer learned from Karl Rahner. It ends with the words, &quot;I am powerless, blind, dead, but you are mighty, light, and life and have conquered me long ago with the deadly impotence of your Son.&quot; Prayer is surrender to a power greater than oneself. But words like &quot;the deadly impotence of your Son&quot; have no meaning in Zen.<br /><br /> More in concert with the spirit of Zen would be the 46th Psalm as quoted on the next page: &quot;Be still, and know that I am God.&quot; However, the use of the word &quot;God&quot; and the sense that &quot;God&quot; would actually demand something of someone is foreign to Zen. In Zen one does not speak of God partly because traditionally the Buddha turned aside all such questions. (It takes some study to understand why he did.) But theologically speaking, to mention God would be to immediately identify God in some manner, and that would be meaningless since what stands for God in Buddhism is beyond any human designation--indeed beyond human comprehension. On the other hand, in Christianity God is made personal. Moreover, in fundamentalist Christianity, humans are said to be made in the image of God.<br /><br /> Boykin's style is engaging and her recollection of her Zen training and how she came to the Catholic Church make for interesting reading. I had the sense that one of the commonalities shared by Zen and Christianity that Boykin discovered, perhaps in a subconscious way, is in the practices of Zen and the rituals of the Catholic Church. Although they are very different in structure and event, they serve some of the same purposes, that of helping the aspirant find spirituality. And of course the monastic tradition in Zen has some similarities with that of the Catholic Church.<br /><br /> Bottom line: While this is a good introduction to Zen, if you want to read about how Zen and Christianity can and cannot be reconciled, I recommend Thomas Merton or Alan Watts.rl Rahner.

578852:US	49786731	RWE2NGIRJX9HE	0743247442	120358955	The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power	Books	5	200	212	N	N	Striking thesis convincingly presented	The modern corporation, according to law professor Joel Bakan, is \\"singularly self-interested and unable to feel genuine concern for others in any context.\\" (p. 56) From this Bakan concludes that the corporation is a \\"pathological\\" entity.<br /><br /> This is a striking conclusion. The so-called pathological personality in humans is well documented and includes serial killers and others who have no regard for the life and welfare of anyone but themselves. But is it really fair to label the corporation, managed and owned by normal caring and loving people, in this way?<br /><br /> Bakan thinks so. He begins with a little history showing how the corporation developed and how it came to occupy the dominate position that it enjoys today. He recalls a time before \\"limited liability\\" when shareholders were legally responsible for the actions of the corporation, a time when corporations could not own stock in other companies, a time when corporations could not acquire or merge with other corporations, a time when shareholders could more closely control corporate management.<br /><br /> Next he shows what corporations have become, and finally what can be done about it.<br /><br /> Bakan's argument includes the point that the corporation's sole reason for being is to enhance the profits and power of the corporation. He shows by citing court cases that it is the duty of management to make money and that any compromise with that duty is dereliction of duty.<br /><br /> Another point is that \\"corporations are designed to externalize their costs.\\" The corporation is \\"deliberately programmed, indeed legally compelled, to externalize costs without regard for the harm it may cause to people, communities, and the natural environment. Every cost it can unload onto someone else is a benefit to itself, a direct route to profit.\\" (pp. 72-73)<br /><br /> And herein lies the paradox of the corporation. Designed to turn labor and raw materials efficiently into goods and services and to thereby raise our standard of living, it has been a very effective tool for humans to use. On the other hand, because it is blind to anything but its own welfare, the corporation uses humans and the resources of the planet in ways that can be and often are detrimental to people and the environment. Corporations, to put it bluntly, foul the environment with their wastes and will not clean up unless forced to. (Fouling the environment and leaving the mess for somebody else to clean up is exactly what \\"externalizing costs\\" is all about.)<br /><br /> Furthermore, corporations are amoral toward the law. \\"Compliance...is a matter of costs and benefits,\\" Bakan writes. ( p. 79) He quotes businessman Robert Monks as saying, \\"...whether corporations obey the law or not is a matter of whether it's cost effective... If the chance of getting caught and the penalty are less than it costs to comply, our people think of it as being just a business decision.\\" (p. 80)<br /><br /> The result is a nearly constant bending and breaking of the law. They pay the fine and then break the law again. The corporation, after all, has no conscience and feels no remorse. Bakan cites 42 \\"major legal breaches\\" by General Electric between 1990 and 2001 on pages 75-79 as an example. The fines for maleficence are usually so small relative to the gain that it's cost effective to break the law.<br /><br /> Bakan disagrees with the notion that corporations can be responsible citizens and that corporate managers can act in the public good. He believes that corporations can and sometimes do act in the public interest, but only when that coincides with their interests or because they feel the public relations value of acting in the public interest is greater than the cost of not doing so. He adds \\"business is all about taking advantage of circumstances. Corporate social responsibility is an oxymoron...as is the related notion that corporations can...be relied upon to promote the public interest.\\" (p. 109)<br /><br /> As for corporations regulating themselves, Bakan writes, \\"No one would seriously suggest that individuals should regulate themselves, that laws against murder, assault, and theft are unnecessary because people are socially responsible. Yet oddly, we are asked to believe that corporate persons--institutional psychopaths who lack any sense of moral conviction and who have the power and motivation to cause harm and devastation in the world--should be left free to govern themselves.\\" (p. 110)<br /><br /> Bakan even argues (and I think he is substantially right) that \\"Deregulation is really a form of dedemocratization\\" because it takes power away from a government, elected by the people, and gives it to corporations which are elected by nobody.<br /><br /> Some of the book is devoted to advertizing by corporations, especially to children, and the effect of such advertizing. Beyond advertizing is pro-corporate and anti-government propaganda. Bakan quotes Noam Chomsky as saying, \\"One of the reasons why propaganda tries to get you to hate government is because it's the one existing institution in which people can participate to some extent and constrain tyrannical unaccountable power.\\" (p. 152)<br /><br /> What to do? Well, for starters, make the fines large enough to change corporate behavior. Make management responsible--criminally if necessary--for the actions of the corporation. Bakan includes these among his remedies on pages 161-164. He also wants the charters of flagrant and persistent violators to be suspended. He writes that corporations are the creations of government and should be subject to governmental control and should NOT (as we often hear) be \\"partners\\" with government.<br /><br /> He would also like to see elections publically financed and an end to corporate political donations. Indeed if we could take the money out of elections, our representatives would not be beholden to the corporate structure and would act more consistently in the broader public interest. I think this is one of the most important challenges facing our country today, that of lessening the influence of money on the democratic process.<br /><br /> Bottom line: a seminal book about one of the most important issues facing us today.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"<br /> As for corporations regulating themselves, Bakan writes, \\"No one would seriously suggest that individuals should regulate themselves, that laws against murder, assault, and theft are unnecessary because people are socially responsible.

There was, however, a Hellenic time not too many years ago when euphoria wafted across dot.com land like the heady scent of flowers in springtime, and nobody really knew what they were doing, and everybody was going to get filthy rich.<br />It was then in 1996 that James Marcus, literary type, was lured to Amland to bring, he thought, some literary class to a commercial venture.  He was thus among the original denizens of Amazonia, #77 on the hired list--a list that eventually included over eight thousand names.  Hired to write quickie reviews and interview writers and blurb up the Amazon pages, Marcus also learned how to answer e-mail cheerily and helpfully, how to change the content on Amazon's pages, and occasionally how to stuff product into boxes for shipping.<br />One can see that Marcus was a little older, noticeably less geeky, and somewhat of a literary dandy compared to his fellow stock option holders.  One can further see that he played the game with an eye on the exit and was never completely comfortable being a corporate cog.  I was reminded of the strong allegiance to the corporate family that the modern corporation demands of its white-collar types, the long hours, the frequent meetings and the morale- and team-building conferences, the pep rallies, the employee trips and outings, etc.<br />The story here is not a tell-all (although there are some juicy tidbits) nor is it a chronicle of the rise and fall, and rise again of one of the Internet's stellar giants.  Instead it is a very personal tale of being hired by Amazon in 1996, what he did, whom he met and worked with, what they said and did, and why he eventually left.  His own personal rise and fall of fortune, peaking at about $9-million early in the year 2000 (consisting mostly of unvested stock options that he couldn't yet sell) and ending during the meltdown, is an interesting one nonetheless, and Marcus tells it well.  As a literary type, he takes his time to polish the prose and use authentic diction; and there is considerable evidence of a brow-knitted search for le bon mot, which he often finds.  Mainly, he has uncluttered the text and attended to the reader's needs, and so the story flows.<br />One can see, of course, that this was premeditated.  Marcus knew he was going to write about his experiences at Amazon as soon as he was hired, or perhaps before.  That is, he took notes while he whistled while he worked, which is why he can simulate conversations eight years old and can recall the exact titles of books he chased down in Amazon.com's mammoth Dawson Street warehouse.<br />But one is struck by how downright mundane Marcus gets at times.  Here he is at the warehouse doing the obligatory help-out during the Christmas rush.  He's talking about the employees who ship the stuff year round.  He says, \\"They considered themselves the core of the business, the extreme employees.  Yet they weren't being rewarded with stock options like their white-collar counterparts.  It made for the occasional display of territorial rudeness.\\"  And then he gives us some action and conversation that amounts to \\"a tall guy with a tongue stud\\" standing in his way and not responding to his \\"can I get by?\\"<br />Not exactly exhilarating stuff, and to be honest, some of this will bore a lot of readers.<br />More interesting is this story: Marcus was at a morale-building ski trip conference in his first year at Amazon.  He joined a group at the hotel bar playing a parlor game in which you have to name a movie star of the same sex that you would have sex with.  Jeff (the Jeff) was in the group.  Guess whom Jeff Bezos named?  Indiana Jones!  (That would be Harrison Ford.)<br />Marcus's portrait of CEO and visionary Jeff Bezos is carefully if sketchily drawn, and Marcus seems to get as much of Jeff into the book as he can.  There is Jeff planning, scheming, laughing, flying everywhere, appearing, speaking, guiding, cajoling, mesmerizing, seemingly having a lot of fun.  Jeff even worked (briefly for show, of course) in the warehouse running a cart up and down the aisles \\"picking\\" books to send to customers.<br />Marcus recounts some of Jeff's mistaken purchases (what's a few hundred million dollars more or less?), and reports on once seeing Jeff give an employee a public dressing down.  But mostly we see Jeff at something close to play: Jeff genially allowing himself to be dunked at a company picnic (by employees throwing a ball at a target), Jeff in a hula skirt, etc.  Indeed, Marcus finds nothing negative to say (or show) about one of the Internet's most powerful moguls.  One gets the sense that Jeff never showed his claws in Marcus's presence or that Marcus is being more than careful.<br />In the Epilogue, we see Jeff playing tennis against Anna Kournikova in a PR stunt while Marcus watches, the manuscript of this book under his arm, hoping to get Jeff's attention and hand it to him.<br />In the final analysis what Marcus finds out about Amazon is that it's \\"always day one\\" (one of Jeff's slogans) and what really counts is \\"monetizing those eyeballs\\" and \\"revenue velocity.\\"<br />Bottom line: a little too precious at times, a little too mundane, but overall a good read that will especially appeal to dot.com watchers and Amazonians, past and present.erywhere, appearing, speaking, guiding, cajoling, mesmerizing, seemingly having a lot of fun.

One gets the sense that Jeff never showed his claws in Marcus's presence or that Marcus is being more than careful.<br />In the Epilogue, we see Jeff playing tennis against Anna Kournikova in a PR stunt while Marcus watches, the manuscript of this book under his arm, hoping to get Jeff's attention and hand it to him.<br />In the final analysis what Marcus finds out about Amazon is that it's \\"always day one\\" (one of Jeff's slogans) and what really counts is \\"monetizing those eyeballs\\" and \\"revenue velocity.\\"<br />Bottom line: a little too precious at times, a little too mundane, but overall a good read that will especially appeal to dot.com watchers and Amazonians, past and present.	2004-07-20
600586:US	49786731	R2DA99GO4QKLYJ	0393050955	906502157	Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century	Books	5	37	48	N	N	Controversial reevaluations vividly presented	This is a remarkable book not only for its content, but for the way it is written.  What Lauren Slater does extremely well is (1) provide a context for the experiments and personalize them; (2) insinuate herself into the narrative in meaningful ways; and (3) write the kind of prose that is vivid and psychologically engaging.  She has the gift of the novelist, and she is not satisfied with the conventional surface of things.<br />But there is an edge to Slater's prose.  She dwells on the horrific: the lobotomies, the monkeys being abused for the experimenter's purposes, the living rats with their brains exposed...  She does/doesn't believe that the means of animal experimentation justifies the ends of neurological knowledge.  This dialectic that she holds in her mind, now favoring the value of experimental psychology, now questioning it, may leave the reader dissatisfied and confused.  Where DOES Lauren Slater stand?  She says she stands \\"with this book\\" for which there is no conclusion, even though she writes a concluding chapter with that title.<br />So it is not so strange that among these \\"great psychological experiments\\" she finds nothing like solid ground.  Instead she waffles between experimenter and experiment, between one interpretation and another.  And while she addresses the experiments themselves and the controversies they raised, more significantly she addresses the experimenters themselves, challenges them with sharp and sometimes impertinent questions; and when the experimenters are not available, she finds relatives or friends and fires loaded questions at them.  Slater wants to find the truth, if possible, and to be fair; but often what she finds is that she doesn't know what the truth is, and that life is oh, so complex.<br />This is refreshing and of course disconcerting.  She began with an attitude of deep distrust, for example, toward B. F. Skinner, the man who had put his daughter in a box, the man who apparently cared more for experiment and establishing behaviorism than he did for human beings, a man whose conclusions could pave the way to a new and more horrible fascist state.  But Slater plunges in and finds that his daughters loved him and that the one who supposedly committed suicide is alive and well.  Slater even realizes, after being confronted by Julia Skinner Vargas, one of the daughters she interviewed by telephone, that she, Slater, hadn't read Skinner's magnum opus, Beyond Freedom and Dignity--had instead, like most of us, myself included, known it only by reputation, bad reputation.<br />So Slater reads the book and when she is through she compares Skinner to a \\"green\\" Al Gore and speculates that \\"maybe\\" Skinner \\"was the first feminist psychologist.\\"  Quite a turnaround.<br />But this is characteristic of Slater's approach.  Become engaged.  Keep an open and flexible mind.  Dare to believe what others are afraid to believe.  Turn on a dime.  And this is right for this book since many of the experimenters did exactly that: they sought to show where the conventional wisdom was wrong; and they sought to turn psychology on its head.<br />The first piece I read (opening the book at random) was \\"On Being Sane in Insane Places.\\"  This is about how in the early 1970s, Stanford psychologist David Rosenhan and eight collaborators showed up at nine different mental hospital around the country and told the shrinks they were hearing voices.  The voices said one word: \\"Thud.\\"  They were committed even though otherwise they acted normally.  Their stay was from fifty-two to seven days each.<br />This experiment created a sensation and a scandal in the psychiatric community and caused a complete overall in the DSM II (we have DSM IV today).  The diagnostic language was rewritten so that the definitions became measurable, and the volume grew by two hundred pages.<br />Slater decided to replicate the experiment.  She went to mental hospitals and said she heard a voice that said, \\"Thud.\\"  What she got were prescriptions for antipsychotics and antidepressants.<br />There are ten chapters and a conclusion.  \\"Obscura,\\" the second chapter deals with Stanley Milgram's infamous electric shock experiment which showed that ordinary people would, guided by the authority of the experimenter, administer what they thought were possibly lethal shocks to fellow human beings.  Another chapter looks at Leon Festinger's experiment with infiltrating a doom's day cult and seeing what happens when doom does not arrive at the appointed hour.  What happens is \\"cognitive dissonance\\"--which I would call \\"elaborate rationalization.\\"<br />Still another chapter is devoted to the famous \\"Lost in the Mall\\" repressed memory experiment by Elizabeth Loftus which demonstrated how subject to suggestion are our memories.  Loftus who, along with Katherine Ketcham, wrote The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegations of Sexual Abuse (1994), showed how a false memory of being lost in the mall as child could be suggested to people and how they would not only come to believe it, but would confabulate all sorts of \\"remembered\\" detail around an event that never happened.<br />This is a book that may make some practicing psychologists uneasy.  (And they may write nasty reviews.)  Certainly Slater does not play to their feelings.  Quite the opposite.  Toward the end she asks: \\"At what point does experimental psychology and clinical psychology meet?  Apparently at no point.  I interviewed twelve licensed practicing psychologists...and none of them even knew most of these experiments, never mind used them in their work.\\"  (p. 253)<br />And Slater is not enchanted with the new psychopharmacology.  She argues that Prozac, Zoloft, and other psychoactive drugs may have long term effects worse than lobotomies.  In fact the point of Chapter 10: \\"Chipped\\" is to tell the story of a man who benefitted from a cingulotomy (the modern, streamlined lobotomy) after electroshock therapy and after \\"more than twenty-three...psychiatric medications\\" had failed him.<br />The walnuts pictured on the cover come from this statement about the brain on page 249: \\"there is still something holy about that three-pound wrinkled walnut with a sheen.\\"scriptions for antipsychotics and antidepressants.<br />There are ten chapters and a conclusion.  \\"Obscura,\\" the second chapter deals with Stanley Milgram's infamous electric shock experiment which showed that ordinary people would, guided by the authority of the experimenter, administer what they thought were possibly lethal shocks to fellow human beings.

It is about all time being always present if only we knew, or could realize it, or had a sense about time in the same way we have senses for light and sound.<br /><br />It is also about the Allied fire bombings of Dresden which killed something like 25,000 people.  (And so it goes.)  Kurt Vonnegut begins as though writing a memoir and advises us that \\"All of this happened, more or less...\\"  Of course it did not, and yet, as with all real fiction, it is psychologically true.  His protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, an unlikely hero, somewhat in the manner of unlikely heroes to come like Forest Gump and the hero of Jerzy Kosinski's Being There, transcends time and space as he bumbles along.  This is a comedie noire--a \\"black comedy\\"--not to be confused with \\"film noir,\\" a cinematic genre in which the bad guys may win or at least they are made sympathetic.  In comedie noire the events are horrific but the style is light-hearted.  What the genres have in common is a non-heroic protagonist.<br /><br />This is also a totally original work written in a most relaxing style that fuses the elements of science fiction with realism.  It is easy to read (which is one of the reasons it can be found on the high school curriculum in our public schools).  It is sharply satirical, lampooning not only our moral superiority, our egocentricity, but our limited understanding of time and space.  And of course it is an anti-war novel in the tradition of All Quiet on the Western Front and Johnny Got His Gun.<br /><br />Vonnegut's view of time in this novel is like the stratification of an upcropping of rock: time past and time present are there for us to see, but also there is time future.  Billy Pilgrim learns from the Tralfamadorians (who kidnapped him in 1967) that we are actually timeless beings who experience what we call the past, present and future again and again.  And so Billy goes back to the war and forward to his marriage, and to Tralfamadore again and again.  He learns that the Tralfamadorians see the stars not as bright spots of light but as \\"rarefied, luminous spaghetti\\" and human beings as \\"great millepedes with babies' legs at one end and old people's legs at the other.\\"  So time is not a river, nor is it a snake with its tail in its mouth.  It is omnipresent, yet some things occur before and some after, but always they occur again.<br /><br />And so it goes.<br /><br />What I admire most about this most admirable novel is how easily and naturally Vonnegut controls the narrative and how effortlessly seems its construction.  It is almost as if Vonnegut sat down one day and let his thoughts wander, and when he was through, here is this novel.<br /><br />In a sense, Vonnegut invented a new novelistic genre, combining fantasy with realism, touched by fictionalized memoir,  penned in a comedic mode as horror is overtaken by a kind of fatalistic yet humorous view of life.  Note here the appearance of Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut's alter-ego, the science fiction writer who is said to have invented Tralfamadore.<br /><br />Bottom line: read this without preconceptions and read it without regard to the usual constraints.

This is what I call bon-bon journalism.  The pieces are all under a thousand words, some are under three hundred.  They are pithy, quickly sketched and to the point, written in the first person as told to some of the writers at Esquire.  I call it bon-bon journalism because the book is like a box of chocolates: you pop one into your mouth and  then another and before you know it you've read the whole thing!<br />There are sixty-one of these little tales taken from the pages of the magazine.  I wouldn't be able to pick a best one, but I liked Buzz Aldrin's reprise of what it feels like to walk on the moon: &quot;powdery dust...the sky velvety black...surreal...&quot;  Naturally he was super focused on the task and aware that &quot;if we made a mistake, we would regret it for quite a while.&quot;<br />I also liked &quot;Going over Niagara Falls in a Barrel.&quot;  It was a lot more high tech than you'd think.  It took them almost a year and a half to construct the barrel.  &quot;Geoffrey Petkovich, 39, self-employed&quot; who did it with a pal got roughed up a bit.  His mouthpiece &quot;got driven, hard&quot; into his gums.  He had two cans of beer and a pack of smokes in the barrel and two hours worth of oxygen in tanks in case the barrel sank.<br />Good too was &quot;What It Feels Like to Have an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.&quot;  This guy, &quot;Craig Strobeck, 24, actor&quot; has to take two and a half hour showers.  He runs out of hot water but doesn't stop.  He has to clean every inch of his body about a thousand times.  Sometimes he has to get back in the shower because one area just doesn't feel clean enough.<br />I was surprised to learn that when giving birth all that pushing that you have to do not only pushes the baby out, but also empties the bowels, etc. leaving a clean up detail that I never heard about before.  But the endorphin rush is tremendous, so says &quot;Dee McManamy, 43, housewife.&quot;<br />You get the picture.

They will not be pleased.<br /><br />The really scary thing about this story is that, although Kotlikoff and Burns wax hopeful near the end of the book, and indeed present a possible way out of the crisis, one gets the sense that they believe that there will be no remedial action and certainly no cure until the pain sets in, and then it will be too late.<br /><br />Personally I won't be around to experience any of this, but my grandsons will.  According to the authors, my grandsons will be burdened with tax obligations of unprecedented weight and/or runaway inflation of the banana republic variety, or the collapse of the American economy as we know it.  It's even possible that they'll have all three, probably in that order.<br /><br />The main culprits are Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  Quite simply we are incurring transfer payment obligations to our elderly so enormous that the working population will not be able to pay for them.  And the terrible thing is that our government knows this--there have been many studies--but has neither the will nor the desire to do anything about it.  Call it the crisis of representative democracy.  No one in Congress or in the White House has the guts to tell the American people that we are going bankrupt.  Everybody seems to think that the future will take care of itself, or, at any rate, that's THEIR problem.  Maybe some fabulous invention or technology will confer upon my grandsons enormous wealth and all the financial obligations will disappear like wisps of clouds on a sunny day.<br /><br />It is important to note that the present incumbent in the White House has greatly exacerbated the problem by recklessly cutting taxes while going on a wild spending spree so that his friends at Raytheon, Halliburton, Big Oil and Big Pharma will have full capitalization.  As the authors note, politicians care almost exclusively about maintaining themselves in office.  Consequently they are seldom able to address problems beyond the short horizon of the next election.<br /><br />In a larger sense, the crisis so vividly and exhaustively described in this strangely readable book isn't about economics at all.  It is about demographics.  With increasingly aging populations, thanks to modern sanitation, cradle to grave health care, plenty of food and safe water, etc., the highly developed countries now have to figure out who is going to pay for keeping the old folks alive and well.  The authors present some solutions: make them work longer, print money so that inflation will dilute the financial obligations, massively tax the working generations, etc.  What they do NOT propose is that the elderly be left to fend for themselves, nor do they suggest a modest proposal of the Jonathan Swift variety, say massive euthanasia.  Instead they propose a 12% national sales tax.  This would be on top of all the other taxes.  Imagine in my state (California), where we already have an eight and a quarter percent sales tax, what it would be like adding over twenty percent to the cost of products and services.  Guess what?  This would put a damper on spending and would greatly increase black market traffic, and probably wouldn't work--which is why Republican think-tankers are scheming to \\"privatize\\" Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, a venture that the authors rightly call \\"eliminating\\" Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.<br /><br />Well, that's not going to happen.  \\"I'm old and I vote,\\" will say the AARP, and politicians will take notice.  And no politician is going to vote for the authors' proposed 12% national sales tax.  Read my lips.  So what IS going to happen?<br /><br />Nobody knows.  The problem is unprecedented in human history, because never before has the ratio of the old and retired to the young and working been sohigh.<br /><br />Historically when governments overspend, they reach for the printing press and flood the market with cheap money.  This is what I predict will happened.  The US, Japan, and Europe will all go massively under the flood of inflation and will, after horrendous suffering, reemerge to restructure their transfers so that all of the suggestions of the authors are put in place including later retirement, responsible taxation, controlled medical costs, and a more modest lifestyle for all.  That is, if we don't have revolutions and a return to some sort of absolute state control.<br /><br />Some examples of the engaging prose spun out by Kotlikoff (who is an economist) and Burns (who is a journalist):<br /><br />(After documenting the progressive aging of our populations): \\"This will not be a phase.  We will be older forever.\\" (p. 36)<br /><br />Perhaps the most important truth in the book is this from page 83:<br /><br />[What is really happening is] a massive redistribution [of wealth] from young and future Americans to currently living adults.

And it would seem to be quite a task to prove that God does not exist given that the presumably easier task of proving the positive that God does exist has never been done--at least not done well enough to convince most philosophers.<br />At any rate, what we have here are 32 closely-argued essays and an appendix written by 25 academics collected from mostly philosophic journals such as Philo, Sophia, the International Journal from Philosophy of Religion, etc, along with excerpts from various books.  What is demonstrated is that the sort of hair-splitting arguments for which philosophy is famous are still alive and well in academia.<br />To my mind what the authors come close to proving (in the most painstaking fashion) is that the usual definitions of God are inadequate, thereby allowing one to derive contradictions from those definitions, contradictions that prove that God, defined in such and such a way, cannot exist.  For example (and several of the contributors use variations on this theme), God cannot be all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-benevolent since there exists the palpable presence of evil in the world.  Actually the editors break this down more finely and throw out three categories of &quot;disproofs&quot; which might be called, (1) the argument to disproof from definition; (2) the argument to disproof from evil; and (3) the argument to disproof from doctrine.  In the latter, what is demonstrated is that a particular formulation of God is inconsistent with a particular religious doctrine, demonstrating that THAT God cannot exist.<br />The astute reader will note that all three categories rest on demonstrating a disconnect between definitions.  What the various authors are trying to do is NOT to prove that God does not exist, rather that it is impossible to define God in such a way that contradictions do not arise.  As the editors point out in their introduction, the real task here is to show that God is a logical impossibility, and therefore, like a square circle, cannot exist.<br />One can get a feel for what the authors are up to by considering some of the essay titles.  (God forbid that one should actually read the arguments!)  Matt McCormick, for example, entitles one of his two essays, &quot;Why God Cannot Think&quot; with the subtitle: &quot;Kant, Omnipresence, and Consciousness.&quot;  What McCormick argues (borrowing from Kant) is that since God is omniscient and omnipotent, God is also omnipresent.  However, McCormick argues, such a God cannot have a higher consciousness &quot;because in order to be conscious a being must be limited in ways that an omnipresent thing is not.&quot;  McCormick gets this notion from Kant's idea that &quot;an omnipresent being cannot make object/representation discriminations, so it cannot make a self/other distinction.&quot;  Consequently &quot;it cannot apply concepts or form judgments.&quot;  McCormick goes on to conclude that &quot;an omnipresent being cannot have higher consciousness, so it cannot have a mind.&quot;  Ergo, it cannot think!<br />Regardless of how one might feel about this argument, there is the additional question as to whether proving the impossibility of &quot;it&quot; is the same thing as proving that &quot;it&quot; does not exist.  The other essays are similar in that they attempt to ensnarl prospective gods in webs made from human logic.<br />I have a couple of answers to this (if you will) sophisticated sophistry.<br />First, any God worth the name is beyond the restrictions of human logic, and can even exist and not exist at the same time.  (Demigods, such as the anthropomorphic God as seen in fundamentalist Christianity or the many personifications of God in Hinduism or the gods presented in this book, etc., are a different matter of course.)  In a similar question one might ask can the universe (or anything) exist and not exist?  By the rules of logic, the answer is no.  But might there be some sort of meta-logic of which we are not yet aware?  Consider that something as simple as so-called &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; was unknown to the ancient Greeks, and the Boolean logic taught today was not completely formulated (if it is indeed completely formulated) until recent times.<br />Second, let me present a definition of God that, for some reason, the authors do not consider--or perhaps I missed it among the 439 pages of text.  This is the definition of God from the Vedas, and is the source of the so-called &quot;Way&quot; of the Taoists, namely, a God with no attributes, a God about which nothing can be said, in short &quot;God, the Ineffable.&quot;  I challenge the authors to find some contradiction in a God about which nothing can be said!<br />What I think this book's authors demonstrate is that old saw about the futility of trying to reconcile the ways of God to man.  In a sense, if we reverse the arguments, we can see just how apparently impossible it is to prove the usual--namely that God exists--while demonstrating that to even discuss such matters, it is necessary to have our terms clearly defined.  There is the God of Old Testament.  He is, by his actions, a far cry from the ocean of Brahma that one encounters in the East.<br />Nonetheless I like this book.  It is handsomely presented by Prometheus Books, and well edited and proofread.

It's a splendid example of how good writing, good editing and some excellent research can lead to a felicitous read.  The people at Slate did themselves proud as they swam between the shallows of the sound byte and the depths of the essay.  Let's say that what we have here--and what is increasingly seen in the print and Internet media (including this review)--is something we might call the mini-essay, between five hundred and a thousand words--that is, longer than the buzz on TV but shorter than an article from Harper's or The Atlantic Monthly.<br />Here's an example of the clear, effective writing with just a touch of panache that characterizes this modest volume.  The writers are discussing how and why Supreme Court Justices recuse themselves (something Justice Scalia ought to do in the case before the court involving his good buddy Dick Chaney): \\"Since Supreme Court justices tend to be well off, and since lawyers often marry lawyers and beget more lawyers, money and family come up the most as reasons for recusal.\\" (p. 172)  In the next paragraph, we are given the probable reason that Scalia is not recusing himself: \\"In general justices are loath to recuse themselves from cases because it opens the way for a tie.  When that happens, the lower court decision is affirmed by default.\\"  Hmm, maybe we can predict if a justice, leaning a certain way, is likely to recuse himself by looking at how the lower court ruled.<br />It is this kind of additional insight into the question at hand that lifts the people at Slate above some other \\"explainers\\" that I have read.  Here's another nice example from the double-edged question, \\"How Does the US Mint Make Money?\\"  It makes it two ways, the authors slyly explain.  First it manufactures the actual coins, which is one way of \\"making\\" money; and then it makes money by putting the coins into circulation, which is another way of \\"making\\" money since the banks have to pay for them.  But the zinger is what economists aptly call \\"escheatment\\" (a word Slate doesn't use here).  Simply put, escheatment is the profit the government gains from all the coins and bills that are lost or destroyed.  For the loser that money just disappears.  For the government that money is money it got paid for, and unless the coins or bills are found, it is money that it never has to redeem.  Banks issuing digital credit cards also benefit from escheatment when the cards or lost or destroyed before being emptied.  Traditionally, escheatment refers to governments benefitting from people who die without heirs.<br />I was startled to read that the US Mint \\"estimates that in the first two and a half years [of the commemorative quarters program with states featured on the quarters]...it bagged nearly $3-billion in revenue off quarters alone.\\"  (p. 215)<br />Naturally, I can find some wee fault with this book.  In explaining how to spell \\"Osama\\" and why authorities can differ, the authors determined that \\"the Al-Qaida leader Romanized his name as Usama.\\"  However they don't give his preference on the Romanized spelling of Al-Qaida.  I found myself beginning with Al-Qaida moving on to Al-Qaeda, and now write Al Qaeda.  As the authors quip: \\"Can't we call the whole thing off?\\"<br />More at fault though is their answer to the first question in the book, \\"Can You Break Even Playing Slots?\\"  Their answer is a \\"in the long run\\" no.  My answer (the correct answer of course!) is that if you select only progressive slots that are now paying a premium (an \\"overlay,\\" as the gamblers term it), you can not only break even in the long run, but are almost certain to be ahead in the long run.  The catch here is that the machines are seldom in the overlay mode, and one would have to spend a tremendous amount to time traipsing through the casinos looking for the few progressives that have gone critical.  Their conclusion that \\"conservativemoralist William Bennett,\\" who was the focus of the mini-essay, prevaricated when he contradicted a report that he lost $8-million at the slots, is no doubt essentially correct.<br />The larger chapter headings are called, \\"Bad Ideas,\\" \\"The Criminal Mind,\\" \\"Death,\\"..., \\"Conspiracy Theories,\\" \\"Where Things Come From,\\" and other juicy topics.  Some of the more intriguing questions under the general headings are, \\"Did Saddam Impose a Mustache Mandate?\\"; \\"Do TV Talk Show Hosts Get Paid?\\"; \\"Do You Own the Movie Rights to Your Life?\\" etc.  I'll give you the short answer to that last one: no.<br />The topics, as you'll see, are topical; usually something in the news justifies Slate's interest in taking the trouble to broaden our understanding.  Since there are six topics to each of 28 general headings, there are (grabbing my calculator) 168 questions in all.<br />Bottom line: like a box of chocolates or a bag of Fritos: betcha can't just read one.moralist William Bennett,\\" who was the focus of the mini-essay, prevaricated when he contradicted a report that he lost $8-million at the slots, is no doubt essentially correct. <br />The larger chapter headings are called, \\"Bad Ideas,\\" \\"The Criminal Mind,\\" \\"Death,\\"..., \\"Conspiracy Theories,\\" \\"Where Things Come From,\\" and other juicy topics.

620749:US	49786731	R2ICWVYJRJ36GJ	0595006426	663927150	The Sociopath	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Primitive, but interesting	In some ways this novel is a throwback to the glory days of pulp fiction, say the 1930s when paperback novels were a dime apiece.  They were typically written in a couple of months in a hard-boiled ersatz James M. Cain style with an ordinary joe as the protagonist.  They served well as escapist fare for flophouse waitresses and guys selling apples on street corners.  Even the slightly smudgy-looking typeset in this book--as though the characters had been Xeroxed from Xeroxed copies--suggests an earlier time.<br />In other ways this is like something out of the late 1970s just before AIDS and the backlash against explicit sexuality in the mass culture.  And in still another way this is like the violent movies that came from directors like Quentin Tarantino and Oliver Stone when Hollywood could no longer sell explicit sex and had to switch to violence.<br />The narrative is written in an unpretentious style full of simple, declarative sentences with flashes of oratory such as one might hear from jail house lawyers or barroom philosophers.  Adams has a good ear for low- to middle-class dialogue of the kind that characterized not just the fiction of James M. Cain, but of the now forgotten James T. Farrell and a host of naturalistic imitators.  In a way this work can be seen as a violent offshoot of the proletarian novel of the thirties that came out of the naturalistic tradition from the 19th century.<br />The story itself reads like it was pieced together in a hurry.  Adams apparently wrote the book during the first five months of 1980.  The title, along with a quote from \\"PERSONALITY AND BEHAVIOR Copyright 1963 by Jesse E. Gordon, PhD\\" which serves as a preface, seems tacked on, like an afterthought in an attempt to give the story an intellectual focus.  More appropriate, to my mind, would have been choice words from a tome on nihilism, since that is the sort of cynical philosophy spouted by some of Adams's characters.<br />One of those characters, a black man named Roosevelt Holmes, is, however, not a nihilist, but is an attempt at fulfilling the promise of the book's title.  He is a violent psychopathic rapist and murderer, but his personality is not really worked out.  He has none of the disarming charm and duplicity attributed to sociopaths in the literature.  He is rather a kind of animalistic sexual predator blind to anything other than is own bloody gratification.<br />There are other problems.  Adams begins in the first person and then switches to the third, and alternates back and forth.  While I am not a narrative purest, I think the entire novel could have been written in the third person without losing anything.  Worse yet, because he apparently wanted to keep a silly and unnecessary plot twist hidden until the story is three-quarters over, his first person narrator suddenly becomes somebody else.  I had the sense that this twist occurred to Adams at about the three-quarter mark.  At any rate, after the twist is revealed, one sees a change in self-referentials from the first person narrator.  I'm being vague because I don't want to give away anything important.  I will say that it wasn't foreshadowed, and seems to come completely out of the blue, and again for no reason.  The \\"love affair\\" is quickly disposed of, which is just as well since it had nothing to do with the plot anyway.<br />To illustrate, let's compare the \\"Chris\\" from page 12 with the suddenly different \\"Chris\\" of page 211.<br />Page 12: \\"From now on I could kill any man I wanted, I could overpower any woman I desired, and no one on this earth could do anything about it.\\"<br />Page 211: \\"I tried to cry out but already I was suffused in a glow of sudden pleasure and without even being conscious of it my arms reached around him instinctively and hungrily and I gasped in the lovely gush of wetness and warmth.\\"<br />Another problem is that the characters think an awful lot alike.  The nihilistic speeches from narrator Chris could easily be exchanged with those of lung cancer victim Donald Eckman.  The two women in the story are very similar in that they both take on masculine styles in speech and behavior, and are little concerned with the usual preoccupations of women.  In a strange way, all of the characters seem like sociopaths.  I'm not sure that is what Adams had in mind.<br />And then there are the loose ends.  For example, never explained is how Chris got the government to release the men from prison.  It's not even clear why.  The idea that Vincent Savanna would have the ability to round up all the low-lifes in Minnesota and that there was any point to Chris's preaching to them, seems utterly silly.  Also never explained is how and why a US Army soldier on patrol in Korea would be wearing a moneybelt with \\"one hundred and twenty-three thousand in Won, Yen, script, and American greenbacks\\" or what that has to do with anything.  And resting on the shakiest of rationales is the trailer to be buried in Cohen's yard as some kind of fallout-shelter tomb (although I kind of like the zaniness of it).<br />There is indeed throughout the novel a kind of random association of people, ideas, and places as though quickly thrown together, perhaps because that is what the author wanted to write about that day.  Yet there is a story and a plot--discovered, it would appear in medias res--that leads us from dissatisfaction to chaos.<br />In spite of the faults, there is one thing that Adams does well, and that is write the kind of prose that is easy to read while creating a kind of netherworld of unsavory characters that may fascinate some readers.hose of lung cancer victim Donald Eckman.

638041:US	49786731	R2XRRN92F8Q3G3	0670032735	748219420	The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)leads America	Books	5	105	115	N	N	Doing Machiavelli proud	Of the spate of Bush-bashing books that have recently come out, this is clearly the best.  Eric Alterman, who wrote the incisive What Liberal Media? The Truth about Bias and the News, and Mark Green, who has penned a number of other books on culture, economics, and politics, rise above the others through sheer thoroughness and a convincing literary style that transcends the merely journalistic.<br />Alterman and Green begin with an introduction entitled, \\"The Power of Audacity,\\" which I think sums up the Bush strategy only too well.  When Bush was faced with the prospect of lukewarm support for his longing to invade Iraq, he simply came up with the Big Lie.  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction that he is planning to use against the United States, and he is in cahoots with Al Qaeda in planning further terrorist attacks.  It has been said that if you're going to tell a lie you might as well tell a big one.  Bush may even be aware of this quote from the author of Mein Kampf: \\"The great masses of people...will more easily fall victim to a big lie than to a small one.\\"<br />The authors go on to show where George W. learned his audacity.  From the Harken Energy insider trading that he got away with, to his irresponsible governorship of Texas, to his cozy relationship with Ken Lay at Enron (which he later denied), to his campaign prevarications about never using the US military for nation building or the No Child Left Behind rhetoric that he failed to support with adequate funding, etc., etc., we are treated to a kind of true crime thriller in which the bad guy is a sort of hail fellow well met (on the wagon of course), a good ole boy who steals from the poor and gives to the rich.<br />Alterman and Green have chapters on Bush's \\"Deja Vu-doo Economics,\\" highlighting his anti-environmental energy policies while he thumbs his nose at pollution control and the development of renewable energy sources.  There is information on what the authors call Bush's \\"large portfolio of antiscience policies.\\" (p. 147)  Indeed, as I write this, scores of senators and congressmen are petitioning the president to allow increased stem cell research in an effort to fight Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other scourges of humankind.  But Bush continues to play a kind of reincarnation of the ignorant William Jennings Bryan who thought he had defeated \\"the infidels of evolution at the Scopes Trail of 1925.\\"  Also highlighted is the fact that, although the scientific evidence is overwhelming as glaciers melt around the world, Bush continues to deny that the case for global warming has been made and has called for more studies, effectively ignoring the problem.<br />The authors however don't think that George W. is quite as dumb and self-deceptive as many others believe.  They write \\"we think him dumb like a fox.\\"  Nonetheless they charge that \\"George W. Bush entered office with less understanding of American history and the world than probably any twentieth-century predecessor.\\"  Add that to Bush's appalling lack of scientific knowledge and his dismal ignorance about other peoples and other cultures, and we have one of the most ignorant men ever to occupy the White House.  Perhaps the double-edged nature of the real George W. Bush can be summed up with these ironic words from neocon strategist Richard Perle, \\"The first time I met Bush 43, I knew he was different...One, he didn't know very much.  The other was that he had the confidence to ask questions that revealed he didn't know very much.\\" (p. 3)<br />All these stupidities and prevarications are explored in full, and more, leaving us to wonder how we got into this mess in the first place.  Blame the Supreme Court (and by extension, the previous presidents, especially Reagan and Bush 41 who appointed those justices)?  Or blame the media for being too cowardly to expose Bush's lies on the campaign trail?  Or blame a semi-educated electorate?  Personally I blame the nature of the electoral process in which TV and other advertising can swing an election toward the candidate with the most money.<br />And what about the consequences of having this guy in office?  The really terrible thing about George W. Bush is that he has so often taken the position that truth in politics is the way to go, that he would bring honesty and integrity to a White House soiled by the presence of a philanderer; yet the truth is that the one shameful lie that Clinton told caused no one to die, while the lies of George W. Bush have (at last count) caused over 800 American soldiers to die in Iraq, with thousands injured, to say nothing of tens of thousands of Iraqi dead.  And for what?  To provide Al Qaeda with a $200-billion recruiting poster?<br />In other words, not only has George W. Bush mislead the American people, he has caused grievous harm in the process.  The massive treasury giveaway to his corporate buddies is something we and our children will pay for again and again over the next couple of decades.  The loss of international prestige we suffer because of his misuse of American power and his disregard for the welfare of others is something we will all have to live with for years to come.<br />It is too bad that the startling information in this book will reach only a very small percentage of the electorate.  One hopes, however, that enough of it will trickle down so that the most mendacious president in our history--perhaps even topping Richard Milhouse Nixon in premeditated lies--will be shown the door come November, 2004.<br />Another good read in a similar vein is The Lies of George W.

His command of the modern history of the Middle East is admirable and obvious.<br />But Khalidi is not a disinterested observer by any stretch of the imagination.  He has an agenda, that of laying the blame for the backwardness of the Middle East at the doorstep of the West while championing the cause of the Islamic people of the region.  He is especially passionate when presenting the case for the Palestinians.  His outrage at the historical record of a brutal, exploitive, and hypocritical colonialism (was there any other kind?) by the West, especially Great Britain and France, fairly singes the pages.  His disgust at the stupidity, mendacity, and narrow-mindedness of the current Bush administration is palpable.<br />What Khalidi does not do very well is offer the sort of forward-looking, balanced, and  dispassionate critique that would lead to a solution to the trouble in the Middle East.  He offers a first step toward a solution to the problem in Iraq, namely that of a multilaterally-guided transition to a sovereign Iraq as opposed to the current bilateralism of the United States and Great Britain.  Along the way he points out that it was the Western powers who concocted the artificial Iraqi state in the first place, and it was the Cold War US government that supported Saddam Hussein and helped him to brutalize the Iraqi people.  However he does not offer specifics on how a recurrence of a Baathist-like dictatorship, or a civil war, or a Shiite theocracy (or all three in succession) can be avoided after the Western powers leave.  Furthermore in the seething chapter on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict he offers no solution at all, merely a call for &quot;real&quot; negotiations toward a solution, with the implication that the solution he has in mind is not for public consumption.  The very title of his chapter, &quot;The United States and Palestine&quot; hints at his attitude toward Israel and what his solution might be.<br />What Khalidi does not see (and in his way is as blind as the neocons in the White House) is that the United States and Israel and others have their interests as well.  It is one thing to cite history and its inequities; it is another thing to realize that regardless of the mistakes made in the past, we have the present to deal with, and that any solution in the Middle East will require that the interests of people alive today be acknowledged and taken into consideration.  Just as a military &quot;victory&quot; over Saddam Hussein is no solution to the problems the Iraqi people and the region face, neither is any &quot;shut up and go home&quot; solution going to work for the rest of the world.  Certainly the US is not going to allow Israel to be overrun, nor are we, rightly or wrongly, going to sit by quietly while an Iran-like theocracy bent on acquiring nuclear weapons and exporting its Islamic rule, mushrooms out of the debris in Iraq.  It is not just realpolitik but realism itself that dictates that the world cannot allow an unbridled Islamic radicalism of the sort that exists in Iran, or even worse, of the sort that had taken over Afghanistan, to expand.<br />Khalidi argues strongly that the US hasn't paid sufficient attention to &quot;the region's political dynamics&quot; or given the &quot;Middle Eastern realities&quot; the seriousness they deserve (p. 165).  I think he's right; however the same could be said about his non-awareness of the global realities.<br />For all his learnedness and his sharply candid expression, unfortunately I see in Khalidi's overall tone and approach the partisan politician more than I see the historian or the political scientist.  Typical is this from page 172 (and elsewhere): &quot;Iraqis and others in the Middle Easthave a strong sense of history.&quot;  (And other people don't?)  This vague and superior sound-byte pronouncement from on high reminds me unhappily of what politicians in the US are fond of doing, that is, telling us what &quot;the American people&quot; think.<br />Carrying this historical burden (that Khalidi seems to think the Iraqi people are especially saddled with) to an absurdity (still on page 172), he objects to what he sees as &quot;a symbolic contingent of Mongolian soldiers&quot; as part of the US-led coalition in Iraq.  He believes their presence may provoke &quot;vividly the history of earlier occupations of Baghdad, such as that in 1258 when it was sacked by the Mongols&quot;!  Yes, that's 1258.<br />Bottom line: partisan, passionate, even prejudicial, but very much worth reading.t have a strong sense of history.&quot;  (And other people don't?)

There are 22 California wild life habitats, from marshes, chaparral, grasslands...to  mountain meadows.  Included is #13 &quot;cultivated &amp; urban&quot; wherein one finds mourning doves, opossums, Norway rats, crows, etc.  Actually I saw a pair of magnificent red-tailed hawks in some trees up the slope toward the Palos Verdes peninsula (clearly an urban area) three or four years ago, but this guide assumes they are gone from the built-up areas, and maybe today, sadly, they are.<br />The habitat areas are color-coded to an eight-part map of California.  (The book itself is revised from &quot;The California Wildlife Map&quot; originally published in five sections.)  Thus grasslands are yellow with black lines while chaparral forests are yellow with y-shaped black lines.  Humid coastal coniferous forests are in green with little trees while oak or foothill woodlands are in blue, and so on, so that one can see at a glance which kinds of habitat cover the various areas of California.<br />The animals are arranged roughly according to families and orders (ducks, sparrows, rabbit-like animals, fish, etc) but the plants are presented in terms of habitats, e.g., fresh-water areas, mountain meadows, grasslands, etc.<br />What is particularly handy about this guide is that by keying the plants and animals to habitat, the hiker does not have look through the entire book when hiking through the chaparral (for example) to know which kinds of wildlife to expect.  The plant species--typically illustrated by crown, leaf, flower, and fruit--are what the authors call &quot;indicator species&quot; which constitute 90% of the plants in most habitats.<br />I have an earlier edition of this book which is practically falling apart, but I wouldn't trade it for several times its cost.  The black and white drawings are particularly well-done and allow easy identification of species--well, at least for the animals.  I have a bit more difficulty with the plants, but I am hardly a botanist.  Clearly this book is not exhaustive, nor does it make a distinction between native and introduced species.h constitute 90% of the plants in most habitats.<br />I have an earlier edition of this book which is practically falling apart, but I wouldn't trade it for several times its cost.

645836:US	49786731	R3NDJXWHBQATT0	0742527948	545234154	Before California: An Archaeologist Looks at our Earliest Inhabiatants	Books	5	19	21	N	N	Archaeology well-told and made fascinating	What Brian Fagan, who is a world-renown authority on archaeology and Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, does that I like very much is imagine what everyday life was like among the first human inhabitants of California and describe that life.<br />Typically he opens a chapter with a scene from the past.  For example he imagines the early Californians hunting a bear by using smoke to disorient the animal and to force it out of its cave and spears and arrows to kill it.  Or he shows how the acorns, which came to be the main source of sustenance for the natives, are harvested by shaking the trees.  Or how dolphins were hunted at Eel Point on San Clemente Island.  In this imagination Fagan uses material from anthropologists elsewhere in the world including Judy Porcasi's observations of modern-day shallow water dolphin hunting in Polynesia.  This &quot;reconstruction&quot; of what must have happened (or something very similar) is a technique that Fagan returns to again and again to help the reader visualize a way of life not recorded and only sparsely evidenced.  Indeed this is the job of the archaeologist: to make the dim past come alive so that we may get a better idea of who we are and from whence we came.<br />Some highlights: Fagan does not believe that the first settlers who came from Siberia came in canoes and other sea craft along the shoreline. He sees instead a migration across the Bering Land Bridge through present day Alaska and Canada between the Cordileran Ice Sheet to the west and the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the east and into what is now the northern and midwestern United States, and from there into California.  And after that in reverse order up the coast.  In other words southern and central California had human settlers before northern coastal California.<br />Of course California is a vast land with a multitude of microclimates and natural communities.  In the great basins for thousands of years the natives subsisted on grains shaken from their stalks at exactly the right time of the year, and then ground on milling stones into flour, while along the coast the bulk of calories came from the taking of sea mammals, fish, clams, mussels and other shoreline creatures.  But Fagan also shows us how the climate changed over the millennia and how the dwindling stocks of animals, such as the easy-to-kill seals, forced the inhabitants to find other sources of sustenance.  The greatest change came about when humans learned to leach the tannins from acorns and thereby free up a rich source of fat, protein and carbohydrates for consumption.  Fagan explains how the acorns were harvested, how they were stored in thatched granaries away from rodents (&quot;with pungent, minty wormwood to repel insects and worms&quot;); how they were shelled and pounded with pestle and mortar into flour, and how they were leached by flushing water repeatedly through the meal, and finally made into breads, soups and gruels.<br />What is fascinating about all this is the time scale and comparisons we might make with what was happening elsewhere in the world.  Independently the people of the eastern Mediterranean world some few thousand years prior had learned to process and consume acorns as a diet staple.  Here we see a people discover a not-at-all-obvious process from necessity and without cultural guidance.<br />Fagan also shows how, as the climate warmed and the humans learned how to better use the resources of the land, populations increased, and how the peoples learned to trade and to compete with one another.  He shows how the population grew from sparsely scattered bands to &quot;tribelets&quot; and into tribes and how that changed the way people lived.  This a story that begins before 11,200 B.C.--a time when agriculture and animal husbandry was just beginning in the Middle East and the ice age had barely begun its retreat--until the time of European contact and into the modern age.  It is a tale of human ingenuity in a sometimes very harsh land, and of human adaptation to vast climate and environmental changes.  It is of necessity a largely incomplete story, pieced together from the usual artifacts of archaeology--hieroglyphs and stone tools, animal bones and hunting arrows, milling stones and obsidian knives, etc., amended with insights from elsewhere in the world, and fleshed out with the imagination of a great archaeologist.<br />Fagan even gives us a glimpse of California 18,000 years ago when there were no human settlements (&quot;No wisps of camp fire smoke rise from lake- or riverside encampments&quot;) and &quot;herds of large Ice Age species like the long-haired mammoth...wild horses, and several forms of camels&quot; still roamed the land.  It is a pristine world that I have often dreamed about with cave bears and saber-tooth tigers and vast herds of bison and ferocious grizzly bears.  Fagan imagines how this land appeared to the first settlers and how they went about making it their home and how they evolved with the land as it changed over the millennia.  It is a great story and one that Fagan tells very well.human ingenuity in a sometimes very harsh land, and of human adaptation to vast climate and environmental changes.

General Clark provides a map and recalls operations and gives a detailed strategic look at how the war was won.  Then on page 83 he begins his critique and analysis of the &quot;victory&quot; in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  It is here that the book becomes most interesting and most enlightening.<br />Clark finished this book sometime early in the fall of 2003 before the full extent of the Bush administration's failure in postwar Iraq became clear.  Nonetheless Clark anticipated the failures, and his critique is devastating.  When one adds it to some of the other criticisms that have come from distinguished military experts--the latest of which was General Anthony Zinni's appearance on Sixty Minutes (May 23, 2004) in which he said that had he made the mistakes in planning that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld had made, he would be compelled to resign--one is forced to recognize not only failure but premeditated and deliberate ignorance and incompetence.<br />While the old saw that &quot;war is too important to be left to the generals&quot; is still viable, it is equally true that to ignore or to go against the advice of those most experienced in such matters is foolhardy.  Imagine yourself as President of the United States being told by your most experienced and senior generals such as Wesley K. Clark and Colin Powell--just to mention the two most prominent--that an invasion of Iraq would be unwise, counterproductive, and very expensive both in terms of monies spent and lives lost.  What would you do?<br />What Bush did was to ignore the experts and to go with the neoconservative ideologues in and around the White House and people like Rumsfeld, and to do it without thinking the consequences completely through.  As Gen. Clark so calmly and convincingly points out, the invasion of Iraq was a military success and a reconstruction failure of the most obvious and predictable sort.  He writes, &quot;Destruction of enemy forces on the battlefield creates a necessary--but not sufficient--condition for victory.&quot; (p. 88)  More specifically, the planners failed to anticipate &quot;various contingencies...including the possibility of postwar Iraqi resistance.&quot; (pp. 86-87)  It is amazing to realize that the Bush White House apparently thought that the scattered Baathist elements and the Shia faithful would turn into flower children and hand out daises to the occupying soldiers.<br />Perhaps the simplest and most telling criticism is that &quot;decisive operations (how to defeat Iraqi forces) had taken priority over the postwar plan (how to achieve the real objectives in Iraq).&quot; (p. 89)  However Clark's most important criticism is this: &quot;the Administration raised the costs and risks of the mission by preventing our use of the full array of tools available to win modern war&quot; by being &quot;unwilling to exploit the international legitimacy and support from international institutions like the United Nations and NATO.&quot; (p. 92)<br />Now in May 2004 as I write this, Bush is practically begging the UN and anybody else who will listen to help us extract ourselves from the quagmire.<br />As to Bush's motive for invading Iraq, Clark asks, &quot;if a primary but unspoken purpose of the campaign was to demonstrate the skills and courage of the American armed forces, then surely... [the military invasion] was a success.&quot; (p. 101)  What he is suggesting (in a larger and less sanitized sense) is that we showed the world not only the awesome power of our weapons but our willingness to use them.  I think that this was the real purpose of the invasion of Iraq.  An easy victory against an overmatched (and evil) opponent in which the &quot;shock and awe&quot; of our military might could be displayed for all the world to see was what Bush had in mind.  One cannot help but observe that such a scenario (successfully constructed) would work toward his becoming a two-term president and would fit well the mind set of a mediocre man whose personal advantages had allowed him many easy victories in his personal life.<br />Another &quot;unspoken&quot; reason for invading Iraq was to draw attention away from the fact that we had not caught Osama bin Laden and that the Bush administration really did not (and does not) know how to go about doing that.  Let me make a suggestion: use the $200-billion plus that we have squandered in Iraq to persuade the tribesmen and warlords of Afghanistan and the government of Pakistan to help us find bin Laden.  What Bush has accomplished in Iraq amounts to a giant recruiting poster for terrorists.  Indeed the boots on the ground in Iraq serve as training targets for a mushrooming terrorist population.<br />Clark also addresses the larger theoretical issues, that of preemptive wars (he's in favor of them but only as self-defense on a multilateral basis) and the delusion of an American Empire.  He points out that the word &quot;empire&quot; no longer has any real military or economic meaning.  The US in fact, through globalization, has in effect created an economic empire, the maintenance of which requires a lot more than military might.  Clark calls this the &quot;virtual&quot; American empire, and I think that is insightfully apt terminology.<br />There's a lot more to this book than I can discuss here, but let me add one more thing.  Clark makes the astute observation that one of the tactics of terrorism is entice governments into instituting &quot;repressive security measures...and so lose the support of its citizens&quot; (p. 106) We can see the beginnings of such measures in the United States with the Patriot Act.  One hopes that we do not fall into this trap, the ancient one of allowing the ends to justify the means on our way to becoming our enemy.e that such a scenario (successfully constructed) would work toward his becoming a two-term president and would fit well the mind set of a mediocre man whose personal advantages had allowed him many easy victories in his personal life.<br />Another &quot;unspoken&quot; reason for invading Iraq was to draw attention away from the fact that we had not caught Osama bin Laden and that the Bush administration really did not (and does not) know how to go about doing that.

Mead's position is that Bush made mostly the right choices even if some of the planning and execution were not the best.  Along the way I think Mead does a good job of explaining why the current administration believes that preemptive wars and unilateralism are sometimes necessary.  He uses a plethora of coinages, American Revivalists, Arabian Fascism, millennial capitalism, harmonic convergence, Wilsonian Revivalism, Fordism, etc., in an attempt to provide a historical context.  To be honest I got a little lost among these labels and had to frequently turn to the index to look up their first use so as to keep them straight in my head.<br />Mead's approach is bipartisan and he strives to make it non-religious as well, although ending the book with a quote from Christ is perhaps not the best way to achieve that, nor is some seeming naivete about the double meaning of the word &quot;revival.&quot;  Indeed one gets the sense that Mead is not only cozying up to neoconservatives but to Christian fundamentalists as well.  Nonetheless he also quotes the Prophet; and the label he pins on Middle Eastern terrorists, &quot;Arabian Fascists,&quot; attempts to secularize the conflict.  Of course he can use all the labels he wants (some of which are clearly euphemistic while others are attempts at political correctness and bipartisanship); regardless the conflict between the West and the terrorists in the Middle East will continue to be played out in quasi-religious terms.<br />In addition to labels, Mead also uses special terms to define American power.  There is &quot;sharp,&quot; &quot;soft,&quot; &quot;sticky,&quot; and &quot;sweet&quot; power.  Sharp power is military force and it is, to use Mead's words, &quot;a very practical and unsentimental thing.&quot; (p. 26)  Soft power is &quot;cultural power, the power of example.&quot;  Sticky power is economic power and it is sticky because it enmeshes others into economic dependence on business with the US.  Sweet power is pretty much the same thing as soft power, &quot;the power of attraction to American ideals, culture and power.&quot; (p. 36)  In some places in the world, I would guess, sweet power would more properly be called &quot;saccharine power.&quot;<br />Clearly this is American foreign policy seen from and justified from an American point of view.  Thus Mead writes, &quot;We do not want to...[impose] our will at gunpoint, but we also do not want to live in a world in which the United States cannot act without permission from a majority of other countries.&quot; (p. 63)  This seems reasonable, and at any rate is realistic, but there is a fine line between realpolitik and the sort of absolutist belief in our righteousness that leads to the use of force to impose our will.  Indeed Mead writes &quot;that, for neoconservatives and Revival Wilsonians generally, American power is itself the summum bonum of world politics.&quot;  He adds, &quot;The End is so noble...that realist means are fully justified.&quot; (p. 90)  The danger here is that along the way we may become that which we are fighting against.<br />Sometimes Mead's tone gets away from him and we are treated to indecorous outbursts.  For example, while justifying the invasion of Iraq as a part of the greater war on terror, Mead writes, &quot;This was a war, and the enemy had to learn who was the strongest and, if it came to that, the most ruthless.&quot; (p. 117)  I dearly would hope that we can conduct the &quot;war&quot; against terrorists without becoming more ruthless than the terrorists.<br />At other times he is a bit snide, as when he remarks that &quot;stroking Europe only seemed to increase Europe's already inflated sense of its importance in the world of American foreign policy.&quot; (p. 132)  This is the mentality of the old politics among nations based on power.  However I don't think this is the way we can best achieve American values and goals in the world.  As Mead himself admits later on, less than five percent of the world's population, regardless of its power, cannot hope to control the other 95%. (p. 212)<br />Often Mead uses fuzzy phrases to make what are largely rhetorical points.  In this way he reveals the politician in his soul rather than the professional journalist that he is.  For example he writes, &quot;The United States is not going to slow down its capitalist development to avoid offending the sensitivities of foreign countries...&quot; (p. 159)  But what does &quot;capitalist development&quot; mean?  Is that the development of the Brazilian jungle or the Iraqi oil pipelines or is that about some infrastructure at home?<br />One can discern Mead's bottom line position from this statement on page 160: &quot;A perfectly justifiable military action against the rogue regime in Iraq was effectively and widely portrayed as an assault by the United States against the foundations of international order.&quot;  And one can see that he has a desire to broaden the war on terror when he avers that &quot;Countries that allow their territory to host terror camps...and who...allow their financial systems to be used...[by] terrorist groups, are committing acts of war against civilization.&quot; (p. 174)  I tend to agree with this sentiment, but does that mean we should consider invading Saudi Arabia?<br />Where I find myself in substantial agreement with Mead is that the structure of the United Nations must be amended in such a way as to reflect the actual distribution of power in the world.  As Mead notes it is not right that (for example) France should have veto power over the rest of the world, or that a country with a million people should have the same voting power as a country with a billion people.  Indeed, I believe that restructuring the UN and other international organizations such as the WTO should be a major goal of US foreign policy.e world.

All effective methods rely first and foremost on how they guide us away from reactive and emotionally-based behaviors and keep us on the proper path.  Note well that Phelan's method requires the parent to understand that \\"Too Much Talking\\" and \\"Too Much Emotion\\" by the parent will lead to failure.  Understanding why this is so is the key to understanding why Phelan's method is so effective.<br />Usually parents get caught in the trap of explaining or justifying their prerogative.  This can be done once: clearly I am the adult, and not only is it my responsibility to guide your development, but, because I have been where you are and understand your situation--mainly frustration at not getting what you want--it is I, not you, who are in a position to make the right decisions.  Period.  Indeed, this doesn't even have to be said once.  Children understand, with or without realizing it, that Mom and Dad know better than they do.<br />So any sort of \\"talk\\" is not only superfluous but may obscure what has happened, namely that the child has done something wrong and the parent wants it stopped.  Furthermore, if you talk, the child talks and the lesson is diluted.<br />Even worse is for the parent to get emotional about disciplining the child.  It's your job, do it and don't get worked up about it because discipline is just a technique in the larger socialization process.  If you allow yourself to become emotional, you muddy up the waters and detract from the business at hand.<br />Phelan's 1-2-3 Magic technique works and is easy to learn and implement.  If you are an ineffective disciplinarian, this book will literally change your life.  My daughter and son-in-law use this method and I can tell you without it they would be foundering about, and their ability to guide my grandsons would be weakened.  Never forget however that what children respond to is fairness, even-handedness, and the love that is implicit in a sincere desire to help them become fully realized human beings.  Or, as Phelan succinctly puts it: \\"...children respond because they know Mom or Dad means business.\\" (p. 50)<br />Just a quick word on this \\"meaning business.\\"  If you say \\"that's two and a half\\" and \\"that's two and three-quarters,\\" you are NOT getting down to business.  You are demonstrating that you aren't sure yourself that you are right while proving that you are unreliable.  Phelan warns against this all too common parental trap.<br />Note too that there is no corporal punishment involved in Phelan's method.  In today's world of the \\"professional parent\\" (as I like to dub my daughter and son-in-law) it is axiomatic that one does not hit or slap a child.  But why?  Of course violent behavior only begets violent behavior, but more than that, not hitting protects the parent from going too far.  Hitting leads to more hitting.  But if one never hits to begin with there is no danger of escalation.  Only foolish and lazy parents hit their children.  Phelan's method is an extension of this wise understanding.<br />The devil is in the details of parenting, you say?  Yes, and in this very well written (the phrase \\"clear as a bell\\" definitely applies), you will get the details of how the method is applied in many situations and circumstances.  Wondering how to put the child in \\"time out\\" at the supermarket?  Phelan goes into that. What about the difference between \\"stop that!\\" and \\"do that\\"?  It's one thing to get a child to stop doing something wrong.  It's quite another to get the child to actually do something that needs to be done, like clean her room or do her homework.  Phelan explains the difference between these two problems and how to deal with them.<br />Here's a another question: should the child have to apologize for what he did?  Phelan warns that \\"many apologies are really exercises in hypocrisy.\\" (p. 54)  The child is forced to apologize for hitting his sister, but he really feels that the apology is just part of the punishment.  She hit him first and she deserved it.  The fine points of the murky psychology of retaliation must wait for the older child to emerge.  Right now, you just stop the hitting, period.<br />Finally, what to do in public?  Phelan devotes an entire chapter to that, and basically he says you have to bite the bullet and realize that the future character of your child is more important than any embarrassment you may experience from \\"counting\\" your child in public.  Once you let the child know that being in public is no different than being at home, the child will behave.  However if you let it be known that you are \\"vulnerable\\" when you're out in public, the child will immediately take advantage.  Children love to test.  They need to test.  That's how they figure out their world.<br />Part of the reason this book is so polished and Phelan's methods so precise is that \\"over the many years of developing\\" his program parents have taught him how to handle tricky situations so that he now has it all covered.  Also clear is Phelan's understanding of children and their needs, and the obvious affection he has for them.  As he says (after you have initially explained that you are going to begin using the 1-2-3 counting method): \\"Expect the kids to sit there and look at you like you've just gone off your rocker.\\" (p. 68)<br />Bottom line here is: if you are not aware of Phelan's very effective technique, do yourself and your children a favor and get this book.xercises in hypocrisy.\\" (p. 54)  The child is forced to apologize for hitting his sister, but he really feels that the apology is just part of the punishment.

The authors, who are historians and philosophers and heady intellectuals of the sort that grace the pages of The New York Review of [Each Other's] Books with their speculations, think they have found something in their notion of &quot;occidentalism.&quot;  Occidentalism, they have decided is the way the East, or to be more accurate, primarily the Islamic Middle East, views the West.  They are writing in partial reaction to Edward Said's book, Orientalism from 1978 and in more immediate reaction to Islamic terrorism.<br />Their idea is first to imagine that such a world view as occidentalism exists, and then to trace its roots and weigh what influence various religious, social and political ideas have had in its formation, including Marxism, German militarism and German romanticism, &quot;State Shinto&quot; and other aspects of Japanese nationalism, Russian nativism, and especially Islamic radicalism.  The problem with this of course is that no such animal exists.  Occidentalism is just a fancy term for a confusion of views opposed to Western culture.<br />There is no occidentalism anymore than there is an occident that can be defined.  There is widespread hatred of Western culture, but it has less to do with all the ism's that the authors come up with (or their city versus country polarity), and more to do with religious animosity, remnants of colonial exploitation, poverty, jealousy, and plain ignorance.  It has little to do with the intellectual notions that fascinate the authors.<br />Additionally, just as there is no occident anymore (people living in China, Japan, Korea, etc., when they look toward the east to see the rising sun look, as they must, across a vast ocean toward the Americas) there is also no orient as such.  Indeed today is it considered politically incorrect to refer to Asians as orientals, and it has been a long time since people in the Middle East were lumped together as orientals.  Such artificial distinctions reflect a categorical way of thinking that no longer has much meaning other than as history.  The authors, however, like the man searching under a lighted post for his keys (which he dropped elsewhere) are shining the light of their particular learning upon something that isn't there.<br />Supporting such intellectual vacuousness is the style employed by the authors.  Consider this statement from page 12: &quot;Occidentalism is not the same as anti-Americanism.&quot;  One would expect an explanation to follow, a distinction to be made.  Instead the authors go off on a tangent about visiting Karl Marx's grave and how eastern European Jews found that Germans lacked &quot;a spiritual dimension.&quot;  They never return to support their statement.  The whole book has this quality of expressing an idea and never actually demonstrating that it has anything other than rhetorical value.<br />There are many other better books to read on why the West is hated.  For a focus on how the Islamic peoples of the Middle East came to hate the West, I recommend Bernard Lewis's succinct,  What Went Wrong? Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response (2002) or the more detailed War without End: The Rise of Islamist Terrorism and Global Response (2002) by Dilip Hiro.her as orientals.

Bush became president.\\" (p. 74)<br />The first part of this book is a devastating critique of the imperialistic intent of the Bush administration.  Soros constructs calmly and with measured deliberation a very sharp and very large pin, as it were, with which to burst the delusive bubble of what he calls the Bush doctrine of \\"American supremacy.\\"  He explains why it has failed in Iraq and why it will fail elsewhere.  He avers:<br />\\"The United States cannot be either the police or the godparent of the world.  America needs to work together with other countries.\\"  (p. 114)<br />I will not reprise his arguments here.  Read them for yourself.  To my mind they are utterly convincing.  What I want to do instead is to present Soros's solution which is the subject of the second part of the book.  His intent is to avoid a repetition of Bush's blunder in Iraq while at the same time protect the world from repressive and murderous regimes.  What he has come up with is a shift in understanding of sovereignty from the sovereignty of governments to the sovereignty of people.  He writes:<br />\\"The principle of sovereignty needs to be reconsidered.  Sovereignty belongs to the people; the people are supposed to delegate it to the government through the electoral process.\\" (p. 102)<br />He goes on to argue that the international community of states has the \\"responsibility to protect\\" the people from regimes intent on murder and mayhem.  His intent is to justify intervention in the internal affairs of nations since he believes that what happens within a nation affects the world as a whole.  Soros argues further that it would be a good idea to prevent crises before they develop.  Instead of \\"the Bush doctrine of preemptive action of a military nature\\" he calls for \\"a doctrine of preventive action of a constructive nature.\\" (p. 111)<br />Part of the impetus for Soros's argument comes from the Warsaw Declaration of 2000 in which it is proclaimed that \\"it is in the interest of all democratic countries...to foster the development of democracy in all other countries.\\" (p. 112)<br />While Soros is a brilliant man of great visionary ability, I think it can be safely said that his doctrine is, considering the present state of international affairs, utopian.  Nonetheless I think he is actually predicting what will happen in the future, although I don't think that such actions will be carried out by or under the auspices of the United Nations as it is presently constituted (and Soros says as much: see pp. 114-117).  What Soros is envisioning is a coalition of democratic states led by the US and the European Union countries along with other economically and socially advanced countries deciding at some point that it is in their best interests to put the dictators and failed regimes out of business and to support and nurture democratic ones.  If this works then the entire world might be constituted of nation states who solve their differences without recourse to the use of military force.  At such time a new United Nations will be formed with a more equitable distribution of power among its members as well as greater authority and the real ability to enforce its regulations.  Such a United Nations would be something similar to a United States of the World.<br />As interesting sidebar to Soros's argument is the idea that it is the very process of globalization that leads to the need to intervene in the internal affairs of nations.  It is because of the international exchange of goods and services and the globalization of capital that the interests of one nation are affected by the actions of another.  The resources of any one nation are themselves international.  It used to be, as Soros points out, that most of the economic activity of any given state was internal.  Now we have our wealth all over the globe.  Consequently we must have theinstitutions that protect our interests and ensure the \\"maintenance of the market mechanism itself\\" all over the globe.<br />Should there be any doubt about the revolutionary nature of Soros's new world order, consider this from page 142: \\"The natural resources of a country ought to belong to the people, but the rulers often exploit the resources for their own personal needs.  This violates the sovereignty of the people and calls for external intervention.\\"<br />Consider this as well: \\"...the United States cannot avoid intervening in the internal affairs of other countries, but I claim that we must do so only on legitimate grounds.\\" He quickly adds, so that there can be no mistake:  \\"The Bush doctrine cannot be accepted by the rest of the world as legitimate.\\"  (pp. 171-172)<br />I highly recommend that readers read the Appendix entitled \\"My Conceptual Framework.\\"  In it Soros presents his ideas about \\"reflexivity,\\" \\"radical fallibility,\\" \\"the open society,\\" and \\"the human uncertainty principle.\\"  Here's a sample of the profound understanding that this brilliant man has come to over the course of his extraordinary life: \\"We must treat our beliefs as provisionally true while keeping them open to constant reexamination.  This is the foundation principle of an open society.\\" (p. 195)<br />This principle, I must note, is allied to the idea of the invisible hand of the free market in which the intelligence of uncounted participants is reflected.  There is a cognate in the ideas that are coming out of complexity theory in which we learn that intelligence is not a top down phenomenon, but something that can be brought about by autonomous individuals acting cooperatively like the neurons of our brains or ants in a colony or bees in a hive.  But if individuals are not free to express themselves, but are oppressed by authority, their wisdom will never reach coalescence.institutions that protect our interests and ensure the \\"maintenance of the market mechanism itself\\" all over the globe.<br />Should there be any doubt about the revolutionary nature of Soros's new world order, consider this from page 142: \\"The natural resources of a country ought to belong to the people, but the rulers often exploit the resources for their own personal needs.

675069:US	49786731	RG745ZMYN7Q8K	0767911725	278453143	Language Visible: Unraveling the Mystery of the Alphabet from A to Z	Books	5	27	27	N	N	Beautiful, delightful, and highly informative	Scrabble players take delight.  Linguists and lovers of the phonetic stand up and cheer.  In this original and delightful book the letters take on their own personalities as author David Sacks reveals their origins and their transitions from ancient tongues into modern English.<br />Combining classic erudition (Sacks is the author of The Encyclopedia of the Ancient Greek World) with contemporary references and allusions--such as &quot;p&quot; being for &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; and &quot;w&quot; for President George W. (Dubya) Bush--David Sacks brings the alphabet to life and reveals its long and twisted history.<br />The sounds and shapes of the letters are explored in minute detail.  We can trance the evolution of the letter &quot;a&quot; from its Phoenician origins as the symbol for an ox to its use by Hebrews as &quot;aleph&quot; to its incorporation by the Greeks as &quot;alpha,&quot; and know that A was always first.  We can see how the letter &quot;e&quot; (the most frequently used letter in the English language) was once shaped like a stick figure man in Egypt around 1800 B.C. in a long dead Semitic language, and how it became the logo for Enron (tilted up so that it supposedly symbolized &quot;ascent and power&quot;).  Sacks reveals that one such Enron sculpture sold for forty-four thousand dollars at an auction in September 2002.<br />Why does X stand for the unknown and not Z?  Sacks has the answer.  How did G become C when the Greeks had gamma as the third letter of their alphabet?  Indeed why do we have an alphabet at all?  Why do we have alphabetic writing instead of the nonalphabetic kind as used by the Chinese and others?  Sacks answers these questions and hundreds of others.  He is obviously a man who takes delight in esoteric detail and in learning for the sake of learning, but he writes like a popular artist, not like a pedant.  He takes delight in contrasting the old with the new.<br />The way the book is structured invites us in without preliminary.  There is no table of contents, but there is an index.  The &quot;chapters&quot; are not numbered.  (They are lettered, of course!)  The beginning word of each chapter is the same as the focus of its subject matter.  Thus the chapter on A begins, &quot;Associated with beginnings, fundamentals, and superiority,&quot; while the next chapter has &quot;Below the best or second in sequence.&quot;<br />A form of each letter in some specialized or historic typeface and/or some information about it graces the offsetting page of chapter beginnings.  An emblem from the Department of Agriculture for &quot;Grade A&quot; is one example; an embedded M in an illustration from the Mad-Hatter's party in Alice in Wonderland is another; and three zees penned by American type designer Frederic W. Goudy is still another.  Each letter has a personality tag: there is the &quot;Dependable D,&quot; the &quot;Gorge-ous G,&quot; the &quot;Exzotic Z,&quot; etc.<br />There is a Preface and an introductory chapter entitled, &quot;Little Letters, Big Idea.&quot;  The morphological history of each letter is illustrated showing the progression in many cases from the Egyptian hieroglyph to the Phoenician letter and then through the Hebrew, Greek and Roman adaptations and on into English.  It was the letter N not the letter S that was originally an Egyptian snake, although Ben Johnson called S, &quot;the serpent's letter,&quot; and it is often depicted as such.  And it is M that comes from the hieroglyph for water, not, as one might think, W.<br />There are sidebar mini-essays and longer ones set over gray shading, each one focusing on some aspect of letters and their history, such as &quot;The Alphabet in the Middle Ages,&quot; or &quot;The Creation of American Spelling.&quot;  Sacks does not neglect the sounds of letters and how they have been pronounced over the ages.  In so far as possible he gives that history as well.  He even explains why some letters are pronounced with an initial vowel sound, S and F, for example; and how others are pronounced with a trailing vowel sound, such as, B and C.<br />This is a highly visual book written in an infectious style that makes the alphabet anything but boring.  It is a beautiful book and one to treasure.  I am much impressed.und, S and F, for example; and how others are pronounced with a trailing vowel sound, such as, B and C.<br />This is a highly visual book written in an infectious style that makes the alphabet anything but boring.

676125:US	49786731	R1HWAGYQGBIW6U	0394301773	19334515	A Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage	Books	5	18	19	N	N	The usage dictionary as literature	That this splendid book (I have the eighth printing from 1957) is out of print and indeed quite dated in many respects (e.g., the word &quot;Negro&quot; was then standard usage) is a shame since it is an excellent work on how to use the language with elegance, grace and precision.<br />Like most usage dictionaries it consists of word entries presented alphabetically followed by comments on the word or words in question.  These comments often amount to little essays on how to write effectively or how to distinguish between similar words, or how to feel about certain words, and when (and if) it is acceptable to use certain words or phrases.  As such this book belongs to an earlier era when there was no question about the prescriptive nature of a usage guide, while notions of frequency were clearly secondary to judgments about use made by experienced and careful writers.<br />This was a treasure and delight to me when I first read it as a young writer eager to develop a sophisticated and convincing style.  Indeed I read it from cover to cover; and, although it may not always be obvious, the Evanses noticeably improved my style.  I took special delight in their many admonitions against the use of cliches.  To be honest they overdid it a bit, condemning hundreds of phrases as hackneyed, overworked, trite, stale, shopworn, moth-eaten, etc. until they ran out of adjectives and had to resort to clever and humorous circumlocutions to get across their message.  Here is the way they treat the (over)use of Shakespeare's &quot;alas, poor Yorick!&quot;:<br />It is sad that &quot;a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy&quot; should be known to us only through such a threadbare quotation.  Alas, indeed, poor Yorick!  There is another line from Hamlet that should always be uttered after this one: &quot;What, has this thing appear'd again tonight?&quot;  Or, if one perceives that it is about to be spoken, appeal to the speaker's better nature: &quot;Refrain tonight, and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence.&quot;  And if he does forbear: &quot;For this relief, much thanks.&quot;<br />The subject of cliches did not leave me until I encountered the lyrics of Bob Dylan.  Initially I was underwhelmed and then amazed at how many cliches he could pack into any given song.  And then at some point a light dawned on me and I realized that Dylan had invented a new poetic device: expression by cliche!  Instead of using mere words in metaphorical and rhythmic ways, he used familiar phrases.  Oh my, my, my what would the Evanses have thought?<br />One of the things that the Evanses do that is not done in usage books much anymore is to make distinctions of usage between words that are not necessarily confused but have different shades of meaning or connotation.  Thus one entry is for &quot;inquire; ask; demand; question.&quot;  Most people for whom English is the native language can use these words appropriately and would say that the bank robber &quot;demanded&quot; the money, not that he &quot;asked&quot; for it.  (And certainly not that he &quot;inquired&quot; about it.)  Here the Evanses point out that &quot;ask&quot; is &quot;the everyday word&quot; and that &quot;inquire...always implies asking about something specific.&quot;<br />Another thing they do well is to explain the origin and meaning of many words, phrases and idioms that we commonly use without thinking.  For example in their entry for &quot;make bricks without straw&quot; the Evanses give the origin of the phrase (from Exodus), explain what it originally meant, how it is misused and misunderstood, and, in this case, finally dismiss it as &quot;worn out with overuse.&quot;<br />Or consider their entry on &quot;malapropism.&quot;  Such is the delicious history and meaning of this word that no usage dictionary that I know of omits it.  But here the explanation is carried to a very pleasant height.  First, not only is the word defined but the Evanses explain howa malapropism &quot;is worse than a mispronunciation because a mispronunciation...is simply honest ignorance; whereas malapropisms...occur in the speech of those who...soar above their abilities and display...not only their ignorance but their vanity as well.&quot;  Then they recall Sheridan's Mrs. Malaprop, as all usage books do.  However they are not content with this.  Instead the Evanses recall Shakespeare's Mistress Quickly as well, remarking that she does the same thing only better, and that it is only the &quot;capriciousness of fame&quot; that we say &quot;malapropism&quot; instead of &quot;quicklyism.&quot;<br />The real value of this book is then not so much in the usage advice per se but in the lexicographic erudition eloquently displayed along with guidance through example on how to write with the effectiveness that comes with using exactly the right word in exactly the right place.  While few of us can draw on the sort of knowledge that the Evanses could, it is good to know what is possible.<br />This is a book especially for those who love the English language and take delight in its artistic use.  If a usage dictionary can be considered literature, this book is a resplendent example.ow a malapropism &quot;is worse than a mispronunciation because a mispronunciation...is simply honest ignorance; whereas malapropisms...occur in the speech of those who...soar above their abilities and display...not only their ignorance but their vanity as well.&quot;  Then they recall Sheridan's Mrs. Malaprop, as all usage books do.

So I get a lot of people wanting to send me their opuses.  I usually ignore them, but sometimes I bite the bullet and say okay send it, and head for cover.  Usually the book is so self-indulgent, so poorly edited, so irrelevant to anybody but the artiste himself, that I rarely get past the second page.<br />Dale Alderman's Being a Dad: The Stuff No One Told Me is different.  It's like bending down (for the sake of the exercise) to pick up a penny only to discovered that it's a $10 gold piece (worth several hundred dollars in today's money).  I mean, Alderman, for all his low-brow feigning is one very funny, sharp-eyed, socially aware kind of guy.  In fact, this is the funniest book I've read in years.  Guys making six-figures a pop aren't half as funny.  I mean, I have brown stains on my Superdad T-shirt from spurting coffee as I read it.<br />Look, I don't know the guy.  He's from Chantilly, Virginia and hangs out in places like Myrtle Beach, South Carolina--I mean, would I go THERE?  Not only that but he watches wrestling smackdown on TV and get supersized regularly at McDonald's.  Heck, he even has loogie spitting contests with his kids.<br />So, I'm not going to review this in the usual way.  Nobody is going to believe how funny this book is anyway, no matter what I tell them.  What I'm going to do is give Big Dale some career advice.<br />First, send the pieces out to some fancy mags, the New Yorker, Esquire, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, the Paris Review, etc., and just keep sending them.  Sure, you'll get rejection after rejection, but sooner or later somebody assistant to the assistant editor is going to actually read one of your tales and is going splatter their cappuccino all over the other manuscripts from laughing and will have to fuss up.  This Alderman (yeah, right) is one funny dude even if he thinks that Chuck E. Cheese is high cuisine or that he has videotaped every Baywatch episode ever made or that he has nightmares about Roseanne Barr in a thong.<br />And bingo! some intrepid editor after many, many conferences and much soul-searching is going to get his nerve up and publish one of these.  And people are going to love it.  And then some Ivy League editor from Random House or Simon and Schuster is going to come hat in hand to iuniverse (how embarrassing) and say, \\"Uh, look, I know we aren't on speaking terms, but I got a hundred grand that says you'd like to sell me the rights to Hick Alderman's scatological meanderings.\\"<br />Meanwhile, couch potato dad, YOU are on the phone with some New York and Hollywood types who want to do lunch and turn the book into a TV sit-com pilot, and you've got three agents and an indie film producer on hold.<br />Second, when they ask you to water down the...ah, too vividly expressed potty-training jokes and upgrade the strip mall mentality, don't let it happen; but DO put the Barbie Princess Birthday Party piece (\\"Boys and Girls Are Different--Duh\\") as the first chapter in the revised edition.  It's a painful story, you'll recall, in which asparagus and a tofu birthday cake were served, all in pink, I believe, causing your son Chase, struck with horror amidst all those girls, to whisper in your ear, \\"Dad, they're aliens!  We need to call the Men in Black.\\" What you want to emphasize (for the literary journals) is the biting wit of your socially conscious critique of mid- and low-brow American culture of the early 21st century, which shows up nicely in this piece.  Viz:<br />\\"Have you ever noticed no one talks about [Barbie's boyfriend] Ken's profession?\\"  Although Barbie has had \\"so many careers, Flight Attendant, Rock Star, Model, Financial Advisor, Chemical Engineer, Nuclear Physicist, Astronaut...\\" nobody knows that Ken\\"was a CPA in Arthur Anderson's Houston Office.\\"  Furthermore, \\"Ken doesn't like to talk about how his long-term relationship with Barbie ended.  Some people say Barbie had a number of unresolved 'issues' because Ken isn't anatomically correct.\\"<br />The second chapter in the book should be the one on your shrunken underpants.  You know, you're at Macy's buying some new \\"briefs\\" (ha, ha, ha) that you can actually get into, and you realize you're stuck with the \\"extra large\\" variety with \\"the fine print on the package\\" reading, \\"May also be used to sail a 28-foot boat.\\"<br />Third, all the stuff about kids vomiting and you having to change diapers, and Chase sleeping with his police car toy and Logan licking the trash can at Disney World and his Mommy having to tell him, \\"Yes, I am wearing underpants.  No, you cannot see them.\\"  Keep it.  Keep it all no matter what the money guys say.  And all that \\"Yes, Dear\\" stuff you have to do with Starla (your wife's name, God love her, you know, the one who refers to you as \\"Jerkwad\\"), keep that too.  They love that sort of thing on TV.  Makes you look like a big, loveable, domesticated Teddy Bear.<br />Finally, whatever you do, NEVER but NEVER let your kids see this.  Burn all copies before they get to be teenagers.  If any of their friends ever read a word of this, both Chase and Logan will die of egregious shame and will hate you for the rest of your mortal life and all through the hereafter as well.\\"was a CPA in Arthur Anderson's Houston Office.\\"  Furthermore, \\"Ken doesn't like to talk about how his long-term relationship with Barbie ended.

682343:US	49786731	R1BLCGJB81DI0H	0743232763	176316738	Killing the Buddha: A Heretic's Bible	Books	4	93	105	N	N	Looking for God in America	I always preferred the sanitized version of that very Zen-like bit of ancient Zen Master advice that is the central idea of this book, namely: If you meet the Buddha by the side of the road, kick him.  It was always a bit too much for me to recognize that the actual injunction is to \\"kill him.\\"  What Lin-Chi I-Hsuan (?-867), who is recognized as the founder of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism, actually said was:<br />Kill anything you happen on.  Kill the Buddha if you happen to meet him...Kill your parents or relatives if you happen to meet them.  Only then can you be free, not bound by material things, and absolutely free and at ease.  (from The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, p. 398)<br />To get a feel for the shock of what Lin-Chi I-Hsuan said, imagine a Christian religious leader saying, \\"If you meet Jesus by the side of the road, kill him.\\"  Of course, that is what the Bible had us doing so long ago. Or think of the experience of seeing the Buddha by the side of the road as similar to seeing Christ's face in the Shroud of Turin.  We have done that.<br />The idea is that whoever you might meet by the side of the road is a fraud.  He certainly is not the Buddha.  If you follow him you will be following a false path.  Therefore kill him.<br />Or, as the authors of this book have it: \\"The Buddha you meet is not the true Buddha but an expression of your longing.  If this Buddha is not killed, he will only stand in your way.\\" (p. 1)<br />But I am compelled to point out that this is merely the beginner's understanding of what it means to kill the Buddha.  What I-Hsuan was really pointing to is renunciation.  The act of killing the Buddha is a symbolic way of renouncing the trinkets of this world and its delusional thinking.  It is a way to dispel the false dichotomies, the bugaboos of good and evil; it is a way to throw off  the heavy load with which the socialization process has burdened us; and also a way to challenge the biological imperatives of the evolutionary mechanism.<br />What this renunciation of the pillars and icons of the world leads to is the freedom that comes with nonattachment, sometimes referred to as nirvana or samadhi.  As long as we are attached to this world we are not free.  Once we are nonattached we can return to the world and draw water, cook rice, and live without delusion or fear.  Renunciation, as it leads to nonattachment, paradoxically allows us to regain the world but in a way in which the gross material and biological desires of the world do not affect us.<br />The authors, along with thirteen contributors who write personal essays on various chapters of the Bible, try to get this point (or at least a similar point) across by looking at religion in America while exposing the absurdities and contradictions in the Bible.  It is a little like Jack Kerouac's On the Road meets Mark Twain's Letters from the Earth.<br />I think Mark Twain would approve of the content, although I suspect he would like the prose to be more direct instead of so preciously wrought.  A. L. Kennedy's piece on the \\"inexplicable\\" God of Genesis, which sets the tone and opens the book (after an introduction entitled, \\"Mortal, Eat this Scroll\\"), is beautiful rendered and intensely felt in a dreamy sort of way: the kind of prose much admired in literary magazines and writer's seminars.  We all wish we could write so well.  I also liked Peter Trachtenberg's quasi-logical take on the trials and tribulations of Job, to mention two of the essays.<br />Interspersed between the essays are chapters describing the trek across America taken by Peter Manseau and Jeff Sharlet.  They begin in New York at a Puerto Rican Pentecostal church in the shadow of the towers that are no longer there, and end up in a bikini bar in Geneva, Illinois.  (Seems right.)  Their experience is filled with gritty Americana, reminding me in its way of Paul Simon's lyric, \\"They've all Come to Look for America,\\" and Vladimir Nabokov's escape, and a thousand andone road novels inspired by Kerouac.<br />Their cause is noble.  They want to go beyond \\"a God too small to be God\\"; that is, beyond a God that has a bellybutton and a bad temper, a God that plays silly games with His creatures, torturing some in hell, rewarding some in heaven, assigning some to purgatory, like some petty, sadistic bureaucrat in the sky<br />What Mark Twain did for the 19th century, and H.L. Mencken did for the early 20th, Manseau and Sharlet are attempting to do for 21st century America.  They write that \\"killing the Buddha is a metaphor for moving past the complacency of belief, for struggling honestly with the idea of God.\\"<br />This is key: the idea of God.  Such a notion.  Is this the God of Swords, the Bronze Age God of Battles, or is this the God of the Vedas, the Ineffable, about which nothing can be said?  Or is it the God of Taoism, defined as only a divine tendency, a Way of the World and the Ten Thousand Things?  Or is it the God of Zen which we must forever laugh at and kill?<br />Bottom line: a little too showy in the writing, a little too young in the comprehension, but vivid, worthwhile, and refreshing.one road novels inspired by Kerouac.<br />Their cause is noble.

682693:US	49786731	R3JVR9BJHY6YNU	0198602634	148581596	The New Fowler's Modern English Usage (New Fowler's Modern English Usage, 3rd Ed)	Books	3	216	224	N	N	Not really Fowlerian	Unlike the second edition of this venerable classic, this, the third, is thoroughly revised and brought up to date by R. W. Burchfield whose distinguished credentials include having been the Chief Editor of the Oxford English dictionaries from 1971 to 1984 and an editor of the Cambridge History of the English Language.  The problem is that in doing so he has greatly lessened the prescriptive intent of Mr. Fowler and offended many readers.<br /><br />Let's begin with the Preface in which he has the temerity of damning H.W. Fowler himself with faint praise and something close to dismissal.  Burchfield asks: \\"Why has this schoolmasterly, quixotic, idiosyncratic, and somewhat vulnerable book...retained its hold on the imagination of all but professional linguistic scholars for just on seventy years?\\" (p. ix)  One gets the sense that Burchfield is going to straighten matters out forthwith.  He adds, \\"Fowler's name remains on the title-page, even though his book has been largely rewritten...\\"  In the next sentence he refers to Fowler's book as a \\"masterpiece,\\" but adds that \\"it is a fossil all the same\\" while intimating that its scholarly scope did not extend beyond \\"the southern counties of England in the first quarter of the twentieth century.\\" (p. xi)<br /><br />From there we go to the entries themselves and find on page one that the suffix \\"-a\\" is now<br /><br />being printed more and more to present the sound that replaces \\"of\\" in rapid (esp. demotic) speech, as in \\"kinda\\" (=kind of), loadsa, sorta.<br /><br />The problem with this is there is no acknowledgment that such usage, especially in written English, is substandard.  Even in the entry on \\"demotic English,\\" Burchfield merely notes that such formulations as \\"gotta,\\" \\"shoulda,\\" etc. are becoming more common.<br /><br />Or consider his entry for \\"didn't ought\\" which includes this designation:<br /><br />A remarkable combination of the marginal modal \\"ought\\" and the periphrastic negative auxiliary \\"didn't.\\"<br /><br />Huh?  Burchfield reveals here that he has lost the thread of Fowler's intent.  Instead of writing for a general educated public that would like some guidance in matters of usage, he is instead addressing scholars, linguists and others whose interest in such matters is professional and not practical.  He goes on to allow that \\"didn't ought\\" is \\"[a]lmost certainly of dialectal origin\\" (I give that a \\"duh, dude\\") that \\"has made its way into novels of the 19c and 20c and into informal speech as a typical construction used by rustic or sparsely educated speakers.\\"<br /><br />Such is his way of \\"labeling,\\" and it isn't very effective.  True, he avoids outright condemnation, but forces the reader to closely examine his prose in order to realize, after some perusal, that if it is \\"a typical construction\\" of \\"rustic or sparsely educated speakers,\\" it is probably substandard and ought to be avoided.  Much of the book suffers from such circumlocutious expression and is entirely inimical to the spirit of Fowler who believed in concise, straightforward English.<br /><br />Okay let's look at that favorite of English usage mavens around the world: \\"infer\\" versus \\"imply.\\"  Well, I think I'd have to be a lawyer to be certain that Burchfield got it right (although I don't doubt that he did) since I had to wade through several hundred words of qualification and extraneous example (\\"imply\\" used correctly; \\"infer\\" used correctly; \\"infer\\" illogically used for \\"imply\\"...) so that the most important distinction to be made between the words is lost, not to mention that by the time I had finished I felt like I needed to reread the passages and take notes.<br /><br />What Burchfield is at pains to do is walk a fine line between being what Bryan A. Garner (who wrote the very fine Garner's Modern American Usage (2003) which I highly recommend) calls \\"describers\\" and \\"prescribers.\\"  As a compiler and editor of dictionaries, Burchfield leans toward the descriptive mode.  He records usage andtries not to pronounce from on high what is or isn't right.  The problem with this approach is that in a usage book the entire point is to make distinctions between what is acceptable and what is not, between what is effective and what is not.  Burchfield's reluctance to be more prescriptive defeats the intent of a usage dictionary.  Note that I am NOT suggesting that Burchfield doesn't know what he is talking about or that he lacks in any way the authority to write a usage dictionary.  On the contrary.<br /><br />Note also that Burchfield (who also wrote The New Zealand Oxford Pocket Dictionary) has not confined himself to BrE but has incorporated AmE and examples of usage from all around the world into Fowler's once more restrictive volume.  This is actually to the good in my opinion, but certainly suggests that this book ought to be called something other than \\"Fowler's...\\"  For this perhaps we can blame the Oxford University Press itself which clearly wanted to take advantage of Fowler's name and reputation.  This book might be better appreciated if we were not forced to compare Burchfield with Fowler, which is somewhat like comparing Neil Simon to Ben Jonson.<br /><br />Bottom line: a little stuffy, a little long-winded, somewhat pretentious, but for the careful reader, as authoritative a book on English usage as one could want.ith this approach is that in a usage book the entire point is to make distinctions between what is acceptable and what is not, between what is effective and what is not.

685665:US	49786731	RSIS4UCHIJHU8	0195161912	265284787	Garner's Modern American Usage	Books	5	93	100	N	Y	Roll over Fowler; tell Partridge the news...	This is a brilliant book.  It is as erudite and authoritative as a usage book should be, but without offensive cant or needless pedantry.  It is scrupulously edited and handsomely presented by the Oxford University Press in their usual exemplary manner.  While Bryan A.Garner concentrates on American English usage (that's where the market is) he is no stranger to \\"BrE\\" or any other kind of English.  Just to give you a hint about what makes the man tick and why he is now considered the preeminent authority on \\"grammar, usage, and style\\" (as a blurb on the book's cover--for a change--rightly has it), consider these words from the Preface to the Second Edition:<br /><br />\\"People have asked whether enough has really changed in English usage since 1998 to justify a new edition.  The answer is that changing usage isn't really the primary basis for a new edition of a usage guide: it's really a question of having had five more years for research.\\"<br /><br />He isn't kidding.  What Garner brings to this usage book that completely dwarfs* all previous efforts is a gargantuan research regimen.  This is clear from the thousands of examples of usage presented, both good and bad, from all manner of publications: newspapers, small town and big city; novels, classic and contemporary; magazines and journals, literary and scientific, etc.  Garner obviously has a passion for words and seems determined to let no genre or form of reading matter go unread or unscrutinized.  I didn't find an example from one of my reviews, but (given the many faux pas that I have, alas, committed in nearly 800 reviews) I fully expect that dubious honor in the third edition!).  Yes, Garner is onto the Web and indeed he frequently quotes statistics of use garnered (sorry!) from such sites as NEXIS and WESTLAW allowing him to say, for example, about \\"analytical\\" and \\"analytic\\" that \\"the long form is five times as common as the short.\\"<br /><br />This is an interesting development in usage books.  As Garner notes in his introductory essay, \\"Making Peace in the Language Wars,\\" there are two types of linguists, \\"prescribers\\" and  \\"describers,\\" or as it used to be said (more narrowly) there are \\"prescriptive grammarians\\" and \\"descriptive grammarians,\\" and never the twain shall meet.  The former in both cases, as Garner has it, \\"seek to guide\\" while the latter \\"seek to discover...how native speakers actually use their language.\\"<br /><br />Obviously, no one who writes a usage guide can be a strict describer.  Indeed throughout the history of usage guidance most of the authors have been primarily prescribers: \\"this is the way the word should be used\\"; \\"this is improper\\" and even \\"this is an abomination!\\"  Garner follows the tradition and even goes so far as to label, for example, the employment of \\"defunk\\" for \\"defunct\\" as a \\"ghastly blunder.\\"<br /><br />So he is clearly a prescriber (as he admits).  But unlike most of his illustrious predecessors he is a describer as well.  He lets us see how the language is actually used and he gracefully bows (on occasion) as much to the preponderance of usage as he does to venerable authority and his own good judgment.  Thus we have a usage dictionary for the 21st century, alive, vital and moving carefully with the tide, but not swept away by it.<br /><br />Needless to say I do have a few disagreements. I will present a couple for sport, fully realizing that he is the authority and I am merely a respectful, sometime critic.<br /><br />For example, Garner writes a very nice little essay on sexist language entitled \\"SEXISM.\\"  However there is no comparable entry on \\"racism\\" or word entries for \\"African-American,\\" \\"Afro-American,\\" or \\"black.\\"  I think there should be, as some guidance in word choice here is sometimes sorely needed.  I have the feeling that Garner is not so much dodging the subject as he is fully preparing himself for the next edition.  There is an entry on \\"ageism\\" (so spelled indicates Garner although the similar word \\"aging\\" is without the \\"e\\"), but no discussion of various usage concerns.<br /><br />Also, he writes (on page 418 in the essay entry \\"HYPERCORRECTION\\" under item \\"J.\\"): \\"When a naturalized...foreignism appears, the surrounding words--with a few exceptions...--should be English.  Thus, one refers to &lt;finding the mot juste> not &lt;finding le mot juste> (a common error among the would-be literati).\\"  However, I would say that using the French \\"le\\" as part of the phrase is a useful emphasis, much as one, when speaking, might emphasize the word \\"the\\" by pronouncing it with a long \\"e.\\"<br /><br />These and perhaps other picayunes aside, let me say unequivocally that this book is a treasure trove of knowledge about our language second to none that I have ever read and a singular pleasure to read and peruse.<br /><br />I should also mention the three splendid appendices:  A 13-page \\"Select Glossary\\" on words about words (\\"gerund,\\" \\"homograph,\\" etc.); a very interesting \\"Lifeline of Books on Usage\\" beginning in 1762; and a \\"Select Bibliography\\" of dictionaries, usage books, grammars, and books on style.<br /><br />*This use of \\"dwarf\\" as a transitive verb is not given in Garner's book, although there is an entry on the noun form.  I checked Webster's Second International and my spelling (not the ugly \\"dwarves\\") agrees with theirs.s usage concerns.    Also, he writes (on page 418 in the essay entry \\"HYPERCORRECTION\\" under item \\"J.\\"): \\"When a naturalized...foreignism appears, the surrounding words--with a few exceptions...--should be English.  Thus, one refers to <finding the mot juste> not <finding le mot juste> (a common error among the would-be literati).\\"  However, I would say that using the French \\"le\\" as part of the phrase is a useful emphasis, much as one, when speaking, might emphasize the word \\"the\\" by pronouncing it with a long \\"e.\\"    These and perhaps other picayunes aside, let me say unequivocally that this book is a treasure trove of knowledge about our language second to none that I have ever read and a singular pleasure to read and peruse.    I should also mention the three splendid appendices:  A 13-page \\"Select Glossary\\" on words about words (\\"gerund,\\" \\"homograph,\\" etc.); a very interesting \\"Lifeline of Books on Usage\\" beginning in 1762; and a \\"Select Bibliography\\" of dictionaries, usage books, grammars, and books on style.    *This use of \\"dwarf\\" as a transitive verb is not given in Garner's book, although there is an entry on the noun form.

688604:US	49786731	R29YRKARQEBSW4	0198605064	128144579	A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (Oxford Language Classics Series)	Books	5	91	94	N	N	The standard to which all the others are compared	It is somewhat amazing that this book, first published in 1926, is still in print.  The language has changed quite a bit since then; thousands of words have been added, hundreds have gone obsolete, and hundreds more have had their meanings shaded; and of course many of Fowler's pronouncements are now merely echoes of battles long lost or won.  Not only that, but two newer editions of A Dictionary of Modern English Usage have been published, the excellent second edition edited by Sir Ernest Gowers in 1965 (now ironically out of print while the original finds yet another printing), and the not so entirely well-received (but underrated in my opinion) third edition, edited and revised by R.W. Burchfield in 1996.<br />How to account for this phenomenon?  Part of it is because Fowler's reputation only grew after his death as several generations of writers sang his praises and adhered to, or sometimes fussed about, his many dicta on usage questions both great and small.  And as the years went by, and as the pages of his masterpiece gave way to wine stains and silverfish or the few remaining copies disappeared from libraries, he himself became a legend.  Not everything he wrote is considered correct today, nor was it then.  And sometimes the succinct yet magisterial little essays he wrote were followed by other little essays that were all but impenetrable, obtuse and somewhat overbearing.  No matter.  The good greatly outweighed the occasional misjudgment, and the education he afforded us remains.<br />Another part of the story is that there is something very properly English and wonderfully nostalgic about the man himself.  He was a bit of a character who lied about his age and joined the army when he was 56-years-old to fight the Germans in the Great War (only to faint on the parade grounds), a man who earlier gave up a teaching career because he did not feel it was his responsibility to prepare a student for the seminary.  More than anything, though, the fact that this book is still in demand is a testament to the high regard and affection felt by the literate public toward Fowler himself.<br />What Fowler knew and preached was that before we could presume to be literary artists or journalists or even authors of readable letters we must of necessity, if we are to be effective, be craftsmen.  Central to his purpose was the belief that the right word in its proper place and context constituted the backbone and much of the muscle and sinew of forthright and effective writing.  That belief along with Fowler's celebrated passion for the concise and the correct, and his intolerance of ignorance and humbug, coupled with his sometimes incomparable expression, long ago won him the undying respect and admiration of careful writers of the English language the world over.<br />But this is something of a problem.  Since Fowler last set pen to page some seventy-one years ago (he died in 1933), the English language has changed and grown enormously.  What was correct and effective then, as well as what was ineffective, offensively brash or downright ugly has in some cases become acceptable and even felicitous.  So, like it or not, Fowler had to be updated, and of course there was no shortage of lexicographers, linguists, grammarians, journalists and others looking to do the job.  Furthermore, the &quot;Great Divide&quot; between American English and British English needed to be explained, recorded, and codified.  Some of the people who have joined in this enterprise over the years have been H. L. Mencken, Jens Jespersen, Margaret Nicholson, Dwight MacDonald, Bergen and Cornelia Evans, and more recently, Bryan A. Garner and R.W. Burchfield, and many others.  I think all of them, if they looked over their shoulder would see upon the wall an especially sober portrait of Fowler passing silent judgment upon their protracted labors.  Certainly on their desks would be this book.<br />So I recommend that you buy that very impressive book by Garner (Garner's Modern American Usage), especially if you are an American, or splurge for a copy of that underrated third edition edited by Burchfield, and that you consult them as well as this venerable authority.  As you use the books you may compare and contrast and get a nice feel for where the language has been and where it is headed.r's Modern American Usage), especially if you are an American, or splurge for a copy of that underrated third edition edited by Burchfield, and that you consult them as well as this venerable authority.

Central to his purpose was the belief that the right word at the right time in its proper place and context constituted the backbone and much of the muscle and sinew of forthright and effective writing.  That belief along with Fowler's celebrated passion for good writing and his intolerance of ignorance and humbug, coupled with his sometimes incomparable expression, long ago won him the undying respect and admiration of careful writers of the English language the world over.<br />And this has been something of a problem.  Since Fowler last set pen to page some seventy-one years ago (he died in 1933), the English language has changed and grown enormously.  What was correct and effective in 1926 (the year the 1st Ed. of A Dictionary of Modern English Usage was published), as well as what was ineffective, offensively brash or downright ugly has in some cases become acceptable and even felicitous.  So, like it or not, Fowler had to be updated, and of course there was no shortage of lexicographers, linguists, grammarians, journalists and others looking to do the job.  Furthermore, the &quot;Great Divide&quot; between American English and British English needed to be explained, recorded, and codified.  Some of the people who have joined in this enterprise over the years have been H. L. Mencken, Jens Jespersen, Margaret Nicholson, Dwight MacDonald, Bergen and Cornelia Evans, and more recently, Bryan A. Garner and R.W. Burchfield (who edits the Third Edition of this book), and many others.  I think all of them, if they looked over their shoulder would see upon the wall an especially sober portrait of Fowler passing silent judgment upon their protracted labors.  Certainly on their desks would be this book.<br />And of course there is Sir Ernest Gowers who revised and edited this celebrated Second Edition.  He writes in the Preface that the most important changes he had to make were those of vocabulary itself.  &quot;Words unknown in Fowler's day--teenager for instance--are now among our hardest worked.&quot;  He adds that &quot;Vogue words get worn out and others take their place.&quot;  He admits to having omitted &quot;one or two&quot; of Fowler's famous little essays as being &quot;no longer relevant to our literary fashions.&quot;  (Would that he had preserved such specimens in an appendix.)  He also allows that &quot;many&quot; of Fowler's &quot;articles&quot; called &quot;for some modernization,&quot; and therefore, &quot;a few have been rewritten in whole or part, and several new ones added.&quot;<br />So this is not your pristine Fowler's, yet so carefully did Gowers preserve and build upon that earlier edifice that most people have been quite pleased.  In fact so nearly universal has been the admiration for this particular book that the so-called Third Edition of 1996, edited by the aforementioned Burchfield, has yet to receive universal acceptance and is indeed disparaged in some circles as not being true to the letter and spirit of Fowler.<br />For me two things stand out in this much admired Second Edition: (1) the absolute delight one finds in the many pronouncements on language; and (2) the odd but satisfying mix of the old-fashioned prescriptive grammarian commingled with someone who disdains pedantry for its own sake, and condemns what is seen as unnecessarily purist.  Perhaps more than anything what one loves about this book is Fowler's incisive dry wit.  Here is Fowler/Gowers on two words easily confused (those are my quotation marks since Amazon does not support the italics used in the original):<br /> prescribe, proscribe.  These words are often confused, especially by the use of &quot;pro-&quot; for &quot;pre-.&quot;  &quot;Pro-&quot; means to put outside the protection of the law, to denounce as dangerous; &quot;pre-&quot; means to lay down as a rule or direction to be followed.  &quot;If I look at the list of proscribed authors in our various universities, I notice with pleasure that since 1940 no year has passed without Jane Austen appearing in the syllabus of at least one.&quot;  The speaker clearly did not mean, as one might infer from the word he used (or perhaps the printer substituted), that Jane Austen's works were on the Index.<br />Also of interest here is Gowers' Preface which amounts to an understanding and appreciation of Fowler and his work.:<br /> prescribe, proscribe.

Some of them could win Best Personal Essay contests were they to be presented as such.  They are eminently readable; in fact it was a delight to read them.<br />Let me put it this way:  If you have a young person interested in a business career or a thirty-something loved one climbing up the corporate ladder, slip this little gem of a book into their unread copy of the Wall Street Journal and they'll have it read before morning and wake up with amazement in their eyes.<br />Reading this book is a little like going to the Harvard School of Business.  Daisy Wademan has selected fifteen life-changing stories told by business professors at Harvard.  She has guided these stories into a form very much like that of the 15-minute personal-experience lecture that typically signals the close of a class before the final exam and before the applause.  They are story/lectures from the heart and from the mind, told by people who know what they are talking about.  They have excellent ideas and the commitment of true teachers who want to help and to guide.<br />The first story, &quot;A Fall Before Rising&quot; by Jai Jaikumar is about mountain climbing and the day his foot went through the snow in the Himalayas at close to 24,000 feet, and of the consequent 60-mile-per-hour ride down part of the side of the mountain, and then a 24-hour trek through snow and ice apparently on a broken hip until he fell into the arms of a peasant woman who fed him and then carried him--literally carried him--for three days to a doctor.<br />The second story by Jeffrey F. Rayport is about a stuffed bird only partially displayed that served as an unusual final exam for a zoology course that taught him to be prepared to expect strange challenges; indeed the bird symbolized the nature of what we can only partially see, making us realize that what we need to know to succeed in business may be characterized by &quot;extreme uncertainty and accelerating change.&quot;<br />The third story is unusually striking in its advice: &quot;be like yourself,&quot; with the emphasis on the word &quot;like.&quot;  Professor Richard S. Tedlow advises his students to assume a public personality that is neither too remote from who they are nor too familiar.  He relates how we might seek &quot;a balanced identity.&quot;  Just as we balance time between our personal and profession lives, so too might we balance who we are at home and at work while keeping a &quot;porous boundary&quot; between the two personae.<br />The fourth story is about understanding who you are, &quot;your background...and your prejudices, and [that] you must understand how each element from your past shaped your thinking...&quot;  Thomas K. McCraw recalls Kierkegaard, who said that &quot;we understand ourselves only in retrospect.&quot;  How truth that is, and yet (McCraw adds) &quot;we must live...[our lives] going forward&quot;--always going forward in a partial ignorance that is only dispelled after the fact, sometimes long after the fact.<br />Notice how the power of these thoughts comes from a broad understanding of history and ideas, from the application of an academic understanding to the practice of life.  These stories can be seen as examples of how education works to improve out lives and to help us understand how to live.<br />If I had to pick one story that stood out for me personally it would be Stephen P. Kaufman's &quot;A Bad Meal, and the Truth.&quot;  What he learned when he became a CEO is that you are still the same person but everyone around you sees you differently and treats you in ways that can isolate you and make you ineffective if you are not careful to devise ways of getting around their insulating and frankly sycophantic behavior.  A fellow CEO summed up the situation by saying, &quot;Steve, there are two things you'll never get again--a bad meal, and the truth.&quot;  I would like to add that this is a danger that can threaten heads of state as well.<br />I could go on--and I will.  One more.  This is from Thomas DeLong (story #12).  He took his 11-year-old daughter on a bike trip to Mount Rushmore and she asked him what he calls &quot;The Mount Rushmore Question.&quot;  He had told her that the men on Mount Rushmore &quot;were courageous&quot; and &quot;had made a difference in people's lives.&quot;  She asked, &quot;Do YOU make a difference?&quot;  One can see the little girl comparing her father to the men on the mountain.  DeLong felt this powerfully and it lead him to formulate two questions he employs to teach others the lesson that he had learned.  The first question is, &quot;How do people experience you?&quot; and the second is, &quot;How do people experience themselves when they are with you?&quot;<br />Try those two out.

Clarke and Carl Sagan, and maybe one or two others, have done those two things any better) has two primary purposes in writing this book.  The first is to bring the general reader up to date on the current status of the search for life beyond earth and the likelihood of its existence. The second is to report (and critique) the state of the political and economic wars pertaining to that search.  Along the way Bova updates us on how the solar system was formed, concentrating in turn on each of the planets.  He reports on the status of extra-solar planets (over 100 have been discovered as he went to press) and on why it is now believed that life may (in the form of &quot;extremophiles&quot;) exist in places previously thought to be completely inhospitable such as deep underground, at the bottom of deep oceans, such as under the ice of Jupiter's moon, Europa, or even in interstellar clouds.<br />The main strength of the book is Bova's always readable prose; the main weakness is a kind of &quot;introductory&quot; treatment that may be too limited or simplistic for more sophisticated readers.  For myself--a reader somewhere between the extremes of novice and expert--I found the book reasonably informative and certainly in no sense dumbed-down.  Of course I did not need to be told (as Bova does in a gray sidebar on page 80) that &quot;a meteorite is what is left of&quot; a meteor &quot;if it survives to the ground.&quot;  Nor did I need to be reminded that &quot;Einstein's special theory of relativity showed that matter can be converted to energy&quot; as Bova does in a footnote on page 67.  Or even that living organisms seem to (but do not) violate the law of entropy.  There are many other examples of this concession to the beginning reader, but not so many that I was annoyed or felt my time was being wasted.  The editors are to be commended for putting most of the elementary material in gray boxes, footnotes, or in some of the eleven appendices.<br />The book is organized into five sections beginning with what Bova calls &quot;The Path to Astrobiology,&quot; and ending with &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; in which he laments the lack of consistent funding for space exploration and argues that, if humans are to survive any of the catastrophes likely to strike earth (including the near certainty of the sun's expansion, explosion, and collapse in the very, very distant future) we must learn to live in places other than earth.<br />For the real afficionado of astrobiology, this book will indeed be much too basic.  For the fairly well-informed reader wanting to know just where we are in the search for life beyond earth, there are several better books.  Two that I can recommend are, Stephen Webb' outstanding Where Is Everybody?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life (2002), the excellent The Life and Death of Planet Earth: How the Science of Astrobiology Charts the Ultimate Fate of Our World (2002) by Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee, and the delightful Lonely Planets: The Natural Philosophy of Alien Life (2003) by David Grinspoon.  Bova includes a discussion of the famous Drake equation and his take on the probabilities implied therein, but if you want the real in-depth treatment read Stephen Webb's book<br />As far as the politics at NASA and in the Congress of the United States goes, I cannot recommend a better book, but can tell you that Bova's treatment here has taught me little that I didn't know.  That the late Senator William Proxmire stupidly bestowed upon SETI one of his infamous &quot;Golden Fleece&quot; awards is old news, as is the fact that Nevada Senator Richard Bryan ridiculed the search for extraterrestrial life back in 1992 and helped to persuade Congress to cut SETI projects from NASA's budget.  However Bova does report the efforts of private citizens (notably Microsoft's Paul Allen) to fund SETI projects as well as the efforts of some people at NASA and in Congress to emphasize the possibility of finding at least microbial life under the surface of Mars or elsewhere in the solar system as a means of exciting the public's fancy. If the public's fancy can be sufficiently excited, that will surely persuade our representatives to vote funds to support such projects.<br />Certainly Bova has a clear understanding of what goes on in Congress.  He writes, &quot;Politicians make their decisions for political reasons, not scientific.  The first question a politician asks when faced with a decision is, How will this affect my chances for reelection?&quot; (p. 273)<br />Nothing is going to change that.  That is the way a representative democracy works.  What needs to be done is to educate the public (and Congress itself!) on (1) the real value of the search for life beyond earth and (2) the real value of being able to colonize, e.g., the moon and Mars.  In the first case we have that most beautiful quote from Lee DuBridge (or was it Pogo?) that sets the tone for Bova's book: &quot;Either we are alone in the universe or we are not; either way it's mind-boggling.&quot; (p. ix)  In the second case we have the specter of any number of earth-confined catastrophes that colonists on the moon or Mars might avoid, such as an unstoppable disease, nuclear warfare, or a huge meteor striking the earth.en) to fund SETI projects as well as the efforts of some people at NASA and in Congress to emphasize the possibility of finding at least microbial life under the surface of Mars or elsewhere in the solar system as a means of exciting the public's fancy.

We can see those vultures circling and we can feel the chapped lips, the mouth so dry that we can hardly speak, and we can see the shimmer of the heat on the dry rocks and sand and hear the wind whispering, and we can be enveloped by the silence.<br />In this true crime tale Maxim magazine senior editor Jason Kersten expands on an article he wrote for that magazine and turns it into a modest book.  It is a engrossing story about two young men, close friends, who travel west and get lost in Rattlesnake Canyon in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park without any water.  As dehydration, fatigue, and hopelessness set in, the two men prepare to die.  One of them, David Coughlin, is vomiting violently, hour after hour.  He is in such pain that, so the story goes, he asks his friend Raffi Kodikian to kill him, to put him out of his misery.<br />Some hours later the next day their camp is spotted and the rangers come.  They find Kodikian alive in the tent.  He tells them where Coughlin's body is and confesses that he stabbed him through the heart as an act of mercy.<br />What makes this story work, and what makes it worth an entire book, is the uncertainty that still exists about Raffi Kodikian: did he kill his friend, as he claims, because he could not bare to see him suffer anymore, or did he have a more sinister motive?  Kersten's narrative clearly leans toward the idea that Kodikian's action was a delusional mercy killing; however most of the law enforcement people mentioned in the book find Kodikian's story unconvincing.  Kersten himself allows that in all the literature he could find, there was only one story of a mercy killing in the desert.  Apparently it is an extremely rare event.  Furthermore, the Rattlesnake Canyon they couldn't find their way out of is not that big.  As Kersten terms it, Rattlesnake Canyon &quot;is just a crack--five miles long, seven hundred feet deep...&quot;<br />Another factor that makes this story interesting is the law itself and the defense chosen by famed New Mexico lawyer Gary Mitchell and his assistant Shawn Boyne.  Since New Mexican law defines a mercy killing as a murder, period, and is not a complete defense to the crime, the lawyers had to come up with something better.  Boyne made an argument for &quot;involuntary intoxication&quot; and it seemed to fit.  Only problem was, according to the legal definition of that defense an agent of intoxication was required.  Instead what they had was lack of water.  Curiously, they might have argued that the juice of the prickly pear cactus fruit was the agent, but for some reason they did not.  Kersten reports that eating prickly pear cactus fruit was probably part of the reason Coughlin vomited so violently.<br />Finally I have to say that Kersten does an excellent job with limited resources.  He was not able to interview Kodikian, who refused his entreaties, so he had to reconstruct the story from the trial transcript and from interviews with other people, none of whom, of course, was in the canyon with the two men.  Kersten also does a fine job of placing the story within the historical context of the New Mexican desert and deserts everywhere while making it clear how people die of thirst and how the law works in cases like this.<br />However, as I finished the book, I was left somewhat dissatisfied as other readers were, not so much because I found Kodikian's story unbelievable or even because I doubted it, but because I felt that I did not really know Kodikian.  We can see that &quot;he appears to be,&quot; as Kersten reports, &quot;quite a well-adjusted young man&quot; who &quot;had good friends&quot; and appeared to enjoy life.  Kersten adds, &quot;He could be me or fifty people I know.&quot; (p. x)  In fact the only negative thing anybody said about Kodikian was that he could be stubborn.<br />I wondered as I finished the book if a stubborn person may be more likely to believe in his own judgment against the laws of men and be more willing to do something forbidden than the average person.  I wonder, but I don't think that fully explains it.  I really believe that the desert can do crazy things to our minds, especially when we are tired and thirsty and the implacable terrain shimmers and dances into a confusing mosaic as we become more and more removed from conventional reality and from hope.  At such times in such circumstances we may very well become confused about what is right and what is wrong.

Neither is it the &quot;dismal science&quot; that Thomas Carlyle claimed it was back in the days when Britannica still ruled the waves.  Economics is a social science, a &quot;historical&quot; science, a science that can seldom rely on experiment to test its theories but must make do with observation.  We do not know whether a tax cut for the rich, for example, will be good for the economy as a whole.  It can be tried and when the results are in some years or decades down the road, we may come to some conclusion; but because we could not also see what would have happened had there been no tax cut or a different sort of tax cut, we really cannot be sure that it was the tax cut for the rich that led to economic growth or (as the case may be) revolution.<br />Nonetheless, while the knowledge we receive from a rigorous and disciplined observation of facts and events gives us nothing like certainty, it does lead us to know how to place our bets.  And in an uncertain world that is really all we can expect.  Even in closed systems like mathematics there are things unknown and not fully understood; and even in the most rigorous of the sciences such as physics, there is no presumption to absolute knowledge.<br />This attractive pint-sized publication from The Economist includes an opening essay entitled &quot;The Joy of Economics&quot; by Matthew Bishop that summarizes the current thinking of economists and presents a report on the state of the art.  Unlike many essays written by economists, it is easy to read and directed at a general (but, of course, educated) readership.  It serves admirably not only as an introduction to this volume but to current economic thought as well.  I especially like his point that &quot;better measures of economic success or failure&quot; than &quot;a purely monetary measure&quot; such as GDP are needed, most clearly some measure that takes &quot;environmental and other non-monetary factors into account.&quot;  (pp. 8-9)  Also good is his question about what effect  the information explosion will have on economic thought and practice.<br />After Bishop's essay there follows hundreds of mini-essays and definitions arranged alphabetically on matters economic.  If one compares these entries to those in the similar, but larger Dictionary of Economics also put out by The Economist, one quickly sees that there are fewer entries here but they are presented in a more readable fashion.  This is then a less technical publication and not as inclusive; yet for most readers I would say it makes the ideas of economics more accessible.<br />Furthermore, Matthew Bishop, who wrote the entries has a slightly different slant on some economic ideas than those of the editors of the Dictionary of Economics.  For example, on &quot;adverse selection&quot; Bishop concentrates on the market failure likely to be experienced by insurance companies selling insurance to, e.g., &quot;55-year-old male smokers&quot; while the Dictionary of Economics zeroes in on what it calls &quot;the lemon problem.&quot;  In both cases the problem is that one side of the transaction has an advantage that results in an adverse selection for the other side.  In the former case, the insurance company that sells insurance to someone who is in poor health is at a disadvantage; and in the latter case the buyer of the poorly-made or maintained car is at a disadvantage.<br />In another example, the &quot;prisoner's dilemma&quot; of game theory is explained and related to the problem experienced by oligopoly (that of setting prices) in perhaps two hundred words.  In the Dictionary of Economics twice as many words are used and a table is included.  How to choose between the two explanations?  The answer is the same for choosing between the two books: simply how technical do you want your explanations, and how readable?<br />Clearly this is the handier book.  The type is a little larger.  It takes up less space, and it does notcover the more esoteric ideas of economics that the non-specialists may profitably skip over.  Furthermore, this quality paperback book has built-in front and end flaps that work as book marks for keeping your place.  Cross references are in capital letters, which I think is the most straightforward way of pointing to them.<br />Bottom line: handy, accessible and just right for those of us who have degrees in something other than economics.cover the more esoteric ideas of economics that the non-specialists may profitably skip over.

701903:US	49786731	R127CGEM61EGR5	0060555564	720762586	The Cell Game: Sam Waksal's Fast Money and False Promises--and the Fate of ImClone's Cancer Drug	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Compelling tale about greed and how the system works	This is about the Cancer Game, which might be seen as a part of the Cancer Industry, a kind of bizarre and ghoulish phenomenon of modern times that exists precisely because there is no cure for cancer.  Indeed, Alex Prud'homme, who is a gifted researcher and prose stylist, whose work has appeared in such prestigious journals as The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, The New York Times, etc., might very well have called his book &quot;The Cancer Game.&quot;  I wonder why he didn't.  Would such a title have offended those who play the game?<br />It is specifically about the rise and fall of one Sam Waksal, oldest son of Jewish emigrants and Holocaust survivors, a man of irresistible charm, fabulous energy, and great intelligence, a man driven to success and the high life, a man who had bounced around academia without much success until in the 1980s he saw an opportunity to become a player in the cancer game, and, along with his younger brother Harlan, founded ImClone Systems, Inc.<br />It is also about an anticancer drug called Erbitux, originally known as C225 because it was the 225th drug tested by its discoverers, John Mendelsohn and Gordon Sato in 1980.  It showed promise because in tests it stopped the growth of tumors in mice.<br />And finally it is a story about how drugs get discovered, how they are developed, and especially how they get approved (or not) by the Food and Drug Administration.  And of course it is about the Byzantine and incestuous relationship that exists between that August government agency and the massive pharmaceutical industry.<br />The curious thing about all this is that Imclone never turned a profit, Erbitux never came to market, and most of the people associated with Waksal and ImClone either made out like bandits or got stuck holding the bag.  The drug itself, which works against cancer tumors, particularly colon cancer, by cutting off the blood supply to the tumors (an &quot;antiangiogenesis&quot; drug), was touted as a miracle that would save the lives of innumerable patients and make possibly billions of dollars for ImClone.<br />At least this was the hype delivered by Sam Waksal, and bought hook, line and sinker by pharma giant Bristol-Myers Squibb, and by desperate cancer patients as well as salivating Wall Street investors who jumped on the bandwagon as ImClone's stock rocketed skyward.  Because of the promise of the drug, Waksal himself was able to live his dream life as a New York socialite, throwing lavish parties for celebs (including Martha Stewart while he dated her daughter), collecting fine art, popping open $600 bottles of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild while secretly selling stock on the side, sending the proceeds overseas, buying expensive apartments and houses for himself, etc., etc.<br />But the cold hard facts of Erbitux, like those of almost any cancer drug one can name, are very far from the hype.  As Prud'homme notes on pages 332-333, &quot;these agents...[Erbitux and others like Avastin and Iressa] are remarkable scientific advances, [but] they still only benefit some 10 to 20 percent of patients, and they only extend patients' lives by a matter of months.&quot;<br />That's it.  That's the bottom line.  And yet these drugs are so valuable that the companies that end up selling them can make hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars.<br />Waksal apparently came to this understanding sometime during the early eighties.  He realized first the simple fact that the way the cancer industry works is doctors have to prescribe something rather than nothing.  Then he realized that living a few months longer can mean a lot to people.  Therefore any FDA-approved cancer drug will automatically fill a need.  What this means is that the PROMISE of a cancer drug, if cleverly promoted, will spark a rally in the shares of the company that owns the patent.  If, like Sam Waksal, you own millions of those shares, you can get rich on mere promise alone.<br />Furthermore, should the drug have any real value at all, and be approved (or even look like it's going to be approved) by the FDA, you might be able to get some pharmaceutical giant like Bristol-Myers Squibb to front a whole lot of money on that promise since they are desperate to find a cancer drug to replace those that have gone generic.<br />This works because even drugs with very limited effectiveness are better than no drug at all.  This is true for many patients, for many doctors, and is especially true for the big pharmaceutical companies.<br />Note that these drugs are valuable because the people who need them are typically people of relative means who can afford to pay large sums of money for them, either through their HMOs, their government, or their own funds.  In contrast a drug that would prolong the life of poor people in third world countries would be of only marginal value to the big pharmaceutical companies.<br />I should also mention that Prud'homme spends some serious ink in this book on Waksal's long-time friend Martha Stewart and her troubles.  Her personality, her empire, and the way she handles herself are vividly detailed.  In fact, some readers might find her story the most interesting part of the book.alue at all, and be approved (or even look like it's going to be approved) by the FDA, you might be able to get some pharmaceutical giant like Bristol-Myers Squibb to front a whole lot of money on that promise since they are desperate to find a cancer drug to replace those that have gone generic.<br />This works because even drugs with very limited effectiveness are better than no drug at all.

We think we \\"see\\" something with our eyes.  The ambient light bounces off of an object and into our eyes and is embedded there, and like a camera we \\"see.\\"  At any rate, that was my commonsense explanation of sight for the first few decades of my life.<br /><br />Today I would say that our brain uses information from the light it gathers to interpret the world around us using its experience in seeing things in the past and using clues such as shadow and perspective to resolve objects.  I would point out that we are actually aware of only a small faction of what there is to see at any given time.  In addition to the \\"blind spot\\" in our vision field being filled in by our brains, much of the rest of our field of vision is constructed and reconstructed by our brains continually giving us the illusion of continuous sight.  Unless there is movement or some other kind of change, we continue to experience the same reconstruction, like a screen being refreshed.  If we focus on something in the field that previously was in our periphery, our brain reconstructs that something based on this new, more direct information.<br /><br />Proof of this somewhat bizarre and perhaps unsettling truth that we construct the world in our brains comes from experiments in perception by scientists, but can also be revealed though the work of artists.  What Al Seckel, who teaches at Cal Tech, has done here is collect almost three hundred optical illusions done by artists, some familiar, but many not so familiar, \\"so that the reader has a much greater chance of being surprised.\\"  Variations on some of Escher's themes including his impossible staircases are included.  There are impossible triangles and impossible cubes, some constructed from objects using mirrors.  There are drawings like the famous young girl/old hag that pop in and out definition as our eyes fatigue from one to the other--included here on p. 87 as \\"My Wife and Mother-in Law.\\"  There are pictures in which a person is smiling and then when turned upside down, the picture becomes someone else frowning.<br /><br />Other forms include lines and shadings that appear to move, black and white designs that trick the eye into seeing color, a photomosaic of a tiger made entirely of animal pictures and a dog similarly constructed.<br /><br />Famous artists include Rene Magritte, Escher, Salvador Dali, and others.  There are photos of three-dimensional illusions including \\"Haemaker's Impossible Twisted Rectangle\\" which must be seen from a particular angle for the illusion to manifest itself.  There are grid illusions in which dots appear at intersections only to disappear when looked at directly (\\"Hermann Grid Illusion).  There are plays with curved lines that look straight and straight lines that appear to curve.  One glittering picture, a \\"Twist on Reginald Neal's Square of Three\\" (p. 280) literally made me dizzy.<br /><br />Not included is one of my favorite illusions that I originally got from a Native American basket tray.  It is composed of dark and light squares arranged in diamond shapes one within the other so that differently constituted squares, and even the illusion of circles, pop in and out of existence.  Sometimes there is the illusion of a vague green or red tint among the black and white.<br /><br />Also not included is the imbedded arrow on the side of the Fed Ex truck (see if you can find it next time a Fed Ex truck goes by!) although a more sophisticated form of the same thing is on page 66 called \\"Time Saving Suggestions.\\"  There are no examples of the relatively new street art phenomenon in which the ground is painted elaborately in such a way as to give the illusion of depth, showing someone crawling out a hole in the ground where there is no hole.<br /><br />The most maddening illusion for me is \\"Shepard's Tabletop\\" on page 10.  There are two tables, one that seems thinner and longer than the other.  You've probably seen this illusion or a variant.  So powerful are the perceptive clues that it is impossible to believe that the surfaces of the tables are identical until you take out a ruler and measure the sides!<br /><br />Many illusions depend for their effect on \\"false shading\\" or misleading perspective clues.  Our eyes are used to the light coming from above (Microsoft shades its dialogue and text boxes in such a way--check and see!) so that when something is shaded from below, as is one of the objects in \\"Shape from Shading\\" (p. 45), our eyes see the object differently.  In this case the objects shaded from above look like spheres while the one shaded from below appears concave.  Turn the picture over and the concave becomes a sphere.  Our brains compensate for shadow so that when something appears to be in shadow our brains maintain the color or shade of the object as though it were not in shadow.<br /><br />Seckel includes remarks about the illusions on the page on which the illusions appear, and then, for most of them, further comments or explanations are included in notes at the end of each of the chapters.  Sometimes however nothing is explained and at other times there is only a partial explanation.  I wish he had included all the remarks on the same page as the illusion.  That way I wouldn't have to keep thumbing back and forth.<br /><br />This is a book that can be flipped through, but for full effect the illusions need to be studied a bit, and for artists, they need to be studied a lot, since some of them are really amazing.variant.

Nobel laureate economists are included as well as distinguished economists from the past.  Distinguished contemporary economists who have not won the Nobel Prize in economics are not included.

Obviously the editors Graham Bannock, Ron Baxter and Evan Davis, have their reasons for their hierarchies of ink expenditure.  They call their approach &quot;a micro-encyclopedic treatment with extensive cross referencing.&quot;  The cross references are indicated with two types of grey arrows, one for &quot;see&quot; and another for &quot;see also.&quot;  Clearly one of their goals is to be as encyclopedic as reasonable without making the volume too large to fit into a briefcase or to be read in bed.<br />Although The Economist is British this publication is aimed at the entire English-speaking world, especially the large market in the United States where this book is published by the Bloomberg Press.  Most of the entries betray no national bias, although there are some exceptions.

Other chapters are on pesticides, water wars, bioengineering, the concept of sustainable (or &quot;sustained&quot;) development, crop yields, etc.  The spirit of the book can perhaps be taken from Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug, who wrote the chapter entitled,  &quot;Feeding a World of 10 Billion People: The Miracle Ahead.&quot;<br />The &quot;Miracle Ahead&quot; in Borlaug's title and his enthusiasm for feeding ten billion people are typical of the optimistic tone throughout.  I would prefer that we not have ten billion people to feed, but that is another argument based on my belief that we should leave room for substantial agrarian and wild spaces on the planet and that we should keep alive in their natural habitats as many of our fellow creatures as is reasonably possible, and that such resources are of inestimable value.  The authors of this book are not much concerned with life other than as it relates to the short-term economic welfare of the human species.<br />This brings us to the question, what are they concerned with?  Why are they arguing so vehemently against almost any sort of restraint on economic growth?  Why are they not concerned about how many humans may occupy the planet?  The answer: they know that poor and disadvantaged humans are needed to work at subsistence wages in order that others (themselves, their friends, and their children) may enjoy a high standard of living.  One of the most important environmental trends during the last century NOT noted in this book is the movement of poor people from less developed countries to Europe and the United States.  These people gladly leave the lands of their births, many crossing borders illegally, to take on the lowest paying jobs in our economies.  Without these eager workers we would all be less well off.<br />Consequently the authors want to continue to be able to exploit not only the environment to the fullest, they want to be able to exploit a ready supply of human labor as well.  This is why they do not argue against the dangers of overpopulation and belittle those that do.  They want a substantial number of poor people in the world.<br />But philosophic and moral issues aside, is global warming an &quot;eco-myth&quot;?<br />First, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased since the levels were first measured, especially during the last century.  Second, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas; that is, it allows the sun's heat to penetrate to the surface of the planet but prevents heat from escaping.  Third, the overall temperature of the planet has indeed risen over the last century with some of the hottest years on record occurring in the last decade or so.  All of this is indisputable.<br />However, what is argued in this book is that, one, it is impossible to prove that increased CO2 admissions are causing the warming; two, it was warmer, much warmer earlier in the earth's history; and three, it is not clear that this warming is something to be concerned about.  The authors argue further that plant life loves having more carbon dioxide.  Indeed, this belief is why carbon dioxide levels are not included in the graphs showing pollution levels in the air.  The authors have simply decided that CO2 is not a pollutant.  Of course this is contrary to common sense and to the long held dictum referred to by contributor Angela Logomasini in her chapter on &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot; that &quot;the dose makes the poison.&quot; (p. 159)  Plants do indeed like carbon dioxide but researchers have found that at too high a dose, even plants begin to suffer from too much CO2.<br />It may well be that the increase in CO2 levels is not the reason the earth is getting warmer; it may be just a coincidence or a temporary anomaly.  However--and this is really the crux of the matter ignored by the authors--what if they are wrong?  What if the most likely argument, that increased CO2 levels produced by a growing human population, ARE causing or contributing mightily to global warming?  And what if it gets worse?  The really scary thing about global warming is that we may pass over the point of no return without knowing it.  A full-blown, runaway greenhouse effect would make nuclear winter look like a walk in the park.  Look what happened to Venus, where on any spring day (or winter day for that matter) the surface is hot enough to melt lead.  Could that happen here?  The real and direct answer to that question is: we don't know.<br />Another underlying argument is the idea that human ingenuity is limitless and that whatever problems do develop, our creativity will solve them.  This pollyannaish stance, this matter of faith, really, is not compatible with the rigorous scientific discipline to which the authors aspire.<br />The arguments against the hysteria about bioengineering, about how prognosticators were wrong in the past (Paul Ehrlich, etc.), about how wondrous has been our ability to grow food faster than babies, etc. are all well taken.  Even the argument that natural resources have become cheaper is true, but that is because a great leap in technological skills coincided with vast areas of the planet being available for exploitation.  For our children and grandchildren, who will probably have an even more advanced technology, there will be unfortunately precious few unspoiled lands on which to use that technology.<br />The argument that the past is a guide to the future, held here as an immutable law, is a respectable one, but is not anything near infallible.  A contrary argument, that nothing is ever the same, that what applied as truth for hunter and gatherer, and for agrarian societies, may not be true for advanced technological societies, is perhaps a better guide.hat increased CO2 levels produced by a growing human population, ARE causing or contributing mightily to global warming?

Ten is the basis of our number system and ten are the digits on our hands and toes.<br />So it is not surprising that we love things in ten.  Included in the top ten reasons that David Letterman is still doing late night comedy is his top ten list.  And here we have a book biz phenomenon now into its 15th Edition: The Top Ten of Everything.<br />Well, not quite (but never mind).  The emphasis here is on the famous and the popular: ten richest men (Bill Gates is #1, but Warren Buffett is closing in), ten richest women (Alice L. Walton of Wal-Mart is #1); ten biggest buffos at the box office (men: Harrison Ford; women, Julia Roberts); highest paid sports stars (Alex Rodriguez, $252-million when he was with the Rangers), popular singers, films, songs, poems (William Blake's &quot;The Tyger&quot; is the most anthologized, but Dylan Thomas's &quot;Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night&quot; is the &quot;most popular&quot;).<br />The top ten most populous cities are listed (Tokyo is #1) as are the top ten most populous countries (the US is #3 behind China and India).  I was surprised to learn the production of corn now exceeds that of rice and wheat.  The top ten list of religions has Christianity at the top with Islam second, Hinduism third and &quot;non-religion&quot; fourth.  Atheism is #7.<br />Some science is included.  Oxygen is the most common element in the earth's crust with silicon second and aluminum third.  The deadliest spider is the banana spider from Central and South America.  (The black widow is fourth.)  The largest butterfly is Queen Alexandra's birdwing with a wingspan of eleven inches.<br />Every page contains color photos supporting the text with plenty of shots of movie, sports, and record stars along with animals and just plain people.  The text is set off in boxes with white backgrounds for easy readability.<br />I spent a couple of hours with this book.  It's addictive, like eating chocolates.  I kept turning the pages.

714320:US	49786731	R3U2QLWJ0YYT4F	000711737X	117801409	Peacocks Dancing	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A novel of color and growth	This is not Guyana-born Sharon Maas's first published novel, although I suspect some, if not most, of this was written before the publication of her well-received Of Marriageable Age.  Yes, she could have used a great editor here, somebody to whisper in her ear that the novel will gain strength by what is left out.<br />Consequently this reads like the first novel of a gifted novelist put before the public without benefit of the sort of judicious trimming that lends focus to a work of art.<br />The setting is Guyana and India, the central character Rita Maraj, whom we meet as a child, a girl at once black and Indian whose language is English, a girl fascinated with life--all of life--ants and horses, tadpoles and dogs, a girl who is a bit &quot;quirky,&quot; as she terms herself, a girl who hates remembering dates and doing numbers, but a girl who loves words with the passion of a lexicographer, a girl who can tell a tale like Scheherazade.<br />This girl could be Sharon Maas herself who has a gift for story and for character; indeed one is compelled to associate Maas's heroine with Maas because knowing only the two from Guyana, one knows no others.  And besides the life that Maas depicts growing up in Georgetown is so enthrallingly vivid that it had to be lived.<br />There is a child-like simplicity to the narrative that I found attractive, a kind of fairytale quality that pits the innocence and goodness of Rita against the world.  This is especially accentuated in her relationship with her stepmother, Marilyn, whose shallow personality and unrelenting stupidity are matched only by half sister Isabelle's unmitigated self-absorption.<br />Certainly Maas is not neutral about her heroine.  She has given Rita the integrity that her father, her stepmother, and her half sister lack.  Even more, we know that in Rita's soul there is a sense of something more important than the bourgeois values that so dominate the lives of those around her.<br />Not far into the novel Maas breaks away from Rita and takes us to India where we meet a boy named Kamal who lives in a palace protected from the ugliness of the world by his all-controlling grandmother, Rani, a corpulent woman whose hand moves throughout the day with slow deliberateness from food trays placed around her to her mouth.  In Kamal one is reminded of Siddhartha, and indeed the little boy longs to leave the palace, and one day manages to sneak out, and indeed sees some of the same deplorable sights that long ago opened the Buddha's eyes.<br />Of course Kamal and Rita must meet.  But Maas, who loves to tell a story and build and build upon that story toward a culmination, returns after a few chapters to Rita.  (Part II, which is about Kamal is only 56 of the 485 pages.)  We watch her grow into a teenager and then into a young woman, and we learn the source of her inner strength.  It comes from her maternal grandmother, Granny, a venerable woman who lives up river, a woman who sees reflected in the black river not only the stars but the wisdom of the ages, a woman who tells Rita, &quot;Mixed up blood is fine.  Mixed up religion, no.&quot;<br />She also gives Rita some diamonds (yes, there is a lot of a woman's fantasy life imbedded in the novel, but Maas does not give in to the easy illusions associated with that genre) and tells her, &quot;Be like this creek.  When it is still and its surface unbroken it reflects the truth...and you will know your way.&quot;  One wonders whether Granny is more Zen or Taoist, but one knows it doesn't matter.<br />I would like to have seen more complexity in the men.  We know Ronnie Maraj, Rita's father only slightly as one who acquiesces all too agreeably to Marilyn's demands.  We see his love for others, for his daughters and for Marilyn even, yet there is much of the man that is missing.  I was also a little disconcerted at how Maas abruptly kills off some of her creations as though somehow dissatisfied with them.  Caroline is a case in point, likea painting began and then set aside, and then painted over with someone new.<br />This an epic-like read of people and places exotic and different, but curiously so like our own.  I could almost say that Rita Maraj reminds me of a girl I went to school with.  I can certainly say that her concerns at Number Seven, Georgetown, Guyana are little different from those experienced by girls growing up in, say, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  I could even say that Rita exchanges pelicans for peacocks.a painting began and then set aside, and then painted over with someone new.<br />This an epic-like read of people and places exotic and different, but curiously so like our own.

As a Californian and a long time devotee of the vintner's art (as well as a consumer!) I can tell you that Fetzer makes six and seven dollar bottles of wine with the best of them, and their more expensive labels are outstanding.  And maybe this has always been the case, but before Paul Dolan was picked to head up the company in 1992 most of us didn't know much about Fetzer Vineyards.<br />In this candid memoir (and frankly, part manifesto) about corporate culture and responsibility, Dolan gives us some insight into how he was able to grow the company by more than fifteen percent a year as he shares with us his ideas about how businesses should be run in a time of dwindling and strained natural resources.  Fundamentally he believes that &quot;it's time for business, one of the most powerful forces on Earth, to become a positive force for change.  We already know that we can create tremendous wealth and technological progress.  The new possibility...is to preserve that progress and wealth for the generations to come.&quot; (p. 8)  This is the mantra of &quot;sustainability&quot; which rewards employees as well as shareholders, customers as well as executives.  For someone involved in viticulture this means sustaining the land as well, and for Dolan this means organic agriculture.<br />But Dolan also wants to make a difference in a larger sense.  He wants to win awards for environmental excellence (and he has) by filtering the winery's wastewater and using renewable energy for the winery.  He especially wants to show the world how Fetzer is both an economic success and a leader in environment-friendly practices and community and worker relationships.  His &quot;green&quot; credentials might be judged from this statement: &quot;The true cost of a gallon of gas is not the price you pay at the pump.  The true cost&quot; includes &quot;what it costs the earth when oil is extracted and the cost when some of its byproducts return to the atmosphere...&quot; (p. 17)<br />He also recognizes that &quot;Nonrenewable resources are running out,&quot; and that &quot;Nothing takes place in isolation.&quot; (p. 18)  Would that more business leaders recognized these facts and acted appropriately.<br />This is also a book about how to become an effective manager.  Dolan describes how he learned to listen, to his employees, to his son, and how he learned to put aside preconceived ideas and realized that sometimes the problem was himself.  He tells a story about an annoying person (to him) named Tracey and the clay model they were trying to make (pp. 81-83) and how his change in attitude (inspired by his competitive nature!) allowed them to be successful in their project, and how that led him to stop regarding his son as &quot;My Son The Jerk&quot; (p. 84).  This impressed me because it is not easy being that honest in public and in print.  Later he even tells of a boldfaced lie he told and of an environmental mistake he made.<br />But Dolan can afford to reveal his shortcomings because when you read the chapter devoted to his third principle: &quot;The soul of a business is found in the hearts of its people&quot; it easy to see that he not only respects and appreciates the efforts of others, but that he knows that such respect and appreciation allows them to do their best work.  He sees this as part of our &quot;inner psychology engine...that gets us to put our heart and soul into something.&quot; (p. 101)<br />Another part of the book is actually about the wine making business, about how he grew the business by acquisition and branding, and how Fetzer committed, for example, to making a lot of Merlot and why (see especially pages 143-146).  And there is an Afterword on how wine is made.  The book ends with a Fetzer history time line and Resources for future study including books on sustainability.<br />This is an inspirational book by a man who is proud of his achievements and wants to share that pride with the world.  And it is a story about growth, not just the growth of Fetzer, but the growth of Paul Dolan.  I should add that this is a beautifully produced book, clearly written (wine writer Thom Elkjer had something to do with that) and meticulously edited.y a man who is proud of his achievements and wants to share that pride with the world.

What Thomas does that others do not (and often cannot) is three-fold:<br />First, using her long experience with animals both domestic and wild, she INTERPRETS their behavior from her observations.  Most of us do that, but scientists in general do not.  They cannot because such interpretations, unless established scientifically, would be labeled &quot;anthropomorphic,&quot; and prove dangerous to their careers.  You and I interpret the behavior of our animals, but most of us have only a small fraction of the experience that Elizabeth Thomas has.  She has spent decades in the wild, especially in Africa, studying animals and their interactions with humans.<br />This interaction between humans and their way of seeing the world and that of cats and their way of seeing the world--our differing &quot;cultures&quot; as Thomas rightly uses the term--is the second thing she does so very well.  Her stories about how the Ju/wasi people, for example, treat lions and how the lions treat them--with mutual respect--and how that differs from the way non-indigenous people treat lions is just fascinating to read.  She describes the Ju/wasi talking to a couple of lions, telling them firmly and politely that a certain fallen wildebeest was theirs and that the lions should leave.  After listening, the lions left. (p.118)  And how the Ju/wasi behaved if by chance they should come upon a lion in the wild: the person would take an oblique angle away from the lion and walk with purpose, keeping the lion in sight but not staring.  Thomas discovered that a lion meeting people sometimes would do the same!<br />The third thing that Thomas does extraordinary well is to use her novelist's sense of description and IMAGINE how the cat is feeling.  She writes beautifully with love and understanding, but without mawkish intent or any phony sentimentality.  Here's an example:<br />&quot;Even people with very inconspicuous disabilities are quickly zeroed in on by cats...the entering tigers stopped...to stare...at someone they had spotted deep in the [amphitheater] crowd.  Following their gaze I finally found what they had noticed immediately: a child with Down's syndrome sitting quietly and (to me) inconspicuously amid his family.&quot; (p. 123)<br />If you limp by a caged carnivore, a wolf or a leopard, say, your limping will excite the animal because an injured or disabled animal is its best prey.  As Thomas explains, carnivores want to obtain their meals with as little risk of injury to themselves as possible because any injury in the wild can prove fatal.<br />Here's Thomas on the roaring of lions: &quot;At about ten o'clock that night a lioness suddenly appeared between the two camps and began to roar.  The loudness of lions cannot be described or imagined but must be experienced.  My body was so filled with the sound that I couldn't think or breathe, and in the brief silences between the roars my ears rang.&quot; (p. 135)<br />She goes on to speculate later in the book that lions may use their roars to frighten and flush out their prey.<br />On page 161 Thomas describes exchanging yawns with a lioness lying by a water hole.  Thomas yawned and then, &quot;To my amazement, without taking her eyes off me she also yawned.  Was it coincidence...Was it empathy?  Fascinated I deliberately yawned again.  She yawned again!&quot;<br />I've had similar experiences with cats.  A yawn is a signal that they are comfortable with your presence.  Domestic cats in the yard will also turn their back on you as they lie on their side to signal that they are comfortable with your presence.<br />I always wondered about water holes on the savannas in Africa.  How could the various animals come to drink in safety, and how did they manage to avoid one another?  Thomas gives a convincing explanation.  The lions, who are most active at night, come in the night to drink.  During the heat of the day prey animals come when the lions are resting.  And of course the humans wait until the sun is fully up before approaching. When the elephants come, the lions leave.  Interestingly enough, Thomas claims that lions will not spoil the water hole with their scat.<br />Thomas's skill as a novelist shows in this passage.  She is describing her friend Katharine Payne's experience with a lion that she had spotted just a few feet away as she lay in her sleeping bag: &quot;He looked and looked at Katy.  She looked and looked at him, hearing the wet noises of him swallowing his saliva and settling his tongue.  He was thinking of eating.  Cats are famous for their patience--the big lion watched Katy while the moon slowly rose behind him...The lion continued to think of eating.  Eventually, he drooled.&quot;  (p. 162)<br />One of the points that Thomas makes in this book is that all cats, from four hundred pound lions to our house cats, have much in common.  Our domestic little kitties are more social than we think, and their hunting instincts are just as savage as those of a leopard.  And yes lions purr.<br />She also claims that tigers are better off in circuses than in zoos mainly because they engage in regular activity that stimulates them, and that they enjoy their interactions with their trainers.  She makes a convincing argument, and yet we must have zoos because without them most of us could not see these magnificent creatures; and indeed someday sadly zoos will be their only home.  Maybe what is needed are zookeepers who know the culture of their animals well enough to provide them with something more than meat and boredom.<br />It is wonderful how Thomas becomes, for the purpose of this book, the animals she describes.  Here she describes a lioness observing cattle: &quot;One whiff of that dizzying, grassy scent would have set a lion's mouth watering.&quot; (pp. 181-182)nimals come when the lions are resting.

His main point is that we must eventually have a hydrogen economy based on the hydrogen fuel cell, but that we must not expect this to happen without some major technological breakthroughs.  His book is a warning that the global warming clock is ticking and ticking, and that we need to do something now if we hope to avoid a possible catastrophe.<br />The really scary thing about global warming is that we may pass over the point of no return without knowing it.  Furthermore, a full-blown, runaway greenhouse effect would make nuclear winter look like a walk in the park.  Look what happened to Venus, where on any spring day (or winter day for that matter) the surface is hot enough to melt lead.  Could that happen here?  The real and direct answer to that question is: we don't know.<br />Romm is not painting any such dire scenarios in this book, but he does state most clearly that &quot;the primary reason why we should pursue fuel cells and a hydrogen economy is to help respond to global warming.&quot; (p. 188)  He adds, &quot;global warming is the most intractable and potentially catastrophic environmental problem facing...the planet this century.&quot; (p. 152)  Romm identifies carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere as the primary cause of global warming.<br />What to do and how to do it?  Because Romm addresses these questions in such compelling detail, this is the book I believe that will be--if it hasn't already been--read by high-ranking government officials and the CEOs of energy corporations throughout the world.  I hope that Sen. John Kerry and President George W. Bush will read it.  What they will find is that it will require a closely co-ordinated effort on the part of both government and the private sector to bring about a cost-effective hydrogen technology.  This technology will include the building of an infrastructure for making and distributing hydrogen that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars.  Romm makes it clear that none of this will happen until hydrogen becomes competitive with fossil fuels in terms of cost and efficiency.  Right now hydrogen is most cheaply made from fossil fuels themselves, a process that does not reduce green house gases, and furthermore is much more expensive, no matter what currently-available technology is used, than gasoline itself, and will remain so for many years, probably decades, to come.<br />Ultimately the goal is to manufacture hydrogen from water using renewable resources such as biomass, wind, sun, downward running water, evaporation, ocean currents, etc. to split the water molecule into its component elements.  Romm's immediate future scenario has us obtaining hydrogen from natural gas while using our renewable energy resources to produce electricity in an effort to begin to slow the belching of carbon dioxide into the air.<br />Romm believes that oil production will probably peak in the first half of this century.  He adds that &quot;Some believe this will occur by 2010.&quot; (p. 16)  Given this, it is obvious that we will have to come up with some sort of fuel to replace oil.  Since only &quot;a limited number of fuels are plausible alternatives for gasoline&quot; (p. 16), and since the one with the most going for it is hydrogen, it will be hydrogen.  But transporting hydrogen the way we transport gasoline will be more expensive, perhaps prohibitively expensive since it has to be condensed and/or made into a very cold liquid under pressure.  One might think we could transport water instead and make hydrogen at hydrogen stations, but the most efficient conversion methods require large scale operations at high temperatures.<br />There are several other very challenging problems to be faced, not the least of which is what Romm identifies as &quot;the chicken or the egg&quot; conundrum.  That is, automakers will not make hydrogen fuel cell cars until the hydrogen infrastructure is in place, and the infrastructure will not appear until there are a sufficient number of fuel cell cars on the road.<br />While I think Romm maintains a cautious level of optimism in the face of these difficulties, he does on occasion let his pessimism show:  &quot;If the actions of Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden and record levels of oil imports couldn't induce lawmakers, automakers, and the general public to embrace EXISTING vehicle energy efficiency technologies...I cannot imagine what fearful events must happen before the nation will be motivated to embrace hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which will cost much more to buy...to fuel, and require massive government subsidies to pay for the infrastructure.&quot; (p. 162)<br />If you want to know where we really are vis-vis the so-called hydrogen economy, read this book.ink we could transport water instead and make hydrogen at hydrogen stations, but the most efficient conversion methods require large scale operations at high temperatures.<br />There are several other very challenging problems to be faced, not the least of which is what Romm identifies as &quot;the chicken or the egg&quot; conundrum.

(Would that I had more than a poor layman's appreciation of such endeavors!)  Obvious are the changes in the transliterations into English.  Gone is &quot;Tao te Ching&quot; for the now correct &quot;Dao De Ching.&quot;  (How I loved those t's pronounced like d's and their exotic appearance in print, now reduced to quaint nostalgia.)<br />Also changed is the I Ching, now properly known as Yijing, the &quot;Classic of Changes&quot; (formerly the &quot;Book of Changes&quot;).  Note however that the publishers of this very fine volume have insisted on &quot;I Ching&quot; being in the title lest the uninitiated not realize that this book is about that enormously popular work of divination now at least 3,000 years old.  As such the Yijing is one of the most venerable of all human writings and is of inestimable value for that reason alone.<br />The occasion for this book and for Professor Shaughnessy's translation and commentary is the discovery in 1973 of the Mawangdui manuscript which shed new light on the text of the Yijing.  That manuscript dates from the second century B.C.  However the original of the Yijing goes back to the days before works were written down.  Ni, Hua Ching in his book The Book of Changes and the Unchanging Truth (1983) notes that &quot;an ancient by the name of Fu Shi developed a line system to express the principle of appropriateness.&quot;  Some time later around 1181 B.C. &quot;the feudal lord, King Wen of the Shang Dynasty...provided a written explanation of these lines and hexagrams.&quot; (p. iii in the work cited)<br />Note well the use of the word &quot;appropriateness.&quot;  Although the Yijing is known primarily in the West as a book of divination, it is really a book about how one should behave and what one should expect in the face of the inevitable changes that dominate our lives.  It is therefore in one sense a book of advice, advice to the high and the low, but especially to heads of state.  It might be contrasted and compared to the Dao De Ching and to various volumes of advice from Sun Tzu's The Art of Warfare to Machiavelli's The Prince.<br />This particular book is not a popular work on the classic.  Instead it is a meticulous scholar's work that presents the new textual discovery to the reader with both the Chinese characters and Shaughnessy's translation appearing on facing pages, noting omissions and puzzlements in the manuscript, etc.  His commentary addresses the origins and development of the Yijing including the earlier commentaries by Confucius and others.  This is a book for scholars and the most devoted students of the Yijing as well as Chinese history and culture.<br />I should also note that this is not a book about how to use the Yijing for fortune telling.  There are many books that work well for that purpose including James Legge's I Ching: Book of Changes from 1964, which I have used.  I might also mention Edward Albertson's I Ching for the Millions first published in 1969.  One of the most respected books widely available is The I Ching or Book of Changes by C.F. Baynes and R. Wilhelm which was also first published in the sixties.  Today no doubt there is an I Ching for &quot;Dummies&quot; or an &quot;Idiots&quot; guide that will work well for divination.especially to heads of state.

730694:US	49786731	R377I2O1O3QQQD	0550100512	156547347	Chambers Biographical Dictionary	Books	4	29	30	N	N	More valuable and handier than might at first appear	Chambers is the leading name in reference works in the UK, and so it is not surprising that this is an excellent work.  The question is do you really need a biographical dictionary?  Just how handy is it, and does it contain the names of people you might be interested in?<br /><br />I got along without one for many years, but I find it increasingly valuable not only for my reading and writing but for following the news.  I used to look up spellings in the back of my Merriam-Webster dictionary (one of the uses of a biographical dictionary), but found that only worked for really famous and usually dead people.  Now when a newsworthy person is mentioned I can look that person up in the Chambers biographical dictionary and usually find an entry.  Even if that person is not found, at least I know that he or she is new to the celebrity game.<br /><br />Let's check some names and see.  Osama Bin Laden?  Yes, he is found under \\"Bin Laden, Osama bin Mohammad,\\" born 1957, \\"Saudia Arabian terrorist leader.\\"  He gets about 250 words.  His near exact contemporary on the next page, \\"Bird, Larry (Joe),\\" born 1956 \\"US basketball player\\" gets about 90 words.  Between them I find \\"Binoche, Juliette,\\" born 1964 \\"French actress\\" with maybe 80 words.<br /><br />Well, what about, say, the Buddha?  Yes, he appears and gets a special text box as befits \\"the enlightened one.\\"  (Jesus Christ, \\"believed to be both human and divine,\\" gets a bigger box.)  Others getting boxes are poet T.S. Eliot.  He gets almost as much space as Jesus.  And Queen Elizabeth I, etc.  Shakespeare tops them with two big text boxes.<br /><br />What about the possible UK-bias in the selection of names?  There is a slight bias, but remember Chambers wants to sell this book not only in the bigger US market but to English-speaking people world wide, so the bias is kept to a minimum.  One thing to note is that your run-of-the mill US congressman is not listed.  Orrin Hatch (long-time Republican senator from Utah) does not appear, but the late Strom Thurmond does.  Of course President George W. Bush does appear, but embarrassingly enough (embarrassing for the precognitive powers of the editors, perhaps) Massachusetts Senator John Kerry does not appear.<br /><br />Scientists are not neglected.  There's a box for Stephen Hawking, for example, and biologist Edward O. Wilson gets a mention.  Even literary critics appear, the late Edmund Wilson, but not Harold Bloom.  Speaking of blooms, Judy Sussman Blume, \\"US writer for teenagers\\" gets a hundred words, but US writer for adults, Howard Bloom does not appear.<br /><br />Una McGovern, who is the editor for this the Seventh Edition, writes in the Preface that the criteria for inclusion is the same as it has always been, \\"achievement and recognition\\" while hinting slyly that \\"recognition\\" is probably the more important factor.  There are \\"over 17,500 biographies\\" stuffed into 1,650 two-column pages.  The book weighs about five pounds so it's a little bit of a problem for extensively perusing while in bed.  Every edition adds new celebrities, so some old ones have to be eliminated to keep this to a one-volume work.  There are about 500 new entries for this edition including Madonna (the new one, not the old, although \\"Mary, Mother of Jesus,\\" does rate one and a half column inches.)  And speaking of Biblical comparisons, I recall that the Beatles had remarked some years ago that they were more famous than Jesus of Nazareth.  Let's see what Chambers thinks:  Well, the Beatles do get a 700-word box, but Jesus gets one twice as large.<br /><br />Bottom line: more entertaining than one might expect (but this is a Chambers reference book trademark--see their quotation books), and definitely worth the relatively modest investment.rmond does.

There are two good reasons.  One is cost.  Compared to the newer dictionaries that I have seen, this book is a bargain.<br />The second reason is that this is an excellent and handy volume that will answer the vast majority of your questions about the definitions and usage of scientific terms.  While it is true that scientific knowledge is speeding ahead at breakneck pace, most of the fundamentals of science haven't change since this dictionary was first released in 1986.  This is a comprehensive dictionary of science, not to be confused with popular and much shorter works like the Dictionary of Scientific Literary from John Wiley and Sons which concentrate on only the most popular scientific ideas.<br />Want to know what joule is?  Or a fermion? Or how the phrase &quot;heat sink&quot; is used?  How about the &quot;uncertainty principle&quot; from quantum mechanics?  Or what the letter &quot;c&quot; means across the disciplines of science?  There all here along with about 16,000 other entries.  The entry for &quot;c,&quot; for example, includes nine definitions for the lower case &quot;c&quot; (including &quot;charm&quot; in subatomic particle physics) and nine more for the capital &quot;C.&quot;<br />Or take a term like &quot;orbit.&quot;  There are entries from astronomy, physics, and anatomy for the noun form of the word, and four more entries for the verb form.  Or the abbreviation &quot;Ig&quot; (immunoglobulin).  This dictionary explains in some detail the differences between &quot;IgA,&quot; &quot;IgE,&quot; &quot;IgG,&quot; and &quot;IgM.&quot;<br />There are numerous small black and white illustrations throughout and many cross references.  Many entries include quotations demonstrating the use of the term in question.  How the term is pronounced is given.  I recently checked on the pronunciation of &quot;prion&quot; (the infectious agent of mad-cow disease) expecting to see &quot;pri'-on&quot; with a long &quot;I&quot; sound, but instead found the correct &quot;pree'-on.&quot;<br />Although this is a comprehensive science dictionary it is not exhaustive.  For instance, the moons in the solar system are not included.  The use of the letters &quot;r&quot; and &quot;k&quot; in evolutionary biology referring to parental strategies of species (the former standing for many offspring, the latter for good care of fewer offspring) should appear but do not.  Terms that have been coined in recent years obviously do not appear, but there are also some terms that were in use before 1986 but were not considered important enough at the time for inclusion.  &quot;Gaia&quot; is an example, as are entries for &quot;complexity&quot; theory and &quot;chaos.&quot;  Even a term like &quot;neoteny&quot; which refers to child-like features in an adult organism is missing although it appears in the unabridged second edition of the Merriam-Webster dictionary from the thirties.<br />Nonetheless, until such time as the publishing industry brings out a scientific dictionary that is both affordable and comprehensive, this book will continue to be a find.  Curiously enough I was at major book store a couple of weeks ago and found a brand new copy on sale at the jacket price.  That says volumes about the publishing niche that this book continues to occupy.&quot;pri'-on&quot; with a long &quot;I&quot; sound, but instead found the correct &quot;pree'-on.&quot;<br />Although this is a comprehensive science dictionary it is not exhaustive.

The book itself is beautifully presented and Nina Munk writes like an angel.  Well, if you're not Jerry Levin, et al., she does.  She has a knack for making the words flow and the personalities as vivid as the sights of childhood.  Her hard-edged but clean and crisp style will be widely imitated I predict.  Her ability to research and to sift through the results of that research and to lay it all out in such an intriguing way is something close to amazing.  I really don't give two hoots about Steve Case, Jerry Levin, the old Luce culture (&quot;I am biased in favor of God, Eisenhower and the stockholders,&quot; p. 7), the Warner Bros. legacy (sleazy ethics and &quot;foul tongues&quot; and rumored &quot;Mafia connections,&quot; p. 35), the dot com upstarts (&quot;You people really need to start moving at Internet speed,&quot; p. 231), etc., but Munk makes it fascinating, like egomaniacs twisting in the wind, so to speak.<br />But this story isn't just about AOL Time Warner but about corporate America in general, about how merger mania and golden parachuted moguls can play fast and loose with our money, our livelihood, our country, and our future.  It's about the collateral damage, the megalomania, the broken hearts and the evaporated portfolios.  It's about the mentality of corporate CEOs like Levin who as he turned sixty wanted to be remembered for something other than the bottom line, &quot;for integrity...high moral principles; and wisdom.&quot; (p. 133)  Ah, yes, a lifetime of chasing money and power and now True Religion.  One is reminded of Bill Gates with the very demanding problem of how to distribute all that money wisely before he dies.<br />Munk knows these people.  How she got them to be so carelessly candid at times amazes me, especially her work with Levin.  She understands their psychology and to some significant extent, their business.  She had to, to write this book and make it work.  She packs the text with spiffy and sometimes all too revealing quotes.  She has the heart of a baggy-eyed scholar and the soul of a muckraker.  The almost surrealistic give and take between Case and Levin as they cooked The Deal reads like something out of a Hollywood movie.  Whose ego, whose sense of personal power, and imagined historical accomplishment and brilliance needed massaging the most by whom?  And who would steal more from the other?  And the ease with which Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley each got $60-million for their part in the deal reads like tales of manna falling from heaven.<br />There are some black and white photos in the middle of the book.  The test is exquisitely edited and proofed, and the book handsomely designed.  Munk ends this &quot;morality play,&quot; as she calls it, with a curtain call of the cast of characters in an epilogue and brings us up to date on what has happened to them and what they're doing now.<br />Incidentally, my subject-line quote about a &quot;mess of porridge&quot; is from Robert Murdoch, no doubt licking his chops. (p. 280)<br />Bottom line: you will be kept up at night reading this page turner.  Better yet take it on that trip to Singapore.  It's a jet-lag killer.sometimes all too revealing quotes.

Homeopathy is a case in point.  Wanjek includes it because he believes that people relying on such medicines tend to deprive themselves of real medicine.  This may indeed be the case sometimes, but more often people turn to alternative medicine when conventional medicine fails.  Clearly if one has an affliction that can be cured by conventional medicine and instead flies to the Philippines for some fake surgery, this is not good.  On the other hand if the medical profession has stopped treating somebody's cancer, it is understandable that one might try anything.  Still even this is sad since such desperation rewards quacks and charlatans.<br />But this book is about much more than bad medicine.  Wanjek actually takes on a wide range of phoniness from bad TV health reporting to urban witch doctors, from why we go gray to why the Rambo-like violence in movies is unrealistic and dangerously misleading  In fact, Wanjek's book is the widest ranging book of its kind that I have read and I've read a few; furthermore as far as I can tell he is right on the money.<br />Some things I learned with interest: what the appendix actually does, and where the silly idea that we only use ten percent of our brain comes from, and why &quot;Vitamin O&quot; (oxygen) is just so much bunk.  Also: how health studies are conducted well and not so well and how they can be fudged, and why it is highly unlikely that Julius Caesar was born of a Caesarean section since his mother lived on and in those days nobody, but nobody ever survived such an operation.<br />There is also of course a lot that I already knew including the fact that the black plague is still with us, and that cold weather does not cause colds, and that antibiotics are useless against viruses (such as flu or cold viruses), and that radiation used in radiating food does not contaminate the food anymore than baking the food in a conventional oven does.<br />Wanjek even changed my mind on a couple of things, and for these old eyes to see new light is a rarity.  I used to give Chinese medical practice and India's ancient ayurvedic treatments the benefit of the doubt believing that all those many centuries of experience counted for something.  However, Wanjek makes the very excellent point that such medical traditions existed not because they were effective but because there was nothing else.  He adds that conventional medicine is largely replacing these practices in their very countries of origin.  Wanjek adds in implication that the entire history of medical practice up to (and to some very real extent) including modern times has been one long exercise in malpractice and painful ignorance.  What horrors are we practicing on our patients today, one might ask, horrors to compare with bloodletting and Mayan brain surgery?  Try chemotherapy for cancer, Wanjek suggests.<br />The only fault I could find with the book is that in his discussion of why we are getting so fat and in his eagerness to nail the Atkins diet to the wall he failed to mention so-called &quot;carbohydrate intolerance.&quot;  (Maybe he doesn't like the phrase.)  I want to therefore remind him that in the prehistory there were not only no fatted calves or choice cuts of beef but no amber waves of grain either.  Humans have little tolerance for living with a lot of easily gotten carbs anymore than they have genes for resisting fat-laden foods.  Before the rise of agriculture, gathering wheat and other grain plants was such a labor-intensive process that not even Momma Cass could get fat from eating grass seeds.<br />Bottom line: the most comprehensive book on pseudoscience that I have read in recent years and one of the most readable.ven does.<br />Wanjek even changed my mind on a couple of things, and for these old eyes to see new light is a rarity.

Reich's bottom line argument is that happy and healthy workers are more productive.  And you can out-source THAT to India.<br />The problem is that happy and healthy, or unhappy and not so healthy, foreign workers are still cheaper, and that is where the jobs have gone and are going.  No argument from morality is going to stop that.  His argument, sliced a little finer, is that American companies need to make American workers happier and healthier at home so that don't have to out source; that is, make them happier than their cheaper cousins in Bangladesh and they will produce more goods and services (albeit at a living wage) and everybody in America will profit both economically and morally.<br />If only.  I think Reich is right that making workers happier and healthier will make them more productive.  But I don't think that will solve the problem of jobs going overseas.  US companies will simply use the same happier, healthier techniques (at a cheaper cost) overseas and they'll still send the jobs away.<br />Reich's argument that spending more money on education and job training, on the other hand, is the right way to go.  If America's work force is the best educated and most skilled it will out-compete foreign labor for the work and the work will stay right here.  Indeed foreign companies will move their plants to the United States to get the best employees.<br />Reich's indictment of the Bush administration for its &quot;semireligious faith&quot; in &quot;trickle-down&quot; economics is based on the observation that &quot;corporations and rich individuals,&quot; blessed with even more riches, will simply invest the money overseas because &quot;investment dollars&quot; in today's economy &quot;travel the world in search of the highest return.&quot; (p. 116)  I believe Reich is right about this and that the Bush administration is living in the fantasy land of a long-dead Keynesian past.  At any rate, we'll see in a few years.<br />All and all this is a good book of its kind except I wish that Reich had not brought his wife's failure to get tenure at an unnamed university into the mix.  He points to that day as the day he became a feminist.  I don't think arguments about gender politics help his economic agenda.  The fact that he called up one of those who voted against his wife and called him an SOB may understandably make Reich feel better, but I wonder how I would feel if I had lost a tenure vote and my wife called up one of the voters and called her a name.<br />Reich's rationale for injecting gender into the discussion is in answer to the constant harping by social conservatives on what they call &quot;family values.&quot;  Reich makes the point that it's fine to talk about vague &quot;family values&quot; when you are financially secure and have someone at home to take care of the kids.  It's a different story when the sole support (the mother) has to work and commute to work fifty or sixty hours a week and can't afford a nanny or day care.  Family values must be centered on home economics is Reich's argument (p. 106), and it is a good one.  Also good is Reich's answer to the &quot;blame-mongers&quot; who peddle &quot;simplistic explanations&quot; for the decline of &quot;family values&quot;: &quot;They demonize people on welfare while doing nothing to end corporate welfare.&quot; (p. 101)<br />A question worth asking (and one I wish Reich had devoted some serious ink to) is, If no solution is found to the growing chasm between the haves and the have nots in this country, what will be the social consequences?  Will we see terrorism adopted by the poor people in our cities and on our rust belt factories and farms as a means of acting out their frustrations?  Or will they bedocile sheep?  As the entire world becomes more and more polarized between the first and third worlds, will terrorism become an instrument of the deprived as it is now of religious fundamentalists?<br />Perhaps a powerful argument for sharing the wealth (Reich calls it &quot;redistributing capital&quot; rather than the old-fashioned redistribution of wealth--but it amounts to the same thing) can be found in these dire thoughts.

743320:US	49786731	R1SMNWF04YV1ZU	0834003465	869705717	Boldtext Pew Bible: King James Version	Books	5	40	78	N	N	As a religious work and as literature	The Holy Bible (&quot;Book divine! Precious treasures thou art mine!&quot;--to recall a popular hymn) like many great works of religion can be taken on two levels.  The first is as literature, the second as the revealed word of God.<br />As far as literature goes, the King James Version, &quot;translated out of the original tongues&quot; during the time of Shakespeare some four hundred years ago has been since its inception the standard by which all other versions are compared.  More than that, along with the works of Shakespeare, the King James Version of the Bible is the bedrock upon which all English literature rests.  The language used by those anonymous translators ranges from the mundane to ethereal poetry of the highest order.  If you are reading the Bible as literature, the King James version is the one to get.  More than that, one can hardly be considered educated without at least some familiarity with this great work.<br />As far as the Bible being the revealed word of God, there are two possible ways of looking at it.<br />One, literally; that is, the Bible as the absolute, denotative truth put down by scribes acting as instruments of God.  This is the way Christian fundamentalists view the Bible.  &quot;God said it.  I believe it.  That settles it!&quot;  (To recall a bumper sticker.)<br />Two, symbolically; that is, the Bible as wisdom from God set forth in symbol, parable, story, myth and metaphor.<br />To be blunt, I don't think there is much to be said for the literal approach.  In the first place, the Bible is contradictory in many places and it requires some clever babbling to reconcile the contradictions.  For example it is written in many places that the Lord was moved to anger by the misbehavior of his people.  Indeed in Kings 17:18 it is reported: &quot;Therefore, the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight.&quot;  A God that gets angry would seem to be not much of a God and cannot reasonably be reconciled with the all-knowing, all-powerful being seen elsewhere in the Bible.  Attributing anger to God is a pathetic anthropomorphic projection.  There is a lot of this silliness in all religions of course.<br />But more than that, the Bible itself clearly indicates in many places that a literal expression is not what is meant.  Thus Jesus spoke in parables (&quot;And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables...&quot; Matthew 22:1) and often used metaphorical language (&quot;Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?&quot; Matthew 7:3).  Clearly a literal meaning was not intended.<br />Because of these considerations the Bible is not taken literally by most practicing Christians.  Consequently the &quot;seven days&quot; of creation can be seen as a metaphor for Big Bang cosmology (if one likes), and the Garden of Eden as a metaphor for human nature before we acquired consciousness.<br />The Bible can also be seen as psychological truth.  All great religious works that have come down to us are repositories of psychological truth.  They have survived partly because people have found them valuable in their daily lives.  Regardless of literal truth they are psychologically true.  It is a good psychology, for example, to &quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&quot;  Or, &quot;neither cast ye your pearls before swine.&quot;  And it is a great psychological, as well as a moral, truth that &quot;all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this the law and the prophets.&quot;  (We are in Matthew 7 where Jesus speaks with especial eloquence.)<br />How does the Bible compare to the other great religious works? is a question worth considering.  Certainly it is longer than the most famous works of other religions such as The Bhagavad Gita of the Hindus or the Tao Te Ching of the Taoists, although not much longer than the Koran.  It is much more uneven than any of these, speaking in a multitude of voices from the begets of the Old Testament and the sublime poetry of Ecclesiastes and the Psalms to the eloquence and wisdom of Jesus in the New Testament.  One would need to take all the Vedas, for example, from the hymns of the Brahmans to Krishna's expression in the Gita to find something comparable, and indeed there are many similarities.<br />In one sense all religious works of any antiquity are similar in that they are written in a symbolic and metaphorical language.  If they were not they would not survive because the literal concerns of one age are not that of another, and furthermore, it is impossible to express many of the great psychological truths in a strictly denotative way.  Even more than that, it is perhaps best to express these truths in a general way so that each of us may discover them ourselves as they relate to the challenges of our lives.  Thus it is said that &quot;Many are called but few are chosen&quot; (Matthew 22:14).  Called to what?  Chosen for what?  Jesus was referring to wedding guests, but this passage speaks to us of spiritual matters.<br />As does the Bible itself, properly understood.king in a multitude of voices from the begets of the Old Testament and the sublime poetry of Ecclesiastes and the Psalms to the eloquence and wisdom of Jesus in the New Testament.

748314:US	49786731	RM0QE8GAIK03U	0451165667	399084864	Fatal Vision	Books	5	162	178	N	N	One of the classics of the true crime genre	This is one of the most sobering of true crime tales, and one of the most intriguing.  Former Green Beret officer Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald (still in prison last time I checked) called the police early one morning to report that his pregnant wife and two young daughters had been murdered by a marauding gang of hippies shouting &quot;Kill the pigs, acid is groovy&quot; while he received some superficial wounds trying to fight them off.<br />Joe McGinniss who at the time was best known for his Nixon campaign book (The Selling of the President 1968) jumped on the case and made arrangements with MacDonald to follow him around and interview him.  McGinniss has said that initially he believed MacDonald was innocent, but as he grew to know MacDonald, and as he sifted through the evidence he began to change his mind until in the end he believed along with the prosecution and the jurors that MacDonald had murdered his family.  McGinniss reports all this in such a compelling manner that the reader is lead step by step to the same horrific conclusion (or at least most readers are).  Also changing their minds about MacDonald were the wife's parents who at first refused to believe that he could have done something like this.  Yet in the end they too were convinced.<br />Not convinced however were MacDonald's many supports including as I recall members of the Long Beach, California police department, many of MacDonald's co-workers, and a number of women who found the doctor very attractive.<br />All of this is interesting but what I think most fascinated McGinniss and what most fascinates me is an answer to the questions of Why did he do it? and How could any human being do something like that?<br />The most plausible theory (this is basically McGinniss's theory as well) to explain why he did it goes something like this: In a rage (possibly induced in part by amphetamine use) MacDonald badly or fatally injured one of his family.  Rather than own up to this and face the consequences he had the &quot;fatal vision&quot; (thought to have been conjured up in part from an Esquire Magazine article or in remembrance of the Mason family murders) of acid-crazed hippies breaking into his home and attacking his family with him in heroic defense.  To make this work he would have to kill everybody except himself and construct a crime scene that would support his story.  The prosecution and McGinniss careful show how MacDonald's crime scene construction failed.  Readers interested in forensic science will find this aspect of the book absolutely fascinating, even if not entirely convincing.<br />But to convict a man of murdering his family based on circumstantial evidence especially when the motive is not another woman, or money, but is instead merely a desire to hide what at worse would be manslaughter, seems quite a stretch for any jury, or so MacDonald apparently figured.  But what went wrong was not only the evidence, but his personality.<br />As McGinniss spent time with MacDonald he came to realize that Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald was not like other people.  He was charming and very bright but there was a cold aspect to his personality, what in autism is called a &quot;lack of affect.&quot;  Obviously he was not autistic, or perhaps his is a form of autism.  Anyway, according to the current psychiatric wisdom, such a person is called a psychopath or a sociopath.  The words mean approximately the same thing, that is, a person who values only his or her own life and welfare, a person who has no real feelings of warmth for others, a person who has no compunction about taking the life of another if he or she can gain from it and get away with it.<br />The compelling psychological argument for me (and perhaps for the jury that convicted him) is that ONLY such a husband and father could have done that.  The fact that he fit the psychopathic personality type was what led to his conviction as much as the forensic evidence.  I should add that even though over the yearsthere have been tips about, and bizarre manifestations of, possible hippy suspects, MacDonald has remained the only real suspect.<br />But did he do it?  This book makes a powerful case that he did.  Followers of sensational crimes such as the Jon Benet Ramsey case or the current case of Scott Peterson (reported as &quot;laughing and joking&quot; with his attorneys in court today as I write this) will see similarities here.  In the Jon Benet case there is the sense of an attempt to cover up some violence inflicted on a member of the family because somebody (probably the mother) lost her temper, while in the Scott Peterson case there is the phenomenon of the sociopathic personality to explain an otherwise unthinkable crime.<br />I originally thought that MacDonald was guilty and I still do, but I admit there is some doubt.  Whether that doubt is &quot;reasonable&quot; is for you to decide.  The jury has already decided.  Someday there may be another trial.  If so, that jury will decide.  You might also want to read the &quot;answer&quot; to this book, Fatal Justice: Reinvestigating the MacDonald Murders (1992) by Jerry Allen Potter.  Or go to the various Websites.  I think you'll discover, as I did, why we have trials by jury in which both sides present their arguments.  Just hearing one side seems so convincing until you hear the other side.<br />Bottom line: one of the very best true crime reads, the book that made McGinniss's career and helped to end MacDonald's: one of the classics of the genre.there have been tips about, and bizarre manifestations of, possible hippy suspects, MacDonald has remained the only real suspect.<br />But did he do it?

751213:US	49786731	R2YLM306D7YQXH	0465054803	818578640	A Mathematician Plays The Stock Market	Books	5	26	33	N	N	Funny, self-effacing, and just a terrific read	Since Professor Paulos delights in paradoxes it is appropriate that a paradox lies at the heart of this very fine book.  He does indeed play the stock market, but how well and using what kind of strategy?  Ironically Paulos's personal tale is one of obsession and foolhardiness, of buying WCOM at 37 (yes, WCOM), of averaging down again and again and buying calls until in near final desperation our good professor finds himself contemplating with a kind of hopeless hope his WCOM calls at $20 as the stock trades at $1.13! (p. 197)<br />Interestingly enough, most of what mathematician Paulos writes about here is the psychology of the market and what he learned about himself psychologically as he rode the stallion down, down deep into the valley of despair.  Yes, there is some interesting and instructive math included, but how refreshing it is to read a professional academic chronicle his experience while being up-front and personal about the emotional, random, and psychological traps that often guided his decisions.  It takes a certain amount of confidence to write a book like this, and it helps a lot to be able to laugh at yourself.<br />My experience during the period beginning early in 2000 when the market began to tank was similar to Paulos's (which is one reason I found his account so riveting) except (thanking my lucky stars) I did NOT average down as he did, and I certainly did not buy calls.  Instead gradually (too gradually of course) I began to take money out of the market.  For those of you who lived through those days of shock and despair, Paulos's witty self-examination will be a pleasure to read.<br />On another level this is a book about market theory.  Paulos does not believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which states that prices in the market accurately reflect the value of the market and that any subsequent deviation (without new information) from those prices is a random walk.  His argument (a very persuasive one) is that the market is a self-referential system that depends on how the players view the market.  Paradoxically, if they believe in an efficient market they will NOT try to figure out ways to take advantage of anomalies and the market will be inefficient!  Conversely, if the players believe that the market is inefficient, that there is some surplus value to be gained, they will indeed look for ways to take advantage of differentials and anomalies, and presto! the market becomes efficient.<br />Consequently, Paulos' theory is a refinement of the EMH.  He sees the market as constantly existing in a dynamic state poised between maximum efficiency and something less than that.  He sees the market as a complex system subject to the laws of complexity theory, and like the weather only more so, impossible to predict much in advance.<br />As for technical versus fundamental analysis, Paulos appropriately hedges.  Yes, the trend is your friend, but (e.g.) the full blown Elliot wave theory is \\"murky\\" while the fundamentalists suffer from possibly cooked numbers and from the information already being factored into the stock's price.  One gets the sense that Paulos is once bitten, twice shy!  However, I think he has gotten this exactly right, namely that only a small edge can be had through a lot of work using both approaches.<br />There are some interesting mathematical paradoxes presented here and some scams.  Those of you who have read Paulos's previous books (e.g., Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences, 1988; A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper, 1995, etc.) know he has a gift for making the obtuse and opaque clear, or at least intelligible, and that he can be laugh out loud funny.  I thought that he was even funnier here than usual, perhaps because there is a taint of  gallows humor infused throughout.  For example, in reference to his love affair with WCOM, Paulos writes, \\"Investing in it had originally seemed like a no-brainer.  The realization that doing so had indeed been a no-brainer was glacially slow in arriving.\\" (p. 199)<br />One paradox is the familiar \\"All Cretans are liars\\" upon which Paulos plays a few variations to demonstrate the self-referential aspect which is at the heart of the paradox.  Included is this illumination: \\"The Prosecutor booms, 'You must answer Yes or No.  Will your next word be No?'\\" (p. 187)<br />One scam is the familiar Ponzi scheme.  Paulos thinks of a stock market bubble (as we experienced in the nineties) as a Ponzi scheme in which dot com buyers are hoping to sell to stupider dot com buyers, etc.  In another context, Paulos notes perspicaciously, \\"Even ravaging of the environment may be seen as a kind of global Ponzi scheme, the early 'investors' doing well, later ones less well, until a catastrophe wipes out all gains.\\" (p. 94)<br />I must warn the reader to beware of many atrocious puns.  In one of the \\"worst,\\" Paulos is explaining the emotional differences between risk adverse people and their opposite and how a stock's beta may be personalized.  \\"A zero beta person would have to be unconscious, perhaps from ingesting too many beta-blockers.\\" (p. 162)<br />Ouch!o-brainer was glacially slow in arriving.\\" (p. 199)<br />One paradox is the familiar \\"All Cretans are liars\\" upon which Paulos plays a few variations to demonstrate the self-referential aspect which is at the heart of the paradox.

Lester Brown recently wrote Eco-Economy: Building an Economy for the Earth in which his thesis was that &quot;the environment was not part of the economy...but instead that the economy was part of the environment.&quot; (p. xv)<br />Here he presents an upbeat and positive plan for saving the world from the consequences of what he calls the planet-wide &quot;bubble economy.&quot;  His central argument is that we are about to face a food shortage of crisis proportions as our aquifers and rivers run dry.  The relative price of food, which is directly dependent upon ready water supplies from underground and through the diversion of rivers, he argues, is about to skyrocket as China and other grain-hungry nations begin to import grain.<br />His plan B is a combination of interventions that would include environmental tax reform, that is, taxing products in terms or their true cost including pollution and the use of non-renewable resources.  Thus the consequences of pollution-induced illnesses like asthma, etc. be factored into the cost of gasoline.  In this way non-polluting energy sources such as windmills and solar energy cells would become cost-competitive with fossil fuels almost immediately.<br />The first half of the book is devoted to describing the problem, which he calls &quot;A Civilization in Trouble.&quot;  The second half is devoted to his Plan B which includes adopting &quot;honest global accounting,&quot; stabilizing the population, and raising land productivity.  He wants not only to shift taxes from the environmentally sound ways of doing business to the ecologically harmful ways, but to shift the subsidizes that many countries now give to fossil fuel producers and to fishing and logging industries to environmentally safe products and industries.  He points out that it is foolhardy to subsidize the destruction of our environment as we are now doing.<br />Brown quotes Oystein Dahle, former Vice President of Exxon for Norway as saying: &quot;Socialism collapsed because it did not allow the market to tell the economic truth.  Capitalism may collapse because it does not allow the market to tell the ecological truth.&quot; (p. 210)<br />A striking example of what Brown means by shifting taxes comes from former Harvard Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who wrote: &quot;Cutting income taxes while increasing gasoline taxes would lead to more rapid economic growth, less traffic congestion, safer roads, and reduced risk of global warming...&quot; (p 214)<br />Incidentally, Brown asserts that rising temperatures adversely affect crop yields.  He notes that crops are grown in many countries &quot;at or near their thermal optimum, making them vulnerable to any rise in temperature.&quot;  He cites a study by Mohan Wali at Ohio State University showing that photosynthesis increases until the temperature reaches 68 degrees F. and then plateaus until it hits 95 degrees whereupon it begin to decline, and ceases at 104 degrees.  (pp. 62-63)<br />The problem with his solution is that, as Brown points out, the body politic, especially that of the United States, must take action to implement the changes.  Unfortunately, President Bush, who represents corporate interests (as most American politicians do), will continue to call for more studies, and nothing will be done.  More particularly, taxing destructive practices will only work if all (or at least a substantial majority) of the countries of the world cooperate.  Polluted air, acid rain, depleted aquifers, and rivers run dry cross borders.  Consequently we have a daunting task in front of us.<br />A crucial psychological problem is that our instincts were honed in the pre-history when the resources of forest and savanna were effectively inexhaustible, where it didn't matter how much we burned and polluted since we could just move on.  Our numbers were so small relative to the land that it would renew itself as we were despoiling other lands.  With six billion-plus people on the planet there are no &quot;other lands&quot; and there is no time for the land to renew itself.  We can no longer toss our waste over our shoulders, defecate in the stream, and slash and burn.<br />This is just one respect in which we have to ask, are human beings as presently evolved able to cope with the modern world?  The tribal mentality, with its violence toward outsiders and toward the environment, is still with us, but the tolerance of the environment for such behavior is not.  The myth of the noble savage and indigenous people living in harmony with nature needs a reality check.  We are savages in headsets, neither noble nor ignoble.  We are indigenous people whose lands have gone the way of the Garden of Eden.  We are clumsily and incompletely adjusting to a different landscape: the modern world.<br />The race is on.  Which will come first: our adjustment to the needs of the planet or the collapse of our great civilizations?  Note well it is the needs of the planet that come first.  Note also that the collapse of our civilizations will usher in a period of immense pain and suffering, even for those of us sitting atop Mount Olympus, as it were, in our garden homes sheltered from the storms in our inner cities and in Bangladesh and Pakistan.<br />A great deal of human suffering can be averted by anticipating the consequences of globalization, of diminishing resources resulting in diminishing returns.  But it is also true that a great deal of human suffering can be averted by not doing something stupid that may have unintended consequences.

767504:US	49786731	R2U9YI9B3D6HNV	0060185406	901862594	Lonely Planets: The Natural Philosophy of Alien Life	Books	5	19	22	N	N	Toward a new science and a new way of thinking?	What planetologist David Grinspoon is working on in this book is similar to the consilience that biologist Edward O. Wilson talked about in his book of that name and what C.P. Snow dreamed about in his discussions of the two academic cultures half a century ago.  But what Grinspoon is reconciling is the informed and creative speculation of the human mind with the rigorous requirements of scientific orthodoxy.  He uses the almost forgotten term &quot;natural philosophy&quot; as a means to the end of reconciling the dreamer in his soul with the scientist in his head.<br />Grinspoon represents a new breed of scientist not afraid to speculate aloud and in public about matters that cannot be proven, to joke about them, to relate to them personally and passionately, and to say that it shouldn't be career-threatening for a scientist to venture into the realm of the unknown.<br />He realizes how complex and wondrous is all that we know and especially all that we don't know, and that in a world of uncertainty one can still make decisions and speculate while recognizing that there is a place where science ends and natural philosophy begins.  In this regard is a nice quote from Bertrand Russell:<br />&quot;When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also add that some things are more nearly certain than others.&quot; (p. 374)<br />This is perhaps Grinspoon's major point.  He seeks to separate not just pseudoscience from science, but the likely from the unlikely, and to allow the unproven to remain the unproven but without prejudice.  He admits his biases and he gives his reasons for them.  At the same time he allows that he could be wrong and hopes that in some cases he is.  &quot;Aliens on the White House lawn?--Not yet, but it could happen,&quot; might be a fair way to summarize Grinspoon's position.<br />This book is about why we think about alien life (which is in some sense just a metaphor for the unknown) and how our emphasis and focus have changed over time, and what we know and what we don't know, and what the prospects are for finding answers.  Grinspoon is clearly on the side of the angels in spirit, but with the Skeptical Inquirer in cognition.<br />Grinspoon knows that the new science, like the new music, always sounds discordant to the establishment.  But because he comes from a personal culture steeped in the ideas of Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, Olaf Stapledon, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, etc., not to mention Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg, Bob Dylan and Jerry Steinfeld and, yes, even Madonna, he doesn't care.  Let the establishment cope with the new sciences of complexity, astrobiology, chaos, and let them grapple with the inadequate definitions of &quot;life&quot; and &quot;consciousness.&quot;  Let them rankle at Gaia and squirm at group selection.  Grinspoon wants to go beyond that.  He wants us to become one of the &quot;immortals&quot;--civilizations so advanced and in tune with the cosmos that they will never die until the universe grows cold, and maybe not even then.<br />Here are some examples of Grinspoon's thought and expression in this wonderfully expressive and exciting book:<br />&quot;[O]ther planets must be inhabited because natural selection would fashion living beings to take advantage of local conditions...&quot; (p. 36)<br />Recalling Percival Lowell's Martian canals: Gaps in the &quot;sketchy data at the limits of current abilities...may be filled by our desires, [and] by the power of suggestion...&quot; (p. 39)<br />Asserting that &quot;the planets were where we thought they'd be and...we reached them...has got to be the most solid confirmation of the scientific and technological revolutions of the past four centuries,&quot; Grinspoon adds in a characteristic footnote: &quot;Stuff that in your socially constructed pipe and smoke it!&quot; (p. 62)<br />&quot;We don't really know what life is.  We may as well try and catch the wind as pin life down with a tidy definition.&quot;(p. 98)  --By the way, this incorporation of song lyric and scientific thought is something that Grinspoon does very well throughout the book.  (&quot;We really don't know life at all.&quot;  --Joni Mitchell)<br />How did single-celled organics beget multi-celled organisms?  &quot;This, not some shadowy ape-man, is the real 'missing link' in evolution.&quot; (p. 113)<br />&quot;We are the life of the sun.&quot; (p. 123)  --One of my favorite ideas that is not scientific because it begs the question of the definition of life.

773944:US	49786731	R291FY5ONVUT41	0974946648	113240706	A Brief History of Disease, Science and Medicine	Books	5	82	84	N	N	Splendid piece of work, authoritative and readable	Brief this is not, but compared to some dry academic tomes it seems brief.  University of Southern California professor Dr. Michael T. Kennedy has the all too rare gift of writing well which he combines with a passion for detail so that this history is packed with the bizarre, the fascinating, the arcane, and the all too often revolting facts of medical delusion, malpractice, and triumph that have characterized the long and tortured history of the healing arts.<br />Note well that this is a history not only of medicine and disease, but of science as well.  The emphasis is on twentieth century developments, which is as it should be since so much has happened in recent times.  This is not to say that the more distant past is neglected.  Kennedy starts with the pre-history and follows the quest for health through Greek and Roman times to &quot;The Rise of Islam and Arabic Medicine&quot; (Chapter 5) with excursions into ayurvedic medicine (from India) and the traditional Chinese practices from antiquity.  He even looks at European health, or the lack thereof, during the Dark and Middle Ages before the rise of science.  When he gets to the modern or nearly modern era, Kennedy organizes less by chronology and more by subject matter.  Some of the later chapters are about &quot;Cardiac Surgery,&quot; &quot;Transplantation,&quot; &quot;Psychiatry,&quot; etc.  I particularly liked the crisp way he dealt with psychoanalytic theory and the inefficacy of psychoanalysis.<br />Frankly, I don't know if there is anything else quite like this available.  The recognized authority on the subject of the history of medicine in English, University College London's late Roy Porter wrote both a popular account, Blood and Guts: A Short History of Medicine (2002), and a full blown treatment, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind (1997) which Kennedy cites.  I have read the former and it is to Kennedy's book as Mary Poppins is to Hamlet.  There are other histories, but most are either not current or too voluminous or too restricted in content.<br />Dr. Kennedy shows how various ideas and methods were developed, how they stemmed from, or were in contrast to, earlier methods; and he highlights the personalities of the practitioners as he describes what they did or discovered.  He also focuses on patients and their stories.  His style is sharp and uncluttered.  Sometimes he employs a dry, cynical wit.  At other times his report takes on extra-medical aspects that lend depth and familiarity to his portraits, as when, for example, he reports on the tragic death of transplant pioneer, Dr. David Hume. (p. 388)<br />Here are some examples of the kind of detail that I found fascinating:<br />&quot;The early Middle Ages saw little consumption of animal protein by the peasants, but legume production, which increased with the agricultural revolution, reduced the dependence on carbohydrates and led to rapid population growth again.&quot; (p. 69)<br />And on the following page: &quot;Women lived shorter lives than men in the Middle Ages...This is attributed to the hazards of childbirth, but also to an iron deficient diet...[because] animal protein was not available.&quot;<br />&quot;...[A]lthough opium offered some relief of pain...until the anesthesia era, speed was the sign of the good surgeon.&quot; (p. 85)<br />&quot;Infectious diseases were uncommon in primitive societies because the available pool of susceptible individuals was too small and the contact with other groups was not common.&quot; (p. 87)  Indeed, infectious disease is part of the price we pay for agriculture and civilization.<br />Quoting Freud: &quot;I often console myself with the idea that, even though we achieve so little therapeutically, at least we understand why more cannot be achieved.&quot; (p. 401)  This is doubly ironic since Freud was even deceived in what he thought he understood.  A few pages later Kennedy drily remarks that psychotherapy &quot;is useful in helping adults to deal with life stress.  It has little or no role in treating psychosis.  The serious mental illnesses are increasingly seen as biological disorders.&quot; (p. 424)<br />The only weakness of this book is that it could have used a more meticulous editor.  (The proofreading is excellent.)  Kennedy's writing style is fast-forward, actually suggesting to me how medical history might be written had somebody like, say, novelist James M. Cain taken his hand to it.  The words just rush down the page.  Kennedy has so much to say and he wants to get it all said.  Sometimes one has to read a sentence twice since sometimes his tenses are a little eccentric, and parallel construction is not always strictly observed.<br />There are two indices, one for names, but I notice that the aforementioned Roy Porter, for example, does not appear in either of them.  Probably the names in the footnotes were left out.  Also the references (545 of them) are collected at the end of each chapter, which is fine, but there is no overall alphabetized bibliography.  This is a pet peeve of mine since one has to chase through chapter after chapter to see if a particular work is cited.<br />However Kennedy more than makes up for this deficiency with what he calls a &quot;Postscript&quot; which is a lightly annotated bibliography organized into the categories, &quot;Recommended Reading,&quot; &quot;General Sources,&quot; and sources by individual chapters.<br />Bottom line: the best history of medicine that I have found and a delight to read.fe stress.

785310:US	49786731	R3VTJS0QDJQ1L7	1591020166	717454743	Perfect Planet, Clever Species: How Unique Are We?	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Really outstanding book with one major flaw	This is an outstanding recapitulation of who we are and how we got that way written by a wise and learned man.  William Burger, who is Curator Emeritus at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, begins with our sun and its place in the universe and ends with reflections on human beings and how rare we might be.  Along the way he demonstrates that he is well-grounded in a variety of disciplines, including most especially evolutionary biology.  I found his insights into the discoveries of science most interesting and edifying.  I especially liked his clear prose and forthright statements shorn of humbug and euphemism.<br />Strange to say, however, I am not in agreement with the spirit of his central thesis.  While it is true that we human beings are unique in the most technical sense of the term, just as every fingerprint is unique, it is questionable whether the essence of who and what we are as intelligent beings is unique in this unimaginably vast universe.  Indeed, I am amazed that Burger, who is so objective about our savage tenancies as well as our incredible ability to manipulate our environment to our perceived advantage, can be so, shall we say, myopic in his inability to see the possibilities in the wider scheme of things.<br />Near the end of the book he recalls the famous Drake Equation, and as others have done, examines each of the factors and comes to the conclusion that it may very well be that we are the only intelligence species extant in the galaxy.<br />I have pointed out the fallacies inherent in such an endeavor elsewhere, but let me note here that at least 90% of the matter in the universe is still a complete mystery to us. While it is technically feasible to say that intelligent life as we know it; that is, carbon-based life dependent upon liquid water, etc, may very well be rare in our galaxy, it is a mistake to suppose that any convincing argument against the existence of intelligence life itself has been made.<br />There is also a peculiar fallacy in the argument (sustained throughout the book) that there is something marvelous or probabilistically rare in the unique series of events that have characterized the odyssey (as Burger calls it) of our planet's &quot;perfect&quot; history, leading to our rise.  This argument can be seen as a sidebar to the &quot;anthropic cosmological principle,&quot; which I like to call the &quot;anthropic cosmological fallacy,&quot; in the sense that we are here only because of a miraculous series of events, when in fact we are here precisely because of those events.  The fallacy can be seen in being dealt the following hand at poker: the nine of hearts, the five of clubs, the king spades, the eight of spades, and the trey of diamonds.  This is quite an amazing hand.  The odds against it being dealt are 2,598,959 to 1! (same as the odds against being dealt a royal flush in, say, diamonds).  It is only our perspective that makes the one hand seem commonplace and the other miraculous.<br />Burger writes, &quot;However unlikely our odyssey, the incontrovertible fact is that our planet, our solar system, and our star are ideally configured for the development of intelligent life...&quot; (p. 290)<br />This is not only ex-post facto reasoning, it is misleading since beings living near (or even on, for all we know) a brown dwarf may make a similar observation, citing the congenial warmth of their star and the lack of &quot;visible&quot; radiation as part of the unique factors that make their life possible.  They might even point to how &quot;lucky&quot; they are at being particularly good at sensing the surfaces of things, a talent that would not have developed in a &quot;sighted&quot; world, a talent that has allowed an intelligence of a particularly high order to evolve.<br />Earlier in the book, Burger argues convincingly that it was the stresses and demands of inter-group war (a biological arms race within our species) that promoted the rapid grown of our brains.  This is a fine insight.  However on page 280 Burger writes that without our stabilizing moon, &quot;a badly wobbling planet...[would] put huge stresses on terrestrial vegetation and the animals it supports.&quot;  His conclusion is that without the &quot;accident&quot; of our precisely perfect moon, intelligent life is unlikely to have evolved.  But, to recall his own reasoning, is it not possible that the &quot;stresses&quot; of a &quot;wobbling planet&quot; could lead to compensations by life forms, perhaps even serving as a factor in the growth of intelligence?<br />Burger concedes that bacterial life may be common in the universe and that there may even be life under the surface of frozen worlds, as on Jupiter's moon, Europa.  However he writes that &quot;Such an environment...won't give rise to complex life-forms that are hungry for energy.&quot;  He adds, as though in explanation, that &quot;there's not a lot of energy available.&quot; (p. 277)  But, it is hard to see how such an explanation explains anything.  When there is a scarcity, perhaps it is the other way around: creatures then become even cleverer at finding what they need.<br />I wish I had more space to talk about the rest of this excellent book and to point to the many fine observations made by Burger and to celebrate the 99% of his book which is wonderful and a delight to read.  I have cited his idea that war is what has swelled our brains (see p. 211).  That argument alone is worth the price of the book, but there are many others, including a devastating critique of the possibility of interstellar travel to colonize the galaxy beginning on page 272.  I also liked the many sharp and candid statements that sparkle the text.  Here's one to think about:<br />&quot;Killing members of our own group is murder, but killing members of other groups is the fastest way for a male to gain social prestige.&quot; (p. 215)is is a fine insight.

790756:US	49786731	R3926URZP3WACQ	0385720793	424209838	Copenhagen	Books	5	27	28	N	N	The play and a fascinating postscript	This book contains the text of Michael Frayn's Tony Award-winning play (94 pages), a fascinating 38-page Postscript, and a two-page word sketch of the scientific and historical background to the play.<br />The play itself is brilliant (see my review of the PBS production directed by Howard Davies, starring Stephen Rea, Daniel Craig, and Francesca Annis available on DVD) and is the kind of play that can be fully appreciated simply by reading it.  There are no stage directions, no mention of props or stage business.  There is simply Frayn's extraordinary dialogue.  A photo from the cover suggests how the play might be staged on a round table with the three characters, Danish physicist Niels Bohr, his wife Margrethe, and German physicist Werner Heisenberg, going slowly round and round as in an atom.  This symbolism is intrinsic to the ideas of the play with Bohr seen as the stolid proton at the center and the younger Heisenberg the flighty electron that \\"circles.\\"  Margrethe who brings both common sense and objectivity to the interactions between the ever circling physicists, might be thought of as a neutron, or perhaps she is the photon that illuminates (and deflects ever so slightly) what it touches.<br />At the center of the play (and at the center of our understanding of the world through quantum mechanics) is a fundamental uncertainty.  While Heisenberg and Bohr demonstrated to the world through the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics that there will always be something we cannot in principle know regardless of how fine our measurements, Frayn's play suggests that there will always be some uncertainty about what went on between the two great architects of QM during Heisenberg's celebrated and fateful visit to the Bohr household in occupied Denmark in 1941.  There is uncertainty at the heart of not only our historical tools but at the very heart of human memory (as Frayn explains in the Postscript).<br />\\"The great challenge facing the storyteller and the historian alike is to get inside people's heads...  Even when all the external evidence has been mastered, the only way into the protagonists' heads is through the imagination.  This indeed is the substance of the play.\\" (p. 97)<br />The three characters appear as ghosts of their former selves, as it were, and begin immediately an attempt to unravel and understand what happened in 1941.  The central question is Why did Heisenberg come to Copenhagen?  Was it an attempt to enlist Bohr in a German atomic bomb project?  Was it to get information from Bohr about an Allied project or to pick his brain for ideas on how to make fission work?  Or was it, as Margrethe avers, to \\"show himself off\\"--the little boy grown up, the man who was once part of a defeated country, now triumphant?<br />The play leaves it for us to find an answer, because neither history nor the recorded words of the participants give us anything close to certainty.  With the conflicting statements of the characters Frayn implies that the truth may be a matter of one's point of view, that is, it may be a question of relativity.  Ultimately it may even be that Heisenberg himself did not know why he came to Copenhagen.<br />Also being asked by Frayn's play is a moral question.  Is it right for scientists to build weapons of mass destruction to be used on civilian targets?  Heisenberg contends that this is the question he wanted to ask of Bohr. It is ironic that although Heisenberg was condemned by physicists around the world for his (presumed) unsuccessful attempt to build a fission bomb for Hitler, his work killed no one, while the universally beloved and admired Bohr had a hand in the Manhattan project that resulted in the bombs that were dropped on the Japanese cities.<br />As the electron is seen and then not seen, its speed measured and then not measured, but never both at the same time, so it is with Heisenberg's character in life and in this play.  We are never sure where he is.  Is he working forthe Nazis or is he only pretending to?  Is he working on a reactor or is he working on a bomb?  Did he delay the German project intentionally (as he claimed), or was the failure due to incompetence, or even--as Frayn suggests--to an unconscious quirk of Heisenberg's mind?<br />In the Postscript Frayn recalls the historical evidence he used in constructing the play and cites his sources and gives us insights into what Bohr and Heisenberg were like.  He quotes Max Born, describing Heisenberg as having an \\"unbelievable quickness and precision of understanding,\\" while \\"the most characteristic property\\" of Bohr, as described by George Gamow, \\"was the slowness of his thinking and comprehension.\\"  One can see where Frayn got his metaphor of the atom with its heavy nucleus and its speedy electron.  But Bohr was also thoughtful and thorough while Heisenberg was \\"careless with numbers.\\"  And of course these are relative terms since both men were Nobel Prize-winning physicists, brilliant men who reached the very pinnacle of their profession.<br />Bottom line: one the great plays of our time on an epochal subject, fascinating and cathartic as all great plays should be.the Nazis or is he only pretending to?

798192:US	49786731	R3UW5SELEIDK62	0521535360	120148909	Atkins' Molecules	Books	5	28	30	N	N	Explores the molecule nature of life	This is a popular book on organic chemistry, a celebrated one at that, this being the second edition, substantially revised.  The first was published in 1987.  It is one of those almost legendary books of the publishing history, a technical book on a highly technical subject that somehow managed to reach something close to a large readership.<br />Ironically, the reason is not so much in the drawings of the molecules, but in the text.  Peter Atkins covers a wide range of interesting molecules and shows how they are related, and he makes their properties semi-accessible to the general reader.  I say, &quot;semi&quot; because, frankly for this chemistry-challenged person, seeing two-dimensional shapes of the molecules helps me to understand them only slightly.  I suspect for those more conversant with chemistry, the drawings (new for this edition) will be valuable.  To me, the mystery of why a certain shape and elemental composition should result in a nutritious substance whereas something else with only the slightest change should be poisonous is not dispelled.<br />He begins with &quot;Simple substances,&quot; oxygen molecules, nitrogen, our air and its pollutants.  He ends with the very complex DNA and RNA.  Along the way he enlightens us about so many of the chemicals and foods and consumer products we use in our daily lives from soaps and gasoline to fats and oils, to painkillers and street drugs.  His style is very readable and he has the welcome knack of being informative about interesting things.  Here are some examples:<br />Baking power releases carbon dioxide to leaven baked goods in two separate bursts.  &quot;The first burst occurs at room temperature as a result of the action of the moistened tartaric acid...The second...is due to the action of the aluminum salt, and it occurs at high temperature.&quot;  (p. 24)<br />One of the differences between synthetic and natural vanilla (vanillin) is that the natural is &quot;weakly radioactive,&quot; the former having been made from coal tar, &quot;from which the radioactivity has long decayed,&quot; while the latter picks up some radioactive carbon-14 atoms captured from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. (p. 154)  (Of course natural vanilla is also more expensive.)<br />Lemons originally came from northern India and were introduced into the Mediterranean region about a thousand years ago. (p. 155)<br />&quot;Initially, a young white wine may have a greenish hue from the chlorophyll...molecules that survive fermentation.&quot; (p. 176)<br />Window glass allows UV-A rays to pass through but blocks UV-B rays.  (p. 180)  I had always wondered about this because I had gotten conflicting information from different sources.<br />There's a Glossary and many full color illustrations and photos on glossy paper in addition to the color-coded drawings of the molecules, some of which are very beautiful.  There's an Introduction in which Atkins explains the difference between elements and molecules, between atoms and compounds, and differentiates between the bonds between atoms and the forces that hold molecules together.aving been made from coal tar, &quot;from which the radioactivity has long decayed,&quot; while the latter picks up some radioactive carbon-14 atoms captured from the atmosphere during photosynthesis.

I mean he's a professional writer and he spent a lot of time on Wall Street before and during the bubble years, up close and personal.  And he wasn't a stock broker and he wasn't a trader.  He was an analyst in technology stocks during a time when technology stocks mushroomed up like tulips under the windmills.  A stock analyst studies the industry and the individual companies.  He knows revenues and profits and cash flow and debts and bottom lines.  He's a fundamentalist.  He makes recommendations.  Buy, hold, sell--well, they never actually recommended \\"sell\\" in those days.  Presumably he knows when the price of a stock is out of step with what it's worth.<br />But the bubble years were tough times for fundamentalists since the ducks were quacking and when the ducks quack they say, \\"We don't need no stinkin' fundamentals.  We just buy the dips.\\"<br />At some point Kessler discovered that there's something wrong with this picture.  If a stock analyst knows so much why is he working for Goldman Sacks or Morgan Stanley?  If he knows which stocks are going to go up and which are going to go down, why hasn't he mortgaged the ranch and milked all his relatives for funds and invested in the stocks himself?<br />Here's the answer.  Hold on to your sweet petunias.  As Kessler notes in the very first chapter he's only supposed to get it right 51% of the time, and with a little hedging and ex-post facto double-talk, he can fudge that.  In other words, it's crystal ball time, and rational people don't raid the cookie jar to bet on flips of the coin.<br />Let me tell you what an \\"analyst\\" is called  in Las Vegas.  An analyst is a \\"tout.\\"  That's a \\"Gold Sheet\\" or a \\"Green Sheet\\" sold in liquor stores and bars with a phone number and some stars and exclamation points advertising their monster \\"**Superlock of the Week!!!**\\"  That is, you pay them some money and they tell you which sports team to bet on.  Needless to say, if they really knew who was going to cover the spread that week, they would mortgage the ranch...etc.<br />By the way, one of the problems with Andy's strict fundamentalist approach is that the markets are not entirely rational, which is why there is such a thing as technical analysis, which basically says the trend is your friend, or forget the fundamentals, buy the chart--or more deeply understood, buy the irrational exuberance of the public, which is what most of the people who made money in the go-go nineties did.  A nice little book that explains some of this is Joel Kurtzman's How the Markets Really Work (2002) where he gives his conviction that, \\"Markets may move to the beat of their dumbest members,\\" adding, \\"In my view...markets are not rational.\\"<br />Anyway, at some point (it is clear to me) Andy Kessler realized that although he wasn't the kind of analyst that touts only those stocks that his firm owns or does business with, he was still a Wall Street strawberry.  We can tell he figured this out because somewhere about three-quarters of the way into this very readable and engaging tome, he ups and leaves the comfy confines of Morgan Stanley and a six-figure plus income and begins to do his own investing.  That is, he actually bets on his own picks.  Wow.  Now understand that even here of course he hedges.  He forms his own capital management company; that is to say, he gets people to send him money which become chips that he shoves into the pot on their behalf.  If he wins, hurrah, and if the stocks he likes tank, well, he still gets paid.<br />Kessler's is the latest in a long line of \\"confessional\\" books written by Wall Street people, almost always ex-Wall Street people--e.g., Where Are the Customers' Yachts? (1940) by Fred Schwed Jr.; License to Steal: the Secret World of Wall Street and the Systematic Plundering of the American Investor (1999) by Anonymous and Timothy Harper...etc.  Kessler's book stands out because he was an analyst, not a salesman (i.e., a \\"broker\\"), andbecause he worked with and knew many of the top people on the street and was well-regarded, but was not a top executive.  This is also an interesting personal story of a somewhat geek tech guy (but personable) who was smart enough and eventually hip enough to wow 'em in the presentations, who worked hard enough to be (I'm guessing) right more than half the time.<br />Where his book is not among the best is in what he leaves out.  For some reason Kessler doesn't actually reveal how much he was paid (again I guessed at the six figures plus) or how well the stocks he touted performed, nor is he specific about how well he did with his own portfolio.  We realize when he gets to trading and discovers the market-maker's spread (Where did THAT come from?) that he really had little idea what life was like for the \\"retail people\\" who had to not only buck the spread but, before the rise of Internet trading, pay rather hefty commissions as well--which is why the customers never had any yachts.  But Kessler's reticence is probably just as well since everybody knows that there are two things people consistently lie about: sex and money.  Kessler doesn't mention the former and is vague about the latter.  I tend to respect that.<br />Bottom line: unless you are Jack Grubman, Frank Quattrone, Henry Blodget and some of the other pieces of Wall Street Meat that Kessler writes about who went down with the ship, you will find this an amusing book, a nice diversion from a long, long time ago on which to reflect.

By what grace, I wondered, have we been kept so well by what we have abused for so long.&quot; (p. 95)<br />This expression by science writer and journalism professor Mark Jerome Walters was inspired by a walk in an old growth forest, and is in reference to the planet's ecology.  It is indicative of his reflective and eloquent style.<br />It was thought not so many years ago that we had infectious diseases nearly under control and it would be only a matter of (short) time before they were eliminated as important causes of human morbidity.  How naive such a pronouncement seems today!<br />The six modern &quot;plagues&quot; that Walters writes about are mad cow disease, HIV/AIDS, antibiotic-resistant salmonella, Lyme disease, the four-corners hantavirus, and West Nile virus.  There is an Epilogue in which he discusses SARS and mentions avian flu, which is making headline news today as I write this.  Walters's argument in each of these cases is that these diseases have come to prominence because of something we humans have done.<br />In the case of mad cow disease we have been mixing remnants from slaughtered cows and sheep in with their feed, including brain and nervous tissue parts that contain the prions responsible for the disease.<br />In the case of HIV/AIDS we have been clearing forests in the African jungles, and to feed the loggers have increased the traffic in bushmeat resulting in a commingling of humans and wild simians providing an opportunity for the virus to jump from apes to people.<br />In the case of Salmonella typhimurium DT104, it is our feeding antibiotics to farm animals that has allowed the antibiotic-resistant strain to develop.<br />Lyme disease, Walters argues is the result of our encroachment on forests that have been depleted of their natural variety of species with the result that the mice and deer that harbor the ticks that are the vectors for Lyme disease appear in unnaturally disproportionate numbers especially following seasons of acorn abundance.<br />A similar overabundance of mice in the Southwestern part of the US following El Nino years of heavy rains leads to more mice eating more pine nuts resulting in more human deaths from the hantavirus carried by the mice.<br />In the case of West Nile virus, it is the international traffic in birds that has allowed the virus, native to the Nile River in Egypt to get on planes and come to the US and other places in the world where indigenous mosquitos bite the birds and then bite native species and humans.  Or, it is the mosquitos themselves who catch the planes and travel anywhere in the world, their cache of virus stowed inside their bodies.<br />Walters writes eloquently of these diseases and the tragedies they are causing.  His purpose is to increase public knowledge about what we are doing to the environment and how that disturbance is wrecking havoc with the long establish ecosystems, and--like a tornado among forest litter--is causing pathogens that normally would not come into contact with humans, to literally fly into the air and be presented at our doorsteps.<br />Walters does not include drug-resistant tuberculosis (although he mentions it), which is even more of a threat to human health than some of the diseases above, but if he had, the story would have been similar.  In a world in which a person or a pathogen can get on a plane and be just about anywhere else in the world in a matter of hours is a world in which infectious disease can spread and trade genetic material as if by design.  We are the designers of this morbid mix, nurturing exponentially increased chances for pathogens to mutate into ever more deadly strains while foolishly wasting our antibiotics in support of profit margins for poultry and meat conglomerates.<br />Walters recalls the first waves of epidemic disease that visited humankind beginning with the agricultural revolution some 10,000 years ago, and then howthe trade between the new civilizations ushered in a new wave of epidemics about 2,500 years ago, followed by the horrific spread of disease during the age of exploration following the Columbian voyages.  He now sees us &quot;entering a fourth phase of epidemics, spawned by an unprecedented scale of ecological and social change.&quot; (p. 9)<br />Because Walters writes so well, and because he is such a passionate spokesperson for the fact that we are part of the planet's ecology and not above its logic, and because the next &quot;ecodemic&quot; is just around the corner, this is an important book that deserves a large readership.  Sooner or later, a new strain of a virus or other pathogen is going to attack humans with a virulence to equal or exceed that of any plague of the past.  We may have no defense until the disease has run its course, and so it is prevention that we must depend on.<br />Bottom line: eloquently-written and as timely as the evening news.w the trade between the new civilizations ushered in a new wave of epidemics about 2,500 years ago, followed by the horrific spread of disease during the age of exploration following the Columbian voyages.

821006:US	49786731	R2SKGUNCTZAY2N	0198662750	829162341	The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Works as a history of modern times in soundbites	This is an attractive book and a lot of fun to read.  Just open it anywhere and start reading.  You will be amused.  There are bon mots from sports stars and politicos, from singers and actors, and from just about anybody famous or halfway so, most of them English speaking with a smattering of Europeans thrown in for a bit of haute culture.<br />There are &quot;Special Categories&quot; such as Advertising Slogans, Cartoons (just the tag lines, not the drawings, including one of my favorites by Peter Steiner showing a dog at the keyboard of a computer who says to another dog, &quot;On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog.&quot;  Oh boy, how true that is!), Film Titles, Misquotations, Opening Lines (of novels mostly) including George Orwell's &quot;It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.&quot;  (This, from 1984, is given again under George Orwell.)  There's a Thematic Index, &quot;Computers,&quot; &quot;Fashion,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; etc., and a Keyword Index.<br />Edited by Elizabeth Knowles, who also edits the traditional The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations 5th Ed. (2001), this book might be viewed as a companion to that larger tome.  The layout and the organization are similar, but this book is set in a slightly larger type so it is easier to read, but with fewer words per page.  The significant difference is that Modern Quotations begins in the twentieth century whereas the larger book knows no time constraints.  Consequently, no Karl Marx here, no Charles Darwin, but there is singer Dean Martin who famously observed, &quot;You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.&quot;<br />To be fair, I should note that scientists are also quoted, and a lot of them. Richard Dawkins, Albert Einstein, Edward O. Wilson, Stephen Hawking, Richard Feynman, etc. made the grade.  And philosophers: Bertrand Russell, Eric Hoffer, Gilbert Ryle, W.V.O. Quine, Yogi Berra, etc. as well, although Thomas Kuhn did not.<br />Some people are here but not at their best (at least in my opinion).  For example Satchel Paige reminds us not to look back, &quot;Something might be gaining on you,&quot; which is good, but I would prefer to hear again his advice on the social ramble not being restful.  Or in the case of biologist Edward O. Wilson there is just one entry in which he corrects the old idea that the human brain begins as a tabula rasa, and that is only attributed to him by Tom Wolfe; however I would have preferred something like, &quot;It is exquisitely human to make spiritual commitments that are absolute to the very moment they are broken&quot; or  &quot;When the gods are served, the Darwinian fitness of the members of the tribe is the ultimate if unrecognized beneficiary&quot;--both from On Human Nature (1978).<br />There is of course a noticeable Brit bias to the selections, especially in the sense that minor British politicians appear but we are spared those of the American sort.  In truth, the publishers have a good eye for the English language marketplace and include a number of quotes from Canadians, Indians and Australians.<br />The question arises, if you have the larger, more general Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, should you buy this book?  To answer this I compared the number of 20th-century quotations from the larger book with those in this book and found that not only are there a lot more, many of the people quoted are given additional space and sometimes different expressions.  In only one case did I find a 20th-century person that appeared in the larger book left out in this one (actress Michelle Pfeiffer who wasn't saying much anyway).  On the other hand, Sylvia Plath was cut from ten to eight quotations.  But then again Norman Mailer went from four to six.<br />Sometimes there is an improvement in clarity in this volume.  Gilbert Ryle is quoting as writing &quot;The dogma of the Ghost in the Machine.&quot;  In the larger book this is tagged with the words, &quot;on the mental-conduct concepts of Descartes.&quot;  With no Descartes to cross-reference here, we find the very sensible, &quot;the mind viewed as distinct from the body.&quot;<br />Although Editor Elizabeth Knowles does not say so in so many words in her brief Introduction, the criteria for inclusion is not just having said something pithy and striking or funny and penetrating, or even something at all witty.  Instead what really counts is that you are or have been famous for at least fifteen minutes (Andy Warhol).  So the way to look at a book like this is to take it as a soundbite history of modern times.<br />Bottom line: buy this because it really is an interesting way to view the modern era, and besides the quotables from the likes of, e.g., Johnny Rotten (&quot;We're so pretty, oh so pretty, we're vacant&quot;) and the Spice Girls (&quot;tell me what you really, really want&quot;) are not likely to make the next edition, and because it is what people say, in what context, while being who they are, in reference to some event, that really spells out what it was like to be alive in the twentieth century.tal-conduct concepts of Descartes.&quot;  With no Descartes to cross-reference here, we find the very sensible, &quot;the mind viewed as distinct from the body.&quot;<br />Although Editor Elizabeth Knowles does not say so in so many words in her brief Introduction, the criteria for inclusion is not just having said something pithy and striking or funny and penetrating, or even something at all witty.

825356:US	49786731	R3IUYGPP6U81AK	030908881X	311025799	The Anthrax Letters: A Medical Detective Story	Books	4	14	15	N	N	In-depth report that questions the FBI profile	This is the second book I've read on the anthrax attack.  The first, The Killer Strain: Anthrax and a Government Exposed (2003) by Washington Post journalist Marilyn W. Thompson is a good book (with a different emphasis), but this is a better one.  Written by Rutgers University Professor Leonard A. Cole, who is an expert on bioterrorism, The Anthrax Letters is both more extensive and goes into greater depth than Thompson's book.<br />Perhaps the most important thing (from my point of view) that Professor Cole does is argue convincingly against the FBI's disaffected loner theory of who did it.  Instead Cole presents a lot of evidence that strongly suggests that Al Qaeda may indeed have been responsible.<br />First of all, the leading suspect, Attorney General John Ashcroft's &quot;person of interest,&quot; Steven Hatfill, actually had an alibi.  He was working in another state at the time some of  the letters were mailed in Trenton, New Jersey.  More importantly though, Cole sees a link between Iraq's known bioweapons program and Al Qaeda; he believes that the Ames anthrax strain in the Daschle letter was possibly purified and concentrated by &quot;the Iraqi BW team.&quot; (p. 201)<br />Furthermore the fact that there were at least two types of &quot;weapons&quot; sent by mail suggests more than a lone perpetrator.  Additionally, the mystery of why the tabloid people in Florida were targeted (and indeed how they became targets) is explained when one learns that two of the suspected 9/11 hijackers rented an apartment from Gloria Irish, the wife of Mike Irish, editor of the Sun tabloid, an American Media Inc. publication.  One of the men, Marwan Akl-Shehhi, told her that he was a pilot and was taking flying lessons. (p. 42)  And it is not to be forgotten that the Al Qaeda suspects were interested in learning to fly crop dusters.  That alone makes it clear that they expected to have access to and intended to use either chemical or biological weapons.  Finally, there is the unsettling fact that one of the hijackers was actually treated for a black lesion on his leg that could very well have been cutaneous anthrax.<br />Cole also suggests that it was no coincidence that the anthrax attacks began less than a month after September 11, 2001.<br />To all of this I would add the fact that the Bush administration has become entirely mute on this question, which may suggest that they know who did it but for reasons unknown to us are not telling.  What could those reasons be?  Originally I thought it was because the FBI had bungled the evidence and didn't have enough left to stand up in court, or that something about the perp or information he or she had would be embarrassing to the government.  Now I think it is possible that Al Qaeda was indeed responsible but the Bush administration won't acknowledge that because it would have to reveal secret information about our counter-terrorism program, and also possibly because such information may work into the hands of Al Qaeda's desire to psychologically terrorize the US population.<br />Another interesting point that Cole brings up is the question of exactly how many cases of anthrax illness were caused by the mailed spores.  He reports that there were eleven confirmed cases with five deaths.  However, as noted in the final chapter, there is a twelfth case that the CDC would not confirm, that of postal inspector William Paliscak who had inhaled dust in which there were spores, and who had anthrax spores on his clothing and in his car.  The problem is that the CDC was not able to culture anthrax from blood samples taken from Paliscak.  Cole speculates that Paliscak and possibly others at the Brentwood postal facility did indeed contract anthrax, asking, &quot;Could bacilli have been embedded in the brains of Bill Paliscak and others who were exposed to spores...?&quot;  He adds that there were eight deaths at Brentwood in the year following the anthrax attack when usually there are only two a year.  Four of the people who died had inexplicably enlarged hearts. (p. 237)<br />Also significant is Cole's point that what we learned from the attacks is that we are not nearly as well prepared as we thought, and that the use of the postal service as a means of disseminating a bioterrorist weapon was greatly underrated.  What was not realized prior to these attacks was that anthrax spores in the size of about three microns would easily slip through the 20-micron pores in a typical envelope resulting in cross-contamination of the mail.  The two women, Kathy Nguyen and Ottilie Lundgren, who died of inhalation anthrax even though spores were never found in their homes or in their mailboxes, were probably the victims of cross-contamination.  Cole posits that by the time the mailboxes were swabbed the spores had dissipated.  In support of this idea Cole quotes Harvard microbiologist Matthew Meselson as saying, &quot;a single organism [of anthrax] has a chance of initiating infection.&quot; (p.110)<br />This raises the question of how many other people died because of their exposure to the bacterium, cases that were either not reported or unrecognized as anthrax killings.<br />This leaves me with an idea.  Cole reports that how the perps got the very, very fine and slippery weapons-grade anthrax spores into the envelops without getting some into the air and eventually into their lungs is not known.  With Al Qaeda's complete disregard for human life, they may not have warned their operatives of the dangers.  Perhaps the FBI ought to look for some dead Al Qaeda operatives in the US and double-check the cause of death.ar.  Four of the people who died had inexplicably enlarged hearts.

Seife sees Hubble's discovery as &quot;The Second Cosmological Revolution.&quot;  In Chapter Four we learn, thanks in part to the Hubble Space Telescope,  that the Hubble constant is not so constant after all and is indeed larger today than it was in the past.  Conclusion: the universe is not only expanding, but is accelerating in its expansion.  Seife calls this &quot;The Third Cosmological Revolution.&quot;  The chapter is subtitled, &quot;The Universe Amok.&quot;<br />Maybe the universe is indeed running amok, or maybe it's the astrophysicists and cosmologists themselves who are possessed.  Too much data too soon may have untoward consequences, especially when one is feeling about in the dark with limited instruments focused on an immensity perhaps beyond human comprehension.<br />First there is the problem of the so-called dark matter.  With the curvature of the universe at one, meaning that it will expand forever and eventually after many an eon die a cold and lonely death, there will be no big crunch, no bounce, and no time reversal.  This is okay.  However, when cosmologists go looking for the correct amount of matter and energy to support this flat curvature they come up a little short.  About ninety percent short, in fact.  In other words nearly all that there is, is not only invisible to our perception, it is completely mysterious except that it does indeed influence gravitationally the rest of the stuff in the universe.  As Seife explains, the stars in a galaxy as they rotate around the galactic center are not moving in concert with Newtonian (or Einsteinian) motion; instead the stars furthest from the center are moving at about the same speed as those near the center, an impossibility.<br />What to do about this?  Cosmologists have postulated some &quot;dark matter&quot; surrounding galaxies like a halo.  With just the right amount of dark matter (again approximately a whopping nine times that observed) the speed of the stars is nicely accounted for.  There is another solution: reject Newtonian/Einsteinian dynamics.  That (as radical an idea as one would like to entertain) has been tried and, as Seife notes, it has failed. (See p. 100)  Furthermore, as Seife observes in &quot;Darker Still&quot; (Chapter 7), this invisible stuff cannot be all ordinary (baryonic) matter.  It has to be of some &quot;exotic&quot; variety that we can't identify.<br />Okay, let's put the dark matter conundrum on hold and look at the next problem: something from nothing.  It appears that, due to the uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics, there is no such thing as nothing.  That is, matter is probabilistically jumping in and out of existence down near the Planck level in the &quot;foam&quot; regardless of how complete the vacuum.  Indeed, some theorists have imagined whole universes popping randomly out of...what?  It would appear that underneath, beneath, inside of--what?--there is, like an unfelt cauldron beneath our feet or inside the very fabric of space/time, something unimaginably immense and/or unimaginably tiny.<br />This &quot;zero point energy&quot; is now being postulated as the source of Einstein's cosmological constant (lambda) that is expanding the universe.  Lambda was once thought to be an error; now &quot;omega sub lambda&quot; is thought to equal 65% of the matter/energy in the universe.  Hello!<br />Seife's book suffers from that familiar plague on the house of popular science writers: trying to explain mathematical ideas without using mathematics, and trying to explain particle physics and quantum mechanics to people who haven't been trained in those sciences.  One must rely on analogy and metaphor.  Naturally using such devices things can make things even fuzzier than they already are.  Also there is some inexactness in Seife's expression employed for what he calls &quot;the sake of clarity.&quot;<br />Sometimes Seife's metaphors reduce to something close to meaningless, as in his ice cream-flavor-slurping hydrogen atoms from page 179.  Such metaphors can send chills down the spine of some scientists, and they can mislead.  A slightly different example is his statement that &quot;the Heisenberg uncertainty principle forces nature to create and destroy...particles that appear out of nowhere...in the deepest vacuum.&quot; (p. 185)  Not to disparage the uncertainty principle, but it is &quot;nature&quot; that is doing the forcing and not the other way around.  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a way of explaining to ourselves what is observed (or not observed, as the case may be).<br />At other times Seife leaps from the uncertainty of a strained metaphor to runaway dramatics, as on page 183 where we find this: &quot;once scientists figure out what &lt;lambda&gt; really is, they will have unraveled the deepest mystery in physics today...[they will] understand...[what] drove the big bang itself...They will see beyond even the era of the quark-gluon plasma...to a time when the quantum vacuum held the fate of the universe in its grasp.&quot;<br />As for Seife's several attempts at witticism, I will give him a Cheshire cat's smile and applause to extend for the entire half-life of a virtual particle in the foam of space.<br />Okay, okay.  Writing science that is both fair to the science and explicable to nonscientists is no easy task.  I don't think Seife is as successful here as he was in &quot;Zero,&quot; especially because the writing gets a little beclouded in the latter parts of the book but also because I have the sense that Seife is not as comfortable with physics as he is with mathematics.  What is clear is just how removed even well-educated and knowledgeable laypersons are from the cutting edge of physics.  Still this is an attractive book that added to my knowledge of cosmology.h devices things can make things even fuzzier than they already are.

844757:US	49786731	R1XRA28DHD042S	0871136643	331588213	The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition into the Forces of History	Books	4	57	64	N	N	Compelling analysis of why we kill each other	Howard Bloom's central thesis here is that nation states, tribes, and other human conglomerates are &quot;superorganisms&quot; held together by memes, that is to say, shared ideas.  From this he has it follow that it is the health of the superorganism that counts and not the individual.  Individuals are likened to the cells of a larger body.  They are expendable, and indeed programed to die in order to serve the collective good.  The Lucifer Principle itself is our commitment to savagery as the way to settle differences.<br />This is an old and hoary thesis familiar to all who have studied history, and it is from history that Bloom garners his most impressive evidence.  He recalls a litany of genocides and murders from the brutal campaigns of the Roman empire through the Crusades and the conquest of the Americas to the Saddam Husseins, the Ayatollahs, and Pol Pots of today.  He also draws on evidence from biology, citing the murderous tendencies of apes and the automatic homicides of ants and other social insects.  He goes to great lengths to show that the pecking orders in chickens and rats are similar to those in humans and that when these orders are disturbed or unsettled, violence of the most savage sort ensues.  In the end he proposes a pecking order of superorganisms, and using this metaphor, attempts to explain why various nations and religions have to this very day slaughtered one another.  Along the way he warns us to remain strong militarily and economically against the barbarians at the gate.<br />What sets The Lucifer Principle apart from other books with a similar message is Bloom's stark and engaging style and the unrelenting flood of evidence he presents festooned with 782 footnotes and a 40-page bibliography.  I've never read a book that makes the assertion that people are animals as thoroughly as Bloom does here.  You've heard the mantra: people are animals, but what Bloom does is make sure you realize it's true.<br />Well, it is true.  But so what?  We are domesticated animals (we domesticate ourselves), and with the right governance we may yet control the awful savagery that has always plagued humankind.  We are nowhere near to doing that now, but extrapolating from the experience of the United States itself, in which a diverse people continue to live without the tribal wars that infect other parts of the world, it might be seen that the rule of law (a &quot;meme,&quot; if you will, in competition with the rule of might) will eventually prove triumphant.  Even though the culture of the Bible Belt is very different from that of California or New York, there is no chance that the one will be invading the others.<br />What Bloom is writing about, then, is the tribal imperative under what I call the War System.  His &quot;superorganism&quot; is just a metaphor for a large and powerful tribe, a nation state, a religion, a culture.  Those who complain this is not &quot;scientific&quot; are correct.  Bloom is writing history, sociology and political science.  These are disciplines in which one does not &quot;prove&quot; assertions in a scientific sense but instead points to a preponderance of evidence.  I think he's done a good job in hanging the murderer sign around our necks, but I don't think humans are as completely sown into the fabric of the superorganism as he thinks.<br />Bloom allows himself to get carried away by the felicitous logic of his metaphors (memes as the genes of cultural evolution; human organizations as organisms) to the point where he forgets they are just metaphors; that is, handy ways of talking, but not scientific fact.  While some people are driven primarily by their emotions and the mesmerizing mentality of the herd, other people are able to live out their lives in relative peace and harmony.  Bloom's intense concentration on the violence in human beings blinds him to the fact that, even though history is strewn with vile heaps of human carnage, the vast majority of people have killed noone and are just trying to make a living.  My belief is that the War System is on its last legs, and I mean that in a historical sense.  I will not live to see its demise, nor will my grandchildren, but perhaps their grandchildren will.<br />Furthermore, there are powerful forces of change working in the world today from microbiology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, etc., not to mention globalization, lead by the vested interests in the developed world.  These forces are changing humans and human culture so quickly that perhaps in a few generations we will be very different from what we are today, and will have no use for &quot;The Lucifer Principle.&quot;<br />Aside from his overriding thesis, Bloom presents a number of compelling ideas, one of which is that &quot;Contrary to contemporary theory, evolution is not built solely on competition between self-interested loners.  It also relies on contests between teams of individuals striving for group survival.&quot;  He believes that group selection explains &quot;self-destruct mechanisms&quot; within individuals. (p. 70)  Another is that when people experience prosperity the level of violence increases.  He gives some examples of this phenomena beginning on page 258 and explains it through an increase in testosterone in the newly prosperous.  The really downtrodden, he avers, stay that way and have low testosterone levels.<br />Finally I must point to his prescient (this was written in the early 90s) and compelling analysis of the situation in the Middle East where the tribal mentality still reigns supreme and where most of its inhabitants are under the spell of what Bloom calls a &quot;killer culture.&quot;  His indictment of Islam and the Arab mentality goes a long way toward explaining 9/11 and the terrorist mind set.  He quotes Nobel Prize-winning novelist Elias Canetti who called Islam &quot;a killer religion, literally &lt;a religion of War.&gt;&quot; (p. 225)  He supports his indictment with some rather astonishing quotes from Yasar Arafat and  the late Ayatollah Khomeini.one and are just trying to make a living.

Waldbauer manages to be fascinating, as indeed, I think an entomologist ought to be, since insects really are something amazing, as well as thorough, but never boring or tedious.  He has that rare gift of being able to present the reader with a lot of information and to make it clear, interesting, and a pleasure to read.  One is left with the overwhelming conviction that without bugs we humans could not exist, period.  Next to microbial life, bugs form the most fundamental life force on this planet, and like the microbes, they will be here long after we are gone.  We need to make our peace with them, and join with them in keeping the planet's life in balance.<br />The subtitle, &quot;Insects in the Web of Life,&quot; really says what this book is about as well as it can be said in just a few words: all life forms are interconnected and interdependent and part of the larger web of life.  It isn't just the pollination of our plants by insects that is irreplaceable, nor their control of one another, nor their policing of the landscape, nor even their position near the base of the entire food chain that serves us, but it is their gigantic presence in nearly all the diverse ecologies of the planet that cannot be replaced.  Remove the insects and the entire eco-structure collapses.  Demonstrating this truth, Waldbauer's text emphasizes how bugs interact especially with plants, how plants take advantage of them as well as how they take advantage of plants for subsistence and reproduction, and how in many cases a symbiosis has been reached so that plant and animal work together for their mutual good.  The stories of ants protecting trees and of wasps and bees and others pollinating plants are marvelous tales of intricate mutualisms honed by nature over the eons, tales so startling as to defy belief, except that we know they are true.  An orchid shaped like female insect, giving off the female pheromone so as to entice the male insect to &quot;mate&quot; in order to spread the plant's pollen, is one example.  The nutritious elaisomes that grow on the seeds of plants that attract and feed ants so that they might distribute the plant's seeds and even protect the plant from predators, is another.  The ants that live on acacias that can actually smell large animals (including humans) and thereby congregate on the branches nearest the approaching animal ready to swarm and bite should the animal dare to touch the tree, is still another.<br />Waldbauer shows us what bugs and their stories can teach us about the nature of life itself--what life is truly like beyond the artificial confines of human culture--and not so incidentally, about ourselves, if we care to recognize the many affinities between our lives, especially our economic lives, and that of bugs, most notably of course the social insects who herd animals, plant crops and harvest them, who fight battles and construct dwellings.<br />I could go on and on, but just let me say that this is the most informative book on bugs that I have ever read (and I've read dozens) and one of the most readable.  Moreover it is beautifully designed (by Marianne Perlak) and beautifully edited (by Nancy Clemente).  The black, white and gray illustrations of bugs and plants by Meredith Waterstraat are elegant and serve as a fine complement to the text.  This book should win some awards.  It is the kind of book you might want to buy for yourself and to give as a present to anyone interested in nature from gardeners to professors of biology.

855996:US	49786731	R30BPIDSL1XMSO	1862075123	781416342	Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals	Books	4	26	36	N	N	Existential postmodernism	London School of Economics Professor John Gray's technique in this original and at times delightfully self-indulgent tome of shock jock philosophy works like this: Throw out a statement--the more it sounds like conventional wisdom the better--and then declare that it's a fantasy or the truth is just the opposite.  Occasionally the juxtaposition is so startling that we take delight.  At other times it reads like adolescent sophistry.<br /><br />But no matter.  (And besides who am I to know the difference?)  Run the sound bites down the page and onto the next and keep them coming and, like monkeys hitting typewriter keys, sooner or later something is bound to be...well, not true but at least arresting.  And contradict yourself.  A lot.  After all isn't existence itself a contradiction, or at least an absurdity?  Why, pray tell, is there anything at all?  Why isn't there nothing?<br /><br />Gray doesn't ask this particular question.  In fact he doesn't really ask questions so much as make assertions.  What Gray has done here is write the quintessential Internet-Age book.  His assertions are like those found on the World Wide Web: they run the gauntlet from the patently absurd to the obvious.  And only we can decide which is which and which is in-between.  There is no central authority or assumed rationality to guide us.  Gray lets the chips fall where they may and he doesn't look back.<br /><br />Let me begin with one of his statements that is true, or I should say, one that I agree with:<br /><br />\\"The authority of science comes from the power it gives humans over their environment...To think of science as the search for truth is to renew a mystical faith...\\" (p. 20)<br /><br />And now one that I disagree with:<br /><br />\\"Death brings to everyone the peace the Buddha promised after lifetimes of striving...Buddhism is a quest for mortality.\\" (p. 129)  Actually the Buddha taught us how to live.  His point is that we are always alive.  That's what the symbolism of reincarnation means.  We may achieve peace when we contemplate our demise, but when we're actually dead we experience neither peace nor its opposite nor anything at all.  Death does not bring peace, but the anticipation may.<br /><br />And here's one that startles, but like Chinese fast food, leaves one a few minutes later, dissatisfied--or its heady cynicism reverberates, like too much beer, perhaps: \\"The examined life may not be worth living.\\"<br /><br />Instead of acknowledging sources individually, Gray provides titles in the back of the book, organized by chapter, for further reading.  For example he writes, \\"The human mind serves evolutionary success, not truth.\\" (p. 26)  This is by paraphrase from biologist Edward O. Wilson, although Gray does not acknowledge the source directly.  There are no footnotes.  Gray quotes and paraphrases as he sees fit.  The subchapters, \\"The Poverty of Consciousness\\" and \\"Lord Jim's Jump\\" provide another example.  The central idea presented, that our consciousness is just a highly reduced and after the fact construction of what we experience, comes from Benjamin Libet, who discovered the half-second gap between our experience and our awareness, filtered through works by Tor Norretranders and Antonio Damasio.<br /><br />But this is okay.  This is a popular book aimed at a general readership.  What is original is Gray's treatment and his tone.<br /><br />I think the weakest part of the book is in his misunderstanding of the purpose and goal of meditation and the Eastern interpretation of life.  Gray writes: \\"The dissolution of self that mystics seek comes only with death.\\" (p. 78)  But what the mystic seeks is not dissolution of self, but an isolation of the true self from the contamination and distractions of society, from a self created and maintained by conditioning.  Gray is closer to the truth when he writes that meditative states \\"are ways of bypassing self-awareness\\" (p. 62)--that is, the self-awareness created by the socialization process.  Indeed even the self-awareness created by biological evolution (which has its own agenda, of course) must be bypassed.<br /><br />Occasionally, Gray has the wrong emphasis.  For example, he writes that \\"Nearly everything that is most important in our lives is unchosen.\\"  He gives as examples, the \\"time and place\\" of our birth, \\"our parents,\\" and \\"the first language we speak,\\" noting that they are ours by chance not by choice. (p. 109-110)  But these things are arbitrary and in essence the same for everyone.  What is really important is how we live, not what our name is.  Whether we can choose how we live is another matter, of course.  Since Gray makes it clear that humans are not, and cannot be, masters of their own destiny any more than other animals can, it's clear that he believes we cannot choose how to live--although I suspect he makes such choices, or acts as though he does, in his everyday life.<br /><br />Sometimes in his haste to be alarming Gray is just plain wrong, as when he avers that \\"Modern science triumphed over its adversaries...\\" because its \\"founders were more skillful\\" at \\"rhetoric and the arts of politics.\\" (p. 21) But what allowed science to triumph against the church and the tribe was its superior results.  Only concrete results in the form of superior goods and services, and especially in the form of superior weapons and armaments, could defeat the tribal mind and the dictatorial clerics.<br /><br />In closing here are some catchy and felicitous sound bites to give you a feel for Gray's style:<br /><br />\\"Homo rapiens\\" (from page 151 and elsewhere: note the long \\"a\\").<br /><br />\\"The middle class is a luxury capitalism can no longer afford.\\" (p. 161)<br /><br />\\"Social democracy has been replaced by an oligarchy of the rich...\\" (p. 162)<br /><br />\\"A hypermodern economy has arisen from the ashes of the Soviet state - a mafia-based anarcho-capitalism that is expanding throughout the West.\\" (p. 179)<br /><br />Bottom line: definitely worth reading but with a grain of salt.ich has its own agenda, of course) must be bypassed.

Spinosa's demolition of Descartes' mind/body duality is the thread that Damasio takes up and weaves into this graceful and agreeable narrative.  Furthermore, it is Spinosa's recognition that we are part of, and contained within, nature and not materially different from nature (another of Descartes' errors) that attracts Damasio's admiration for Spinosa.<br /><br />Leaving aside this framing device I want to concentrate on Damasio's argument about the nature of humans based on his experience as a neurobiologist, which is really the core of this book.<br /><br />Damasio recognizes that feelings, like consciousness itself, are perceptions, not states of mind.  What is being perceived is the state of the body itself, and what is doing the perceiving is the brain.  In this understanding--and I think it is a felicitous one--the brain operates as a sixth sense, something like the so-called third eye of the Hindus.  It is not, of course, a supernatural sixth sense, but a sense organ in addition to the other five whose job it is to perceive the homeostasis of the organism, a sense organ that looks within instead of without.  Instead of the sensation of color or sound, the sixth sense perceives emotions.<br /><br />Of course the Van Allen Distinguished Professor of Neurology at the University of Iowa Medical Center does not use such a term as \\"sixth sense\\" nor would he allude to the third eye of the Hindus.  He is a neurologist, a scientist and (despite his demurral) a philosopher.  I mention these other ways of \\"knowing\\" in an attempt to provide a larger context for Damasio's argument.<br /><br />This argument is not original with Damasio (and I don't think he would claim it is).  In one sense it is derivative from the growing understanding that consciousness itself, a kind of meta-awareness, is actually a perception.  Damasio's \\"feelings\\" are part of this consciousness.<br /><br />A further part of Damasio's argument is that emotions are prior to feelings.  First there is an emotionally competent stimulus (ECS).  Then there is an \\"appraisal\\" of that stimulus which results in appropriate and automatic emotion, followed by feelings based on a perception of the emotion and the external situation.  This is on-going, and we usually don't notice it.  In extreme cases, such as danger, our feelings are more pronounced.  In Damasio's scheme, an ECS might be a grizzly bear come upon suddenly while hiking.  The \\"appraisal\\" would be the recognition that this is a bear, that it is big and it is potentially dangerous.  The \\"emotion\\" would be all the systemic glandular, chemical and muscular responses in preparation for the flight or fight response.  The \\"feeling\\" itself would be what we call fear.<br /><br />Damasio attempts to explain the experience of feelings in anticipation of \\"naysayers\\" who contend that such things are eternal mysteries.  He makes a distinction between what, say, a Boeing 777 with all its sensing devices might \\"feel\\" and how humans feel.  The crux of Damasio's distinction is the enormously greater complexity of the biological organism.  But this argument, beginning on page 126, is not satisfactory because it does not explain the subjective experience of pain, which is what the \\"naysayers\\" are really talking about.<br /><br />What I think Damasio should say is that we can never know what the Boeing 777 is feeling (or if it is \\"feeling\\") since feelings are subjective experiences.  They can only be recognized in ourselves (if we have them) and identified with in the report of others.  It is the same as trying to explain what the color red looks like to a blind person or how strawberries taste to someone who has never tasted one.  Analogies and comparisons may be drawn, but there is no way that I can ever be sure that I feel what you feel or that the subjective nature ofany sensuous experience between one entity and another is the same.<br /><br />In the fourth chapter, \\"Ever Since Feelings,\\" Damasio attempts to account for how feelings arose in an evolutionary sense.  He believes they help complex organisms solve complex problems. (p. 177)  \\"Body-state maps\\" work automatically for most organisms, but, Damasio argues, with emotions made conscious through the experience of feeling, humans are able to achieve not only a \\"concern for the individual self\\" but with \\"sufficient integration of the now, the past, and the anticipated future\\" a more effective game plan for survival and well-being. (p. 178)  Feelings signal the conscious mind to become involved and this has proven adaptive.<br /><br />What I think is profound about this argument is how naturally it would have arisen from the evolutionary experience.  Before humans and other sophisticated animals arose, most creatures probably made little or no distinction between themselves and their environment.  Their responses were mostly automatic and they had no sense of self.  Along comes this great leap forward called consciousness and it works because it makes us more effective at protecting ourselves.  It also makes us more fearful of death, of course, which is part of the human predicament.<br /><br />Despite some difficulties, I am very much impressed with Damasio's effort, and I think that his approach from neuroscience and biological evolution, and through the use of scientific experiment, is eons ahead of the old schools in psychology which attempted to understand human beings based on arbitrary models such as psychoanalytic theory or on limited approaches such as behaviorism.  But it must be realized (as I'm sure Damasio does) that we are at a tentative stage of understanding.  Some even say that we will never be able to completely understand how our brain works.  Some even cite Russell's paradox and Godel's proof about the limitations of self-referential systems (the brain/body is such a system) and deny that it is even theoretically possible for us to completely understand ourselves.  Maybe only our artifacts, our computers will be able to understand us.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"any sensuous experience between one entity and another is the same.<br /><br />In the fourth chapter, \\"Ever Since Feelings,\\" Damasio attempts to account for how feelings arose in an evolutionary sense.

We are domesticated animals; and it is said that domesticated animals are not as smart as the wild kind.  We domesticate ourselves.  We become more docile, more amendable to being controlled.  We opt for security and creature comforts in lieu of freedom and privacy.  We are settling gently into the &quot;Soft Cage&quot; of our eventual imprisonment.<br />Or are we?  I have a feeling that by the time we realize what is going on, it will be too late.  As Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems, famously said in 1999 (quoted on page 91): &quot;You already have zero privacy.  Get over it.&quot;<br />After learning about the growing transparency of our lives, the question is, do we care?  Should we care?  Journalist and sociologist Christian Parenti believes that we should.  He believes that the dossiers being gathered on us by business and government will be used against us.<br />He begins with an introductory chapter on &quot;Life in the Glass Box&quot; in which he sets forth his view on the situation today.  He makes the subtle and excruciating point that it is the accumulation of surveillance, from Closed Circuit TVs on street corners to cookies on our computers to satellites in the sky to microchips soon to be on our credit cards and even implanted in our bodies, that is insidiously, piece by piece, stealing our privacy.  He calls this &quot;function creep.&quot;  He compares the growth of surveillance to that of advertising and writes, &quot;it is not that this or that ad is so oppressive, but a whole landscape and culture of commercialism most certainly is.&quot; (p. 7)<br />Parenti then goes back to the slave trade days and recounts how slaves were tracked and controlled.  He recalls the beginnings of photography and the use of fingerprints and body measurements to identify criminals and other undesirables.  As he moves toward the present, he examines various aspects of our lives from an historical, a present tense, and a futuristic perspective.<br />For example, he recalls the work and cult of efficiency expert Frederick Winslow Taylor who published The Principles of Scientific Management in 1911.  Parenti then demonstrates, that with the help of cameras, drug tests, lie detectors, computer software, and even Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) surveillance (of truck drivers and others on the road), management has gained even tighter control over employees.  He calls this &quot;The New Taylorism&quot; (Chapter 10).<br />In Chapter 11, &quot;The Benevolent Gaze,&quot; Parenti recounts a history of charities and social workers asserting their control and &quot;guidance&quot; over the poor and the homeless, while in Chapter 12, &quot;The Eye of Justice,&quot; he details how the courts and the police are catching and controlling criminals both inside prison and out.  Again GPS technology allows surveillance of parolees and others doing &quot;street time.&quot;<br />One of his key ideas is &quot;surveillance instills discipline by forcing self-regulation&quot; (p. 9)  For some, especially for employers, this is a good thing.  Even for some wayward individuals, this may be a good thing.  But down such a road lies fascism and a Brave New World of docile citizens.  Parenti writes, &quot;Instead of observation towers, checkpoints...and low-flying black helicopters...the emerging surveillance society is characterized by innocuous passwords, swipe cards, automatic toll lanes, and workplace IDs.  Everywhere we leave digital footprints.&quot; (p. 79)  We become &quot;ultimately more governable.&quot; (p. 82)  Parenti even sees Attorney General John Ashcroft as a &quot;mullah of social control.&quot;(!) (p. 84)<br />Another key idea is that the goal of surveillance is to &quot;internalize&quot; the gaze of the watcher; that is to make us feel that Big Brother is always there and that we dare not do anything untoward.  (See, e.g., pp. 174-175.)<br />Although Parenti is uniformly alarmed, I am less so.  I think we need to realize that someaspects of increased surveillance are clearly positive.  For example, there is nothing draconian about having cameras in public places like busy intersections.  The cameras help regulate traffic and catch speeders and people who run red lights.  Furthermore, the surveillance that some people use to protect their property may reveal an unhealthy level of paranoia, but that's a private concern.

The danger, as Parenti notes, is that government or a conspiracy of powerful interests will use information and their position to control populations in political and economic ways that benefit only the powerful.

One gets the sense that we may rail against the soft cage, or settle into it.  Regardless, it is coming down around us.aspects of increased surveillance are clearly positive.  For example, there is nothing draconian about having cameras in public places like busy intersections.  The cameras help regulate traffic and catch speeders and people who run red lights.  Furthermore, the surveillance that some people use to protect their property may reveal an unhealthy level of paranoia, but that's a private concern.

In the game of \\"Who would you invite to dinner if you could choose anybody?\\" Oxford University Professor Richard Dawkins, author of The Selfish Gene, and other important works on evolution, would be near the top of my list.<br /><br />Not that I agree with everything he says.  Indeed, that is part of the fun.  Dawkins is adamant on some subjects, religion being one of them.  A goodly portion of this book is devoted to letting us know exactly how he feels about the \\"God hypothesis,\\" \\"liberal agnostics,\\" and the so-called miracles recognized by especially the Catholic Church.  The title of Chapter 3.3, \\"The Great Convergence\\" (of science and religion), for example, is used ironically.  He sees no convergence; in fact, he calls such a notion \\"a shallow, empty, hollow, spin-doctored sham.\\" (p. 151)<br /><br />Clearly Dawkins is not a man to mince words.  But his insistence on a restrictive definition of \\"God\\" as \\"a hypothetical being who answers prayers; intervenes to save cancer patients...forgives sin,\\" etc., is really the problem.  He considers the \\"religion\\" attributed to scientists like Einstein, Carl Sagan, Paul Davies and others (and even himself!) to involve a misuse of the term, calling such a definition \\"flabbily elastic\\" and not religion as experienced by \\"the ordinary person in the pew.\\" (p. 147)<br /><br />But what Dawkins is really railing against is the illegitimacy of believing in the supernatural and science at the same time.<br /><br />While I think Dawkins makes a good point with this argument, I think it would be better to make a distinction between fundamentalist religion, which has been, and continues to be, the root cause of much of the horror in the world, and the more progressive varieties which recognize the limitations of the barbaric \\"Bronze-Age God of Battles.\\"  See Chapter 3.5 \\"Time to Stand Up\\" in which Dawkins rightly condemns the hatreds and violent history of the three middle eastern religions.  At the same time I think he needs to realize that it is legitimate to define \\"God\\" as God is defined in, for example, the Vedas; that is, as The Ineffable, which has no attributes, about which nothing can be said.<br /><br />However it is exactly his point that there is no evidence for the God hypothesis and that to partially accept such a notion, or even to be \\"agnostic\\" is to depart from a purely scientific viewpoint.  In this I think the atheistic Dawkins is mistaken.  Absence of proof is not proof of absence, period.  And as far as religion, per se, goes, I would add that not only is religion part of human culture (for better or for worse), but is also part of the so-called \\"extended phenotype\\" of human beings, and not something that is going to be argued away.<br /><br />I also have some reservations about his reasons for not debating with creationists.  He believes that to debate with them gives them a legitimacy they don't deserve.  In Chapter 5.5, he reveals a letter he wrote to Steven Jay Gould expressing such a view.  I don't debate creationists either, but my reason is that creationists don't really debate.  They have already made up their minds and are not capable of being influenced by evidence.  Theirs is purely an exercise in propaganda.  Furthermore, as Dawkins discovered himself (in Chapter 2.3 on the Australian film crew that he allowed into his house for an interview), it is often the case that creationists don't play fair.<br /><br />In Chapter 1.5 \\"Trial by Jury\\" Dawkins presents his reservations about \\"one of the most conspicuously bad good ideas anyone ever had.\\"  I understand his demurral, but would like to point out that juries dispense a social justice; that the tribe makes its decisions based on what it perceives as good for the tribe now,not necessarily what's true in an objective or scientific sense.<br /><br />Interesting enough, Dawkins demonstrates his knowledge of other scientific subjects, including physics, and he does it very well.  I was particularly impressed with his explanation of entropy and how it effects the evolutionary process in Chapter 2.2. (See especially page 85.)  He also does a fine job of elucidating why Lamarckism cannot work without a \\"Darwinian underpinning\\" since there must be a mechanism for selecting between the acquired characteristics that are improvements and those that are not. (p. 90)  Good too is his characterization of genes as constituting \\"a kind of description of the ancestral environments through which those genes have survived.\\"  (p. 113)<br /><br />On his tiff with Gould, Dawkins attempts to make amends by reprinting some semi-gracious and mostly positive reviews of some of Gould's books; however it is obvious that his professional and emotional differences with Gould remain.<br /><br />One of the most important points that Dawkins reaffirms here is his belief that we humans, because of our unique insight into ourselves and our predicament, \\"can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.\\" (p. 11)  What Dawkins means is that we do not have to take biology as destiny or to take Darwinism as a template for our morality--a point often missed by his critics.<br /><br />There is much, much more of interest in this refreshingly personal collection of essays by one of our most original evolutionary thinkers, some of it first rate, and some of it rather ordinary; yet taken in total reveals a lot about Richard Dawkins, scientist, science writer, teacher, and human being that I was pleased to learn.<br /><br />Incidentally, the title is from Charles Darwin who speculated on how such a personage might regard \\"the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low and horridly cruel works of nature.\\" (p. 8)<br /><br />That \\"devil's chaplain\\" here is Richard Dawkins himself who mostly directs his ire toward the stupidities of human beings.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Isnot necessarily what's true in an objective or scientific sense.<br /><br />Interesting enough, Dawkins demonstrates his knowledge of other scientific subjects, including physics, and he does it very well.

Schlosser presents the unembellished facts along with some vivid detail about the growers, the sellers, the law enforcement people, and the politicians.  Reading this reinforces my belief that the \\"new prohibition\\" (not so new anymore of course) is really a full employment program for the law enforcement establishment endorsed by hypocritical social conservatives (Rush Limbaugh would be a fine example) and Christian fundamentalists, most of whom have little idea about what is going on.<br />The second essay, entitled \\"In the Strawberry Fields,\\" is about Mexican laborers in virtual peonage in California, the history of this phenomenon, its politics, its economic consequences, and the reality of today's conditions in the field and across the border.  The endemic political and economic hypocrisy is illustrated by Scholosser's eye-opening observation on why Mexican migrants are routinely rounded up and sent back to Mexican in a kind of (wink, wink) revolving door policy.  When migrants are allowed to settle here and raise their children, the states end up paying for their education and welfare.  However by periodically deporting them we benefit from their cheap labor \\"while Mexico...in effect...[pays] for the education, health care, and retirement of California's farmworkers.\\" (p. 95)<br />The third essay, \\"An Empire of the Obscene\\" is about the pornography business with the focus on porn king Reuben Sturman and his nemesis IRS agent Richard N. Rosfelder, Jr. who finally got Sturman for tax evasion.  Although this is the longest essay in the book (longer than the other two combined), I found it the least interesting.  That Sturman was able to launder and hide his profits off shore in the same manner as drug dealers (and, for example, Enron) was interesting, as was the way Schlosser chronicles how pornography has become such a huge business that it now accounts for a significant part of the revenues of some Fortune 500 companies.<br />Holding the essays together is Schlosser's idea that the private morality of Americans is inconsistent with our public morality, and that the evidence for this is especially compelling in these three domains of the black market economy.  He frames the essays with an introduction called, \\"The Underground,\\" and a postscript named rather hopefully, \\"Out of the Underground.\\"<br />Some highlights:<br />\\"Today approximately three-quarters of all $100 bills circulate outside the United States.\\"  As Schlosser notes, this \\"serves, in essence, as a gigantic interest-free loan\\" from them to us.  (p. 7)  (I just hope that George W. Bush's huge deficients don't lessen the world's love for the Yankee dollar and lead them to adopt the Euro instead.)<br />\\"Import barriers [on marijuana] drove prices high enough to make domestic production extremely profitable,\\" allowing UCLA professor Mark A. R. Kleiman to note that this is \\"a rare instance in which protectionism actually worked.\\"  Schlosser adds, \\"Some American marijuana is now worth more per ounce than gold.\\"  (p. 36)<br />\\"The new mandatory minimum laws [for marijuana possession and trafficking] took...power from the judge and handed it to the prosecutor\\" who could decide who to prosecute and for what. (p. 45)  This results in an uneven application of the law and \\"de facto sentencing by police and prosecutors.\\" (p. 53)  Added to the power the police have because of the forfeiture laws, and one sees that justice in marijuana cases can be anything but.  Schlosser cites an example in Ventura County, California in which drug agents had first obtained an appraisal of a $5-million ranch and then raided it for marijuana cultivation only to find nothing growing there. (p. 62)<br />A further point about the forfeiture laws (which I think are unconstitutional since they are seizures without due process) is that informers may get up to one-quarter of the proceeds.  Schlosser claims that this has resulted in a \\"new business: the buying and selling of drug leads.  Defendants who hope to avoid a lengthy...sentence...can now secretly buy information from vendors on the black market.\\" (pp. 62-63)<br />Recalling that justice Douglas H. Ginsburg (nominated by Reagan) declined nomination to the US Supreme Court \\"after confessing that he smoked marijuana as a young man,\\" Schlosser recalls the McCarthy era's \\"defining political question\\"--Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist party?--with today's question that congressmen and political candidates have to answer: Are you now, or have you ever been, a pot smoker? (p. 49)  On page 51 Schlosser notes however that \\"Legislation to impose drug testing on members of Congress has repeatedly died in committee and never reached the floor for a vote.\\"<br />Finally, Schlosser compares America's attitude toward the drug Viagra with its attitude toward marijuana.  He recalls Bob Dole's TV commercial for Viagra and then notes that \\"Elizabeth Dole, now a US senator from North Carolina, apparently doesn't oppose this sort of recreational drug use.\\"<br />Bottom line: social conservatives will deplore this book, and right wing AM shock jocks will rant against it, while most of the rest of the country will ignore it.  Too bad.  This is a fine piece of work by Schlosser and everyone involved in the project, and an engrossing read.arijuana cultivation only to find nothing growing there.

886252:US	49786731	RPFQJ1VIGIGZI	0595292038	913969936	Last Leg	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A gag-writer's novel	Neophyte novelist and gag writer, Dave Hanson is one very funny dude, especially if you're a suburban teen feeling the first surges of testosterone.  Included among his credits (according to the book's jacket) are stints with Mad TV, the Late Show with David Letterman, Comedy Central, and National Lampoon.  Currently Hanson writes for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.<br />I have to say that this seems right since this novel reads like a spell-checked first draft of some ideas a talented but not very well read twenty-something might have had while sitting at the keyboard dreaming up gags for Mad TV or Jay Leno.<br />Marl Trevicker, the protagonist of this raunchy, one-liner-jammed tale of one-legged sexual angst in the Garden State is a leg man in more ways than one.  But there are a few confusing things going on in his life.  For one thing his wife Evelyn is in California getting her breasts enhanced, although Marl swears he loves her as she is.  For another some bizarro demon is slipping into his house while he's gone and having some very weird fun with the premises.<br />But Marl is not in any dire straits.  After all this is a comedy.  He's got a cushy \\"job\\" with Aspen Air Freshener Corporation with no duties.  The company wants to get rid of him but he has a worker's comp kind of contract prohibiting them from firing him.  True, the mystery burglar is taking some elaborate pains to get our boy's attention, including setting up a Rube Goldberg chicken-beheading machine complete with live chicken, triggered by Marl's trying to push open a door, which sends the chicken dancing around the house, spewing blood for several minutes.  However, the intruder also plays Santa Claus by leaving a new entertainment system apparently as a present.<br />Marl's also got a cat named Vinnie with some legs problems of its own that he carries around with him like a papoose.  The cat's libido somehow got haywired by the vet and now it humps anything and everything within reach, turning all cat-sized objects into gal-pals.  One might say that Vinnie is a sort of Marl Trevicker doppelganger.<br />But the main problem is Marl can't find his artificial leg.  As the novel opens we learn that he got so blindingly drunk the night before that he can't remember what happened, but figures he must have left the leg somewhere, thus sending him off on an odyssey of north Jersey.<br />Quite clearly our boy has a lot of time on his hands and no direction home.  He meets a saucy, leggy, flat-chested P.I. at a bar and figures that she could help him find his lost leg.  He also divines that she might be able to help him with his libido since he can't masturbate because every time he does, something bad happens to somebody.  (This is supposed to be, I guess, a kind of dramatic irony based on the old notion of the sin of self-abuse.)<br />Okay, you got the premise, and I mean if everybody put as much energy into their premises, they'd never get around to writing the rest of it.  Hanson does, however, although to be honest I don't think it matters.  The main problem is there is virtually no dramatic tension so that the only reason we have for turning the pages is to read some more of Hanson's admittedly very clever lines.  He has a plot of course including the dumping of poisons by Aspen into the not so pristine New Jersey rivers, but the plot is not well integrated with character development, and so it also doesn't matter.  There's a bit of a conflict developing between his bosses at Aspen but Hanson is more intent on having Marl exchange wise-cracks with his erstwhile brother Cliff while stumbling through some Jersey dives and eating establishments than he is at character development.  What he does well is vividly depict the young male sex-obsessed mind through over-the-top metaphors and bizarre scenes and scenarios.<br />Here are some examples to give you a feel for the prose:<br />On Rhino the barkeep: \\"his teeth as gray as his bar rag.\\"<br />On making eyes withCranci Glocz, the leggy P.I.: \\"it's also very exciting when someone looks into the Window of Your Soul and they don't mind the view.\\"<br />On being without: \\"Just like you shouldn't go to the supermarket on an empty stomach...you shouldn't make any life decisions with your prostate swollen up and pressing against your brain.\\"<br />His brother on a well-endowed woman: \\"if keisters were brains we'd be talking Nobel Prize.\\"<br />On the hot atmosphere: \\"as thick as a bum's hair.\\"<br />On a pic: \\"Sometimes a still photo reveals a facet of a person...\\" concealed \\"in real life.\\"  (I think he got this one from me, but I don't know how!  Anyway it's true and worth thinking about.)<br />On a couple of bar girls: \\"I felt their eyes gathering on me and settling...like flies on a carcass.\\"<br />Bottom line here is: Dave, take that Famous Writers' course, and DON'T quit your night job.h Cranci Glocz, the leggy P.I.: \\"it's also very exciting when someone looks into the Window of Your Soul and they don't mind the view.\\"<br />On being without: \\"Just like you shouldn't go to the supermarket on an empty stomach...you shouldn't make any life decisions with your prostate swollen up and pressing against your brain.\\"<br />His brother on a well-endowed woman: \\"if keisters were brains we'd be talking Nobel Prize.\\"<br />On the hot atmosphere: \\"as thick as a bum's hair.\\"<br />On a pic: \\"Sometimes a still photo reveals a facet of a person...\\" concealed \\"in real life.\\"  (I think he got this one from me, but I don't know how!

Quite a performance by Jim McManus, and I don't mean only the writing.  For a fancy wordsmith, he is one heck of a poker player.  To come to Las Vegas and play in your first tournament and make it to the final table of the World Series of Poker is one very fine achievement.<br />Jim McManus, 49-year-old novelist, poet, teacher, and sometime journalist on assignment in Las Vegas for Harper's Magazine takes part of his $4,000 retainer and buys into a satellite tournament hoping to win a pass to play in the big one, the $10,000 buy-in no limit hold'em event that annually decides the world championship of poker.  Not coincidentally he is also covering the trial of Sandy Murphy, a saucy, skanky Vegas lap dancer and her linebacker beau Rick Tabish who are accused of the murder of Ted Binion, brother of Becky Behnen, host of the tournament, and one of the sons of Benny Binion, the long time owner of the sponsoring Horseshoe casino.<br />What results is a suberb example of a genre that I call \\"participatory journalism,\\" the sort of thing the made George Plimpton, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson and some other very fine writers famous.  What happens in participatory journalism is the journalist himself joins in the action and becomes part of the story.  Because of McManus's cleverness with the pasteboards (actually they're made of plastic of course), his discipline, and because he did indeed get lucky a time or two on Positively Fifth Street, his experience became more than just part of the story.  As he covers the trial and the World Series of poker from the inside, he focuses intimately--sometimes perhaps too intimately--on himself and what it was like, first person singular, to play the kind of high stakes poker that most of us can only dream about.  And to win.  Not all the marbles but enough of them to pay off the mortgage and, as he says, maybe pay for a semester of college for a daughter in 2016.<br />Reading this book--*living* this book, I might say, because it is such a vivid and engaging romp through some things and a part of the world that I know very well--was an adrenaline pumping and humbling experience for me, poker player and writer myself.  I was dazzled at times by the sheer energy of his prose, at the worldly-wise (and wise-acre) metaphors, references and striking allusions that jump off the page as adroitly expressed and appropriately placed as notes in a symphony--a modern symphony with discordance and harmony splashed out with wild and sardonic energy.  Or maybe I should say, Jim McManus writes like a poet with an ear for the vernacular and an eye for the kill.<br />He begins with an informed imagination on just how handcuffed Ted Binion was \\"burked\\" to death with girlfriend Sandy Murphy naked on his chest and big boy Rick Tabish forcing a turkey baster full of heroin and Xanax down his throat while holding the millionaire's nose shut.  Not a pretty way to die.  Now enter the journalist, perhaps a bit like Jackson Browne's \\"The Pretender,\\" no longer young and strong, in fact a little strung out on pills and booze and cigs, but a forty-nine year-old still in charge of himself, with a second family and some bills to pay, some temptations to resist, some oats to sow, a man torn between the irresponsible machinations of \\"Bad Jim\\" and the socially and domestically appropriate behaviors of \\"Good Jim,\\" a guy who calls his young wife at least once a day while managing to interview nearly naked lap dancers at their place of work on his lap without losing his...composure.<br />But what McManus does best is weave an exciting account of how he played cards, what his opponents were like, how he behaved and covered the stories, and how made the right calls and the right lay downs and especially how he sat on his hands when he needed to and nursed his stack so that was able to arrive, against some very stiff odds and against some very good players, at the final table.  He highlights several of the pivotal pots during his nearly miraculous run by telling us what cards he held, what cards his opponents held, what flopped, what the turn card was, and especially what hit the felt on fifth street.  He gets it all right and crystal clear and he reveals his bad reads and questionable plays as well as his good ones.  He shows the camaraderie and the competition among the players and does it all in such a vivid manner that we feel we are there with him.  Along the way he quotes from Dante and Edward O. Wilson, Dostoevski and Jared Diamond, etc. on human nature past and present.<br />He does get a little self-indulgent at times (although personally I think he has license) and some readers might want to skip the digressions into his youth and flash past some of the mini book reviews and philosophic arias and just stay with the story.  It's one of the best I've ever read and captures a culture, and a time and a place, as only a master of the craft could.of the pivotal pots during his nearly miraculous run by telling us what cards he held, what cards his opponents held, what flopped, what the turn card was, and especially what hit the felt on fifth street.

And one wants to say, it doesn't take the wisdom of Solomon to figure out that you can't always get what you want, or that, for you in particular, and for every other woman in the world, there is no perfect man.<br />In fact, that is what most of the women in this book, writing so articularly, so passionately, so \\"honestly\\" (although at least one had to use a pseudonym, and I don't blame her), came to realize, and to take as part and parcel of the inexplicable bitter sweetness of life.<br />Let me give you a clue (not that I am any Solomon myself, but for what it's worth I have been there and done that from the male point of view): one does NOT (as Lucy from Peanuts once expressed it) go from \\"ups to upper ups\\" in life.  Love and sex and passion and romance are like taking drugs, the more passionate the relationship the harder the fall and the more lasting the pain.  The higher the highs, the lower the lows.  The more fantastic the sex, the worse the rest is likely to be.  Prince Charming only courts Grace Kelly or Jackie O, and believe it, Prince Charming had a fault or two.  And yes, life is unfair.  You will, nine times out of ten, end up doing more around the house and with the children than he will--even if you make more money than he does.<br />Why is this so?  It's not just that men and women are different with different strategies and different needs (although that is true), but because any woman that doesn't do a better job with such things is not an alpha (w)itch to begin with, and certainly is not a woman that most men would want for the long run.  The women who really care quite simply do more, and any man worth the discernment knows that.<br />I liked Hanauer's Introduction in which he lays out just how and why this book came to be.  I especially love the way she and the women who wrote the twenty-six pieces WRITE.  The prose is smart and sharp and knowing, very knowing.  For example, after Hazel McClay (\\"A Man in the Heart\\") writes \\"Sooner or later I'll probably be tempted to cheat\\" she adds, \\"I'm not looking forward to that time.\\"  She has compared the man of her twenties, a man that was passionate and made her passionate, with the man of her thirties, a man she loves who has however \\"never wrapped me in his arms, never...kissed me until I gasped for breath.\\"<br />Hazel McClay is not her real name.  One sees why.  But I suspect there will be some women reading this who would like to remind her of the women in Afghanistan and say, lady, you actually had everything, you just didn't have it all at the same time.  Nobody does.  At least not for long.<br />And there IS a reason that Karen Karbo (\\"Why I Hate That My Mother Was Right...\\") married not \\"horizontally\\" but \\"down.\\"<br />And then there is Hope Edelman (\\"The Myth of Co-Parenting\\"), who also writes with elegance, complaining about the 92-hour weeks her husband put in.  She had won \\"the boyfriend jackpot.  He was beautiful and sexy, and devoted and smart...and he had the kindest green eyes.\\"  And then he became a work alcoholic and simply wasn't there.<br />I'm thinking as I'm reading this, hey, get a new clue: 90-hour weeks mean onlyone thing.  But no, there is not a hint of another woman.  And then I'm thinking, the guy is afraid.  He is scared to death that the passion is going to go or has gone out of his marriage and he is compensating big time.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  And then, when it all gradually goes away and he begins to be home more and Hope Edelman has released \\"the dream of completely equal co-parenting,\\" and all is, relatively speaking, marital bliss, I want to say, there is something you didn't tell us...!<br />But I need to let that go.<br />This is a fascinating book, a page-turner, filled with sharp observations and melancholy truths from some very bright women who learned those truths, or those partial truths, or those elusive truths, or those truths-in-the-making, the only way they can be learned, that is by living them.  And they are very good at sharing.  I came away feeling that, the woman in the house, having come home from work to \\"see a sinkful of dishes\\" and the man on \\"the couch, beer in hand, newspaper spread before him, stereo blaring the Dave Matthews Band\\"--that these two people have learned to live and love and accept the imperfections of one another and of life.one thing.

891812:US	49786731	R2FOXVKY53IFZB	0881925500	512742908	In Praise of Plants	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Technical but wondrously informative	It's always a good sign to see that someone has bothered to translate a science book from another language into English.  Publishers can usually get some English-language scientist to write a tome on the latest discoveries in a more commercially agreeable manner than putting together a translation.  So when the translation appears you know the book is good and/or original in a distinctive way.<br />In Praise of Plants by botany Professor Emeritus Francis Hall&eacute; of the University of Montpellier, France is such a book.  However it is by no means a popular treatise; indeed, if you want to get the look and feel of a botany article in a professional journal, this book provides an entire book's worth!  The material is technical, detailed, and uncompromisingly professional.<br />So why has the Timber Press chosen this volume to bring to the English speaking world?  Partly because of the international prestige of Hall&eacute;, who is an expert on tropical plants; partly because they were able to get a translation by David Lee who is Professor of Biological Sciences at Florida International University; and partly because of the striking nature of Hall&eacute;'s presentation.<br />Hall&eacute; emphasizes the form of plants and how that form has developed evolutionarily from their need to secure the services of both sun and earth while remaining nearly immobile.  There are dozens of line drawings in the book, most by Hall&eacute; himself, illustrating the differences between plants and animals with the text explaining why these differences occur.  For example, because plants are sessile (attached to the ground) they are symmetrical on the horizontal plane, a tree looking pretty much the same from whatever spot on the ground you view it.  However in a vertical sense a plant is very different since its crown is in the air looking at the sun while its roots are in the ground looking for water and minerals.  In contrast, animals (I'll just quote Hall&eacute; so you'll get a feel for the technical language): &quot;have dorsiventral polarity and anteroposterior and bilateral symmetry.&quot; (p. 70)<br />Fortunately the attractive and sometimes funny drawings help to penetrate the language for this amateur!<br />Here are some examples of the sort of things you can learn from this book:<br />At the microscopic level, where gravity is relatively &quot;negligible compared to other forces&quot; like &quot;surface tension, viscosity, friction and Brownian motion,&quot; (p. 64) life forms tend toward the round and take on the symmetries we associate with astronomical objects like the sun and Saturn.  Hall&eacute; gives examples of bacteria, amoebas, diatoms, etc. where &quot;vertical polarity simply does not exist.&quot; (p. 64)  Science fiction writers take note: creatures living in interstellar dust clouds will be more or less round.<br />One of the clear homologies (same form) assumed by plants and animals is in &quot;the external (assimilating) surface of a plant and the internal (digestive) surface of an animal.&quot; (p. 51)  The plant maximizes its surface area to expose as much of it as possible to the sun and the air, while the animal creates folds and such within its alimentary canal so as to provide a large surface area for effective digestion.  Hall&eacute; notes that plants resemble fractals externally. (p. 52)<br />The waste products of animals bring forth (to our sensitivities) malodorous compounds as do their decomposing bodies.  Hall&eacute; explains why this is so on pages 148-151, and why the waste products of plants and their decomposing bodies do not usually offend us; indeed the smell of new mown hay and forest humus or even a compost pile, can be very agreeable.  On page 149 he favors us with a drawing of a tree which grows in part upon the waste products of its metabolism stored in its trunk.  Next to the tree Hall&eacute; has a dog on top of a pile of its excrement, noting that &quot;An animal that stored its excrementwould also be capable of becoming very tall.&quot;<br />Hall&eacute;'s love of plants and his deep respect for them, and his life-long experience in studying them comes through most wonderfully in this fine book.  Although technical, it is accessible to amateur botanists and just plain old gardeners and lovers of plants with just a little effort.é's love of plants and his deep respect for them, and his life-long experience in studying them comes through most wonderfully in this fine book.

894641:US	49786731	R62JI65CQJVMA	1576751678	578761329	The Ultimate Competitive Advantage: Secrets of Continually Developing a More Profitable Business Model	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Don't open the store without it	The central message of this book is that you have to continually reinvent the way you do business in order to stay ahead of the competition.  Mitchell and Coles call this &quot;continuing business model innovation.&quot;  It's very much like the experience of the Red Queen in Alice and Wonderland: you have to keep moving just to stay in the same place, and if you want to get ahead, you better start running.<br />Well, what's new about this?  What's new is that everything in our world is now changing so fast that it is no longer enough to simply find a need and fill it, or to discover how to do something better than those who are currently doing it, and for less.  You got to do that again and again, year in and year out, and you have to constantly be looking for ways to expand your services and improve your products.  In short, it has to be the continuing policy and practice of your company to work toward developing a more profitable business model.  This is especially true for successful companies since you WILL be imitated.<br />Okay, this sounds right, but just how do I go about reinventing my business model?  Well, that's what Mitchell and Coles wanted to know, and so beginning in 1992 they went out and studied 100 successful companies and especially their CEOs, including such stalwarts as Clear Channel Communications, EMC, Dell Computers, Paychex, Goldcorp, etc.  They asked questions and they listened.  They realized that many of the business models that once worked would not work today, and that what worked today would fall behind tomorrow.  They learned that gaining a competitive advantage through management effectiveness became more important than ever in the go-go nineties.  But the biggest lesson they learned is that &quot;business model obsolescence&quot; is the greatest threat to all businesses now.  Of course, they reverse this negative perception and point out that avoiding business model obsolescence is the greatest opportunity now available to your business.  This way of thinking is sure to provide excitement in many stagnating businesses today, and is sure to set a fire under somebody's derriere.  It might as well be yours, is the message the authors want to get across.<br />They support this message with a slew of examples from the companies they studied, showing how innovations in pricing, in expanding customer benefits, in creating reductions in costs, in coming up with new ways to increase market share, in adding customer value for the same or a lower price, etc. have worked for others and how they might work for you.  They note that &quot;business model innovation usually requires more mental agility than resources...&quot; (p. 218)  That's good news to hear since resources are often limited.  They give case histories and recount in detail how some of the inventive CEOs took their companies from share prices in the pennies to share prices in the hundreds of dollars(!).  Of course some people got lucky and expanded with the bubble, but others didn't, and those that are still successful today have innovated and are continuing to innovate.  Mitchell and Coles document this truth.<br />The densely-packed material in the book is handsomely presented, exceptionally well-edited, and the book's design is first class.  There are sidebars highlighting key information and ideas, and subtitles that allow the reader to focus quickly on areas of especial interest.  Chapters typically begin with a well-chosen key-note quotation from authorities as diverse as the Bible, Sun-Tzu and Irving Berlin.  The style is clear and business-like.  The authors are seasoned business strategy consultants who are working on a series of books to help improve your business.  This the third in the series, and the one that the authors recommend you read first.  There are &quot;Key Questions&quot; at the end of chapters to keep you focused and to highlight and further explain ideas.  The authors emphasize looking back objectively at both yourcompany's successes and failures with the time-honored realization that we can often learn more from our failures than from our successes; and indeed the difference between a successful innovation and an unsuccessful one can be as narrow as the razor's edge.<br />One of the things that most impressed me about this book is the way the authors emphasize the positive aspects of being successful in business, sharing benefits, increasing not just shareholder value, but value to the customer and to those who work for and with you.  This kind of enlightened self-interest approach to business is not only a pleasant departure from the Machiavellian model that one so often sees presented, but is a surer way to success, not only to success in business, but to success in life.  I know from my experience with Don Mitchell that he is a wise and considerate person who understands the business world and what it takes to get ahead.  This book will surely set you in the right direction, and most likely will stimulate you to do even better than you are doing, and especially help you anticipate and indeed create tomorrow's business climate.company's successes and failures with the time-honored realization that we can often learn more from our failures than from our successes; and indeed the difference between a successful innovation and an unsuccessful one can be as narrow as the razor's edge.<br />One of the things that most impressed me about this book is the way the authors emphasize the positive aspects of being successful in business, sharing benefits, increasing not just shareholder value, but value to the customer and to those who work for and with you.

What is unraveling is the nation's economic health.  What we are looking at, according to Princeton economist and New York Times Op-Ed columnist  Paul Krugman, is not only an emperor without any clothes, but a nation being burdened with so much debt that it is ready to crash upon the rocks of a hard economic reality to come.<br />There are about a hundred and fourteen columns, the earliest of which is dated December 29, 1997, the latest March 25, 2003, organized into sixteen chapters comprising five parts.  The columns, almost all of which first appeared in the New York Times, are arranged more or less chronologically within each of the sixteen thematic chapters.  For each of the five parts Krugman has written an introduction especially for this volume.  What Krugman attempts to do is: Part I: account for and assign blame for the economic bubble and its collapse; Parts II and III: document the redistribution of the nation's wealth from the poor and middle class to the rich by the Bush administration; Parts IV and V: assign responsibility for the negative aspects of globalization and for the frequent collapse of markets in foreign countries, and speculate on where we might be headed.<br />(By the way, &quot;Is that Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?/Seems like I've been down that way before.&quot;  --Bob Dylan)<br />His targets are Bush, Bush and more Bush, of course, but also Alan Greenspan for acquiescing in Bush's Rob the Future Economics, but most pointedly he goes after the mass media, especially broadcast journalists for their failure to report candidly on what Bush and his cronies are up to.  Krugman feels, as I do, that the failure of the Fourth Estate is one of the reasons that Bush's attack on the environment, our pocket books, and our civil liberties is succeeding.  Bush has bullied the media into presenting the news in a way that obscures his attack on America and what America has always stood for.  This is no exaggeration.  Krugman's indictment likens the Bush leadership to that in so-called banana republics (see page 187), and I have to say, he makes a good case.  Krugman is thorough; he is incisive and, for an economist, welds a most colorful pen.<br />I would recommend in reading this book that you skip the first part and turn directly to the chapter &quot;Crony Capitalism, USA&quot; on page 101 and learn about  the insider stock trading and other shady deals of one George W. Bush, now president of the United States, and how a failed businessman might became rich.  Krugman makes the point that Bush got away with insider trading and other shady dealings because nobody would prosecute him since the potential prosecutors were all friends of his father who was then president of the United States.  Or better yet don't read any of this: it will destroy any illusions about free market capitalism in the United States you may have.  You will be offended.  You will be outraged.<br />Krugman even goes as far as to characterize Bush's faith-based economics as a deliberate Ponzi scheme in progress in which he takes money from the future and gives it to the present in the hope that things will remain rosy enough so that he will be reelected.  Even more to the point is the transfer of funds from the poor and the middle class to the rich (Krugman identifies them as people making over about $300,000 per year) to be doled out for many years to come in the form of a &quot;supply side&quot; tax break costing hundreds of billions, perhaps even a couple trillion dollars.<br />So who's minding the store?  Not Bush and his administration.  They feel that the store is a public commons that they need to exploit as much and as fast as possible before another administration gets in.  The purpose of the Bush administration as revealed in these pages is really nothing more and nothing less that this redistribution of wealth.  Bush apparently believes that this is God's will and he is God's instrument in bringing about this massive stealth.  In a sense, the folksy George W. is actually a Robin Hood in reverse.  His technique for handling a docile public is to lie to them and manipulate them, pretend to be a populist while constantly pushing an economic agenda that siphons off as much of America's wealth as he can get his hands on into the big gas tanks of his elite circle of relatives, friends and cronies.  In a nice summation of the George W. technique, Krugman writes: &quot;Mr. Bush has made an important political discovery.  Really big misstatements...cannot be effectively challenged, because voters can't believe that a man who seems so likable would do that sort of thing.&quot; (p. 196)<br />Until I read this book I was among those voters.  It seemed incredible that the President would just lie to us and carrying on as if there were nothing amiss and then lie to us again, and again.  Amazing, but such tactics work.  However, as someone once said you can fool some of the people some of the time...but eventually you get found out.  I hope Bush gets found out before November, 2004.  Four more years, if Krugman's prognosis is anything close to correct, could be more than this venerable republic can afford.tribution of wealth.

897875:US	49786731	RJTJ32BC3DWIC	1580420818	440664396	Doyle Brunson's Super System	Books	5	430	444	N	N	Still the best how-to book on poker ever written	When this was first published in the seventies it caused a sensation.  Immediately recognized as the most ambitious poker book ever written, it nonetheless was received with irritation by some professionals because it was believed that Doyle &quot;Texas Dolly&quot; Brunson and his collaborators gave away too much, thereby allowing the amateurs to catch up, thereby cutting into the professional player's take.<br />There is more than a little truth to this accusation.  Poker is an ever-evolving superset of games with the individual games changing over time as the players learn how one game and then another should be played.  Write a revealing book and the old games disappear more quickly and the &quot;rocks&quot; have to learn the new game in order to continue to make a living.  Today's most important games are hold'em and seven card stud.  Both are covered in this book, hold'em quite extensively.<br />What sets Brunson's Super/System apart from other poker books is first the prestige and celebrity of the writers, especially Doyle himself, but also Bobby Baldwin (also a World Champion); David &quot;Chip&quot; Reese, Doyle's expert on seven-card stud; Joey Hawthorne on Low-Ball; David Sklanski on Hi-Low; and Mike Caro (MJC) on draw poker.  I used to play with Sklanski and MJC back in the sixties in Gardena when the only legal game in the California clubs was draw poker, both lowball and jacks or better.  Sklanski has gone on to be one of the game's great theoreticians and the author of several excellent books on poker.  Caro, known as &quot;the Mad Genius of Poker,&quot; has formed his own &quot;Poker University&quot; and is partly responsible for this book's republication, and has become quite a poker entrepreneur.<br />Second, there is the comprehensive coverage of the games from five card draw to no limit hold'em.  Not everything is explained and some of the tricks are held back.  Reese in particular, in his chapter on seven-card stud is somewhat reticent.  He presents a tight strategy that is sound but withholds more aggressive strategies that, in the proper hands, would make more money.<br />By the way, &quot;no limit&quot; really means table stakes since you are NOT, as is sometimes seen in the movies, allowed to go to the bank and get some money when you hold a killer hand!  In fact, no limit is really no different than pot limit expect that instead of being restricted to the amount of the pot when betting, one can, if one so chooses, push in one's entire stack.  THAT does make for some interesting psychological situations!  One of Doyle Brunson's main points in this book is the huge difference between set limit poker as played in the clubs and indeed as played for the so-called world championship, and no limit poker as played by the rich and the top professionals.  The latter game is much more of a psychological game in that you can lose pot after small pot and yet come out ahead by winning one great big monster, and also because it takes a lot of nerve to either call a huge bet or to make a huge bet.  Furthermore as you're playing along you have to be aware that at any moment the pot can suddenly mushroom to gigantic proportions.  Because of these psychological factors, some of the  top players at limit have never been able to make a satisfactory jump to the no limit game.  In Brunson's case, he actually was adept at no limit long before he became a top limit player.<br />Third, there are the brilliant caricatures of the players by Stan Hunt.  Just to see those again in print is worth the price of the book.<br />Fourth are the poker odds and statistics by Mike Caro.  Believe me they are completely accurate.  I and a number of others players checked and rechecked them, hoping to catch MJC in an error.  No such luck!  I was a little disappointed that Mike chose to recall an odds story that showed him in the right, because I, among a very small number of people, actually did beat him out of a twenty dollar bet in the sixties on some odds we were discussing.  Of course Mike would &quot;give away&quot; money just to support his carefully cultivated image as a &quot;madman.&quot;  One of his most notorious &quot;plays&quot; at draw was to pretend to have a pat hand, raise the opener, and then not bet after the draw and just show down his nothing hand, thereby giving away the pot.  I mean eyebrows raised and heads shook incomprehensibly at this totally &quot;irrational&quot; play.  Yet it worked because people then would call him when he really had something.<br />Caro was also an expert on poker tells.  He wrote a book on the subject.  He would, when playing, do parodies of the other players by betting and acting as they would in an exaggerated way.  Sometimes he actually did unconscious parodies of himself.<br />Doyle Brunson on the other hand loved the psychological struggle and just being in action.  In his prime he was arguably the world's best player at both limit and no limit hold'em.  He had nerves of steel and an intensely competitive nature and a deep obsessive love of the game.  He overpowered his opponents with a constant energy that was always, always pushing.  He had a few tricks and his knowledge of the game was among the best, but perhaps his greatest gift was his ability to bet when he knew the other guy would toss in.<br />What you can learn from this book about poker is really almost priceless.  Even though this book is definitely dated (and today's stars are a different breed) nonetheless there is wealth of information here for the casual as well as the professional player.

898576:US	49786731	R3EDE97UF4O0SE	0877799156	211621092	The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (Third Edition)	Books	5	71	73	N	N	Don't play without it	The OSPD is no ordinary dictionary.  There are capsule definitions given but no usage tips.  All the entries are in caps.  Since there are no proper names allowed, this doesn't matter.  The most important information about the entries (from the point of view of the Scrabble player) is how they are spelled, how they are made plural, how the gerund and past tenses are formed, and whether you can make comparatives or superlatives out of the word and how.<br /><br />For example the plural of \\"bijou\\" (a jewel) is either \\"bijoux\\" or \\"bijous,\\" and the OSPD gives that info.  The gerund of \\"snib\\" (to latch) is \\"snibbing\\" while the comparative of \\"sleazy\\" is \\"sleazier\\" and the superlative, \\"sleaziest.\\"  There is also the adverb, \\"sleazily.\\"<br /><br />The -er form of a word is listed separately.  If you don't find it, it's not a word!--or at least that should be our agreement.  For example \\"renown\\" is a noun and a verb but there is no \\"renowner\\"--\\"someone who makes renown\\" since the verb is intransitive, but there is a \\"tearer\\"--\\"one who tears.\\"  (There's also a \\"terror,\\" but never mind.)<br /><br />By the way, words beginning with the prefix \\"re\\" as in, e.g., \\"reword\\" are listed separately from words that begin with the \\"re\\" that is not a prefix.  Again, \\"renown\\" is not listed after \\"rename\\" but follows \\"renovate\\" a few pages later.<br /><br />The other peculiarities of the entries are explained in the Introduction, which I highly recommend you read.  (Be sure your informed opponent has read it!)  There it is explained why \\"You should look always look at several entries above and below the expected place...\\" when searching for the word in question.  You should also read the brief Preface in which the editors explain why some offensive (especially four-letter) words do not appear.  Note too that words longer than eight letters (and indeed one-letter words) do not appear (except for some inflected forms) because they are seldom if ever used in a Scrabble game.  Of course most veteran players have on occasion played a very nice nine-letter, double triple-word, 50-point bonus word.  I did myself once.  I wish I could remember what it was.<br /><br />For casual players, who typically use a collegiate dictionary to settle spelling disputes, the contents of this little green book will come as something of a shock.  You mean \\"zax\\" is a word?  How about \\"zek\\"?  Can you believe \\"jefe\\"?  This is just to name three off hand that are not in the Random House college dictionary I have in front of me.<br /><br />There are in fact in the OSPD seven words beginning with a \\"q\\" not followed by a \\"u\\" (qaid, qanat, qat, qindar, qintar, qiviut, and qoph--in case you're in the middle of a game).  Don't laugh.  In some households there is a Scrabble game going on at all times just as in some other households the TV is always on.  Random House's college dictionary doesn't give \\"qaid\\" or \\"qanat\\" but surprisingly has \\"qadi\\" which is not given by the OSPD.<br /><br />I think Scrabble has influenced dictionary compilers because if you look at the Merriam-Webster (the same company that produces the OSPD) Ninth Collegiate (copyright 1985) you will find only qintar, qiviut and qoph.  But even more tellingly if you look at Merriam-Webster's Second International Unabridged Dictionary (I have the edition of 1950), the Grand Dame of American dictionaries, you will find that there are no words beginning with a \\"q\\" not followed by a \\"u\\": no \\"qat,\\" no \\"qintar,\\" no \\"qoph,\\" etc.<br /><br />With so much variation between dictionaries, the good folks at Merriam-Webster saw a need and filled it.  Most people I know play \\"house rules\\" and rely on the dictionary(ies) that happen to be in residence.  My recommendation is that you buy two of these green books, one in paperback to take with you when you take your Scrabble game on the road, and another in hardback to have at home.  Of course if you haven't used this book before it will take some getting used to.  But buy a Scrabble software program and practice with this book at hand, and after some time you will find that, with all those extra words to play with, you can really rack up the points!<br /><br />One other thing to realize is that some of the spellings and even some of the words in the OSPD are really not standard anymore and should not be considered part of the so-called \\"Standard English\\" that we all read and (usually) speak.  This fact does not detract from the utility of the OSPD for Scrabble players; however, as other reviewers have pointed out, when writing a term paper use a \\"real\\" dictionary.<br /><br />In short, it is not the plentiful number of Scrabble-type words that appear in this dictionary that makes it so valuable--although that is certainly one of its best features.  It is rather the definitive way the OSPD demonstrates exactly how different forms of words are spelled, something not always done in your average dictionary.<br /><br />The OSPD is most valuable because it settles spelling disputes in a quick and unambiguous manner, and that alone is reason enough to buy this book.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"How to Win at Hearts on Your Computer\\"tware program and practice with this book at hand, and after some time you will find that, with all those extra words to play with, you can really rack up the points!<br /><br />One other thing to realize is that some of the spellings and even some of the words in the OSPD are really not standard anymore and should not be considered part of the so-called \\"Standard English\\" that we all read and (usually) speak.

He is also the editor of The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medicine (1996) and was until his death professor of social history at University College London.<br /><br />But let's face it, the history of medicine has not been a pretty story, nor could it have been.  Most of history's physicians were flailing about in the dark, the surgeons as sawbones and barbers performing crude amputations and such without the aid of either anaesthetics or disinfectants, the practitioners as faith healers and quacks, dispensing placebos or poisons often without knowing which was which.  It wasn't until the late 19th century that the medical profession began to achieve some understanding of the real causes of illness and indeed understand how living things work and how and why they don't work.  Porter recalls some of the controversies about working with cadavers, and arguments about the causes of infectious disease: an argument made difficult because how microbes figured in disease was only beginning to be understood during the time of Pasteur.<br /><br />Porter outlines this sobering story from the time of the Greeks to the present day in an objective and easily assimilated style.  He organizes the material into eight chapters focusing on Disease, Doctors, The Body, The Laboratory, Therapies, Surgery, The Hospital, and Medicine in Modern Society.  Along the way he delves into the politics (some sexual) and into the sociology of medicine around the globe.  There are suggestions for Further Reading and an Index.<br /><br />There are also about 40 rather appalling (some amusing) illustrations from previous centuries in this (for a change) accurately named little tome, showing the horrors of past medical practices.  They enliven Porter's text, but you may need a magnifying glass to catch all the nuances--as though you might want to do that!--since some of the prints, while small enough to fit the page are not large enough for the unaided eye.<br /><br />In short, this is a quick and unsettling read that may make the reader wonder about how future generations will view some of the medical procedures practiced today.at!--since some of the prints, while small enough to fit the page are not large enough for the unaided eye.<br /><br />In short, this is a quick and unsettling read that may make the reader wonder about how future generations will view some of the medical procedures practiced today.	2003-11-13

Instead I went to work for the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press while Wolff went on to become a best-selling writer and a columnist for New York magazine.<br />I mention this personal note since what Autumn of the Moguls is all about is, quite frankly, Michael Wolff.  Indeed in the annals of self-indulgent and largely rhetorical tomes about media, Wolff has here something close to a singular achievement, something to rival (in its way) the memoirs of many a Hollywood movie producer.  This is a book ostensibly about media wheelers and dealers, the money men who divide and conquer, merge and squeeze while manufacturing low-interest loans and golden parachutes for themselves.  Yet Wolff's style is to concentrate on how the moguls have sought him out, how he has been invited to expensive shindigs (&quot;I found myself on the Forbes family yacht&quot; p. 75), while maintaining the acumen to see through their posturings and stupidities.  Having established his authority--and to his credit he admits to having lost a buck or two in media deals himself--Wolff then digresses and digresses and then returns to the story, as leisurely as a patriarch at dinner with his heirs.  Of course, as necessity has it, Wolff's observations and critiques are strictly after the fact.  I suspect that some of the moguls mentioned herein might say that Wolff has raised Monday morning quarterbacking to an ethereal plain.<br />Still there is some fun to be had here and there are some tidbits worth savoring, although sometimes he becomes too enamored of his own coinages, such as when he uses &quot;Zeitgeisty&quot; on consecutive pages 46 and 47, or when he too frequently employs trendy words like &quot;arrivistes.&quot;  His use of paragraphing and sentence fragments for emphasis is also a bit overdone.  More often however, Wolff demonstrates a gift for striking turns of phrase that unfortunately may or may not really mean anything but do indeed catch the ear, like something from Marshall McLuhan without the academic gloss.  For example, he writes on page 30, &quot;The media is...in the business of being noticed by the media.&quot;  Or, &quot;Brand is about access to media.&quot; (p. 29)  Or, &quot;the larger and higher-profile the company, the bigger the nutcase who runs it.&quot; (p. 95)  Or, even, &quot;Ubiquity has become the main media standard.&quot; [paragraph break]  &quot;So this is elemental: The more available content is, the inherently less valuable it is.&quot; (p. 278)<br />I'm not sure that these &quot;insights&quot; rank with McLuhan's &quot;The Medium is the Message,&quot; which was the then sensational title of the first chapter of Understanding Media (1964); or with the more profound understanding McLuhan reached three years later with the publication of The Medium is the Massage.  Note that that's &quot;message&quot; first and then &quot;massage.&quot;  The media first tried to nullify content by becoming the message itself, and then realized that massaging the masses with couch potato content was an even surer way to make a buck.<br />However Wolff is not interested in such crass academic cynicism. Although he mentions McLuhan once in passing and, although he too is less interested in what the media publishes than what it is, his real mentor is David Halberstam who wrote a best-seller on the media business in 1979 called, The Powers that Be (not coincidentally the title of Wolff's fourth chapter).  Wolff opines, &quot;Many of us, I'll wager, came into the media business, rather than, say, government or academia, because of ThePowers that Be.&quot; (p. 38)<br />In other words, it was the romance of media that seduced Wolff, and it is the romance of media expansion, merger and consolidation that fascinates him today.  And (putting Wolff himself aside for the moment) that is what this book is ultimately all about: the politics, the grandeur, the power, and the romance of media; about how media has replaced politics, how it has become &quot;a more influential force in our lives...than politics or government ever was&quot; (p. 28); how in fact Wolff can write: &quot;I don't believe any greater power has ever existed&quot; (p. 30)<br />Well, hyperbole aside, Wolff's thesis that media today is more powerful than it has ever been, and that it is a cultural and political force to test the power of government, our schools and churches, and all the other institutions of society is one to be taken seriously.  It is all the more alarming (to the extent that Wolff's observations are accurate) to discover in these pages the self-centered and purely acquisitive mentality of the moguls who run the media business and control its content.Powers that Be.&quot; (p. 38)<br />In other words, it was the romance of media that seduced Wolff, and it is the romance of media expansion, merger and consolidation that fascinates him today.

911648:US	49786731	R2B5CI8KRCA6UX	0300083238	535692988	A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution, and Cooperation	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Well worth reading	It was thought not too many years ago that the architects (so to speak) of the modern world were Marx, Darwin, Einstein and Freud.  Now that the postmodern era is upon us, a reevaluation has been made and Marxist ideas have been largely discredited.  Einstein has suffered a correction (from quantum mechanics), Freud has been reclassified as literature, and it is only Darwin's reputation that has survived unsullied.<br />Furthermore during this period the right has taken Darwin as its own, believing that the competitive biological nature of human beings as revealed by evolutionary biology is what leads to the inequalities that exist in human societies while justifying the war of one against all, etc.<br />But what Peter Singer is crowing about (and is the occasion for this lengthy essay/short book) is that the &quot;red in tooth and claw&quot; (Tennyson) interpretation of biological evolution that prevailed throughout the modern era is now coming under fire.  No longer can biological evolution be seen as simply the strong taking advantage of the weak (a notion understandably obnoxious to the left).  The larger truth now emerging from biology is that cooperation plays an important role in being fit and has, especially for humans, great adaptive value.  It is becoming clear that Richard Dawkins's idea of the &quot;selfish gene&quot; is only part of the understanding, and that natural selection operates on groups through the individual, leading to an understanding that one (more cooperative) tribe may be selected over another, and that it is through cooperation within the tribe that Darwinian fittest may be most strongly expressed.<br />Now this is an idea that the left can appreciate.  Consequently Singer's enthusiasm.  Marx is dead, long live Darwin!<br />My problem with this intellectual enterprise is one that Singer points to on page 38, namely that we cannot form an argument from what IS to what SHOULD BE.  Singer opines that we can instead through an appreciation of evolution gain &quot;a better understanding of what it may take to achieve the goals we seek.&quot;<br />Beginning on page 31 with his second chapter, Singer compares behaviors across societies.  This allows him to note which practices are universal or nearly so and which are highly diverse.  The conclusion is that the more universal the behavior, the more it is a product of our biological nature and not a construct of society.  To the extent that this process is valid, the information gotten is valuable.  This is indeed one of the tools of evolutionary psychology that some people on the Darwinian left would like to discredit.  They fear that an emphasis on our genetic endowment will work against our ability to nurture positive values and behaviors.  They want nurture trumping nature.<br />However, in my opinion, the entire argument is pass&eacute; and invalid.  It is now generally understood in biology that nature gives us a predisposition to certain behaviors that develop in concert with our environmental experience so that our behaviors are an intimate product of both our nature and our nurture and cannot in any way be separated.  The old &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; debate is now seen as based on a false dilemma.<br />Also, it should be appreciated that today's scientific understanding of human nature as derived from biology, genetics and kindred disciplines, is just that, today's understanding, and as such is tentative.  Consequently any oughts, shoulds, etc. drawn from such an understanding--even if such a practice were logically valid--would also be of a provisional nature.<br />Having said all this, I want to note that Singer's argument is well presented and his prescription for a Darwinian left in Chapter 5 well worth reading.  If adopted it would work toward relieving the left from its fear of what evolutionary psychology is discovering about human beings.  As Steven Pinker (not exactly a leftist) cheerfully notes, &quot;Singer challenges the conventional wisdom that a recognition of human nature is incompatible with progressive ideals...&quot;<br />He does, and indeed Singer demonstrates that the discoveries of evolutionary biology can be completely compatible with the traditional values of the left.  This is an important understanding, since evolutionary biology is not going to go away, nor are its discoveries.  We must learn to live with who and what we are without necessarily condoning our less attractive tendencies or attempting to sweep them under the rug.<br />Bottom line: the opening chapter which concentrates too much on the well-known Marxist delusions and the Soviet doublethink might well be skipped.  The meat of Singer's essay begins with Chapter 2, and works very well by itself.wisdom that a recognition of human nature is incompatible with progressive ideals...&quot;<br />He does, and indeed Singer demonstrates that the discoveries of evolutionary biology can be completely compatible with the traditional values of the left.

911664:US	49786731	R2NV46WXX9SCDH	0895261480	815056968	Breakdown: How America's Intelligence Failures Led to September 11	Books	3	2	9	N	N	Needs to focus the blame	Since the blurb on this book has glowing endorsements from such people on the right as Jeane Kirkpatrick and Edwin Meese, and furthermore, since Washington Times (that's Times not Post) reporter Bill Gertz spends a lot of ink going after the Clinton administration and Janet Reno, one might be led to believe that the now universally acknowledged failure by the spook culture in the United States was caused by liberal restrictions on the FBI, the CIA, etc.  However, a careful reading of Gertz's (frankly pedestrian, I am sorry to say) effort will reveal that he knows the failure lies exactly where the title of the book says it lies, that is, within the intelligence institutions themselves.<br />Consider just this little tidbit from page 28, &quot;the FBI, as late as 1998, had only two Arabic speakers who could translate documents written in Arabic.&quot;  Imagine that: billions of dollars spent for high tech equipment, &quot;Chevy suburbans,&quot; international travel for all those Ivy League grads to talk to other button-down guys in other countries, and all those hours fighting turf wars and playing cops and robbers to keep the price of street drugs high, and guess what? there's virtually nobody who can read the reports from the Middle East!  Gertz emphasizes the point in the next paragraph by quoting former director of Central Intelligence R. James Woolsey: &quot;Obviously, both the FBI and the CIA would have been very well advised MUCH EARLIER to have trained, or retrained, or hired a much larger group of people who spoke Arabic, Farsi, and some of these languages of the Mideast.&quot;  (My emphasis.)<br />That's a &quot;duh, dude&quot; and it goes back well before the Clinton administration.  Indeed, Gertz likes to remind us of the intelligence failures pre-Pearl Harbor.  (See, e.g., page 36.)  I would like to remind everybody of two other points, one that the premier intelligence agency director of Spook Culture and part-time architect of how to spy and be spied upon is none other than the former director of the CIA, our past president and father of the present president, George H.W. Bush.  His mentality and legacy is partly responsible for an intelligence community mentality that is insular, and intellectually and educationally incestuous to the point of something close to sterility.  Thanks to a long over reliance on high tech and white male conservative operatives our intelligence institutions are without the means to penetrate cultures other than our own.<br />My second point is, the failures continue!  Where is Osama bin Laden?  Where is Saddam Hussein?  Where are the perpetrator(s) of the anthrax mailings?  Clinton's excuse for not getting Osama bin Laden, as reported by Gertz, was fear of civilian casualties.  After 9/11 we gave up a lot of the niceties about collateral damage and let it fly.  But again we missed him and we missed Saddam Hussein.  And with the number of possible perps that could have had the knowledge, the opportunity and the motive for mailing weapons grade anthrax to select domestic targets countable by, say, the Easter Bunny, one would think, one would readily imagine that the FBI knows darn good and well who mailed the pathogens, leaving many of us to speculate (especially considering the deadening silence coming from the White House) that somebody, somewhere has already blown that case.<br />The sad and frustrating truth that almost everyone now knows about American intelligence, and something that Gertz should have emphasized, is that we will have no effective intelligence, no effective counterintelligence, and no effective way to prevent terror until the cultures in the FBI, the CIA and the other intelligence communities enjoy a fresh and massive infusion of more cosmopolitan, more sophisticated, more multi-ethnic and more diversified personnel.  And that, my friends, will take decades.  We are offering $25-million for the cold, dead body of Saddam Hussein, and we are getting no takers.  You want to know why?  Because there is not an American spook in the entire Middle East who can convey convincingly that kind of message to the people on the ground, the street and village people of the Middle East who might have some inkling.  Our intelligence community has been so high and mighty and divorced from any effect of criticism for so long that it actually has no idea of what a lousy job it has been doing.  It lets criticism run off his back like so much political dishwater not realizing for a moment that it has failed.<br />One hopes now, that with the right and the left in agreement on those failures, effective change is taking place and we will be spared the horror of another 9/11 in the form of a suitcase nuke blowing up in one of our harbors.

Once again the venerable champion of common sense assumes his role as the sorcerer's apprentice trying to sweep back the tide of pseudoscience.  And once again he provides insight into just how overwhelming that task really is.<br />The thirty-one essays, many of which appeared in The Skeptical Inquirer, are sorted into five parts: Science, Mathematics, Religion, Literature, and Moonshine.  As a special treat (!?) some clerihews and other poetic bits by Gardner's \\"friend\\" Armand T. Ringer are sprinkled throughout, especially at the beginning of chapters.  One notes in passing that \\"Armand T. Ringer\\" is an anagram of \\"Martin Gardner.\\"  Also included is a short story by Gardner from The College Mathematics Journal entitled \\"Against the Odds\\" (Chapter 6), a pleasant tale about a gifted black boy and a prejudiced schoolmarm notable for a happy ending and a thoroughgoing sense of the politically correct.<br />The first essay, \\"Multiverses and Blackberries\\" is a discussion of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.  I was surprised to learn that this mind-boggling take on QM has been \\"defended by such eminent physicists as Murray Gell-Mann, Stephen Hawking, and Steven Weinberg.\\" (p. 3)  I think they may have defended it at one time or another, but I doubt that they embraced it wholeheartedly!  A physicist who has of course is Oxford University's David Deutsch.  What Gardner reveals in this interesting piece is that there are two versions of the MWI of QM, one in which the many worlds are \\"abstractions such as numbers and triangles,\\" and the other in which the many worlds are real. (p. 5)<br />The second and third essays are on the philosophy of science, a favorite Gardner topic, and a topic that he actually makes readable and interesting, one deflating Karl Popper and the other partly a personal remembrance and appreciation of Rudolf Carnap.  And then we have \\"Some Thoughts About Induction\\" in which Gardner aligns himself with David Hume, Bertrand Russell and others on the possibility that we can really prove anything by induction.  This essay includes this glancing blow at those who would imagine that we might discover the ultimate nature of things: \\"[Electrons] may be made of superstrings.  If so, what are superstrings made of?\\"<br />Other essays include \\"The Strange Case of Garry Wills,\\" and \\"The Vagueness of Krishnamurti\\" from Part III on Religion in which Gardner reveals his consummate interest in the intimate details of the lives of the famous, especially the non-flattering details.  I was surprised to learn of Krishnamurti's various episodes of hanky-panky.  Like Gardner I had always found him unreadable, but herein I learned that the probable sufficient secret of his success was his charismatic personality.<br />In Part V on Moonshine Gardner has some fun with the idea that Little Red Riding Hood is a symbolic story of emerging womanhood complete with the red hood symbolizing menstrual blood and the wolf's appetite being not entirely gastronomic.  I think here revealed is Gardner's limited appreciation of the nature of certain kinds of literature, of which fairy tales and religious works are examples.  Such works are necessarily symbolic since what they are about cannot be expressed in a strictly denotative way because to do so would offend or be in conflict with some particulars of whatever the current wisdom might be.  Such \\"evolved\\" literatures must be accessible regardless of the taboos of the present society.  Better than any of the commentary from Gardner or those he quotes on the tale is the amazing print on page 180 by Gustave Dor&eacute; of Little Read Riding Hood in bed with the wolf.  The primeval nature of the tale is exemplified by Little Red Riding Hood's appearance simultaneously as a little girl and as a small woman, and the wolf's large mouth and ready claws.  Dor&eacute; knewthat this was one scary tale that penetrated the listener's subconscious.<br />Perhaps the most valuable essays in the book are \\"The Brutality of Dr. Bettelheim\\" and \\"Facilitated Communication: A Cruel Farce\\" (chapters 23 and 24).  In the first, Gardner reminds us how Dr. Bruno Bettelheim in particular, and psychoanalytic theory in general, mistreated a generation (or two or three) of autistic children and especially their so-called \\"refrigerator mothers\\" through a gross misunderstanding of autism and how to treat it.  Some of the material comes from Edward Dolnick's  Madness on the Couch: Blaming the Victim in the Heyday of Psychoanalysis (1998), a book I reviewed favorably and recommend highly.  In the second, Gardner reminds us of the fraudulent Quija board technique employed by some health workers using autistic children that had its heyday in the late eighties and early nineties before being exposed on Frontline and 60 Minutes.  The disturbing thing about Gardner's report is that one of the true believers, Professor of Education Douglas Biklen, is still at Syracuse University and is still plying his trade.<br />One of the best reasons for reading Gardner is to appreciate how clear his expression is, and how readable he makes just about any subject.  He has a gift for making the abstract concrete and the obtuse transparent.as one scary tale that penetrated the listener's subconscious.<br />Perhaps the most valuable essays in the book are \\"The Brutality of Dr. Bettelheim\\" and \\"Facilitated Communication: A Cruel Farce\\" (chapters 23 and 24).

It sheds little new light on the investigation which to this day has still not turned up a suspect.<br />Marilyn W. Thompson, who is an editor at the Washington Post, and her research assistants, Davene Grosfeld and Maryanne Warrick, interviewed scores of people from Leroy Richmond, a postal employee who almost died from inhalation anthrax, to Dr. Jeffrey P. Koplan, then director of the Centers for Disease Control, in putting together the story.  But apparently they were not able to interview anybody in the FBI, nor did they talk to Steven J. Hatfill, who was dubbed by Attorney General John Ashcroft as &quot;a person of interest&quot; in the investigation and was prominently in the public eye as a possible suspect.  Much of the material was culled from news sources and public records.  Consequently, what we have here is a presentation of what is publically known about the case and a record of events.<br />One of the aspects that Thompson concentrates on is the differential between the public health response to the anthrax found on Capitol Hill and the response to that found at the Brentwood Mail Processing and Distribution Center in Washington, D.C. with the suggestion that there was a dual standard at work, one for the white and powerful and another for the black and blue collar.  This may be so, but the most damaging criticism she presents--against the CDC at least--is their failure to realize that anthrax could escape a sealed envelope.  However it could, and did, especially in the Brentwood Center.<br />Thompson does get into &quot;who done it,&quot; hinting that Al-Qaeda may be responsible as she recalls the pre-9/11 activities of Mohammed Atta, alleged ringleader of the hijackings, who is reported to have met with Iraqi intelligence in Prague where he accepted &quot;a glass container&quot; that may have contained an anthrax sample. (pp. 53-54)  She also recalls Atta's interest in crop dusters and his visits to a south Florida rural airstrip to check out an Air Tractor AT-502 crop duster. (p. 54)<br />Even more sensational (to me at least) is the write up of &quot;a textbook description of cutaneous anthrax&quot; by Dr. Christos Tsonas of Fort Lauderdale, Florida after treating Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi, one of the hijackers who went down with United Airlines Flight 93 in Somerset County Pennsylvania, for a &quot;dry, blackish scab covered wound&quot; on his leg.  As Thompson remarks, &quot;skin anthrax could be acquired in only one way: through direct contact with anthrax spores.&quot; (pp. 51-52)<br />A lot of ink is also spent on Hatfill, although Thompson is careful not to propose that he is the culprit.  What she does is give a report on his background including his partially falsified resume, including a false claim that he has a Ph.D in microbiology (p. 191) and a report on his soldier of fortune persona.  She also quotes scientist Barbara Hatch Rosenberg's &quot;likely portrait of the perpetrator,&quot; a portrait that fits Hatfill very well.  (See pages 202-205.)  However, Rosenberg also refused to name Hatfill.  The way Thompson organizes this information in Chapter 15, &quot;A Person of Interest,&quot; with the juxtaposition of the characterizations and the profiling and Hatfill's grand-standing insistence that he is innocence, suggests that he is, if nothing else, a prime suspect.  Of course, this is nothing new.  Since his name first surfaced he has been &quot;a person of interest&quot; in the media and in the minds of many people.  But the FBI, despite investigating every aspect of his life, has failed to arrest him.<br />The big question here is why the FBI has not solved this case.  As reported here and elsewhere the number of people who could have the expertise, the opportunity, and some kind of motive for this crime (involving &quot;weaponized&quot; anthrax, remember) probably can be counted without taking off our shoes.  I have speculated that either the FBI has somehow compromised the evidence and is stuck without enough for an indictment, or the identity of the culprit (or the details of the investigation) would somehow embarrass the administration--or (that old standby) compromise the investigation of other, perhaps larger crimes or even crimes being planned.  Thompson allows Rosenberg to add a third possibility, namely that the perpetrator &quot;participated in the past in secret activities that the government would not like to see disclosed.&quot; (p. 204)<br />I have one small question.  On page 174 and page 185 it is suggested that &quot;over irradiation&quot; of the mail (to kill possible anthrax spores) could cause those opening such letters to feel sick to their stomachs or feel some other illness.  From what I know about the use of radiation to kill germs, whatever is radiated contains no residue of radiation (how could it?) and poses no health hazard whatsoever.  Thompson's suggestion of the &quot;post-traumatic stress of returning&quot; to the once contaminated mail facility is the more likely reason for illness.<br />Bottom line: this is a thoroughly professional tiptoe through the tulips that allows Thompson to maintain a journalistic objectivity while pointing an accusatory finger at governmental incompetence in the face of the first bioweapons attack ever in the United States.can be counted without taking off our shoes.

Our exit may very well be totally unique.  We may go the way of the dinosaur, of course, our world obliterated by a cosmic catastrophe, or we may blow ourselves up, and then watch the survivors die out in the ruins.  But more likely we will pass away quietly as our culture transforms us from what we are now to creatures that are partly the result of genetic engineering and partly the result of mechanical ingenuity, until one day we may notice that we are so different from the humans of the past as to be an entirely different species.<br />But Boulter is not concerned here with cultural evolution.  He is looking at the biological evolution of life on earth primarily through the fossil record and in particular through Fossil Record 2, a huge database that he has studied extensively.  His theme, despite the book's title, is the diversity of life, the radiation of living groups, etc., and how an understanding of that diversity through an analysis of the fossil record can shed light on the evolutionary process.  He analyzes the growth of life's diversity after the major catastrophic events in the earth's history and plots curves and comes to the conclusion that biodiversity is an example of exponential growth, and that the phenomenon of evolution is another example of a self-organized system (such as sand piles and the weather) driven by &quot;power laws and pink noise.&quot; (p. 125)<br />Some of the interesting conclusions that Boulter comes to along the way to forecasting our extinction is that we probably did do in the Neanderthal.  (He lists &quot;selfishness&quot; as one of our distinctive traits that the Neanderthal apparently didn't have enough of.)  And yes, we wiped out the major fauna of North America within a thousand years or so of our arrival from across the Bering Strait.  In fact, we are now living through a period of mass-extinctions, in particular of large mammals, and we are a major factor in those extinctions.<br />My problem with this book is that it is sometimes hard to follow Boulter's argument since he is not as direct as he might be.  Then again it may be that I need to read more carefully!  At any rate, the fact that biodiversity follows an exponential curve until it hits a catastrophic event is certainly one of his points.  And that evolution is an example of a self-organizing system like that of a sand pile, and behaves in similar ways with large changes occurring less often than small changes, etc., is another.  Do &quot;groups of animal and plant Families follow clear rules in their origin, expansion, peak diversification and eventual extinction?&quot; is a question he asks. (p. 124)  His answer is yes, and the pattern can be traced.  He adds that &quot;extinctions are an essential stimulus to the evolutionary process.&quot; (p. 183)<br />The &quot;new idea&quot; (as he terms it, p. 182) that mass-extinctions come from &quot;within&quot; as a feature of self-organization does not seem convincing to me, although it is certainly intriguing and worthy of further study.  He writes: &quot;So modern man is kicking the sand pile and causing a severe avalanche that only started to crash down at the end of the last ice age...the fundamental cause continues: human aggression.  The first phase was our killing other mammal species...then through human history our killing of one another.&quot;<br />But is it only a temporary irony that today there are more humans on this planet than ever before?<br />Aggressive we are.  And we kill each other with an amazing abandonment, but have such actions led us toward extinction?  The evidence is all to the contrary mainly because our reproductive abilities and our ability to exploit planetary resources outweigh our murderous tendencies.  And besides the cause of at least some of the great mass extinctions of the past (huge meteorites) clearly came from without.<br />Boulter sees small animals inheriting the earth after we are gone.  He notes (p. 193) that &quot;insects and birds are still at the early stage of high diversification.&quot;  What this means is that a group of animals that is continuing to diversify (continuing to grow in the number of species) will be safe from extinction until the diversification slows.  This is a nice scientific understanding, but what it says to me is that a successful body and behavioral style (e.g., a Family or order or some other classification of organisms) is less likely to go extinct than a less successful one.  One might say, QED.<br />He speculates (his terminology, page 176) that &quot;our system is in free fall, out of control.&quot;  We won't need &quot;nuclear weapons,&quot; he posits, &quot;or the inventions of science fiction writers.&quot;  We are &quot;doing very well...just with our use of fossil fuels.&quot;  Exactly what he has in mind here is not entirely clear.  Does he mean that we will pollute ourselves to death?<br />Elsewhere he writes about global warming, caused in part by our burning of fossil fuels, but advises that fluctuations in temperature are common, and that for much of the history of life on this planet it was hotter than it is now, and that, in fact, for 250 million years from before the P-Tr mass-extinctions until the Miocene there was no frost on earth. (p. 113)  Furthermore, &quot;between AD 900 and 1300 cattle were farmed in Greenland and the French tried to embargo English wine.&quot; (p. 122)<br />In short, this is not a text for the causal reader.  It is dense, and in places, technical.  But what Boulter has to say is worth the effort.nd besides the cause of at least some of the great mass extinctions of the past (huge meteorites) clearly came from without.<br />Boulter sees small animals inheriting the earth after we are gone.

Cole relies on her wide reading in science, and on her interviews and friendships with scientists as a basis for appreciations, observations, interpretations, reports, and just plain musings on science and how science is transforming the planet.  Employing a style that ranges from gossip column cute to poetic, Cole (who teaches at my alma mater UCLA) works hard to make science as relevant to the general public as the personalities in, say,  People magazine, and just as accessible.<br />The task in writing about science is making it intelligible without dumbing it down or making simplistic statements that are not accurate.  Cole recognizes this problem; indeed in reading these small essays (almost all are under a thousand words) I can feel her struggling mightily to get it just right: to make her expression as accurate as possible and as readable.  She muses on these problems in the final essay, entitled, \\"Oops!\\" in which she confesses to some slips including confabulating Caltech physicist Robert Millikan with junk bond king Michael Milken.  Ah, yes, I know well that sort of error, having stumbled thereabouts myself a time or two!<br />But it is not her ability to popularize science (by the way, she is now doing pieces for National Public Radio) that impresses me about Cole.  It's her ability to understand science and its place in society that sets her apart from other writers.  She is especially good are relating science to the social, political and personal worlds in which we live.  Indeed, Part IV of this book is entitled \\"Political\\" Science with just the \\"Political\\" in quotes emphasizing that Cole is talking about both the internal political affairs of science and how the political world in general affects science and how science affects the political world.  Some of the best essays in the book are from this section.<br />In \\"Dreamers,\\" beginning on page 269, for example, Cole laments the loss of funding for some science projects (e.g., particle physics, the mission to Europa) as money is being redirected toward the wars on terror, drugs, and cancer--\\"missiles and medicine.\\"  She understands the pragmatic view of politicians who want tangible results from grants and under writings, but makes the powerful point that it is the \\"dreamers in the hinterlands who often come up with the most practical inventions.\\"  She directs our attention to PET scans, magnetic imaging, and laser surgery, all products of dreamers.  But most saliently she recalls the physicists behind the development of the atom bomb, \\"dreamers\\" like Einstein and Oppenheimer.  She notes that Germany might have won that war had Hitler been able to keep most of the German and Austrian scientists from fleeing to the United States.  It is one of the great and most delicious ironies of history that so-called \\"Jewish\\" science helped to defeat the Nazis.<br />In \\"Unnatural\\" (p. 291) she addresses the controversy about genetically modified foods, noting first that seemingly unnatural plastic is mostly made from petroleum products, natural \\"plant matter that brewed for millions of years in the bowels of the earth\\"; and second that we have been modifying foods since the pre-history.  (\\"You could even say that falling in love is nature's way of genetically modifying the species.\\")  In conclusion she makes one of my favorite arguments: \\"We evolve...There's nothing special about this particular point in the history of any species--corn, humans or dogs.  We're all on our way from someplace, going somewhere.\\"<br />I've read this argument elsewhere and indeed have presented it myself, but nowhere have I read it put so succinctly well.  We are NOT an unchanging construction (as from a creator God); instead we are a perpetually evolving entity, immersed in, and part of, an ever changing cosmos.<br />Some things learned: why Brazil nuts rise to the top in cans of mixed nuts (p. 117);there is a human wave of wake-up calls constantly going around the earth as we travel in our mind's eye with the sunlight though the time zones (p. 204); a comet or meteorite impact on the scale of the one that hit Siberia in 1908 happens about once every hundred years (p. 295); you can't get a suntan indoors because glass is opaque to ultraviolet light.<br />And much more.<br />I have read three of Cole's previous books and reviewed two of them (First You Build a Cloud: And Other Reflections on Physics as a Way of Life 1999 and The Hole in the Universe: How Scientists Peered over the Edge of Emptiness and Found Everything 2001) and I read every essay in this book and can say this is her best work.  I found almost all of her arguments agreeable and informed, very well and gently expressed.  I was fascinated at how her distinctive style--sometimes cute (sometimes too cute!) but often understated--partially obscures her nimble and trenchant intellect.  Cole knows science and she knows why science matters, why it matters more than we can know, and she works hard at getting that message across to a sometimes reluctant public.<br />Science writers are as necessary to the modern world as electricity is to our homes.  In some places in the world there is neither.  We are lucky to be able to turn on the lights and to read someone as lucid and pertinent as K.C.

934333:US	49786731	R1IWCN7UK1HL00	0553374281	48489484	Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: The Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali	Books	4	42	45	N	N	Excellent for a first reading	The main strength of this book is in the late Professor Miller's Introduction which is lucid and insightful in identifying and placing Patanjali's Yoga Sutras for the general reader.  The weakness is in Miller's use of certain non-yogic and sometimes misleading terms in her translation, usage which stems from her position as an academic of yoga and not a practitioner.  Sometimes she translates words that probably should not be translated since there are no real English equivalents--for example, \\"samadhi\\" itself.  And sometimes she uses what I would consider not the most agreeable English equivalent.<br /><br />Her use of the word \\"spirit\\" in the third aphorism is an example: \\"When thought ceases, the spirit stands in its true identity as observer to the world.\\"  The Sanskrit word she is translating is \\"drashtri\\" which is usually \\"seer\\" although it can also mean \\"soul,\\" according to B.K.S. Iyengar.  When one reads the next aphorism, \\"Otherwise, the observer [seer] identifies with the turnings of thought\\" it becomes clear that the seer is not spirit; indeed \\"spirit\\" is a confusing word in this context since it has no clear cognate in the dualistic yoga philosophy.  The closest equivalent would be \\"purusha\\" but that would be inappropriate since that refers to the entire non-material consciousness (as opposed to \\"prakriti,\\" which is what is manifested).  Perhaps I should simply say that \\"soul\\" in yogic philosophy is not the same thing as \\"spirit.\\"<br /><br />Another example would be her translation of vairagya in I.15  as \\"dispassion\\" which is technically correct but misses the larger meaning of the non-attachment that comes from renunciation, which is the point of the aphorism.<br /><br />I could also quibble with her use of the word \\"contemplation\\" as the equivalent of the Sanskrit \\"samadhi.\\"  But it is really impossible to translate the last three limbs of yoga: dharana, dhyana, and samadhi into English, and the contemporary practice is to simply use the Sanskrit terms themselves.  And, at any rate, there is considerable controversy about the experience of these states.  Miller follows the established practice of rendering them respectively as concentration, meditation, and contemplation.  Yet it is clear that samadhi, especially \\"nirbija samadhi\\" or seedless samadhi, is beyond contemplation.  Georg Feuerstein actually defines samadhi as \\"ecstasy.\\"<br /><br />Another strength of the book is the translation itself--once one puts aside the quibbles about some of the terms and looks at the forest, as it were, of the entire expression.  Miller has worked hard to make the text readily accessible to the general reader by using familiar terms in familiar sentence structures.  She also groups several related aphorisms together and comments on them as a whole, giving each group a title.  For example, aphorisms I.17 - I.22 are labeled, \\"Ways of Stopping Thought.\\"  This organization works well in helping the reader to a good overall understanding of Patanjali with only a first reading.  Miller has not simplified the text or dumbed it down in any sense.  What she has done is to give the pithy statements a sort of liquidity that makes for easy reading.<br /><br />Her subtitle: \\"Discipline of Freedom\\" is an apt description of Patanjali's yoga in the sense that this yoga employs technique and practice to reach liberation whereas other yogas might employ faith and devotion, selfless service, or knowledge as ways to transcend this earthly existence.<br /><br />I would recommend that this text be studied in conjunction with Iyengar's Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (1993) since that book contains a more detailed exposition of Patanjali's text and has more extensive commentaries.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"ms themselves.

934667:US	49786731	RCFTSWKOK95YI	0007145160	777145488	Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali	Books	5	193	197	N	N	The theory behind the practice	There was yoga before the time of Patanjali but it was not written down, or at least no text survives.  We find elements of the practice in the Upanishads and of course in the Bhagavad Gita.  But before Patanjali's codification there was no systematic text to guide the aspirant.  Since then Patanjali's sutras have been translated into many languages along with commentary to elucidate the concise text, with Vyasa's commentary from the ninth century--upon which Iyengar makes some reliance--being the most important.<br /><br />With the publication of this book a decade ago, B.K.S. Iyengar laid his claim to being one of the world's foremost experts not only on the practice of yoga--which he certainly is--but on its theory as well.  Mark well that the bulk of what we call yoga stems from these pithy aphorisms first written down by the Indian sage Patanjali some eighteen hundred years ago.*  One can see in this authoritative, comprehensive--indeed, nearly exhaustive--translation and commentary that Iyengar aspires to take his place among the great yogis of history.<br /><br />For each of the 196 aphorisms (most texts have 195 omitting number 3.22 as superfluous, which Iyengar includes), Iyengar gives first the Sanskrit, then the Sanskrit in transliteration.  Then he breaks down the expression into its individual words and gives an English translation of each word.  Indeed he often gives several possible English equivalents for each Sanskrit word.  Then he gives his English translation of the aphorism. In this way the reader can judge the fidelity of Iyengar's expression.  Better yet, the reader can have reference to another translation (I have Ernest Wood's, Alistair Shearer's and Barbara Stoler Miller's in front of me, but there are many others) and compare the results, and in doing so, come to a fuller appreciation of Patanjali's sometimes enigmatic words.<br /><br />Finally there are Iyengar's commentaries on each of the aphorisms, some of which cover several pages.  Occasionally Iyengar gives tables for further clarification; indeed there are 18 tables and diagrams spread throughout the text.  The sutras and commentary are framed with an Introduction, an Epilogue and four Appendices.  There is a Glossary and an Index.<br /><br />To be candid, there is more in this book than can be assimilated by most persons interested in yoga.  Even the most sincere practitioners will find the information and interpretation given by Iyengar daunting.  Some may also object to Iyengar's non-secular presentation.  While he stops short of calling yoga a religion, it is only the word \\"religion\\" that is left out!  Iyengar makes his position clear from the opening sutra which he translates as \\"With prayers for divine blessings, now begins an exposition of the sacred art of yoga.\\"  Usually this opening statement is rendered simply as, \\"Now, instruction in yoga.\\"  In the Sanskrit there are only three words.  Iyengar even identifies Patanjali as \\"an evolved soul incarnated of his own will to help humanity\\" who has \\"assumed human form, experienced our sorrow and joys, and learned to transcend them.\\" (p. 1)<br /><br />Clearly Iyengar is taking a more spiritual position in this book than he took in his famous treatise on hatha yoga, Light on Yoga, first published in 1965, although even there he calls yoga \\"the true union of our will with the will of God.\\"<br /><br />Personally, I have no problem with this.  Properly understood, yoga is a religion if one so desires; and properly understood yoga is not a religion if that is what is appropriate.  Most authorities believe that yoga works best as an adjunct to religion so that one can practice yoga and remain devout in one's own faith; in fact this is the usual practice.  Furthermore, the emphasis here, as in all of Iyengar's work, is on the practical and the non-sectarian so that Iyengar's yoga is accessible and appropriate for persons of all faiths, and is in negation of none.<br /><br />I should add that fromthe spiritual yogi's point of view the idea of God is not personal.  Although Patanjali refers to Isvara as our Lord and as God, many authorities believe that this is an inexplicit augmentation of his text that one may take or leave as one sees fit.  Indeed most yogis who embrace God embrace a God similar to the God of the Vedas; that is a God that is Ineffable about which nothing can be said, a God beyond any human comprehension, a God without any attributes that we could name.<br /><br />By the way, Patanjali's yoga is often referred to as astanga yoga (astanga meaning \\"eight-limbed\\") because there are eight limbs or steps leading to liberation.  It is also called raja yoga, the so-called king's yoga that comes after one has mastered the preliminaries of hatha yoga.  More correctly however, hatha yoga and raja yoga are both integral parts of Patanjali's program with the purely physical aspects including asana and pranayama being mentioned but without any exposition.  It wasn't until the middle ages and such works as the Hatha Yoga Pradipika by Svatmarama that hatha yoga gained prominence as something separate.<br /><br />There are four other yogas that have come down to us from ancient times that should not be confused with Patanjali's yoga.  They are bhakti yoga, the yoga of faith and devotion; karma yoga, the yoga of selfless work; jnana yoga, the yoga of knowledge; and tantric yoga, the mystical yoga of self-indulgence.  All but the latter are mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita.<br /><br />*Iyengar identifies Patanjali with the grammarian who lived some four hundred years earlier, but this is more of a traditional understanding than it is historical; most scholars including Georg Feuerstein and Mircea Eliade believe that Patanjali the grammarian and Patanjali the author of the Yoga Sutras are different persons who lived at different times.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is as close to an essential work on Patanjali as I have read.  Any serious aspirant should have this book and study it.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"the spiritual yogi's point of view the idea of God is not personal.

All but the latter are mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita.<br /><br />*Iyengar identifies Patanjali with the grammarian who lived some four hundred years earlier, but this is more of a traditional understanding than it is historical; most scholars including Georg Feuerstein and Mircea Eliade believe that Patanjali the grammarian and Patanjali the author of the Yoga Sutras are different persons who lived at different times.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is as close to an essential work on Patanjali as I have read.  Any serious aspirant should have this book and study it.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"	2003-10-19

I assume the translation of the sutras is the same while Shearer, who is a disciple of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, has updated his Introduction.  The text is presented in a sky blue color that is easy on the eyes and does not distract from the meaning of the words.  The design by Barbara Sturman is indeed very attractive while the small size of the book (4.75 by 6.25 by 0.75 inches) makes for easy portability.<br /><br />The translation itself takes up about one-third of the book while Shearer's commentary takes up most of the rest.  The translation is strikingly original and interpretative.  Patanjali's famous first line, which I recall most agreeably as \\"Now, instruction in yoga\\" (which I have from Ernest Egerton Wood's Practical Yoga, 1948) is presented as \\"And now the teaching on yoga begins.\\"  B.K.S. Iyengar, in his Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (1993), which I highly recommend in addition to this book, has \\"With prayers for divine blessings, now begins an exposition of the sacred art of yoga.\\"<br /><br />Clearly the differences with this first line are mainly stylistic with Iyengar emphasizing a spiritual and religious tone while Wood's aim was to reflect Patanjali's succinct style, with Shearer looking for lucidity and an affinity with the modern English expression.  But let's look at the second sutra.  Shearer's \\"Yoga is the settling of the mind into silence\\" is very pretty, and when one realizes that \\"silence\\" to Shearer is akin to godliness (he quotes Meister Eckhart on page 24: \\"Nothing in all creation is so like God as silence\\"), it works in a symbolic sense as well.  Professor Wood's \\"Yoga is the control of the ideas in the mind\\" places a very different emphasis.  But in Shearer's understanding, the idea of \\"control\\" is inappropriate.  He sees instead that \\"Once pointed in the right direction, the mind will begin to settle down of its own accord.  It needs no control or forcible restraint.\\" (p. 68)<br /><br />From my experience (I began my practice of yoga in 1974) both of these ideas are correct; and indeed it is a synthesis of conscious control of the ideas of the mind along with a sense of falling away that leads to meditation and samadhi.  It is a mistake to imagine that one makes no effort, since it is the very essence of yoga that one does indeed make an effort and uses technique in order to find liberation (rather than, say, faith or knowledge).  Yoga is above all a practice and nothing in it can be fully appreciated without practice.  But it is also a mistake to think that one can through force of will achieve samadhi.  What is required is a controlled practice in which one leads the reluctant mind and body to a place of relaxed concentration in which meditation is allowed to take place.<br /><br />But let's now look at how Iyengar translates this famous second aphorism: \\"Yoga is the cessation of movements in the consciousness.\\"  He adds, \\"This vital sutra contains the definition of yoga: the control or restraint of the movement of consciousness, leading to their complete cessation.\\"  (Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, p. 46)<br /><br />While I think Shearer's translation is very much worthwhile, I am less enthusiastic about his interpretation.  He devotes the last part of his Introduction to the famous \\"siddhas\\" (psychic powers).  He attempts to justify and explain them in terms of quantum mechanics, averring that \\"the subatomic universe...reveals a reality that is every bit as strange as Patanjali's.\\" (p. 79)  He even compares the superfluidity of helium near absolute zero to what is possible in the \\"least excited state of awareness\\" (i.e., the self in samadhi).  This sophistic suggestion, which has largely been discredited, at least in the scientific community, relies on the false belief that the human mind (a macro object all the way down to the molecular level) can in some way operate on thequantum level.  This is  \\"New Age\\" babble of the most annoying sort and does not in any way explain the so-called psychic powers.  Anyone who has practiced yoga long enough and has become adept at meditation has experienced these psychic powers, but realizes that they are phenomena of the mind and have nothing to do with ordinary consciousness or ordinary experience.  They are--and this is why they are valuable and why Patanjali mentions them--signposts on the way to samadhi.  When one experiences a siddha, it is an indication that one has stilled the ordinary mind and is making progress.  I don't think Shearer really understands this.<br /><br />I could also take exception to his interpretation of some of the limbs of Patanjali's yoga, or express my appreciation of some of his insights.  For example, I think his translation of shaucha (sauca) as \\"simplicity\\" instead of the usual \\"cleanliness\\" or \\"purity\\" is very agreeable.  On the other hand, I could disagree with his interpretation of brahmacharya as something more than celibacy.  I think brahmacharya means exactly that, celibacy.  Or I could find his idea that pratyahara is akin to William Blake's \\"closing the doors of perception\\" (p. 68) interesting and worth adding to the regular meaning of \\"withdrawal of the senses.\\"  But these fine distinctions would be beside the point.  Note well that the sole purpose of Patanjali's yoga is liberation from the pair of opposites (pleasure and pain) that dominate our lives.  The word \\"samadhi\\" (the goal of yoga) means both the highest level of meditation and something akin to the Buddhist \\"satori,\\" or enlightenment.  All of yoga is a means to this end.<br /><br />For anyone beginning their yoga practice this book can help, but it should be understood that reading this or any other translation and interpretation of Patanjali's yoga sutras is only the beginning and is actually worthless without the concomitant practice of yoga.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"quantum level.

939025:US	49786731	RWG8UT52P562	067400762X	962568204	Body Heat: Temperature and Life on Earth	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Interesting topic but oversimplified	Body Heat is an introduction to how living things regulate their internal temperature in the face of changing external circumstances.  It is aimed at a general readership and written in a non-technical style.  Although published by the Harvard University Press and handsomely presented, this is not as rigorously scientific as one might like.<br />First of all there are no footnotes so that some of University of Iowa psychology Professor Mark Blumberg's assertions are without reference.  In a work aimed at the general public this is perhaps acceptable, even preferable; however when some of the assertions are a bit puzzling, it would be agreeable to have some attribution.<br />For example, Blumberg claims that the ancestors of the Pima Indians of southern Arizona (whom he is writing about because they have low levels of leptin which &quot;predisposes them to fat storage&quot;) &quot;have lived in North America for 30,000 years.&quot;  (p. 182)  From everything I know about the settlements in North America, there are none that go back 30,000 years.  Perhaps this is a very recent discovery.  If so, he should cite the source.<br />Or, consider Figure 8 on page 179.  This is a black and white photo of two mice, &quot;one bred for obesity (left) and the other a normal mouse...&quot;  On the facing page 178 the obese &quot;mouse&quot; is identified as a db/db (for diabetes) mouse, yet the text suggests that it is more likely a ob/ob (for obese) mouse.  Maybe I have this wrong, but what REALLY bothers me about the photo is that I think those white mice are really white RATS and the wrong picture (or text) was used!<br />Or, on page 175 Blumberg writes that &quot;a pound of fat holds twice as much energy as does a pound of sugar or protein.&quot;  Actually it holds more like 2.25 times as much energy.  There are nine calories in a gram of fat and four in either a gram of sugar or protein.  Since I'm sure Blumberg knows this I can only attribute his expression to either a desire on the part of his publisher to &quot;keep it simple&quot; and avoid fractions, or because in the metabolism of fat some energy is lost.  If the former is the reason, he should have insisted in the interest of accuracy on the more precise expression; and if the latter, he should have told us so.  In either case, we are left wondering if we are being &quot;dumbed down.&quot;<br />This simplistic approach, a kind of creeping casualness about what is and what isn't so, may lead the reader to wonder about the strict accuracy of other statements in the book.  For example, on page 158 we learn that the psychologist Craig Anderson asserts that in high heat conditions (hot days) there is an increase in human violence and aggression.  This seems reasonable enough.  However Blumberg then cites Anderson as suggesting that &quot;if global warming trends continue, an increase in average temperature by&quot; two degrees fahrenheit &quot;will result in 24,000 additional murders each year in the United States.&quot;  This is startling, so much so I would like to have some of the evidence and the reasoning leading to his conclusion.  But Blumberg does not provide any.  He does however cite a research paper by Anderson in the bibliography.<br />Another example of Blumberg really needing to tell us more than he does is from page 188 where he writes that on a &quot;practical level&quot; leptin is not likely to help the average overweight person because &quot;leptin costs nearly $200 per milligram.&quot;  Problem here is, how much leptin would one need--a milligram a month or perhaps a milligram a day?  Again Blumberg doesn't say.<br />This casualness of expression is really a shame because in perhaps the most interesting part of the book, in the chapter entitled &quot;Livin' Off the Fat,&quot; Blumberg presents some evidence that anorexia nervosa may to some degree be a disease caused by a thermoregulatory dysfunction. (pp. 191-196)  Unfortunately before he presents this argument hewrites that the &quot;discrepancy between the physical realities faced by most women and the messages portrayed by a minority of women who are so thin that many of them no longer have menstrual cycles has helped to generate a steady increase in the incidence of anorexia nervosa over the last twenty years.&quot; (p. 188)<br />I'm not sure what this means, except it sounds a lot like the usual lament about how the fashion media is in some sense responsible for anorexia.  Yet, he doesn't exactly say that, does he?  What he really says is that some &quot;women&quot; have &quot;helped to... increase&quot; anorexia!<br />Finally on page 204 Blumberg notes that there are &quot;many theories, some of them silly and some of them intriguing&quot; as to why we behave as we do in REM sleep.  However, he just leaves it at that without mentioning any of them except to say that temperature is a factor.<br />On the plus side, there is a lot of interesting information in the book about how heat and cold affect us and other animals, and plants.  I was surprised to learn that plants can heat themselves, that the skunk cabbage, for example, can melt snow (p. 92), and that some plants may be using heat instead of aroma or color to attract pollinating insects (p. 93).  Also interesting is the little known fact that the skin of polar bears is actually black (to absorb as much of the sun's heat as possible) while its fur of course appears white to match the snow and ice of its environment.<br />Bottom line: this is definitely worth reading; however I think the decision to avoid being technical and explanatory work against the value of the book.writes that the &quot;discrepancy between the physical realities faced by most women and the messages portrayed by a minority of women who are so thin that many of them no longer have menstrual cycles has helped to generate a steady increase in the incidence of anorexia nervosa over the last twenty years.&quot; (p. 188)<br />I'm not sure what this means, except it sounds a lot like the usual lament about how the fashion media is in some sense responsible for anorexia.

949742:US	49786731	R1F631ZMPCCZXM	0198601735	69619018	The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations	Books	5	96	97	N	N	Best choice for Brits	The question for most people looking to purchase a book of quotations is whether to get Bartlett's Familiar Quotations or The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.  So perhaps it would be a good idea to compare them and see which might better meet your needs.<br /><br />Both are important works of reference; both are authoritative.  Bartlett's latest edition, the 17th is from 2002 while this, the latest Oxford, is from 1999 with a reprint with corrections from 2001.  So both are relatively up to date.  Bartlett's is a slightly larger book with perhaps 300 more pages; however the number of actual quotations is not that different.  Both books quote over 3,000 authors and contain over 20,000 quotations.<br /><br />The most significant difference between them, to my mind, is that in the Oxford, English authors are favored both in terms of number included and entries by, which is to be expected since the Oxford is an British publication while Bartlett's is an American publication.  A quick check shows that British mathematician and philosopher Bertram Russell, for example, has more entries in the Oxford than he does in Bartlett's, whereas both Mark Twain and the Baltimore sage, H. L. Mencken, have more entries in Bartlett's than they do in the Oxford.  France's Voltaire commands just about the same space in either book.<br /><br />The next most important difference is that the quotations are presented alphabetically by author in the Oxford while Bartlett's presents them chronologically beginning with the oldest.  Both sources give author's dates.  Personally I find the alphabetical arrangement preferable because it often saves me a trip to the alphabetical \\"Index of Authors\\" in Bartlett's that I have to make before finding the author I am interested in.  When one is looking for a quote by keyword, which often happens, Bartlett's is slightly to be preferred.  Its Index is definitely longer (accounting for most of the difference in length between the books) and it is more extensively cross-referenced.  In looking up Marx's \\"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\" I found the quote in the Oxford from the keywords \\"according,\\" \\"abilities,\\" and \\"needs.\\"  In Bartlett's \\"according\\" did not work, but \\"each,\\" \\"abilities,\\" and \\"needs\\" did.  So that was a standoff.  However I found the Golden Rule and its source in Bartlett's without any trouble by looking under \\"Golden Rule\\" and under \\"do unto.\\"  In the Oxford neither \\"Golden Rule\\" nor \\"do unto\\" were in the Index of keywords.  Both books give Matthew 7:12 as the source.<br /><br />The Oxford has a slightly more international approach to religious texts.  There is a little less of the Bible here, but more of the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, and other non-Christian texts, except for the Tao Te Ching from Lao Tzu where Bartlett's has 34 entries to 19 for the Oxford.<br /><br />Another feature that the Oxford has that will be handy for some is its \\"Special Categories\\" which are \\"Advertising Slogans\\" (mostly for products sold in the UK), \\"Misquotations,\\" \\"Newspaper Headlines and Leaders,\\" \\"Political Slogans and Songs,\\" and fifteen more.  These are text boxes appearing alphabetically among the quotations.  Curiously they give the rather staid Oxford reputation a bit of a colloquial feel that may surprise some people.<br /><br />So how to choose between these two very excellent works of reference?  I like them both and if I had to part with either, I would reluctantly let the Oxford go.  However if I were English I would part with Bartlett's and keep the Oxford.  I really think they are that close in quality.  For a secondary consideration, I would prefer the Oxford since its slightly smaller size is a bit handier, especially when balanced on one's chest as one reads in bed!<br /><br />Bottom line: no serious writer (especially of literature, culture and history) should be without either this or Bartlett's.

I own both books and have examined them in some detail.  I have used the 16th for many years.<br /><br />The 17th is set in a new typeface which is both slightly narrower and less bold than that of the 16th.  The result is a cleaner look to the pages and more white space.  The difference in the number of pages--1431 for the new, 1405 for the old--is slight, and a little misleading.  In fact the new edition has more entries--\\"around one hundred\\" authors are quoted for the first time, and some authors have additional entries.  But the text in the 17th actually takes up less room. Its Index, for example, although it has more entries, has only 564 pages to 608 for the 16th.  This is accomplished mainly because the narrower type is also shorter, allowing more entries per column.<br /><br />The question then is, is the smaller type harder to read?  Surprisingly, I would say no.  The new type is sharper, crisper and, because the pages have a cleaner appearance, is easier on the eyes.  I have a strong suspicion that the publishers--whose investment in this most famous and most important reference work is considerable--tested the readability of their new type before adopting it!<br /><br />Some additional space, according to editor Justin Kaplan, has been gained by the elimination of \\"several hundred purely mechanical and nonsubstantive cross-references.\\"  For example in the 16th on page 247 is given this quotation from Fredrich von Logau: \\"Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small.\\"  A footnote at the bottom of the column refers us to Euripides and George Herbert who wrote something similar.  In the 17th that footnote is gone and we have no handy reference to the two earlier instances of von Logau's expression.  I think this is a clear loss and not something simply \\"mechanical and nonsubstantive\\" as editor Justin Kaplan has it in his Preface to the Seventeenth Edition. (p. viii)<br /><br />Okay, what about the new authors being quoted and the additional quotations by authors already present in the 16th addition?  Do they constitute a significant upgrade?<br /><br />This is a question difficult to answer partly because only time will tell if the new additions--many of them are so new--will really remain worth remembering.  Bill Clinton's rather infamous \\"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is\\" surely will be around for a while, but film director Cameron Crowe's \\"Show me the money!\\" from his film Jerry Maguire (1997) may not seem so memorable or familiar a generation or two down the road.  (Or maybe I have that backwards!)  A quick way to address the question of whether the new quotations are worthwhile is to look at the last pages of entries just before the Anonymous section.  Because Bartlett's presents its quotations chronologically, from the earliest (the first quote is from the Egyptian The Song of the Harper 2650 B.C.) to the latest (Sesame Street's Kermit the Frog's \\"It ain't easy bein' green\\") most of the new entries are near the back.  By the way, technically speaking, Kermit the Frog's dictum is older than Cameron Crowe's movie.  But that is a quibble.<br /><br />Of course there are additions that are not from new authors.  French mathematician, Pierre de Fermat, who does not appear in the 16th, appears here in the 17th, noting that his \\"truly marvellous\\" proof for his famous Last Theorem, will not fit into \\"this margin.\\"  Fermat was rediscovered by Bartlett's no doubt because in 1994 Andrew Wiles finally proved the theorem--taking considerably more than a margin to do it, by the way.<br /><br />Some other authors appearing for the first time are Mother Teresa, Richard Feynman, Margaret Atwood, Princes Diana, etc.  Vladimir Nabokov, Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein and W. Somerset Maugham are among about two dozen who have had their space extended.  Kaplan doesn't mention it, but there are also some deletions from the previous edition.  I was particularly disappointed to find that one of the central tenets of the Vedas, from the Chandogya Upanishad, \\"Thou art that\\" was eliminated.<br /><br />Also eliminated (and I think this is to the good) are the Ibid's that sometimes ran all the way down the page in the 16th.  Now the title of the work is repeated.<br /><br />If you don't have this reference, you really should get it or the comparable Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.  See my review of that very excellent book for a comparison.  Suffice it to say here, if you are an American who prefers a slight emphasis on American authors to an emphasis on English authors, you'll want to get this book.<br /><br />Bottom line: no serious writer (especially of literature, culture and history) should be without this invaluable and authoritative book.

As every science fiction writer knows, any futuristic venture, either in fiction or nonfiction, is an extrapolation from the present.  How prescient the writer is depends partly on how well he understands and observes the present and on how lucky he is.  I don't know how lucky sci-fi novelist Bruce Sterling is going to be as a visionary, but he definitely has a keen insight into the present.  To use his words, &quot;the victorious futurist is not a prophet.  He or she does not defeat the future but predicts the present.&quot; (p. xvii)<br />I have read recently, Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution (2001); Howard Bloom's Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century (2000); The Next Fifty Years: Science in the First Half of the Twenty-First Century (2002), a collection of essays edited by John Brockman; Francis Fukuyama's Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution (2002); Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence (1999), and others; and I can tell you this is as impressive (in its own way of course) as any of those very impressive books, and has the considerable virtue of being beautifully and compellingly written in a style that is polished, lively and sparkles with deft turns of phrase and a cornucopia of bon mots and apt neologisms.  Furthermore, Sterling really is a visionary of the present in that he sees connections and developments that most of us miss.  Here are some examples:<br />&quot;The sense of wonder has a short shelf life.&quot; (p. xvii)<br />Speaking of SUVs and cross-training shoes: &quot;Modern devices are overstuffed with functionality...&quot; (p. 81)<br />&quot;The right wing wants to leave the market alone but to regulate sex.  The left...[tolerates] domestic license but wants to regulate private industry.&quot; (p. 160)<br />&quot;...[F]oreign investors are entirely indifferent to...[the] phony-baloney national mythology&quot; of any given country.  &quot;They may feel very ardent about their own country, but they won't tolerate any pretension from&quot; someone else's country. (p. 162)<br />&quot;Garage sales became Ebay.&quot; (p. 224)<br />Speaking of the abundance of &quot;giant armadillos, sloths as big as hippos, three kinds of elephants,&quot; etc., and other fauna in North America before humans arrived: &quot;A natural Texas would look like the Serengeti on steroids.&quot; (p. 270)<br />On what is causing the glaciers to melt: we are &quot;digging up fossils...and setting fire to them.&quot; (p. 279)<br />&quot;The actual likelihood of people...getting atomically bombed is much higher today than it was during the cold war.&quot; (p. 260)<br />On the human-caused &quot;extinctions, and the sheer air-borne filth that comes from burning fossils&quot;: &quot;It will...[transform] the whole Earth into something like a grim mining town in East Germany, only without frogs.&quot; (p. 281)<br />Sterling sees the first &quot;superbaby&quot; as a very sad creature indeed because it will be superceded almost immediately by a superior version, and then by a super-superbaby, and will be superior only to its &quot;moronic parents.&quot;  (p. 30)<br />&quot;Blobjects...are computer-modeled objects manufactured out of blown goo.&quot;  They &quot;tend to be fleshy, pseudo-alive, and seductive...&quot;  Some examples: &quot;the Gillette Mach 3 razor.  The Oral-B toothbrush...  The Handspring Visor PDA.  Gelatinous wrist rests.  The curvy, slithery Microsoft Explorer mouse...&quot; (p. 75)<br />In addition to &quot;blobjects&quot; there are also &quot;gizmos&quot; which are &quot;small, faddish, buzzy machine[s] with a brief life span.&quot;  A computer is a gizmo.  There are also &quot;blobject gizmos.&quot;  (p. 89)<br />And on and on.  What Sterling is really writing here is social criticism.  He is revealing us to ourselves by highlighting our technology, our consumerism, and the way the various economic and political players--governments, corportions, terrorists, NGOs, etc.--are all out to manipulate us to their advantage.  His take on what he calls the dichotomy between the New World Order (the technological haves who are able to effectively manage information) and the New World Disorder (blighted areas of the planet taken over by terrorists, drug dealers and other high risk takers) is especially interesting.  He sees the weapons of the unconventional warfare that is now, and will continue to be, the norm in a revealing way.  He notes, for example, that terrorist-induced plagues, sometimes called &quot;the poor man's bomb,&quot; will only lead to the &quot;poor man's doom&quot; because &quot;Areas with organized governments and public health systems will be the last to collapse from germs and viruses, not the first.&quot; (p. 262)<br />Sterling's vision is of the postmodern world giving way to the posthuman.  He sees the disadvantage of our becoming part machine and part biologically-enhanced beings: we will &quot;still have some kind of everyday treadmill&quot; to negotiate, and we may even acquire a renewed respect for death. (pp. 299-300)<br />In the final chapter he touches on the notion of a &quot;Vingean Singularity&quot; (from Vernor Vinge) which is a place in the future &quot;impossible to describe, simply because&quot; we as human beings &quot;cannot comprehend&quot; such a posthuman environment.  In other words, like the event horizon of a black hole, the singularity allows no communication between us and that future world, and that it why it is called a singularity. (pp. 295-296)<br />Bottom line: be not dissuaded by the nay-sayers about this book, who may not like the unnecessary use of the extended metaphor from Shakespeare's As You Like It, which Sterling uses to frame the text (&quot;All the world's a stage...&quot;), or who are put off by Sterling's sometimes paternal and self-centered expression.  This is a terrific read.

Wilson's Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge (1998), Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (1997), and Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence (1999), that presents the distillation of a lifetime of learning by an original and gifted intellect on the subject of who we are, where we came from, and where we might be going, and presents that knowledge to the reader in an exciting and readable fashion.<br /><br />By the way, the very learned and articulate Howard Bloom (our author) is not to be confused with the also very learned and articulate literary critic Harold Bloom.<br /><br />Bloom's theme is the unrecognized power of group selection, interspecies intelligence, and the dialectic dance down through the ages of what he calls \\"conformity enforcers\\" and \\"diversity generators.\\"  These diametrically opposed forces, he argues, actually function as the yin and yang of the body politic, active in all group phenomena from bacteria to street gangs.  He is building on the idea that a \\"complex adaptive system,\\" such as an ant colony or an animal's immune system is itself a collective intelligence.  He extends that idea by arguing that a population, whether of humans or bacteria, is a collective intelligence as well.  Put another way, intelligence manifests itself as an emergent property of a group.  Furthermore, intelligence manifests itself as an emergent property of a collection of interacting groups.<br /><br />This idea is certainly not original with Bloom--indeed it is part of the Zeitgeist of our age--but his delineation of it is the most compelling and thorough that I have read.  It runs counter to the prevailing orthodoxy in evolutionary theory.  In particular it is in opposition to Richard Dawkins's selfish gene theories and Ernst Mayr's insistence that natural selection operates on individuals not on populations.  It is a synthesis of ideas that will, I believe, in the next decade or two, greatly alter the perspective of many of our scientific disciplines.<br /><br />Bloom also posits \\"inner-judges\\" which function like biological super-egos; and \\"resource shifters\\" which function like neural nets, rewarding those strands of the group that are successful, punishing those that are not.  To this he adds the playfully named \\"intergroup tournaments\\"; that is, war and other competitions between groups as close as human bands and as diverse as animals and their microbial parasites.  Bloom defines these ideas on pages 42-44 and elaborates on them throughout the book with a summary in the final chapter.<br /><br />The key idea that needs emphasis here is that Bloom believes (as I do) that evolution, cultural and biological, operates on groups as well as on individuals--groups of people, groups of animals, groups of microbes--cities, tribes, gangs, herds, species, bacterial colonies and viral masses.  He sees all forms of life as interconnected in ways that are not obvious, but discernable if we find the right perspective.  Bloom's perspective begins with the physics of the big bang, continues through pre-Cambrian microbial jungle, to the dialectic dance of Sparta and Athens, even to pre-September 11th Afghanistan (perspicaciously, by the way), until he concludes that all life on earth is, and has been, plunging toward an emergent property which might be called Gaia with a planetary brain.<br /><br />Some observations:<br /><br />\\"Reality is a mass hallucination\\" (p. 193) or \\"Reality is a Shared Hallucination\\" (title of Chapter 8; see also page 2 and page 170).  This declaration, expressed somewhat differently, is a tenet of Buddhism, but here Bloom makes the case from a scientific point of view, and he makes it very well.<br /><br />\\"Humans have been outfoxed...by a collective mind far older and nimbler than any we've developed to this point--the 3.5-billion-year-old global microbial brain.\\"(p. 115)  What Bloom is asserting here and throughout the book is that bacteria constitute a superorganism with an intelligence superior to ours that expresses itself through its complex chemistry and tactile behavior.<br /><br />\\"...[T]he brain we think belongs solely to our kind achieves its goals by tapping the data banks of eagles, wheat, sheep, rodents, grasses, viruses, and lowly E. coli.\\" (p. 220)  This dovetails with \\"We are modules of a planetary mind...\\" (p. 219) and \\"the global brain...is a multispecies thing\\" (p. 216), and the final line in the text, \\"We are neurons of this planet's interspecies mind.\\" (p. 223)<br /><br />In short, this is one heck of a book.  And I'm just talking about the text, which is written in a spirited--sometimes even giddy--style that is infectious and thoroughly engaging.  There are 66 pages of footnotes and a 62-page bibliography listing perhaps 500 titles.  Some of footnotes contain multiple references, and of course there are errors.  It is clear, for example, that human class did not exist 25 million years ago (as is asserted on page 148).  When one looks at Bloom's footnote for the assertion, one realizes that he probably meant 25 thousand years ago.  The point here is that we shouldn't be put off by all of his references.  Those references allow us to check on his facts and gauge his interpretations.  And, were any of us to actually read all of the approximately 500 titles he lists, I think we could at the very least apply for our own special ivory tower and some kind of honorary degree.<br /><br />Bottom line: read this book.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"(p. 115)  What Bloom is asserting here and throughout the book is that bacteria constitute a superorganism with an intelligence superior to ours that expresses itself through its complex chemistry and tactile behavior.<br /><br />\\"...[T]he brain we think belongs solely to our kind achieves its goals by tapping the data banks of eagles, wheat, sheep, rodents, grasses, viruses, and lowly E. coli.\\" (p. 220)  This dovetails with \\"We are modules of a planetary mind...\\" (p. 219) and \\"the global brain...is a multispecies thing\\" (p. 216), and the final line in the text, \\"We are neurons of this planet's interspecies mind.\\" (p. 223)<br /><br />In short, this is one heck of a book.

I say &quot;favored us&quot; because Darling is a writer who writes with the kind of clarity that we all wish we could achieve, and is therefore a pleasure to read.<br />By the way, my favorite David Darling book is Zen Physics: The Science of Death, the Logic of Reincarnation (1996), which is a very readable and profound look at human consciousness, a book I cannot recommend highly enough.  (See my review!)<br />Included here are objects and energies in space, instruments and machines for exploring space, mythological references to the heavens, historical cosmic events, catastrophes from space, ideas about space, space programs (some still only on the drawing boards), space scientists and scientists tangentially involved in some aspect of the extraterrestrial, scientists who have mentioned something otherworldly, historical figures that have mentioned something otherworldly, science fiction writers, movie and book titles about space, aspects of other sciences that could be applied to things extraterrestrial, etc., etc.<br />But this is not a dry reference book.  On the contrary it is exciting to read and fun to flip through.  Opening it at random to page 164 I find &quot;Galileo (spacecraft)&quot; which I learn is the &quot;first spacecraft to conduct long-term observations of Jupiter&quot; with Jupiter in bold face so that I know I can cross-reference it if I like.  There is a little table in the entry giving the launch date, the date of arrival at Jupiter and other information about the spacecraft.  Darling also uses bold-faced arrows in the text to point to related entries.  Here an arrow points to &quot;Jupiter, moons of,&quot; which has further information about the Galileo spacecraft.<br />The next entry is &quot;Galton, Francis (1822-1911)&quot; making me wonder what the old social Darwinian had to do with the extraterrestrial.  Turns out he proposed in a letter to the editor of the London Times in 1892 that sunlight be reflected toward Mars to catch the attention of any possible Martians.<br />Next are &quot;gamma rays&quot; and the &quot;gamma-ray burster&quot; (two full-page columns worth) carrying me to the next page where there is &quot;Ganymede,&quot; the Galilean satellite that is the largest moon in the solar system.<br />There are long entries on topics that Darling considers &quot;of central importance or popular interest&quot; such as Frank Drake's famous equation (Darling evaluates each variable) and SETI which includes a list of programs from 1960 to 1999 with information about the investigator, the location, frequency used, etc.<br />One senses that one of Darling's main tasks in compiling and writing this book was to decide what to include and what to leave out.  How pertinent does something have to be to be included?  I wasn't surprised to see paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould with an entry since his idea of punctuated equilibrium (also included) depends in part on catastrophic environmental changes, some brought about by extraterrestrial events.  Nor were the entries on the elements from the periodic table surprising.  (There's a very nice entry on the biological abundance of elements both here and in space.)  But I was surprised to find many entries on biology and microbiology, including entries on DNA and RNA.  And yet, one can see how they are relevant in thinking about extraterrestrial life.<br />As a side note, remember Whitley Strieber who wrote the book Communion: A True Story (1987), purporting to be an actual experience with aliens?--a book, by the way, for which he reportedly got a million dollar advance.  Well, according to the entry by his name here, he confessed in 1993 that he made it all up!<br />There's a chronology at the back of the book identifying events under the categories, &quot;The Search for Life in Space,&quot; &quot;Science Fiction,&quot; and &quot;World/Scientific Events&quot; beginning in 580 BCE.  There are also several pages devoted to Web Sites with URLs.  Darling has footnoted his text with 634 references giving book titles and journals for further reading.<br />One final thought: In the future there will be an encyclopedia devoted to every subject and to every creature and to every person under heaven.  And those encyclopedias will be on the Web (as will future editions of this book, I predict).  And it will be part of our life experience to update our encyclopedia, as Darling will surely have to do with this book in a few years.uot; &quot;Science Fiction,&quot; and &quot;World/Scientific Events&quot; beginning in 580 BCE.

I'm not sure why this essay from The New York Review of Books of January 16, 2003 was made into a book.  It's more like a pamphlet, and a short one at that.  Of course Joan Didion is an icon of the American left and a prose stylist deluxe as well as a trenchant social and political critic.  Perhaps what Didion has to say is of great importance and perhaps she says it very well.  Clearly the unstated assumption of the essay--that we would in fact bring about a regime change in Iraq (that is, we would invade Iraq) has proven prescient.<br />Didion's essay is in three parts.  The first part is mostly an observation on how the Bush administration is attempting to preempt criticism of its policies by labeling critics as somehow unpatriotic or worse.  One of the nice points she makes is that the &quot;war on terror&quot; is a misnomer since terror is not a state but a technique. (p. 8)<br />In the second part she identifies the first &quot;fixed idea.&quot;  She is talking about the government of  Israel.  She writes, &quot;Whether the actions taken by that government constitute self-defense or a particularly inclusive form of self-immolation remains an open question.&quot;  She goes on to say that almost no one in the US dare challenge the fixed idea that we must support the actions of the Israeli government.  She says that the question is seldom discussed rationally or at all (in her circle, it would seem) because &quot;few of us are willing to see our evenings turn toxic.&quot; ( p. 23)  That she herself has to bury this assertion into the very middle of her essay and to express it so obliquely reinforces her point perhaps more strongly than she might have imagined.<br />In the third part she reveals the second fixed idea, which she identifies as the &quot;theory&quot; behind the &quot;regime change in Iraq&quot; pronouncements made in 2002 by President Bush.  &quot;I made up my mind [the President had said in April] that Saddam needs to go.&quot; (p. 36)  The &quot;theory&quot; that Didion is talking about is sometimes called &quot;The Bush Doctrine&quot; or &quot;The New American Unilateralism&quot; or more bluntly, &quot;The American Empire.&quot;  The second fixed idea then is that &quot;with the collapse of the Soviet Union&quot; we have an opportunity and an obligation to move unilaterally and preemptively against our enemies as an imperial power might.<br />I'm not going to evaluate Didion's argument here--that is something you will want to do yourself--except to say that:<br />1) In reference to the rather high-handed attempt at managing the press and public opinion by the Bush administration, had the Democrats been in the White House post 9/11 they would have done something similar.<br />2) The actions of Hamas and the other Palestinian suicide/murder organizations make it difficult to take any side other than Israel's.  If the Palestinian people had better leadership that would pursue their goals in the spirit and manner of, say, Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr., they would find widespread (although not majority) support in the US; indeed, I believe, given world opinion, they would be successful.<br />3) Yes, we are indeed seeing the emergence of an American Empire.  Whether we will have the wisdom to use our power so that we do not go the way of Rome in a relatively quick manner will depend on our ability to work with other nations for the betterment of the entire planet.  This is something the Bush administration is not doing very well, but there is hope that the next administration will be wiser.eory&quot; that Didion is talking about is sometimes called &quot;The Bush Doctrine&quot; or &quot;The New American Unilateralism&quot; or more bluntly, &quot;The American Empire.&quot;  The second fixed idea then is that &quot;with the collapse of the Soviet Union&quot; we have an opportunity and an obligation to move unilaterally and preemptively against our enemies as an imperial power might.<br />I'm not going to evaluate Didion's argument here--that is something you will want to do yourself--except to say that:<br />1) In reference to the rather high-handed attempt at managing the press and public opinion by the Bush administration, had the Democrats been in the White House post 9/11 they would have done something similar.<br />2) The actions of Hamas and the other Palestinian suicide/murder organizations make it difficult to take any side other than Israel's.

The really sad thing about this book is that, although we might be entertained, and it sure feels good if nothing else to verbally abuse the bad boys of corporate America, it is all so morosely ineffectual and after the fact.  How many of the CEOs that columnist (and currently independent candidate for governor of California) Arianna Huffington lambasts here will actually do any jail time?  How many will pay fines that are more than a fraction of the benefits they have already received, benefits they have reinvested, benefits that are drawing dividends, interest and influence?  How many will even find their lavish lifestyles amended in the slightest?<br />The answer my friend is probably zero.<br />And so it goes (wrote Kurt Vonnegut Jr. in Slaughterhouse Five, but that's another story).  In the long run whether corporate executives will continue to find the means to rip off their shareholders is of little moment.  Let's say each visible pig managed to steal one way or the other an average of $40-million from his corporation; and let's say there are one thousand such swine.  How much does that cost us?  Forty million times a thousand is $40-billion big ones, or as Evertt Dirksen used to say, a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon we're talking real money.  Notice, by the way, that in small companies or in a business that you may happen to own, there is absolutely no chance that you could get away with ripping off...yourself!<br />Furthermore, remember that these oinkers have to spend that money on conspicuous consumption of some kind, a house on Long Island, an apartment in Manhattan, a yacht berth at Martha's Vineyard, Picassos and Rembrandts, a mistress, Chateau Petrus and Cuban cigars.  So some of it trickles down, and for most of us poor souls in the unemployment line (God, we're hardly alive! relatively speaking) it really doesn't matter much.<br />What does matter is how corporations are able to gain unnatural influence over our elected officials and thereby rip off the government, the environment, pollute the water and the air, drive smaller businessmen out of business, purchase public lands at garage sale prices, economically ensnare millions of workers (and then dump them when the time is ripe), and guess what, nobody can be held responsible!<br />I wish Ms Huffington had focused on these more substantial crimes of corporate America and on the way the system works to shield them and their execs from any real accountability.  I did enjoy her numerous flights of nasty rhetoric and the befuddling array of facts and figures she presents (I assume they are mostly right), and I have a lot of sympathy for those who got their pension funds shortchanged while the CEOs golden-parachuted on gossamer wings to the French Riviera or Barbados or a ranch in Texas.  I even feel some sympathy for the poor slob who bought Enron at ninety bucks and change or WorldCom at sixty-four fifty (see p. 41).  And it is true she has a table on page 115 entitled &quot;Buying Congress&quot; which lists the top five senators and top five congressmen in terms of campaign contributions from the accounting industry, 1989-2001.  The salient thing to notice, however, is that there are exactly five democrats and five republicans on the list.  What does that tell us about how things are going to go in the future?  With both political parties feeding heartily at the trough is there any chance that any of what Huffington rails against will change?<br />The answer my friend is the null set.  Until the laws of the land are changed so that corporations AND their executives are held responsible for their actions, business will continue as usual.  The rich will grow obscenely more rich, and someone, somewhere, who doesn't deserve, it will get ripped off once again.<br />And so it goes.thereby rip off the government, the environment, pollute the water and the air, drive smaller businessmen out of business, purchase public lands at garage sale prices, economically ensnare millions of workers (and then dump them when the time is ripe), and guess what, nobody can be held responsible!<br />I wish Ms Huffington had focused on these more substantial crimes of corporate America and on the way the system works to shield them and their execs from any real accountability.

Rex and the Crater of Doom	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Fascinating story of a great scientific discovery	It's interesting to see that this book is now being used as a text in high school and even junior high school science classes.  I had a great laugh from the reaction of a young reader who wrote that it was &quot;boring&quot; and that &quot;Innocent eight graders shouldn't have to read this stuff&quot;!<br />Ah, yes.  Innocence.  But 14-year-olds aside, this is a fascinating and delightful story of scientific discovery and triumph second to none.  It can be compared to James D. Watson's  The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA, both in terms of the importance of the discovery and for bringing to the reader some of the excitement and adventure of the quest.  It is not, however, as the title might imply, the reading equivalent of watching a Stephen Spielberg movie!  And perhaps we can be thankful for that.<br />T. Rex and the Crater of Doom is the story of one of the great scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.  Prior to Alvarez's work, it was not known what had caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.  Volcanism, disease, climate change, etc., were put forward as possibilities.  But in1970 Alvarez began to believe that a large meteor or a comet had struck the earth with enormous force causing the extinctions.  But how to prove it?  At first it wasn't even imagined how a meteor could bring about such a catastrophe; but gradually it was seen that the debris thrown into the atmosphere by the force of impact would encircle the earth and block out the rays of the sun for months or even years at a time, thereby killing off plants both on the land and in the sea, thereby collapsing the food chain and starving the dinosaurs and most other creatures.<br />This was the breakthrough idea, and an exciting idea it was.  Of course there was great resistance, as there always is in science when established opinions are threatened, and Alvarez and his team of scientists had to fight mightily against the orthodoxy of uniformitarianism which had held sway in geology and paleontology since the time of Charles Lyell.  It wasn't until twelve years later in 1992 that Alvarez's theory finally found general acceptance in the scientific community.<br />One of Alvarez's purposes in this book is to show a general readership how scientific discoveries are made and confirmed.  His tone is generous and he goes out of his way (unlike Watson in The Double Helix) to give credit to everyone involved.  He makes it clear that the work was a shared enterprise.  One thing that stood out in my mind was the central contribution from Alverez's father, Luis, a physicist who unfortunately died before the theory could be confirmed.<br />Alvarez does however allow himself an occasional sarcasm vis-a-vis the old order.  Characterizing the &quot;conventional geologic opinion&quot; on the formation of craters like the Meteor Crater in Arizona as due to &quot;mysterious explosions that occurred at random times and places for no evident reason,&quot; he appends this observation: &quot;In retrospect this causeless mechanism...is indistinguishable from magic, but at the time many geologists considered it preferable to catastrophic impacts.&quot; (p 76)<br />Science is especially subject to the braking effect of established opinion because it is extremely difficult for anybody to allow that the established beliefs of their entire professional career can suddenly be overturned.  All your life you believed one thing and one day you wake up and some whippersnapper has overturned the entire edifice!  That is hard to take, and so entrenched opinion wars against new discovery.  But that is as it should be since extraordinary claims do indeed require extraordinary proof.<br />Therefore, just as &quot;the course of true love never did run smooth&quot; (Shakespeare), so it is with science.  Alvarez recounts an early misdirection in the quest when it was thought that they had found plutonium-244 in the KT boundary clay, possibly indicating a nearby supernova explosion 65 million years ago.

It really doesn't matter how thoroughly columnist Jacob Sullum argues for the legalization of street drugs.  He can demonstrate the hypocrisy of marijuana prohibition, prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that alcohol is more dangerous than the killer weed; he can document the misinformation and outright falsehoods that masquerade as truths about illegal drugs; he can cite scientific studies that show that marijuana is less debilitating than alcohol; he can do these things and more (and he does) but it won't make slightest difference.  Marijuana, cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, PCP, and other street drugs will remain illegal.<br /><br />The reason is simple: the laws are predicated not upon rational debate or the presentation of evidence one way or the other.  The prohibitions are the result of emotional attitudes held by the people who make the laws and by those who elect them.  Sullum knows this; in fact this is one of his major points.  He shows how the current attitudes toward illegal drugs are just the reprise of historical attitudes toward not just the same drugs but toward tobacco, alcohol, and even coffee.  Any substance that has a mind-altering effect on people will be controversial at some level.  People are naturally suspicious of anything that alters their consciousness or the consciousness of their neighbors.  Consequently all such substances undergo the most strenuous test by the society into which they are introduced and will not be easily accepted.<br /><br />Marijuana continues to be tested by our society and rejected even though millions use it.  Alcohol was tested, as Sullum chronicles, throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth, the culmination occurring with the Volstead Act of 1919.  At first it seemed that the prohibitionists had won.  But a few years later it became clear that prohibition would not work and the act was repealed.<br /><br />Marijuana has not done as well.  The reasons for this are complex, including opposition from the established nicotine and alcohol purveyors who lobby against legalization, and from a law enforcement bureaucracy which has a vested interest in keeping pot illegal, but also from millions of non-users who want to stigmatize users as lawbreakers and members of a lower social class.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing Sullum does in this book is to show that street drugs are not nearly as debilitating as the prohibitionists would like us to believe.  He also does a good job of recalling the historical context that has led us to the present legalities.  However what he doesn't do very well is see the human drug experience from a biological and evolutionary point of view.<br /><br />I think it's important to understand that the yeast, for example, that produce alcohol (as well as the plant that produces the sugars that the yeast feeds upon) have formed a symbiotic relationship with human beings, a relationship that may be mutually beneficial--or not, depending on your point of view.  Marijuana in particular is an example of a plant that has been in a symbiotic relationship with humans since well before the dawn of history.  We can see this in the cannabis hemp that humans have found useful and in the seeds that we have eaten or at least fed to our animals.  However the resin that the female plant exudes is variously seen as the door to another consciousness by its champions or a noxious substance that saps our strength and leads us into immorality by others.  With such a divergent point of view, it is not surprising that marijuana is illegal.<br /><br />Other drugs are the highly concentrated products of plants, heroin from opium, cocaine from coca, etc., while still others are manmade chemicals patterned after natural occurring ones, amphetamines and LSD, for example.  Sullum argues that people once told lies about alcohol, coffee, tobacco, tea, etc., and are doing the same thing again about heroin and marijuana.  Yes, they are; however it does not follow (and Sullumacknowledges this) that the conclusions society will ultimately come to will be the same.  Each substance must be evaluated on its own merits, and on how the substance is taken, whether it is ingested, inhaled, injected, drunk, or snorted.  Sullum makes the further important point that dosage must also be considered.  How highly refined is the drug and how much of it does a user typically use?<br /><br />I think this book would be more effective if Sullum had emphasized the differences among the various drugs and had presented his arguments more succinctly.  Clearly he wanted to err on the side of being thorough.  But many of the points he makes are familiar articles in the on-going debate.  Furthermore his unabashed touting of drug use is certainly decades ahead of its time.  It is only when it becomes clear that legal drugs, such as produced by the great pharmaceutical companies, are being used because people like the effects they have on their minds, that the public will begin to look upon the taking of drugs for pleasure and recreation in a positive way.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"acknowledges this) that the conclusions society will ultimately come to will be the same.

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	5	31	35	N	N	Welcome to "Absurdistan"	This extraordinary work is quite a bit more than \\"a slice of life.\\"  It's more like a seven-course meal replete with a different wine for each course topped with cognac, coffee, tea and cigars--not to mention a steady stream of songs, dances, toasts, speeches, gossip and other staples of Russian life east--far east--of the Urals.  Relying on her experience as visiting professor at the Irkutsk State University in Irkutsk and the Far Eastern National University in Vladivostok during the years 1993-1995 when the fledgling Russian Federation was crashing headlong into the realities of the new market economy, Professor Hudgins has penned an amazingly detailed, colorful and often painfully vivid reminiscence of life in a place she and her husband Tom rightly dubbed \\"Absurdistan.\\"<br />Much of the book chronicles their day-to-day life amid the dreary poverty, the revolting filth, the depressing pollution, the mind-altering inefficiency, the endemic corruption, the physical danger and the stubborn backwardness and Big Brother paranoia that still characterized the Russian reality.  Living in a drab high-rise \\"village\\" often without electricity or running water, with elevators that seldom worked, in small rooms often without heat in below zero temperatures, where toilet paper typically consisted of pages cut from Soviet era books, subsisting on their wits and craftily purchased food and drink, Sharon and Tom made an adventure out of what most of us would rightly experience as a horror story.<br />Consider this from Chapter 7:  \\"The water that ran through our taps...ranged in color from clear to amber to orange to purple to black, with accompanying aromas of petroleum, sewer gas, ham, rotten eggs, or fish.\\"  Consequently they pumped all their water for drinking, cooking, and tooth brushing through a portable filtration device they had brought with them.  When the electricity was on they used the opportunity to boil water for future use, storing it in plastic bottles and an emergency 10-liter plastic container.  They saved and used and reused plastic bags for many purposes, including carrying home fresh meat from the market that was cut from the animal and placed in their hands.  They even reused the foil from Cadbury chocolate bars since there was no aluminum foil available.<br />Siberia is a cruel place, one must conclude from reading this book, yet a place where people survive in a hardtack economy buffeted with long cold winters and brief, sometimes sweltering summers, away from the dependable comforts of our world, a place pitifully short on glamour and indoor plumbing, a place I would rather read about than experience first hand.<br />That Hudgins did experience this first hand surprises me.  I wonder why she did it.  Part of the reason was her love of adventure no doubt, and part was to write a book about a country that she had been interested in since childhood, and part was to experience a culture in transition.<br />Central to that experience was her love of food and drink as exemplified by the way she describes in the most amazing detail the bizarre and sumptuous feasts she attended as well as exactly what she and her friends and neighbors ate on a daily basis.  Additionally she recounts ritualistic ethnic meals featuring strange dishes and the frequent imbibing of even stranger drink.  In one of them Tom is forced to eat raw salted liver still warm from the butchered sheep (while she was able to make herself otherwise busy away from the table!)  The food in general was so heavy and the accompanying drink so relentlessly alcoholic that I was weighted down by the mere experience of reading about it!  How Sharon and Tom could walk after some of the gluttonous meals forced on them by the dictates of the social graces, is beyond me.  Sharon never once admits to regurgitating, even though some days the eating and drinking began full force in the morning and continued throughout the day and even into the wee hours of the next morning.  One especially recalls tarasun, a liquor distilled from sour milk by the Buryat people that had the \\"unappetizing aroma of a baby's wet diaper.\\" (p. 139)<br />So outrageous was the cuisine that at times I felt like I was reading about a drunken episode of the TV reality show \\"Fear Factor\\"!<br />Yet there is great beauty in this forlorn land of corrupt petty bureaucrats, dirt poor peasants, and mafiya cowboys in shark skin suits.  There is the fabled Lake Baikal and environs, the land of the Buryats, historically a nomadic people akin to the Mongol hordes that once ruled half the world.  There is the extraordinary white of the Siberian winter when all imperfections are covered in a pillowy down while in the snowy forests Siberian tigers (God save them) still roam.<br />But most of what Hudgins describes made me realize how far the Western world has come from the days when the serfs still tilled the land in Russia, and how little removed the present day people of Siberia are from that way of life.  This sense is illustrated on the cover with the photo of the leather-skinned and shifty-eyed babushki in shawl selling radishes and onions from her dacha at market much as her ancestors did more than a hundred years ago.<br />Hudgins's book is attractively presented, well-edited, and written in a style that is at once thoroughly professional and as readable as a travel log.  There are four maps, a couple of dozen or so black and white photos of buildings, people and scenery, an Index, and a splendid \\"Bibliographic Essay and Notes\\" on the literature of Siberia and the Russian Far East.g.

The key word is \\"might.\\"  As it stands now there are no quantum computers at work; and, although there is apparently no theoretically reason they won't be developed in the future, there are a host of practical problems to be solved that suggest they may never be developed.<br /><br />Johnson acknowledges as much when he quotes French physicists Serge Haroche and Jean-Michel Raimond as saying that the small scale \\"hands-on experiments\\" with a few qubits that are currently being done \\"are more likely to teach us about the processes that would ultimately make the undertaking fail\\" than to teach \\"us how to build a large quantum computer.\\" (p. 169)<br /><br />As I understand it, basically the idea behind quantum compters is that (somehow) individual quanta (atoms, photons, electrons) are able to be in a particular state or not to be in a particular state; that is, either the equivalent of yes or no, but also in an indeterminate state; that is, a state that would signal yes and no at the same time!  Somehow (and I hope I am forgiven for not fully appreciating this)--somehow because of this fabled indeterminancy, quanta can be used to compute at a speed that is more than exponentially faster than digital computers.<br /><br />Johnson spends some series ink in trying to show how the atoms can hold and crunch numbers as long as they are not disturbed; that is, not measured in any way (which would bring about the famous \\"collapse of the wave function\\").  In this manner a problem that would take a digital computer weeks or months to solve could be solved in a fraction of a second.  Problems now actually impossible to solve in any reasonable length of time might become tractable after all.  The traveling salesman problem which grows exponentially more complex with the addition of each city, might very well yield to a quantum computer since the computational ability of a quantum computer itself grows exponentially with the addition of more quanta.<br /><br />Wow.  One of the reasons there is real money going into trying to develop these seemingly magical machines is that at present all the cryptography used by the military and big corporations relies on the fact that digital machines, no matter how fast, are not able to factor the codes.  However, a quantum computer could.  Furthermore, as Johnson explains, a quantum computer could also develop cryptography that could not be decoded.  So, whoever gets there first--assuming somebody can--will at the very least make a whole lot of money.<br /><br />What I found more interesting than the hope for a quantum computer are some of the insights into the quantum word that Johnson provides incidentally.  The biggest stunner for me was his assertion that quantum events can be used to generate random numbers.  It may come as a surprise to many people but in the world of classical mechanics there is literally no such thing as a truly random number generator.  But because radioactive nuclei decay on a random basis, they can, according to Johnson, be used to generate random numbers.  He writes that numbers generated in such a manner are \\"undeniable random.\\" (p. 91)<br /><br />Apparently this conclusion is a consequence of quantum indeterminacy.  In a way, it is a circular conclusion since if we could somehow predict the rate of radioactive decay we would violate indeterminacy.  I say \\"circular\\" when perhaps I should say \\"as a matter of faith\\" because there is no way a stream of numbers derived from radioactive nuclei decay can be proven to be random.  Indeed, no string of numbers can, by examination, be proven to be random.  If QM is true--and it is massively established--then the numbers are random.<br /><br />Perhaps this idea of randomness is similar to the notion of \\"nothing\\" in that it is only defined in a negative way, by which I mean random is the absence of order, andorder is in the eye of the beholder.  What seems random to human beings may be quite orderly from another point of view.<br /><br />Some of the book is pure fantasy.  His discussion of quantum banknotes in Chapter 9 is an example of something that is useful to think about because of the light it sheds on the nature of the quantum world, but any chance that we would actually use quantum banknotes (requiring temperatures near absolute zero!) approaches the null set. (p. 146)<br /><br />Other parts of the book are largely tangential (but interesting nonetheless).  For example Johnson's exploration in Chapter10 of \\"nondeterministic polynomial-time\\" problems, such as the above mentioned traveling salesman problem, the protein-folding problem and the software verification problem, is very interesting.  I was not aware that such problems were linked, but according to Johnson if one is solved, the others would yield as well.  The current thinking is that the only hope of solving such intractable problems is a large-scale quantum computer. (p. 164)<br /><br />Johnson is hopeful that such a computer can be developed and bases his hope in part on recalling just how intractable the problems toward the development of the sort of computers we have today seemed in the 1940s in the days of the vacuum-tubed Eniac computer which filled an entire room and had only a small fraction of the computational ability of my desktop. (p. 140)  However, whether history will repeat itself and the impediments be overcome remains to be seen.  It's exciting to think that they will.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"order is in the eye of the beholder.

Ryan shows in graphic language (and some photos that make one recoil), how the tuberculosis germ can eat away at human bodies, how it can poison and destroy lungs and internal organs, brain cells and bone, our skin, and indeed virtually every part of our body.  One sees through Dr. Ryan's eyes a parasitic pathogen that \\"knows\\" its victims so well that one gets the sense that tuberculosis has been a cruel and grotesque tax on humankind since the first light of history, that tuberculosis is the price we've had to pay for learning animal husbandry, for agriculture, for civilization itself.<br />And then came the medical science of the twentieth century which developed antibiotics and chemotherapies that by the 1950s had tuberculosis so in retreat that many spoke of its eradication.  Ryan brings the personalities that developed these cures and their struggles to life.  We see them fight against not only the microbe but the nearly intractable belief held by most medical authorities that nothing could defeat the tuberculosis germ, that such efforts were doomed to failure, and anyone claiming otherwise was a charlatan and a fool.  Ryan's book chronicles the story of the courageous, brilliant, and dogged people in the United States and in Europe--Gerhard Domagk, Rene Dubos, William Feldman, H. Corwin Hinshaw, Jorgen Lehmann, George W. Merck, Albert Schatz, Gylfe Vallentin, and Selman Waksman, to name a few of the most prominent--who actually developed a cure for this most horrible of diseases.  It is a story of personal danger, intrigue, obsession, personality conflict and territorial spats, patent laws and priorities, money, jealousy and friendship--failure and eventual triumph set against the backdrop of two world wars.<br />How ironic the story is!  How in direct contrast these two very human activities were: the heroic endeavor to cure disease, and the process of war--the latter a gross stupidity that served only to enhance the fertile ground of disease!  As one reads one cannot help but exclaim, Oh, shame, shame on you humanity for your cruel and mindless stupidities!  And hurrah for those who devoted their life to trying to understand the microbial world and its chemistry, to those who rose above the slaughter all around them and worked tirelessly to alleviate the pain and suffering of disease!<br />One wonders in reading this extraordinary story, how such grossly divergent behaviors by human beings can exist side by side: madness and the pursuit of knowledge.  The nature of these schizophrenic bed fellows of humankind is what Ryan has really chronicled here.<br />But the story, after perhaps two decades of euphoria, takes a ominous turn sometime around 1978 with the incipient rise of \\"reactivation tuberculosis\\" and the \\"AIDS-tuberculosis syndrome\\" (pp. 395-396).  Ryan shows that the struggle against TB, far from being over, is upon us once again with a new and terrible ferocity.  He notes with alarm how the tubercular bacterium has continued to mutate against the drugs that once cured it while HIV-crippled immune systems allow the pathogen to once again run rampant through the bodies of the compromised.  Already in our cities the tide against the \\"greatest killer of all time\\" has turned and the mortality rates are climbing.  And in the developing nations, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the disease in combination with AIDS threatens entire generations.<br />Ryan estimates that 1.7 billion people in the world harbor the tuberculosis germ,an astonishing number.  He calls this a \\"global time bomb\\" waiting to explode. (p. 404)  He quotes health officials as claiming as long ago as 1991 that Africa was \\"already lost.\\"<br />This is a beautiful and horrifying book that chronicles one of the greatest triumphs of medical science while making all too vivid the fact that \\"the ageless leviathan of terror\\" (p. 378) is still very much with us, and is likely to continue to evade our efforts to eradicate it.an astonishing number.

A third ingredient, a more than passing knowledge of high tech, crime-related gadgetry including some extensive weapons knowledge, nicely enhances the text, demonstrating that Gregg Hurwitz knows his stuff.<br />Quite simply, Hurwitz is a very good writer who put an enormous amount of energy into the research, planning and writing of this novel.  He is also a guy who, at least in part, is enamored of two-fisted justice and the action hero as seen in movies starring, e.g., Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, and Silvester Stallone.  If you liked Paul Kersey, Dirty Harry, and Rambo, you will love The Kill Clause.<br />Hurwitz begins with the tried and true formula for righteous vengeance so beloved by Japanese and Hollywood action/adventure movie-makers by raining grievous and horrific harm upon his upstanding (and very talented) hero Deputy US Marshal Tim Rackley.  Hurwitz takes no chances here: Rackley's beautiful seven-year-old daughter is raped, murdered and mutilated by a sickie who is set free on a technicality.  Then, when Rackley courageously and heroically shoots a couple of murderous drug dealers in self-defense, a front page newspaper pix showing his fellow officers celebrating with high fives turns a \\"good shooting\\" into a request that he take some time off while they investigate.<br />Instead, Rackley turns in his badge.  Meanwhile, because of their shared grief, his marriage to the love of his life is going south.  He moves out of their Moorpark, Simi Valley, California home and takes up residence in a dive in the inner city of L.A.--all the better to provide cover as he sets out to right some wrongs.<br />Now comes a counter-complication: Rackley is seduced by a motley crew of self-styled vigilantes who, through star chamber type trials, want to identify, judge, condemn and execute various violent criminals that the law has let go free for one reason or another.  They want Rackley to do the executing, and they hold over his head as inducement the prospect of knowledge about others involved in the murder of his daughter.<br />Where Hurwitz is not entirely the novelist he would like to be (judging from his self-conscious press-release statement: \\"I don't like being dismissed because I've chosen to address issues in a medium that's suspenseful and plot-oriented\\"), is in the shallowness of his characters and his handling of male-female relationships.  While his hero, Tim Rackley is seemingly explored in great depth, one cannot escape the sense that Rackley is really just a fantasy projection of Hurwitz's youthful idealism.  The minor characters are quirky, kinky and extreme in a fascinating way that blinds us to the fact that they are also as deep as a puddle on the linoleum kitchen floor.  And the second most important character in the book, Tim's police officer wife, Dray Rackley, despite being both feminine and tough enough to flip pukes, is never really revealed as anything more than a TV, politically-correct kind of housewife.  I would liked to have seen her do more than hold Tim's hand and run some errands.<br />Hurwitz knows the genre and he knows the requirements.  He is expert, and his expertise will pay off handsomely.  But if he wants to go beyond the commercial novel to a work of art (and by the way, I'm not so sure he should) he needs to free himself from the psychology of the thriller novel, and follow the human truth wherever it may lead.  (Of course the price for that will likely be no assured place on the best seller list and no movie option.)<br />Let me give an example of what I mean.  Hurwitz obviously read some stats on what happens to marriages when the children die young.  The stats show that the now childless couplestend to have a higher divorce rate than other couples.  Hurwitz worked this into a subplot as he made us see Tim and Dray lose their desire for one another and begin to drift apart as they tried, each in his or her own way, to cope with their tragic loss.<br />However, if he had followed another kind of logic (say from evolutionary psychology), he might have had Tim and Dray become ravenously hungry for one another, a truth that I think would have been closer to the reality of his characters who, after all, deeply loved and were strongly attracted to one another.  Indeed such a \\"truth\\" might have given their personas a psychological depth that they lacked.  But would that play?  Not in a novel aimed at a readership looking for escapist fare.  Such sexual v&eacute;rit&eacute; would be distracting at best and disturbing at worst.<br />One other thing: the theme of the novel could be summed up in these words: our courts \\"do not address justice--only the law.\\"  A press release quotes Hurwitz as saying something similar, and similar words appear in the book.  This is a problem that haunts our society, but Hurwitz's novel does not provide an answer.  Clearly the path chosen by Hurwitz's morally-challenged vigilantes can be seen to be rejected by the way the novel develops.  But how do we provide both justice and remain within the rule of law?  Perhaps a commercial novel is not the right place to answer such a question.  I would note that one of the distinctions that Hurwitz does not make in this novel is between justice and revenge.

Hurwitz worked this into a subplot as he made us see Tim and Dray lose their desire for one another and begin to drift apart as they tried, each in his or her own way, to cope with their tragic loss.<br />However, if he had followed another kind of logic (say from evolutionary psychology), he might have had Tim and Dray become ravenously hungry for one another, a truth that I think would have been closer to the reality of his characters who, after all, deeply loved and were strongly attracted to one another.  Indeed such a \\"truth\\" might have given their personas a psychological depth that they lacked.  But would that play?  Not in a novel aimed at a readership looking for escapist fare.  Such sexual vérité would be distracting at best and disturbing at worst.<br />One other thing: the theme of the novel could be summed up in these words: our courts \\"do not address justice--only the law.\\"  A press release quotes Hurwitz as saying something similar, and similar words appear in the book.  This is a problem that haunts our society, but Hurwitz's novel does not provide an answer.  Clearly the path chosen by Hurwitz's morally-challenged vigilantes can be seen to be rejected by the way the novel develops.  But how do we provide both justice and remain within the rule of law?  Perhaps a commercial novel is not the right place to answer such a question.  I would note that one of the distinctions that Hurwitz does not make in this novel is between justice and revenge.  The latter word hardly appears but \\"justice\\" is replete throughout.  Perhaps a clear understanding between the emotion of revenge and the legal concept of justice is necessary before we can address the problem of violent criminals slipping through the cracks.	2003-08-21

This is my letter to the World<br />That never wrote to Me-<br />The simple News that Nature told-<br />With tender Majesty<br />Her message is committed<br />To Hands I cannot see-<br />For love of Her - Sweet - countrymen-<br />Judge tenderly - of Me<br />  --\\"A Blogger's Anthem\\" (actually a poem by Emily Dickinson, c. 1862--change the \\"Hands\\" in line 6 to \\"Eyes\\" and it fits rather nicely.)<br />Well, the novel is dead or dying, I forget which, and there's no cinema in Hollywood, and TV's still a wasteland, and pro wrestling's fixed (yes, sad), and the news is biased, and I don't need no stinkin' make-over, etc.  So why not blog?<br />Is it an ego trip?  Cheap psychotherapy?  Pathetic?  How about an exercise in futility?  Or a way to know for sure how meaningless your life really is?  (And a way to document same?)<br />A new art form?  The new New Journalism?  A synergistic combination of link and commentary?  Open letters to the world?  A great adventure in self-discovery?  A way to make friends and influence people?<br />Judging from this book which serves as a spiffy, if limited, introduction to the world of blog, all of the above, I would guess and something more.  In fact, anything at all.  Link and ye shall know.  Write and somebody might write back.<br />There's a Glossary.  It's short.  The first word I looked up (\\"filter\\") wasn't there.  That's my test.  I read a technical word in the text that I am not sure about and I flip to the Glossary.  I do this three or four times.  If it's there, good Glossary, otherwise not.  There are footnotes.  All are URLs.  Cute.<br />And there are chapters.  In six parts: A Brief History; Meet the Bloggers; Blog, Blog, Blog; Advice; Weblogs vs. Traditional Journalism; and Community.  Neat.  Each chapters is written by a different blogger including Rebecca Blood, who wrote the Introduction, and Weblogs, A History and Perspective.  Here are some examples of the most interesting chapters:<br />Weblogging: Lessons Learned by Kulesh Shanmugasundaram whose dicta include: \\"Content is everything.\\"  That's a duh, but a Great Big Duh.  And \\"Having ten million hits is not the game plan.  Having 10 regular readers is a home run.\\"<br />The Libera Manifesto by Chris Pirillo, whose words of wisdom include: \\"Most of us seek recognition, not fame\\" and \\"Opinions aren't wrong.\\"<br />Metascene's Ten Tips for Building a Bionic Weblog.  His style is lively, snappy, a bit of a controlled hard-boil (and foul-mouthed), but somehow mature, and includes this gem: \\"Once in a while remind yourself that just because it happened to you does not necessarily make it interesting.\\"<br />Put the Keyboard Down and Back Away from the Weblog by Neale Talbot.  He gives an example of a Blog Style Journal and a Journal Style Blog, and comments, \\"I'm not sure which one is worse.\\" (Actually both are great.  See page 158.)<br />Tim Cavanaugh's Let Slip the Blogs of War has the virtue of pointing to what might be expected of a lot of blog text: it's political.  The political fires are what motivate some bloggers to blog.  \\"The weblog is not the most useless weapon in the War On Terrorism,\\" he writes.  \\"That title is still held by the nuclear submarine.\\" (p. 189)  Clever, but I think he's wrong.  The decentralized exchange of opinions that blogs offer may be exactly what we need, the fact that the blogs that Cavanaugh read were pretty much lockstep jingoism, notwithstanding.  There are other opinions that go out to the world.<br />What is wonderful about the blog is that it allows almost anyone to have his or her say (with the hope that somebody might be listening).  Yes, the journalism is mostly somebody else's (but often there's a link); and as an art form the blog is in its infancy--although some bloggers would surely say the opposite, that blogging is already a mature art form (measured at the speed of webtime), and out there in Cyberspace, already quietly perfecting their art, are the Shakespeare and Botticelli of blog.  Andthey aren't necessarily A-list.<br />Or is blogging possibly a way to fame and fortune?  Will it be possible some day to make a living as a blogger?  Ah yes, a tenth of a cent a hit cometh your way.  Ten thousand hits a day = a hundred dollars.  (I just wish they would charge even a tenth of a penny for each e-mail.  That would hit the spammers where it hurts.)<br />If nothing else this book inspired me to check out the blogs themselves.  I was expecting some pretty amateurish stuff, but the ones I looked at were easy on the eye and fairly well composed and edited.  They combined links with commentary.  Many were political and some were obviously biased, but that is to be expected.  If you take the time to surf I suspect almost anybody will find a blog that appeals.<br />Ironically this excellent little book makes the point that blogging is another example of the decentralization of the publishing world.  This is a semi-official acknowledgment that the commercial publishers are watching.  Where blogging will lead is anybody's guess.  Maybe someday everybody will have a blog, started from youth and continued throughout one's life.  Instead of a resum&eacute; or a formal introduction, you will send the URL to your blog.

1012608:US	49786731	R1A9CGTNQHDWG4	0871139014	458016722	Into the Silent Land: Travels in Neuropsychology	Books	4	47	47	N	N	The philosophic and human implications of neuropathology	A blurb on the cover touts neuropsychology Professor Broks, author of this intriguing book, as \\"The new Oliver Sacks.\\"  While any writer on neuropathology would be flattered to be compared to the renowned Dr. Sacks, whose books include the fascinating The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and other clinical tales (1987), I don't think such a comparison is fair to either man.<br /><br />While Broks and Sacks write about the sometimes bizarre consequences of neurological disorders, they do so from a different perspective.  Sacks is more tightly focused on the patient and the pathology whereas Broks concentrates more on his personal experience as a neuropsychologist and the philosophic and emotional consequences of those experiences.  Furthermore, while Sacks writes with an uncommon clarity and eloquence, Broks relies on a more literary style with excursions into memoir, story (sometimes reminding me distantly of Borges), Socratic dialogue, and dream sequence.<br /><br />Each chapter in the book is a personal experience essay.  Some chapters recall patients with disorders, some do not.  Some chapters are intensely personal, as is the final chapter on the experience of his wife's breast cancer.  Others are almost completely philosophical.  What can pathology, especially neuropathology, teach us about what it means to be human and to be self-aware is what Broks is asking in all of the chapters, sometimes directly, sometimes obliquely.  His answer is equivocal and meandering; in short he isn't sure.  I respect that because I'm not sure either, and I don't know anyone who is.<br /><br />Broks begins by experiencing the pulsating brain as raw meat.  He is mesmerized by the \\"absolute conviction\\" that in the flesh \\"behind the face\\" being probed by the surgeon, \\"there's no one there.\\"  (p. 17)  This leads him to reject the \\"Mysterian\\" position on consciousness and Cartesian dualism.  He excises the ghost in the machine and comes to realize that the \\"I\\" of our experience is nowhere at all, but is an ever-changing, ever constructing presence among the modules of the brain.<br /><br />\\"Thoughts, feelings, and intentions produce me, not the other way around,\\" is how he expresses it on page 80.  He sees the \\"I\\" that experiences and reflects upon experience as \\"not a single thing, or a thing at all,\\" but as \\"a principle of biological organization.\\" (p. 100)<br /><br />This is a profound insight from modern neuroscience and philosophy as presented by people like Francis Crick and Daniel Dennett, whom Broks cites, and others.  But Broks is neither completely satisfied with this unsettling point of view, nor is he complacent to leave it at that.  In my favorite chapter of the book, \\"To Be Two or Not to Be,\\" Broks presents a science fiction scenario in which one is teleported to Mars.  One's body is exhaustively copied on Mars from information sent from Earth.  Every single atom is replicated exactly as it appears in the original and then the original is destroyed, allowing one to travel at the speed of light.<br /><br />In effect this is a thought experiment asking the question \\"Who are you?\\"  Are you the original or the copy?  The copy assures us that he is the same continuous being that was on Earth and is now on Mars.  He is the father of his children, the husband of his wife, and is the man who was once the child.  He has all this in his memory.  He certainly did not die.  And besides he has done this a dozen times and is still alive.<br /><br />But Broks throws a monkey wrench into this scenario by having the original not destroyed.  Now who is who?  And if the original is now to be destroyed, how does he feel about that?<br /><br />What is different from the man on Earth and his identical on Mars?  Absolutely nothing (although because of their now different environments they are beginning to change).  Yet the original prefers that he continue living, as does the copy.<br /><br />This story really highlights the Buddhist idea that we do notexist as we think we do.  There is no \\"self,\\" no \\"ego-I\\"; we do not die because we were never living in the sense that we think we were.  What exists is pure identification, so to speak, that everybody has identically.  That does not die.  It is always there in a sentient being.<br /><br />Broks acknowledges this Buddhist perspective, admits that in some sense he is uneasy about it; admits that in some sense, at some times, he is a Mysterian, who does believe in something non-material in ourselves.  (See \\"Right This Way, Smiles a Mermaid\\" beginning on page 132.)<br /><br />Another point that Broks makes is that we do not exist in isolation.  \\"The working brain has to be understood not only as part of a larger biological system (the rest of the body), but also as a component of the wider social system.\\" (p. 102)  I would add that we are also part of this planet and its systems, and in the most minute, but real sense, part of the cosmos.<br /><br />Broks believes that the familiar soul-body dualism from Decartes is hard-wired into our brains by the process of evolution. (p. 138)  He also believes that \\"phenomenal consciousness--the raw feel of experience--is invisible to conventional scientific scrutiny and will forever remain so.\\" (p. 140)<br /><br />I agree that the idea of a soul is adaptive in an evolutionary sense.  It allows for us to have hope in many seemingly hopeless situations.  It furthers the adaptiveness of the tribe which furthers the adaptiveness of the members of the tribe.  I also agree that such phenomena as the taste of ice cream, the experience of the color red, etc., are not subject to scientific evaluation.  Science is preeminently a social exercise in that, without peer review and confirming experiments by other scientists, would not exist as such.

1017470:US	49786731	R17W5SN3X1KIBV	0595227600	741450987	Nebraska Farm Life WWI to WWII	Books	4	6	6	N	N	The American heartland recalled	This is an example of a family history that is so well done that it speaks for hundreds of similar families and their communities all across rural America.<br />The details are interesting because the authors focus on the concrete day-to-day activities central to their lives, including interactions with family and friends, what it was like at school and church, what kind of work was done on the farm (particularly interesting to this city boy), the animals they husbanded, the crops they grew, and the games they played as children.  Included are reminiscences of people who drifted in and out of their lives working in the fields and in the house.<br />The authors avoid controversy, seldom pass judgment and keep the gossip and censuring to a minimum.  They don't glorify themselves, although it's clear that the McCalls were a fine upstanding bunch who helped others and worked hard.  They give the facts of their experience without embellishment and without curlicues: who married whom, who died of what, who ran off with whom, who taught school and who preached on Sunday and how they were received.  The hardships and the pleasures, the May baskets and the winter snows, the locusts and the dust are recalled with something close to nostalgia and sometimes even affection.  That world of long ago is recalled without sentimentality in a matter-of-fact, laconic style that I found attractive.<br />The locale is near Red Cloud (home of Willa Cather) and the time is the period between the world wars, which of course included the depression years.  One gets the sense that life on the farm was hard but fulfilling, and that there was a sense of community imposed on people because they had to help each other in times of crisis, a sense of community that I think is often missing in today's America.  They lived close to the land and to our fellow creatures, close to the weather and the progression of the seasons.<br />Much of the text is in the form of anecdotes and stories, some wryly funny and some sad, and some in the form of something akin to a tall tale.  The story of the woman who fed the chickens potato sprouts and upon finding that they couldn't digest the sprouts, cut the chickens open, removed the sprouts, and sewed the chickens back up, is perhaps an example.  The authors comment dryly, &quot;...the story is she saved 90% of them.&quot;  (p. 83)<br />Then there is the story of the hired woman who didn't like babies.  But &quot;She hadn't been [at the McCall's farm] two weeks before the baby had made a slave of her.&quot;  After &quot;quite a long while...she left to be married...and became a very good mother...which just goes to show you that a baby's smile goes a long way.&quot; (p. 49)<br />I also liked the reminiscences about the telephone party line in which everybody listened in on everybody else's conversation, and how wheat chaff can irritate the skin, and how wounds were healed, and how animals and people were doctored.  The authors end chapter 10 talking about the twenty cats they had around the farm and the dog that chased off an intruder with the observation that in those days no one &quot;would spend money for veterinary care for these dogs and cats.  If they got sick, they lived and died on their own.  Wounds were treated with axle grease to keep the flies out of the wound.&quot;<br />There are 14 chapters describing everything from the  The Town, The Family, The Hired Men, The Hired Girls, Health Conditions, Veterinary Medicine on the Farm, to The 1935 Republican River Flood, to Fun and Games and Food.  There are a few black and white photos of people and buildings for atmosphere and very appropriately a photo of the flyer that advertised the auction on November 18, 1972 in which the machinery, household goods, tools and other items of the McCall farm and estate were sold off.<br />One of the benefits of the decentralization of the publishing industry and the rise of the Internet selling of books is it allows titles to reachthe public that otherwise would perhaps never see the light of day, and even if they did would only achieve a limited distribution and readership.  Nebraska Farm Life is such a book.  It is unlikely that a commercial publisher would publish this excellent book because there is little chance that it would reach a large readership, and the university presses would probably turn it down because of its narrow focus and because the authors have limited academic credentials.  But we are the better for its publication because of the light it sheds on a time and place that is nearly gone and forgotten.the public that otherwise would perhaps never see the light of day, and even if they did would only achieve a limited distribution and readership.

1022219:US	49786731	R1NCPRNZONETSX	1583224890	746847725	9-11	Books	3	26	39	N	N	The political Chomsky	In this diminutive book, world renowned linguist Noam Chomsky responds to questions posed by journalists (many foreign) following the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States.  It should be emphasized that these \\"interviews\\" (mostly conducted by e-mail) have been edited and revised for publication in book form so that included are quotations from journalists and commentators to support Chomsky's arguments, quotations that would not necessarily have been at the ready during the interviews.<br />In reading the political Chomsky one is struck by his almost singular desire to focus on the short-comings of the United States and to balance terror against the US with terror by the US.  Several times in the book Chomsky calls the US \\"a terrorist state.\\"  This is a view that many in the world find persuasive, especially those who have experienced the use of force and violence by the US, or even those who believe that they are being exploited by the US economically.  And one can argue from a definition of \\"terrorism\\" as Chomsky does that the US has committed acts that are terrorist in nature.<br />But the same thing could be said of every significantly non-isolationist state throughout human history.<br />The problem then with Chomsky's critique is not so much that it is false, but that it is unfair.  He does not take into consideration what another people or another nation state would do if they were in the position that the United States is in.  We can imagine how Nazi Germany might deal with terrorist attacks were it the only superpower left in the world.  We can speculate on how the Soviet Union would handle the First and Third Worlds had it won the Cold War.  We can even imagine how France or China or Iraq or a hundred other countries might behave had they the opportunity (and the responsibility) of being the nine-hundred pound gorilla in the jungle of nation states.  Would any of them do a better job than the US?  Would they be more humane and kill fewer people?  Would they take less for themselves and leave more for the underdeveloped, undereducated and vulnerable peoples of the world?  Or would they take more, and more brutally repress challenges to their position and prerogatives?<br />No one knows the answer to these questions, but Chomsky seems ignorant of their relevance.  In a sense he argues from the position of an ideal that does not exist in the real world.  He argues not from an ivory tower so much as from a pearly gate.  And I would like to remind him that the United States is the only country in the history of the world to rebuild the societies of the vanquished as we did after World War II, and as we are trying to do in Iraq.<br />I also think that Chomsky is mistaken in his belief that an armed response to terrorism only brings about more terrorism.  On page 64 he quotes London Times journalist Simon Jenkins as saying that \\"what the perpetrators of the Manhattan slaughter must want above all\\" is a massive military assault that would kill many innocent civilians.  Chomsky adds that such a slaughter would \\"mobilize others to [bin Laden's] horrendous cause.\\"  I think it is more likely that others would be mobilized to further terror against the United States if we did not act at all.  The point is to respond as EFFECTIVELY as possible.  This is what the US is trying to do.  Whether we have the skill and the knowledge necessary to be effective against terrorism remains to be seen, but clearly we are steering a course between mass murder and doing nothing, which is really the only reasonable course.<br />Finally, I don't agree with Chomsky's idea that a proper first response to terrorism is to look into the causes of terrorism.  The causes are murky and multitudinous, often triggered by social pathology.  The first response is to make terrorism a high risk venture for both the perpetrators and their supporters and to take defensive measures to protect ourselves from them.  Then, and only then, can we look into the social, political and economic causes of terrorism and see what we can do to change them.  Be assured that as long as the US is rich and powerful there will be those who out of jealousy and hatred will want to harm us.  No amount of perfect behavior on the part of the US will change that.<br />While I have a great respect and admiration for Chomsky as a linguist--his demonstration that the basic structures of language are mostly innate attributes of human beings and not something learned is one of the great scientific insights of the twentieth century--I don't think he is entirely effective as a political commentator.  Nonetheless I think we need him as much as we need, say, ex-army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, whose views on terrorism (see his recent Beyond Terrorism) may be contrasted with Chomsky's.to the social, political and economic causes of terrorism and see what we can do to change them.

1026140:US	49786731	R11SWR8VDFJRI	0811700240	632808331	Beyond Terror: Strategy in a Changing World	Books	4	38	43	N	N	Machiavelli updated and shock-jocked	It's easy to get swept up in the rhetoric that jumps so glibly from the adroit fingertips of the verbally gifted former army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters.  Indeed Peters occasionally gets swept up in it himself.  For example, while marveling at the rapid change and dislocation characteristic of our times (so that \\"the collapse of the Roman Empire looks glacial by comparison\\"), Peters is led to exclaim, \\"Much of humanity is returning to the days of witches, anti-Christ, and self-willed apocalypse.\\" (p. 87)<br /><br />Well, not exactly.  The degenerating culture in the Middle East that Peters so well delineates in the second essay in this collection has nothing to do with Christian apocalyptic delusions, nor have the horrors experienced by the people in sub Saharan Africa.  And while there are nut cases in this country (as there have always been in Europe and the US) that believe in witches and warlocks and the Biblical anti-Christ, most of humanity is actually just trying to make a living.<br /><br />Peters also loses it a bit when he writes \\"Men like to kill.\\"  He adds that some dislike it, but \\"the latter are few.\\"  Furthermore, \\"For many men, there is no more empowering act than taking a human life.\\" (p. 83)<br /><br />Again the generalization would be acceptable if indeed it applied to even a bare 51% of humanity.  But it doesn't.  The thugs and henchmen and Saddam Hussein-like warlords and bullies are greatly in the minority.  Otherwise we could hardly cross the street.  Peters shows that he realizes that he is overstating the case when he writes: \\"The crucial violence is usually perpetrated by a smallish number of actors...with a still larger group enjoying the spectacle of the violence and, perhaps looting.\\" (pp. 86-87)<br /><br />This is closer to the truth.  Most people do not actually like to kill.  We like to get others to do it for us.  We don't even like to kill the cows and the pigs that we eat.  We have specialists to do that for us.<br /><br />It would be easy to dismiss Peters as a kind shock jock for those that can read or a postmodern son of Strangelove were it not for the fact that he is often right, and that he makes some critical points that cannot be ignored.  He is especially effective in the opening essays in the book, \\"Our Place in History\\" which was written for this volume, and the above mentioned second essay, \\"When Devils Walk the Earth: The Mentality and Roots of Terrorism and How to Respond,\\" which was written for a thinktank a month after September 11th, and could easily serve as guidance for President Bush.  I suspect Bush has read this essay, although I don't expect him to admit it publically.  Peters's Machiavellian advice would not play well in the media and is not the sort of reasoning that heads of state reveal to the public.<br /><br />In the first essay (also perhaps given as advice to the Commander-in-Chief) Peters calls for an \\"enlightened\\" American empire, arguing that given the state of real politics in the world, mainly that we are the only superpower left, we have no choice but to accept the mantle and do our best.<br /><br />I think there is more truth to this than most people, both here and especially in Europe, would like to admit.  He makes the salient point that the American empire (already a partial reality) differs from that of Rome in that \\"our empire is cultural and economic, a matter of influence and the occasional exercise of military power, and not one of conquests and exploitation.\\" (p. 19)  I would add that our battalions take the form of multi-national corporations that serve to direct tribute and lucre to the US through economic power rather than by force of the sword.<br /><br />In \\"When Devils...\\" Peters psychoanalyzes the Islamic Middle East coming up with an indictment that could be summed up with these words from page 46: \\"We [the vibrant, creative states of the West and the Pacific Rim] are succeeding, the Islamic world is failing, and they hate us for it.\\"  This is almost exactly the diagnosis presented (more gently) by Middle Eastern scholar Bernard Lewis in his books, What Went Wrong? Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response (2002) and The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Holy Terror (2003), and it is one that I think is substantially correct.<br /><br />The central point of the essay however is to make a distinction between \\"practical terrorists\\" who just want to seize power, and \\"apocalyptic terrorists\\" who want to destroy our civilization and kill us all.  Peters presents a 25-point \\"take no prisoners\\" program for dealing with such \\"monsters.\\"  His advice, simply put, is kill them before they kill us.

1026658:US	49786731	R208QTTD4OG8BT	1400034639	467724921	War Is a Force that Gives Us Meaning	Books	4	30	38	N	N	There's a deep ambiguity in the title	Award-winning New York Times foreign correspondent Chris Hedges' scathing indictment of war is one of the truest rants you'll ever read; that is, until he gets to the cause and the explanation of war, and then I am afraid his education, not his experience, fails him.  It is not the expression of a human death instinct as derived from Freudian psychology, as Hedges has convinced himself, that is the reason that humans periodically engage in the wanton slaughter of one another and get high while doing it.  He is closer to the truth when he calls war a mass madness or a collective pathology.<br />Human beings do not wish death any more than other creatures.  There is not in the human psyche a struggle between Eros and Thanatos, as Hedges would have us believe, with Thanatos sometimes bursting forth in savage triumph over the forces of love.  Instead the death that haunts us all and to which we will retire, is in the very nature of things.  All that are born must die.  The wish is not in us, but in something larger, in the scheme of things, one might say, or simply it is the way of life.<br />I am not even sure that Hedges really understands the purpose of war within human culture.  War is the ultimate means of settling disputes (\\"Politics by other means\\").  From an evolutionary point of view, war is adaptive.  It is the fundamental expression of the power of the tribe (now the nation state).  War exists because it has been successful.  Those who won the wars lived on to more successfully reproduce their kind.  Those who lost the wars did not.<br />Hedges wonders about the clerics who, though men of God and lovers of peace and forgiveness, are often in the forefront of those who urge the young into battle.  But one of the purposes of religion is to give credence to the mythology of war that will delude the warriors into making the ultimate sacrifice for the good of the tribe.  Those clerics who did not urge on the warriors became dead clerics, their tribes gone the way of dust, and the artifacts and tenets of their religion wiped from the face of the earth.<br />War seems to give us meaning because it is so completely demanding emotionally and psychologically.  Fail at this game and there will be no more games.  And so our attention is focused and our emotional lives completely captured.  Everything else is by comparison insignificant.  And then the war is over and nothing else--no drug, no whirling dervish dance--can ever bring us such emotional highs again.<br />Hedges is right in his indictment of nationalism and patriotism--modern expressions of the bestiary of tribalism.  And he is right that when the dogs of war are let loose all fall under their spell.  Not just the warriors who do the killing or the clerics who find the justifications or the old men who cheer them on, or the press who support the lies of the state, but also the women whose hearts beat a little faster at the sight of a man in a uniform, and the children who sense the absolute urgency of the battle and quickly emulate the warriors in every way.  No one is immune.  All fall down.<br />Like Freud, Hedges is fatalistic in his belief that as long as there are humans there will be war.  But I disagree.  I believe that disputes can ultimately be handled by the rule of law.  This is not something that is going to happen in the near future.  I doubt that there is anyone alive today who will see a world without war.  But eventually all the planet will be like a town in, say, Switzerland in the sense that disputes among neighbors will be prevented by the mechanisms of society from raging out of control.  Murder itself will not end, but the mass murder of war will.<br />The reason we still have wars is that the rule of law has little applicability outside of individual nation states.  The Hobbesian rule of the jungle applies there.<br />It is not love alone that can triumph over war (Hedges' theme in the last chapter).  The natural state of human beings is that of peace and if not brotherhood, at least tolerance.  Despite the fact that there have been few if any years in human history free of war (Hedges claims thirty-some; I think zero)--despite the fact that humans have never really been free of war or the fear of war (or the \\"glory\\" of it--\\"that old lie\\") most days of our lives are lived in peace.  It is during the times of peace that we forget the horror, the delusion, the madness, the ultimate futility, and the ghoulishness of war.<br />Hedges has not forgotten; indeed his primary purpose in this book is to remind us.  He speaks from personal experience as a veteran correspondent who has covered wars from San Salvador to Bosnia.  He has seen the absolute immorality of war up close, but he is fair in condemning Jew and Arab, Serb, Croat and Muslim alike.  He is in a sense a \\"war lover,\\" not the sort that John Hershey wrote about in his novel of that name, but a war lover as addict, as he freely admits; a man who came home from the adrenaline rush only when he \\"no longer had the emotional and physical resilience of youth.\\"<br />The \\"meaning\\" that Hedges finds in war is less significant than the meaning he might find in a better understanding of our biological and cultural selves through a study of not just history, psychology and literature (which he has studied) but also through a study of science, which is everyday shedding more and more light on who we are and why we do what we do.e and if not brotherhood, at least tolerance.

The cover shows a fifties housewife in black heels, nylons, lipstick, a modest hairdo and a house dress covered by an apron mopping her kitchen floor.  She is smiling with pride.  Her squeaky-clean persona represents the germaphobe in all of us--a class of humanity to which I belong and to which science writer Bakalar has aimed his book.  Her pleased sense that her sparkling kitchen is largely germ-free is of course a delusion.  Read and be revolted!<br />As far as readability goes, this is the best general-information book on germs that I have read, and I have read several.  What Bakalar does so very well is inform, period.  He also has a witty and easy flowing style that makes the pages turn.  He is a writer who loves to explain how the microbial world of disease works.  He likes to turn away misconceptions and debunk urban myths without taking himself too seriously.  He can be slyly funny as when he notes that house mice \\"are in general not a reservoir of serious human illness,\\" but that \\"any restaurant that allows them to frolic in the presence of diners is likely to be out of business soon.\\"  Or when he identifies electrocuting insect traps that \\"may actually spread germs into the air\\" as \\"the kind that produce that satisfying buzz every time they kill a fly.\\" (p. 197)<br />He can also be profound.  Consider this from page 15: \\"Viruses, bacteria, archaea, prions, protozoa, and fungi all exist in nature.  Disease does not.  Disease is a human invention, not a phenomenon that exists out there apart from us.\\"  He adds that from the point of view of the disease agent, \\"the infection is merely life.\\"  And indeed, \\"From the point of view of some organisms, human beings themselves are a disease.\\"  He notes that tigers, for example, have a bad case of \\"humans.\\"<br />One of the myths that he debunks that I had long believed was that the recycled air in passenger airplanes was a significant cause of disease.  Turns out that in older airplanes such as DC-9s and 727s the air is not recycled at all but drawn entirely from outside the plane.  In newer airplanes \\"half the cabin air is recirculated\\" but it is filtered better and refreshed more often than in office buildings. (pp. 209-210)<br />Chapter headings include The Contaminated Kitchen, Toilet Training, Kids and Microbes, Microbes and Your Sex Life, Pets and Their Germs, Water and What's in It, Germs in Public Places, etc.  Bakalar ends the book with a chapter on products you can buy at the store that may or may not kill germs and improve your health.  Naturally all sorts of ugly microbes make their appearance including plague, West Nile virus, smallpox, TB, cholera, etc. as well as some not so charming vectors: mice, rats, mosquitoes, ticks, bats, fleas, and their brethren, cockroaches, flies and things that creep in the night.<br />There is a 15-page glossary and there are footnotes arranged by chapter (a dense paragraph for each) at the back of the book that you can examine for further information.  The notes are not subscripted nor referenced by page.  I'm not sure I like this but it does unclutter the text.cause of disease.

It is a reconstruction of meetings, conversations and thoughts focused on President Bush as he orchestrated the military response to 9/11.  Bob Woodward, the celebrated Washington Post journalist who with Carl Bernstein wrote All the President's Men about the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration, demonstrates here that he has entree (and will keep it) at the highest levels of the Bush administration including lengthy interviews with the president himself.  Much of the material in the book comes from these interviews, where the participants recall their thoughts, motivations, and reconstruct their words.  Woodward weaves into his text both direct quotes and reconstructed quotes, the former with quotation marks, the latter without.<br />The story itself is rather bland and unrevealing.  Most of the action is clearly off camera, the deviling details left to those lower on the change of command.  The various secretaries report to the president and get his views and his orders and then they meet again.  Some of the progress in the war is reported on.  Spin is discussed.  Bush prepares for and gives speeches.  Scenarios and long-term consequences of various actions are bandied about.  The high level players posture and engage in dialogue.  We do feel some of the tension between Rumsfeld and Powell and there is an occasional bit of peek and undertone displayed but overall the language is what one would expect to find in official documents.<br />Nonetheless Bush-watchers will find this book very interesting in that a clear picture of George W.'s leadership style and substance emerges.  I think that was Woodward's goal, and I think he did a good job of achieving it.  Here are two quick examples of Bush revealing himself:<br />Taking a kind of Harry Trumanesque &quot;the buck stops here&quot; stance, Bush says, &quot;...I don't need to explain...why I say things.  That's the interesting thing about being president...I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation.&quot; (p.146)<br />Or, when advised by Rumsfeld that the bombers leaving Missouri for the 15-hour flight to Afghanistan might tip off &quot;the start of operations,&quot; Bush responded, &quot;Let them go.  Try some disinformation.&quot; (p. 204)<br />Clearly, President Bush's presidency is a practical presidency.  We see this today with the emphasis on &quot;nation building&quot; in Iraq, a 180-degree turn from his stance both during the 2000 election campaign and during the bombing of Afghanistan when he reiterated again and again that he did not believe in using the US military for nation building.  (See especially page 192.)<br />But more than anything we see Bush and Company preoccupied with visualizing how their actions will appear to the public via the media.  This is nothing new.  John F. Kennedy worked tirelessly to manage the press, with varying degrees of success, as has every president since.  We have to go back to JFK's immediate predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower to find a president that felt comfortable putting substance before spin.  Perhaps it is no coincidence that Ike was the last president to be elected before the majority of American homes had television.<br />Revealing how commonplace spin has become, Woodward writes, &quot;The president, focused as always on the public relations component, asked Defense to work with Hughes [White House counselor Karen Hughes] on the themes that were going to be used in the announcement of military action.&quot; (p. 189)  Notice the &quot;as always&quot; and the use of the word &quot;themes.&quot;  The postmodern president has no choice but to be a master of spin since in today's world perception of what has happened and why is often at least as important as what really happened.<br />Rumsfeld's style on public relations is contrasted somewhat in that he comes across as believing that the best way to handle the media is to give them no more information than is absolutely necessary.  For example, he is quoted on page 176 as saying, &quot;I think the precedent is bad of having to go out and make your case publically...because we may not have enough information to make our case next time...&quot;<br />The role that National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice plays in the Bush administration was what most surprised me about the information I got from this book.  She is not just a token black woman in the White House.  It is clear that Bush relies on her to both coordinate the input of the other participants at the highest level and to advise and guide the president himself.  Rice comes across as someone who thinks clearly, rises above petty squabbles, works hard, and has the ear of the president.<br />Powell's famous patience and level-headedness and cautious style also come through vividly.  Rumsfeld's preoccupation with guarding his rear and protecting his turf and its prerogative powers is also well-illustrated.<br />Bottom line: this is the sort of book that serious politicos must read, but will probably speed-read.n is absolutely necessary.

The emphasis here is on an attractive and somewhat cutesy presentation of tea and herbs very much in concert with Ron Rubin's The Republic of Tea retailing business.  There are sidebar quotes from such anonymous \\"authors\\" as \\"The Minister of Travel,\\" The Minister of Soil,\\" The Minister of Herbs,\\" etc., in frank imitation of Eastern mystical pronouncements.  (\\"The Minister of Travel\\" is identified on the jacket as co-author Stuart Gold.)  An example from page 72:<br />Who draws the water and boils it?<br />Who spoons the leaves from the tin and places them in the pot?<br />Who lifts the kettle and pours?<br />Who could be a greater friend?<br />This Zen and Taoist take on the consumption of tea is of course entirely appropriate.  The Bodhidarma himself (legend has it) contributed his eyelids to the spawning of the first tea plant; and Zen and Taoist masters have from olden times used tea as an aid to meditation.  Personally, as a long-time devotee myself, I believe that tea has mystical powers not easily quantified by modern science, and at any rate there is also a ceremonial and a devotional aspect to the drinking of tea than leads one to the quiet contemplation that makes for a life fully lived.<br />The text is easy to read and there are attractive thumbnail illustrations in green throughout.  There are a few plugs for Rubin's company, but they are tastefully woven in.  I must however call into question some of the information.  For example on page 34 it is writ: \\"Homo erectus pekinensis, who lived in Southeast Asia where tea bushes grow wild, was boiling water and eating wild tea leaves more than 500,000 years ago.\\"  I would dearly like to see the reference for this supposition.  (There are no footnotes.)<br />Also on page 20 it is claimed that white tea has \\"virtually no caffeine.\\"  I am having white tea myself this afternoon with lunch (Foojoy's Bai Mudan) which I have drunk many times before.  I can say with complete confidence that it has noticeably more than \\"virtually no caffeine.\\"<br />Indeed the whole question of the caffeine content of various teas seems a bit murky in this volume.  On page 80 there is a table \\"Caffeine in Beverages\\" that indicates that five ounces of green tea contains 15 mg of caffeine while five ounces of black tea contains 40 mg.  Needless to say it depends on which green or black tea you are talking about.  Japanese green teas in my experience typically contain more caffeine that Chinese green teas.  The caffeine in a typical Assam tea (a \\"black\\" tea) seems greater than in say Keemun the famous black tea from China.  Furthermore, of course, it depends on how strong one brews one's tea and how long the leaves stay in the water and indeed at what temperature the water is when it hits the leaves.<br />Putting that aside and assuming such things are balanced, as I presume the authors do, consider this statement, also from page 80: \\"The more oxidized (or \\"fermented\\") the tea, the more caffeine it contains...\\"<br />I don't see how this can be true since the amount of caffeine in the bud and leaves does not gain from oxidation.  It is not the processing of the tea (except for the deliberate removal of caffeine), but the tea leaves themselves that determine the amount of caffeine in the infusion.  The authors imply that they know this when they end the paragraph with the observation that \\"The greatest concentration of caffeine...is in the bud and first two leaves of the tea bush.\\"<br />I'm not even sure that this is correct.  What IS correct is that the finer the tea the more likely it is to come from the bud and the first leaf or two, yet it will not be experienced as \\"strong\\"--which reveals perhaps a more important point about tea drinking: in the older leaves there is more tannin, and it is the experience of tannin that seems \\"strong\\" and bitter.  The finest teas have only a hint of tannin and not a bit of bitterness.<br />Putting these peccadilloes aside, this is an attractive book that would makea nice gift for tea and herb lovers.  For those who drink nothing but Lipton, it will be an eye-opener deluxe.e gift for tea and herb lovers.  For those who drink nothing but Lipton, it will be an eye-opener deluxe.	2003-07-24
1044787:US	49786731	R2RGR75EXFTCE	096793060X	315246790	Should You Really Seek Custody Of Your Child?	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Child Custody 101	This is really a terrific book that asks (and answers) a rather surprising but fundamental question in the child custody wars: Should you REALLY seek custody?  Most people, I would venture to guess, when thinking about a potential custody dispute would automatically answer yes.  But Dr. Kerman, whose considerable and obvious experience and knowledge in both the legal and psychological aspects of the question (she is both a lawyer and a psychologist), goes a little further in this very valuable book and guides the reader to think twice and then to think twice again before answering this extremely important question.<br />Although the subtitle of the book refers to the best interests of the parent in considering who should have custody, in truth as one reads the book it becomes clear that what is best for the children really is the primary consideration, and by extension what is best for the children is really best for parents who love their children.<br />Clearly if one parent is not capable of taking care of the child for whatever reason (and Kerman gives a  list of reasons, including alcoholism, drug dependancy, a significant other who would not like having the children around, lack of a stable home environment, lack of maturity, or just plan don't want the responsibility, etc.) that parent should not seek custody.  But parents who seek custody simply because they want control or because they want revenge or want to avoid paying child support should rethink their position.  If there are not substantial reasons that relate to the welfare of the children over and above the purely psychological and selfish reasons, then the parent who really cares about not only the children but about his or her own welfare may want to allow the other parent custody.<br />Kerman's book is set in large type that is easily read by the farsighted and there is a lot of white space for notes.  She presents her methodology in seven thorough, almost exhaustive steps which, if followed, will lead almost certainly to a correct assessment of the situation and to a correct decision regarding who should have custody.  It's clear that Kerman did not want to leave anything to chance or allow a wrong decision through ignorance.  She considers the practical, the psychological, the legal and the human aspects of the question.  You will learn what to expect from the courts and what others in similar situations experienced.  Kerman sprinkles the text with case histories that illuminate the legalities and psychology involved.<br />When you are through reading this book you will be in a position to determine not only who should have custody, but how you should go about realizing that and what difficulties you might encounter.  This is an entire course in child custody dynamics in a book.  I would say not only should you buy this book yourself and read it if a custody question is on the horizon, but you should send a copy to your spouse and your lawyers!  If your kids are ten or eleven years old or older, have them read it too!  Everybody will benefit from the knowledge and understanding that Kerman brings to bare.<br />I will tell you one thing for sure: you will be at a significant disadvantage if you don't read this book.

1045419:US	49786731	RJNTF7LJM5ZZ7	055380183X	783924583	The Chronic Pain Solution: The Comprehensive, Step-by-Step Guide to Choosing the Best of Alternative and Conventional Medicine	Books	5	51	54	N	N	Holistic approach firmly grounded in modern medicine	Chronic pain has become perhaps the most trying and least understood health problem in this country.  Millions of people suffer from chronic pain, and most of them have little hope that their pain will end.  Many doctors are ignorant about the pain experience of their patients, and some are even dubious that the pain exists!<br />Part of the problem is that pain is an entirely subjective experience.  It has no existence in the world outside of the pain sufferer (and the observable consequences of that pain).  There are no instruments that can objectively measure pain.  The plain fact, known only too well to chronic pain sufferers, is that nobody feels your pain but you, period.  Dr. Dillard, however, among a growing number of progressive and caring physicians, realizes that the pain is real and has trained himself to appreciate and understand pain.  On page 59 he even has a list of 68 adjectives for describing pain ranging from &quot;aching&quot; to &quot;gnawing&quot; to &quot;wrenching.&quot;<br />Another part of the problem, as Dr. Dillard points out, is that many physicians have not had adequate training in pain management and tend to respond to their patients' needs from a narrow and relative uninformed perspective.  A third part of the problem is that pain management is not a medical specialty.  Most physicians simply are not experts in treating chronic pain.<br />I am not a chronic pain sufferer, but I know about this tragedy because someone I love has suffered for several years from near-constant pain of unclear origin.  She has seen a number of doctors but has found little relief.  To some extent she has become discouraged and cynical about ever finding help.  I hope she will read this book and be inspired to renew her efforts to manage and reduce her pain.<br />Clearly this book does not offer a magic pill or any sort of miraculous solution.  What it offers is an up-to-date and relatively thorough examination of ways to reduce and cope with chronic pain using methods combining alternative and conventional medicine.<br />Dr. Dillard's training and experience as both a chiropractor and a medical physician, and his open-minded and far ranging approach to the healing arts make this well-organized, well presented and eminently readable book the best I have read on the subject.  Dillard begins with an attempt to understand pain using a whole body/whole mind approach.  He encourages pain suffers to become part of a &quot;pain management team&quot; that includes the patient along with doctors, physical therapists and other professionals.  His is a pro-active agenda in which he advocates &quot;Taking Control of Your Treatment&quot; (title of Part II).<br />Part III presents an evaluation of therapies from exercise, yoga, and meditation to acupuncture, pharmaceuticals, implants, and surgery.  Part IV outlines the various complaints from headache through back pain and fibromyalgia to myofascial and complex regional pain syndrome.  Part V focuses on &quot;Special Considerations,&quot; pain management for children, pregnant women, the elderly and terminally ill.  Dillard apparently has no prejudices against any given form of treatment, evaluating each according to its merits and appropriateness.  He sees a place for methadone as well as meditation.  Indeed, he usually recommends a combination of approaches.<br />Even though there is no magic bullet yet, and even though such a miracle may be many years in the future, Dr. Dillard's book offers hope that chronic pain can be reduced and managed (and in some cases eliminated entirely).  People who are completely disabled by their pain can gain enough control to return to a more active lifestyle.  Others who live only a reduced existence because of their pain may again find the joy in living.  What Dr. Dillard's experience shows is that those who take an active part in managing their pain receive a synergistic effect by their active involvement.  He emphasizes that immobility and lackof exercise (caused by the pain) tend to increase the pain experience, while exercise and an active engagement with life tend to reduce it.  Consequently his approach for those whose pain is so bad they cannot exercise at all is to recommend even very strong pain medications so that exercise is possible, and then as activity increases to gradually lower the dosage.<br />This is an excellent first course in understanding and managing chronic pain and the sort of book that pain sufferers will want to read.of exercise (caused by the pain) tend to increase the pain experience, while exercise and an active engagement with life tend to reduce it.

Gleick's focus in these thirty highly polished essays is information and especially the Internet and how the Internet and related technology are changing our lives.  There is a personal, and an \\"I lived it\\" quality to the writing that I found engaging.<br />Author of the challenging Chaos and the very long and adoring Genius about physicist Richard Feynman and the more recent Faster, here Gleick gives us short and easy to appreciate recollections of the communications revolution.  His observations are trenchant, mildly apocalyptic and/or gee-whizzed, amusing and very well expressed.  Having good editors is something Gleick says he has been blessed with, and in these pieces it shows.  This attractive book is simply a pleasure to read.<br />The first piece is from 1992 about the bugs in software, in particular those in Microsoft's Word for Windows; and I want to tell you even though (or especially because) I use WordPerfect, I identified.  I felt the aggravation.  Gleick notes that software is unlike any other product in its complexity, an observation that no doubt pleases Microsoft's software engineers.  However, he reports that Microsoft, unable to cope with the bugs munching on their code and unable or unwilling to excise them, came to an accommodation with the world by declaring that \\"It's not a bug--it's a feature,\\" while compiling an in-company list of known bugs dubbed, \\"Won't Fix.\\"<br />And then, I guess, had lunch.<br />My favorite essay in the collection is the one entitled \\"The End of Cash\\" beginning on page 143 in which Gleick notes among other things that issuers of digital cash cards expect to \\"profit generally from lost cards.\\"  He adds that \\"telephone companies and transit systems already figure gains ranging from 1 percent to a phenomenal 10 percent.\\" (p. 152)  This is an example of privatized \\"escheatment,\\" an aptly named phenomenon in which governments have traditionally benefitted from lost coins and paper money, or people dying without heirs.  Gleick reports that billions of pennies \\"simply vanish from the economy each year\\" which he cites as a \\"hidden cost of money.\\" (pp. 157-158)  But credit cards too have their hidden costs.  They amount to a tax on those who do not use credit cards (basically the poor) because \\"the credit card companies have mostly succeeded in forbidding merchants to offer discounts for cash purchases.\\"  (So everybody buying the product shares the credit card transaction costs.)<br />Gleick also looks into the changes that a cashless society will bring, noting what kinds of crime will no longer be worth doing (e.g., kidnaping for ransom, armed robbery.)  He reflects on the phenomenon of \\"float\\" in which digital money can be used by financial institutions to earn interest for themselves.  Gleick observes that holders of the Yankee dollar at home and world wide (think of the large safe-deposit drawers of Arabian sheiks) are actually lending \\"their wealth to the United States, interest free, just as holders of American Express traveler's checks lend their money to American Express.\\" (p. 153)<br />I also liked the essays on advertising (\\"Who Owns Your Attention\\") and on the growing lack of privacy (\\"Big Brother Is Us\\") and on the awesome power of Microsoft (\\"Making Microsoft Save for Capitalism\\").  There are lesser essays on political websites... web browsing (\\"Here Comes the Spider\\") and software contracts between vendor and user (\\"Click OK to Agree\\"), etc.  Finally Gleick notes that we are \\"Inescapably Connected\\" and gives on page 299 a weird but telling example of how we are being transformed.  We are not yet \\"neurons in the new world brain,\\" he observes, yet we have gotten so much in the habit of knowing things, or at least being able to find them out that \\"You get a twitchy feeling that you ought to push a button and pop up the answer.\\"<br />I've felt that, and soon a connecting chip may be inside my brain that really does do something like twitch as my synapses are activated by the World Wide Web.hem out that \\"You get a twitchy feeling that you ought to push a button and pop up the answer.\\"<br />I've felt that, and soon a connecting chip may be inside my brain that really does do something like twitch as my synapses are activated by the World Wide Web.	2003-07-16

Instead we have Betelgeuse and Cygnus X-1, Deneb and MXB 1730-335 and 96 other illuminators of the night sky as selected by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor of Astronomy James B. Kaler.  They are called &quot;the greatest&quot; mostly because they are significant in one way or another and partly because they are Kaler's favorites.<br />Of course included are Alpha Centauri, our closest interstellar neighbors, and Barnard's Star, the fastest moving star across our line of sight, and Polaris, the North Star, friend to navigators.  The sun is included for comparison and reference.<br />Kaler begins the book with what he calls an &quot;Introduction and Allegro&quot; in which he explains what stars are and how they are classified and how they evolve.  Then come mini essays on the each of the chosen stars, what's interesting and important about them, their history and vital statistics beginning with number zero, the sun.  He identifies the &quot;Residence&quot; of each star according to astronomical constellation, alternative name, its class such as F2 giant (Beta Cassiopeiae), its visual magnitude, its distance from us, its absolute visual magnitude, and its &quot;Significance&quot; (e.g., ESO 439-26 is &quot;The faintest known white dwarf.&quot;)  Because of the range of different types of stars that Kaler has chosen (with wildly differing system configurations), double and triple stars, stars with known planets, pulsars, neutron stars, black holes, etc., reading through the various essays amounts to a modest astronomical education in itself.<br />There are color plates pertaining to each star, sometimes of the star and sometimes of the area of the sky in which the star can be found, and sometimes pertaining to something significant about the star such as a colorful drawing of the inflowing gas from the giant surrounding the black hole at Cygnus X-1.<br />There's a modest glossary and three appendices, one listing the stars by their various names for easy recognition, the second by their evolutionary status (Main Sequence stars, Neutron stars, etc.), and the third by position (by Declination and Right Association).<br />This works well as an introduction to stars and their nature and as a source of reference for the amateur star-gazer.  It is an attractive book that would make a fine gift especially for a young person just becoming interested in astronomy.  It is technical in spots, but overall it is readily accessible to the general reader.isting the stars by their various names for easy recognition, the second by their evolutionary status (Main Sequence stars, Neutron stars, etc.), and the third by position (by Declination and Right Association).  <br />This works well as an introduction to stars and their nature and as a source of reference for the amateur star-gazer.

Books	5	3	4	N	N	A detailed and challenging look at a profound question	When I first heard that genes could be patented and that our DNA could be used without our permission, and indeed without our knowledge, I was rather taken back.  When I read that some people with rare and/or interesting diseases can have cells taken from their bodies and used in research, again without their permission or knowledge (e.g., the case of Moore vs. the Regents of the University of California, cited several times in this book), I was flabbergasted.  The really startling irony is that cells taken from our bodies and replicated in labs can be used for commercial purposes over which we have no control and from which we derive no financial benefit<br />O brave new world, that has such ideas in 't!--to paraphrase Shakespeare and to recall Aldous Huxley.<br />This collection of essays by experts in the fields of microbiology, philosophy, biotechnological law and intellectual property, including an historian of science, a sociologist, and several people from the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, is edited by three men who are experts in bioethics, all holding distinguished positions in academia.  Explored are the ramifications and controversies occasioned by new discoveries, new techniques and new uses in biotechnology and allied disciplines.  This is not a book for habitual readers of People Magazine or for those who get their science from TV sound bites.  This is a thorough and challenging discussion of one of the most demanding questions of our time: indeed who does own life?<br />A secondary issue, yet one of enormous importance, is the extent to which knowledge gained from biological research might be misused, and the extent to which striving for patents helps or hinders scientific progress.  Science writer Robert Lee Hotz's essay (Chapter Nine: \\"Falling from Grace: Science and the Pursuit of Profit\\") is particularly helpful in addressing these questions.<br />Hotz begins with a brief recounting of the legal tussle between the University of California and Genentech Inc over royalties from the sale of Genentech's somatotropin, a biosynthesized version of the human growth hormone.  He reveals that there is often a built-in conflict between the scientific need for openness and the for-profit need for secrecy that often puts scientists in a very uncomfortable spot.  Commercial companies tend to demand that the scientists working for them sign non-disclosure forms while the scientists want to publish their findings in a full disclosure manner so that other scientists can review and benefit from the research.  Hotz quotes Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute as observing that the involvement of commercial interests in medical research leads to \\"an emphasis on the ethical and operational values of business rather than science.\\" (p. 177)<br />To answer the larger question of Who Owns Life? David Magnus in his Introduction argues that we may need to redefine what life is and what is \\"natural.\\" (p. 12)  We will have to grapple with the binary nature of our bodies, especially our genes which, as he express it, \\"have a strange dual existence as both physical material and information molecules.\\"  I am guessing that we are going to be able to keep the physical part of our genes but will have to allow the informational part to become the property of those who manage to patent it!  An allied question is who owns our body after we are dead?  \\"Can a dead person own anything?\\" asks Magnus.  Furthermore, \\"can someone else own your body?\\" (p. 14)<br />Perhaps the key legal question revolves around the long held opinion of our courts that \\"only...the products of human ingenuity can be patented; naturally occurring items cannot.\\"  (Quoting David B. Resnik on page 135.)  However in the landmark case from 1980, discussed by A.M. Chakrabarty in the first essay, \\"the US Supreme Court ruled that life-forms can be patented if they are the products of human ingenuity.\\"  In question was a \\"hybridized bacteriumthat metabolizes oil\\" developed by Chakrabarty. (p. 136)  This case points to the crux of the matter: what is invention (patentable) and what is discovery (not patentable)?<br />It has long been held that in order to stimulate creative activity on the part of human beings it is necessary that they should benefit materially from their activities.  Furthermore unless companies that develop products can protect their investment from competitors in the form of patents entitling them to exclusive economic use of those products, they will have no incentive to develop the products in the first place.  Consequently artists and chemists, biotechnologists and song writers are able to copyright or patent their creations making them their intellectual property.  Thus the Beatles and Big Pharma make a lot of money and we are all the better for their endeavors.<br />Or so the argument goes.  What I wonder is, should the advent of biological engineering and the rise of the Internet cause us to question the assumptions of this argument?  Can it be that a new way of looking at intellectual property is required?  Will scientific and artistic progress suffer if artists and scientists can no longer copyright or patent the results of their work?  The answer from most quarters is a resounding yes.  Certainly the general assumption behind the essays in this book is in agreement with that answer.  Therefore the question here is not whether life should be removed from the realm of the patentable but how we can reconcile human dignity and our sense of self with the needs of biotechnological progress.um that metabolizes oil\\" developed by Chakrabarty.

1058037:US	49786731	R3LC4T8U2M3CUF	0679642811	448968193	The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror	Books	5	21	26	N	N	An interesting and compelling analysis	In The Crisis of Islam Professor Lewis expands on both The New Yorker article from November 2001 that served as the basis for this book and on his companion volume What Went Wrong? Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response (2002).  He writes with grace, clarity and a remarkable succinctness that makes this attractive little book a pleasure to read.<br />He begins by defining Islam geographically, politically, historically and as a world religion to be compared to and contrasted with other great world religions.  He notes how closely related are the three Middle Eastern religions, calling Judaism, Christianity and Islam \\"variants of the same religious tradition.\\"  He adds that Christianity and Islam, alone among the major religions of the world have in common the belief \\"that they alone are the fortunate recipients and custodians of God's final message to humanity, which it is their duty to bring to the rest of the world.\\"  (p. 5)<br />And therein I would say lies a problem.  But it is not a problem of Christianity or Islam per se; it is a problem stemming from a fundamentalist or literal interpretation of religion.  When the offices of state are in the hands of clerics or ayatollahs who believe they have absolute knowledge of truth from God, rather than just a guidance about which they may be fallible, one can be sure that personal choice and freedom or the discoveries of science will be tolerated only in so far as they are in conformity with their \\"absolute knowledge.\\"  Lewis makes the further point here and in What Went Wrong, that in the West there is separation of church and state, and in Islam there is not.  Indeed in Islam political power comes from God, not from humans; therefore democracy is unlikely to prosper.<br />Lewis illuminates how this crucial distinction works in practice: The ideology of democrats \\"requires them, even when in power, to give freedom and rights to the Islamist opposition.  The Islamists, when in power, are under no such obligation.\\"  He adds that their principles \\"require them to suppress what they see as impious and subversive activities.\\" (p. 111)  This explains in part why almost all the states in the Middle East are autocratic or theocratic.<br />A related phenomenon restricts any effective opposition other than that of fundamentalist Islam itself.  Lewis notes that the rulers can forbid political parties and political meetings, but \\"they cannot forbid public worship and they can to only a limited extent control sermons.\\"  Consequently, the \\"religious opposition groups are the only ones that have regular meeting places when they can assemble.\\"  He adds this telling observation: \\"The more oppressive the regime, the more it helps the fundamentalists by giving them a virtual monopoly of opposition.\\" (p. 133)<br />A good portion of the book is devoted to the geopolitics, including Western and Soviet imperialism, that helped to shape the Middle East as it exists today (as well as the warlord mentality of Middle Eastern lands).  He emphasizes the support of repressive regimes by the US, first as a hedge against communism, and then with the end of the Cold War, as a hedge against \\"the emergence...of a single regional power that could dominate the area and thus establish monopolistic control of Middle Eastern oil.\\" (p. 100)  In Chapter VIII \\"The Marriage of Saudi Power and Wahhabi\\" he implicates the US in support of a self-indulgent monarchy that has grown decadently rich while its people remain largely uneducated and relatively poor.<br />Some of the book is devoted to a perception of the way people in the Middle East view Americans and why Osma bin Ladin and others see America as the primary enemy of Islam.  Clearly, conservative ideological Islam which views the American lifestyle as hedonistic, sinful, and morally lapsed will have trouble co-existing with the culture that gave us, e.g., \\"Sex in the City.\\"  And while the Ayatollah Khomeini could comfortably denounce the US as The Great Satan, Lewis makes it clear that the primary reason many people in the Middle East hate the US is its support of Israel.<br />It is clear from Lewis's analysis that the backwardness of the Middle East stems from many factors, not the least of which is fundamentalist Islam itself.  By the way, Lewis uses the term \\"fundamentalist\\" with reservations, saying that it is a misnomer, originally applied to Christian conservatives.  I think whether you call the true believers in an intolerant and violent Islam \\"radicals\\" or \\"fundamentalists\\" really makes no difference.  They are jealous of the superior power and prestige of the West and the success of Israel and in their frustration are obsessed with revenge against a world from which they feel alienated.<br />Obviously, Lewis is no \\"neoconservative\\" in the manner of the present White House as some have charged.  His is a balanced and very well informed view of the Middle East that doesn't take sides.  He actually bends over backwards to be fair.  In this way, he does not please ideologues on either side.  But ignore his critics.  Bernard Lewis is a man who knows what he is talking about, and a man well worth reading.<br />I want to add that when it is believed that the final knowledge of humanity is contained in a book or a book and commentaries two thousand years old, or even only thirteen hundred and some years old, one can be sure that such knowledge will be backward not only scientifically, but socially and politically as well.ewis makes it clear that the primary reason many people in the Middle East hate the US is its support of Israel.<br />It is clear from Lewis's analysis that the backwardness of the Middle East stems from many factors, not the least of which is fundamentalist Islam itself.

Instead of writing a text for Accounting Fraud 101 (which he could do very well), Silver imagines that he is walking the beach with his dad who is both a gourmet chef and an expert on corporate financials.  Basically the dad talks \\"cookin' the books\\" and the son listens and asks questions. The son, who is eighteen-years-old, is about to go away to college.  Dad thinks it's time he learned to protect himself from investing in the wrong companies.<br />While I think Silver's advice is timely and clearly expressed, I think the metaphor wears a little thin after awhile.  I also think a more appropriate occasion for the old dad to wax Socratic on accounting tricks and fraud would be when the son is thinking of investing.  Maybe have the wise old dad visit the son on his thirty-third birthday as he's reallocating his portfolio and wants to know how to separate the Enrons from the Exxon-Mobils.  Or better yet maybe the son ought to come home after a couple of years in college after taking a particularly vivid course in accounting and advise the dad on how to protect HIS retirement nest egg from rapacious portfolio managers and brokers who wouldn't know a bottom line from a line-up.<br />Or better yet, just write the advice out straight.<br />The problem with the method chosen by Silver is its artificiality.  For centuries writers have tried to emulate Plato by arguing a philosophic point through an imaginary dialogue.  The idea is to make the wisdom dispensed as easy to take as Jell-O sliding down.  It looks easy to do but actually it's an extremely difficult art to master mainly because to write veracious dialogue one has to have the skills of a playwright, and to argue effectively for both sides, one has to know and believe to one's core the arguments of both sides.  Usually what happens is the dialogue is artificial (as it is in Silver's book) and the argument one-side.  Here Silver has the son becoming enlightened as he asks questions that the dad easily answers.  More realism would have the son trying to trip up the dad or contradict him or get him to change the subject or to complain, \\"Dad, you've told me that a hundred times.\\"  Maybe they could have a true philosophical diagreement about how to evaluate risk or whether executives should be jailed for accounting fraud.<br />Silver's book is 176 pages and reads fast, mainly because a lot of the text is there just to lend veracity and color to the imaginary dialogue, and also because there's a lot of air on every page.  Reduce the text to its essentials and the book would make a nice chapter in a larger tome.<br />On the positive side the book is very well and attractively presented, well-edited and proofread and might be just the ticket to send to somebody wanting an introduction to fundamental analysis or someone just wanting to know how to read a corporation's financial statement.  The book works very well as an introduction to corporate accounting for investors.  It's a shame that Silver tried to fancy up his \\"menual\\" (yes, that's quote, unquote) when all he's done is dilute the soup.ppens is the dialogue is artificial (as it is in Silver's book) and the argument one-side.

He's talking about Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton, recalling that Monica said the President always left his shirt untucked to hide his belly and how that was perhaps a connection between the two (their protruding bellies, that is).  And then Critser reflects, \\"If the right wing in this country is still really moralistic about sex, the left is moralistic about food...\\" (p. 149)<br />He goes on to note that educated people are supposed to be in control of the amount of body fat they have.  This observation is in tune with the disturbing truth he chronicles: namely those people from the lowest educational and socioeconomic levels of society are the ones becoming the fattest.  He cites studies showing that the percentage of obese African, Hispanic, and Native Americans is higher than that of other groups, and that those people who are living at or near poverty levels are the most likely to be obese and are the most likely to have obese children.  Yet Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton are not exactly candidates for remedial education or payday advances.  What is going on?<br />Epidemic.  Something as deadly as a killer virus is on the loose in America today, and although obesity is most prevalent at lower economic levels, it hits all segments of society.  Since reading this book I have found myself eyeing the populace.  Every time I pass by a Burger King or a Carl's Jr. or a McDonalds or a Taco Bell I check out the clientele, those walking up and those sitting high and large in their expensive SUVs at the drive-up window.  And when I see them, I say to myself: they are being supersized.<br />Just how bad is it?  According to a table on pages 182-183, in the year 2000 19.8 percent of Americans were obese.  That's one in every five.  This figure shot up from 12 percent in 1991.  But it's even worse than it appears.  According to figures on page four, 61 percent of Americans are overweight.  That's most of us!  And about \\"25 percent of all Americans under age nineteen are overweight.\\"  We have supersized ourselves into a health care nightmare in which the total cost of obesity to HMOs is \\"$345.9 million annually, or 41 percent of the total\\" for just eight obesity-related diseases. (p. 148)  But the larger cost to our society in terms premature death, reduced quality of life, and cost of work days lost due to obesity cannot be measured, but in dollar terms is well into the hundreds of billions of dollars annually.<br />How did it happen?  First, as Critser observes, food got cheap, relatively speaking, thanks to the growth of big agriculture.  And then came the use of corn syrup (fructose) in sodas and other fast and snack foods.  This may have been the most significant development of all because fructose, according to Critser, is used by the body differently than other sugars and leads to changes in fat oxidation, insulin resistance and increased fat storage often resulting in Type 2 diabetes.  (See pages 136-139 for how this apparently works.)  Type 2 diabetes, long a threat to middle-aged, overweight men and women, is now a threat to children.  Critser also points to the invasion of our schools by snack and fast food vendors as fostering the epidemic.  They seduced financially-strapped school districts into allowing them to pepper the school with their ads and their products.  TV advertising of junk foods to kids and the rise of sedentary video games are other factors.  Shorter and non-existent physical education classes at our schools is perhaps as big a factor as any.<br />Furthermore, quite frankly, we were looking the other way.  In particular, while feminists and others were obsessing over anorexia and bulimia (a tragic but minuscule problem compared to obesity) and calling fat a feminist issue (p. 123), the real truth of a fat epidemic was sweeping the land.  While fashion magazines and Hollywood were being condemned for giving women body image problems, the real media blitz was going on all around us, especially on Saturday morning TV where the fast and junk food purveyors were indoctrinating our children into supersizing themselves.<br />What's to be done?  Will the purveyors of high-fat, high-fructose foods be treated like the tobacco industry, their advertising drastically curtailed and their products demonized?  Will home owners allow themselves to be taxed enough to pay for real physical education classes in our schools?  Will being fat become such a social stigma that people will take it upon themselves to slim down?  Critser sees education and parental involvement as the key to helping our kids avoid becoming overweight.  I agree and believe that it will take nothing less than a sea change in our values from the worship of all things big to an appreciation of modesty and restraint and a realization that bigger is not necessarily better.<br />In addition to this well presented and readable book, I also highly recommend The Hungry Gene: The Science of Fat and the Future of Thin (2002) by Ellen Ruppel Shell for another view on the epidemic.h of a fat epidemic was sweeping the land.

1069195:US	49786731	R1XLL74WAL9NBL	0670031518	879167194	The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature	Books	5	8	11	N	N	Erudite, worldly, fascinating, and an education	This is, as is the case with everything I have read from Steven Pinker, a tour de force of erudition and gracile expression filled with a super-charged energy and a diabolic dry wit that delights those who agree with him, confounds and makes jealous those who disagree, and informs those whose tabulae are relatively rasae.  In a sense Pinker is the Richard Feynman of the social sciences, a man universally recognized as brilliant, exceedingly articulate (and not shy about demonstrating same), a kind polyglot/polymath who loves the center of the stage.  Here he takes the podium in a grand hall and begins with the philosophers of the Enlightenment, the empiricists Locke and Hume, the vitalist Descartes, the romantic Rousseau, the political philosophers Mill and Hobbes, etc., and leads us step by step to the absurdities of the present day postmodernist left.<br />Of course Locke and Hume and Mill and Hobbes are not to blame for the absurdities.  (I'm not so sure about Rousseau and Descartes).  Their ideas were state of the art for their time and have been, shall we say, uniquely interpreted for today's postmodern agenda, an agenda that Pinker sees as denying humans human nature.  The idea that the mind of the newborn is a tabula rasa, or a blank slate, was discredited long before Pinker's fingers ever graced a keyboard, and the sad but beautiful delusion of the Noble Savage, like that of the Garden of Eden, has likewise been set aside by twentieth century science; however the Ghost in the Machine, the vitalist revision of the doctrine of the homunculus is stubbornly flitting about deep inside the layers of our ideas, and Pinker is determined to peel away the layers and arrive at the center where there is nothing at all.<br />The ghost in the machine, like the phantom of the opera, haunts our imagination, but unlike the denizen beneath the Paris opera house, the ghost does not exist at all.  Rather like Freud's id, the ghost is a construct of culture, employed to explain the mysteries and to separate us spiritually from the animals of the forest.  The ghost is an expression of Descartes's dualism in which there is the plane of the material world on the one hand and the plane of the spiritual on the other.  And we (it is concluded) are not merely material but suffused with a spark of the divine, and so we are simultaneously material and spiritual.  As the Police phrased it, \\"We are spirits in the material world.\\"  One is also reminded of the idea from the East in which the Atman of our soul is a drop of water in the ocean of Brahman.<br />As a religious idea this works very well--at least to my discernment.  However as a basis for a scientific understanding of the human being, which Pinker insists upon, it is no explanation at all.  Indeed, it is something like (as a naive religion might say about what holds up the world) another turtle standing upon a turtle standing upon a turtle until it's \\"turtles all the way down.\\"  Or, since one might demand to know what is inside the homunculus, it's like an infinite Russian doll, little men to the very center of the mathematical point.<br />So Pinker is delightfully (I must say) guiding us to a scientific understanding of the contemporary world unencumbered by ghosts and pre-formed little men.  He is especially anxious that we understand that there is more to the human mind than what society might etch on it, and that heredity counts in larger amounts than the politically correct culture would allow.<br />I could--and would I had the space--go on.  But read the book.  Pinker is at once a purveyor of intellectual delights, an entertainer for those who have graduated from the pop culture, an enlightened infomercial, and a scholar of unusual depth and breath who can write like the wind.<br />However, I have always been the sort of student who graded the professor's exam just to keep him on his toes, and so allow me this one little guidance.  On page 37 Professor Pinker demonstrates (from Chomsky) why the number of sentences that one may utter is theoretically infinite, and goes on to say that \\"...if the number of sentences is infinite, the number of possible thoughts and intentions is infinite too...\\"  But it is especially when we are dealing with the infinite (which is a kind of ghost in the formulas itself) that we must emphasize that we are speaking theoretically.  The sentences we may utter are infinite if, and only if, we had an infinite amount of time to speak them.  As a practical matter (and to be rigorous about the meaning of the word \\"infinite\\") there are actually an indefinite number of sentences that humans can actually utter and therefore an indefinite number of \\"thoughts and intentions\\" that we may realize.  (Boy, do I wish Amazon supported italics, but you may be assured that the word \\"indefinite\\" is being emphasized in the last sentence.)<br />It may seem a pedantic point of limited utility to differentiate between \\"infinite\\" and \\"indefinite\\"; however it goes right to the heart of Pinker's argument.  If he will not allow a spiritual entity morphed as a humonculus or a ghost to haunt about the human brain, I don't think he can allow the purely abstract notion of the infinite to further his case.  We are finite creatures living a finite existence.  It is only in religion that we become infinite.<br />Bottom line: Yes, Pinker could say as much in fewer words (the book is 509 pages long), but so could Shakespeare.  Would we be the better for it?  A little meandering, a bit of a stroll in the lush greenery instead of a beeline to the nearest conclusion is Pinker's style.) why the number of sentences that one may utter is theoretically infinite, and goes on to say that \\"...if the number of sentences is infinite, the number of possible thoughts and intentions is infinite too...\\"  But it is especially when we are dealing with the infinite (which is a kind of ghost in the formulas itself) that we must emphasize that we are speaking theoretically.

1070222:US	49786731	R15MCQ09AB1LB8	0782124690	82043225	Visual Basic 6 Complete	Books	4	14	17	N	N	Good reference and companion volume	For my introduction to today's Basic (no longer all caps, I note) and my re-education in programming, I found this to be the best value if you already have the Basic 6 program.  If you haven't you might want to try one of the other books, such as Practical Visual Basic 6 by Bob Reselman and Richard Peasley which includes a disk with the Working Model Edition of Microsoft's Visual Basic 6.  Professional programmers of course will want to buy the full-blown Visual Basic, but even they might find this manual handy.<br />I came from the environment of the line numbered GW Basic and even \\"Shingo\\" Basic after taking a class in Basic programming at the local junior college in the late eighties.  After that I learned QuickBasic on my own.  QuickBasic was a programming language developed from Basic that incorporated the structured programming techniques and some of the commands and ideas used in more professional languages like C, and I forget what else.  I wrote some moderately complicated programs of eight or nine hundred lines and then I didn't do any programming for years.  When I returned a couple of years ago I discovered that what was now the state of the art for the amateur programmer was Visual Basic.  I took a look at the program (a stripped down version that came with Word Perfect) and was absolutely flabbergasted.  I could not figure out how to even begin writing a program!<br />So I went to the bookstore and found several shelves of Basic books.  I tried one (I don't recall the title) but found it so lacking in information and guidance (for the price) that I actually took the book back the next day and got a refund.  Some other books were entirely too advanced and too specialized for my needs.  Then I tried this generic title, and with help from doing the exercises in Reselman's and Peasley's book, it brought me up to speed in Visual Basic enough to write a program to keep track of some stock market data that I was interested in.<br />What this book does not do that I wish a Visual Basic book would do is include an equivalence table in which the old commands from the world of QuickBasic are paired off with the new commands, and a one-for-one comparison of the old and new ways of doing things.  This would be very handy for those of us who learned our Basic some years ago.  I looked around for such a book but without luck.<br />Fortunately many things have not changed.  The random number generator works the same, for example.  The techniques and commands for using sequential files, for another example, are vitually the same.  The really startling changes are in the way information is presented on the screen.  If you're like me and haven't done any programming lately, you will probably find yourself facing a brand new learning curve here.<br />This book begins with an introduction to Visual Basic 6 and the concept of object programming in Part I, followed by practical guidance in Part II, and then in Part III introduces the reader to scripting and using Visual Basic for Internet programming.  Part IV is Visual Basic for Applications, which I didn't get to, and Part V is a reference.  The various chapters are taken from other Sybex publications such as e.g, Steve Brown's Visual Basic 6 In Record Time.<br />In the old days, the \\"quick and dirty\\" way to really learn a programming language was to jump right in with a project and get it to work.  However, like the \\"spaghetti code\\" techniques of old, such an approach will not work well if one wants to write complex programs.  So I found that there is no substitute for laboriously learning a significant portion of the commands and techniques before actually trying to write a program.  Writing small programs guided by experts is the best way, and that is why I do not recommend any single book for the beginner.  I recommend instead that this book be purchased as complement to another book, again Practical Visual Basic 6 mentioned above would be adequate.  That way if one explanation or guidance is not entirely clear, you can have the advantage of another writer's approach.<br />Bottom line is the Visual Basic program itself, a way to interface and develop programs in concert with Microsoft's Windows that will astonish you with its power.  Or at least it astonished this old weekend programmer.or guidance is not entirely clear, you can have the advantage of another writer's approach.<br />Bottom line is the Visual Basic program itself, a way to interface and develop programs in concert with Microsoft's Windows that will astonish you with its power.

1071609:US	49786731	R37C88RXUY7PUR	0679727299	102642549	The Annotated Lolita: Revised and Updated	Books	5	169	182	N	N	Best for a second reading	When I was a young man and first encountered Lolita I was pleasantly taken with the audacity of the good Professor Vladimir Nabokov's intent.  Like most undergraduates it was clear to me that \\"shocking the bourgeoisie\\" was always good sport.  Now that some decades have passed and I have had the opportunity to re-read the novel and then to read it a third time with the insights provided by Professor Alfred Appel's annotations, I can only say, it is a singular pleasure and a troubling experience.<br /><br />Lolita is everything a great novel should be, challenging us intellectually, disturbing us emotionally, leading us to fascination and revulsion, making us question our values and our preconceptions while compelling us to turn the pages.  A close and sober reading leaves one feeling a kind of tristesse, as the French say, that cannot be easily dismissed.  On the one hand, the conception and development of the novel is brilliant.  The language is Joycean, the ironies delicious, the plot twists delightful, the theme compelling, the characters indelible, the milieu veracious.<br /><br />On the other hand, the \\"unreliable narrator\\"--I never liked that term: he's reliable; he just isn't admirable--who is the novel's central character, Humbert Humbert, the Old World dirty middle-aged man taking sexual advantage of a child whom he has trapped, is without doubt a vile creature.  And yet--and this is part of the genius of the novel--one cannot help but identify with his tainted love, his hopeless, doomed passion.  And indeed one even identifies with the task he has perversely inherited, that of looking after a teenaged girl and keeping her out of harm's way, a formidable task with which almost any parent can identify.  (Part of the dramatic irony throughout the novel stems from Humbert's dual role as lover and parent.  Something to think about.)  What one cannot abide, of course, is Humbert's obsessive jealousy and his overbearing attempts at psychological dominance.<br /><br />Why is it that \\"normal\\" men do not fall in love with young girls (to say nothing of pre-adolescent \\"nymphets\\")?  Why is it that one loves them without falling in love with them?  Is it not \\"wise\\" in an evolutionary sense to be there first, so to speak?  No doubt the evolutionary mechanism demands that drive in some of us, but at what cost, and in the modern society, to what end?<br /><br />Normal men do not chase after pre-adolescent girls partly because it is against the law, and partly because society condemns those that do, and partly because older girls are more interesting, but most often simply because such a relationship would never work.  The intense, masochistic, obsessive love that Hum feels for little Lo is all there is of permanence in such a relationship.  When that is gone, there is nothing left.  \\"Dollie\\" must go her own way, make her own life, and Humbert must go back to his books and his lurking by school yards.  Lolita at twelve is not capable of loving Humbert.  By the time she is sixteen she is bored with him.  And by the time she is an adult he is an embarrassment, a skeleton in the closet of her former life.<br /><br />So we know as we begin Nabokov's mid-century masterpiece that Humbert's love is doomed.  We also fear that something terrible is going to happen to Lolita because she is being robbed of her adolescence and forced into a kind of physical and emotional servitude.  Note well the entrance of Claire Quilty, the libertine, who is part foil to Humbert and part the embodiment of the moral abyss that one may fall into.  Indeed Quilty is the horror that Humbert Humbert himself might very well become, which is why his hatred for Quilty is so intense, accentuating as Quilty does the extent of Humbert's perversion.  Note that Quilty fulfills (offstage and after the fact, as it were) our worst fears for Lolita.  Humbert addresses Quilty as one addresses the hated parts of one's very soul.<br /><br />But enough.  The word limit here prevents a full critical treatment of Lolita.  For those interested there is Harold Bloom's collection of critical essays, Interpretations of Lolita (1987), to read.  You might also want to look at my reviews of the non-annotated edition of the novel and at my reviews of the two very interesting films based on Nabokov's work, Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (1962) and Adrian Lyne's Lolita (1997).  My intention here is to recommend this edition because of the light shed on the text by Professor Appel's gloss, especially his translations of the many French phrases that Humbert (who is a professor of European literature, as was Nabokov, one notes in passing) sprinkles throughout the story.  I would also like to correct an error in a review below in which it is asserted that Professor Appel is actually Professor Nabokov in camouflage (perhaps like a butterfly).  While annotating his own novel in pseudonym is something that Nabokov might very well do and do with delight, I must point out that Appel does indeed exist (at least he has a Website) and of course Professor Nabokov is dead, and so the reviewer is mistaken.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Novels and other Fictions\\"s a full critical treatment of Lolita.

Written in an engaging, clear and almost poetic style (the translation by Andy Klatt is first rate, his surprising use of \\"irregardless\\" on page 182 notwithstanding), this book gives us a sense of the latest understanding with an emphasis on evidence from the Sierra de Artapuerca excavation site in Spain where paleoanthropologist Professor Arsuaga is co-director.  The black, white and gray illustrations by Juan Carlos Sastre nicely augment the text.<br /><br />Arsuaga begins with the observation that today we exist almost alone in the sense that there are no very similar species extant, the last one being the Neanderthal in Europe.  Arsuaga then traces our descent until he arrives at \\"Domesticated Man\\" in the Epilogue.  His detours and asides are very interesting.  I was especially pleased to learn that there are well-preserved wooden lances (or spears) used by archaic humans fully 400,000 years ago. (p. 182-183)  I also found interesting his digression on what caused the extinction of the megafauna of America some 10,000 years ago (in Chapter Six, \\"The Great Extinction\\").<br /><br />Primarily, though, this book is about the cultural, behavioral and conceptional abilities (as derived from the archaeological evidence) that separate humans from other living creatures, especially the Neanderthals.  Arsuaga reveals his purpose on page 280: \\"I have been trying to summarize the evidence available concerning the thorniest problem of human evolution, the development of consciousness, which is the defining characteristic of humankind.\\"  He had asked in the Prologue on page ix, \\"Apart from us, has there ever been a life form on earth that was conscious of its own existence and of its place in the world?\\"  In short his answer is yes, the Neanderthal, whom he defines as our contemporary, not as an archaic human species. (p. 278)<br /><br />Arsuaga's story begins about 2.5 million years ago when Homo habilis emerged in Africa (presumably from another post-australopithecine species) with a noticeably bigger brain than the first upright walking apes.  \\"A short while later\\" (geologically-speaking) Homo ergaster (probably the same as Homo erectus) appeared.  Arsuaga sees Homo ergaster as the first hominid to migrate out of Africa about 1.5 million years ago, spreading to Europe and southeast Asia.  Not only did these proto-humans have a significantly larger brain than Homo habilis, they had also begun \\"to create a social and cultural environment...that afforded them ever more independence from the physical environment,\\" which is one of the reasons they were able to survive in diverse climates, especially in the cold of the northern latitudes.<br /><br />Then about 300,000 years ago Arsuaga sees the development independently in Europe and Africa of a \\"second great expansion of the human brain\\" producing \\"somewhat different results.\\" (p. 307)  When modern humans again emerged out of Africa about 150,000 years ago they arrived in Europe to find the Neanderthal.  The somewhat different results of their independent evolution prevented the species from merging and eventually the Neanderthal died out.<br /><br />Although some authorities have emphasized competition with modern humans as the reason for the Neanderthal's demise, Arsuaga believes we need more information before we can say \\"in a convincing fashion\\" what happened. (p. 292)  He does say somewhat imprecisely that the Neanderthal was \\"defeated by the cold\\" while the Cro-Magnons due to \\"superior technology,\\" especially with bone awls and needles to fashion well-fitting animal skins, etc., were able to survive the glacial maximum 25,000 years ago. (p. 302)  However on page 78 while noting that the Cro-Magnons had developed physical features that made them look relatively childlike--a gracile build and a \\"small, minimally protruding face,\\" (\\"neoteny\\" is the technical term for this phenomenon)--Arsuaga may have tipped his hand.  He observes, \\"Cro-Magnons must have looked cute to the Neanderthals!  They may have discovered later, to their dismay, what kind of people they were dealing with, and as sweet as the Cro-Magnons may have looked, what kind of behavior they could expect.\\"<br /><br />(I had a sudden vision here of an abandoned Cro-Magnon child found by a Neanderthal family.  They tenderly take the child in, nourish it and bring it up as their own.  At a certain age, the child realizes that it is not Neanderthal and...  Well, I'm sure there are a few science fiction stories that resolve this premise for better or for worse.)<br /><br />Arsuaga's account therefore presents the Neanderthal as a co-existing species, not our ancestor, with whom there was little to no interbreeding.  Nonetheless Arsuaga has great respect and affection for the Neanderthal.  He writes on page 284 that \\"It would thrill me more than anything if I could say that I had even a drop of Neanderthal blood to connect me with those powerful Europeans of long ago.\\"  His portrait is of a \\"human\\" species different from (not less than) ourselves that had culture and ritual and self-adornment (as evidenced by, e.g., the Neanderthal's necklace found at Grotte du Renne in France), a being that had achieved consciousness, although of a sort undoubtedly different than ours.  In one particular, Arsuaga argues that the fossil evidence suggests that the Neanderthal's phonetic apparatus would not have been able to produce \\"sounds as distinct as ours,\\" (p. 268).  This physical characteristic may have reduced its ability to develop a culture as extensive as the Cro-Magnon's which we know about in part through the cave murals that they painted in France and Spain.<br /><br />What one feels strongly from Arsuaga's account is the sense of loss that the Neanderthal is no longer with us.  How much we could have learned from a being that was at once much like ourselves, but intriguingly different.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"non)--Arsuaga may have tipped his hand.

1081845:US	49786731	R2OFYQVMWZ7V24	189212355X	605457505	The $100,000 Teacher: A Solution to America's Declining Public School System	Books	5	4	6	N	N	A provocative solution	Brian Crosby understands what is happening in our public schools. Our public schools really are facing a crisis of unprecedented proportions, especially in Crosby's (and my) home state, California.  He understands that a society that pays its prison guards more than its teachers has its values distorted.  His solution is a noble one, one that will work, and he outlines in considerable detail the steps necessary for its implementation in this easy to read, well thought out presentation.  However, I am sorry to say that I don't think the $100,000 teacher is going to happen any time soon.<br />Why?  Mainly because there is a perception on a significant part of the public that teachers have it easy because they only work 180 days a year and therefore shouldn't be paid more.  As a former teacher myself, one who retired young from the profession because of the inequities experienced, I can tell you that this perception is grossly mistaken for any number of reasons, but is true in at least one sense.  To put it bluntly, it is true for the teacher who doesn't care, for the teacher who just wants to get a paycheck, for the teacher who has tenure and sees his or her responsibility as not extending beyond that of a glorified babysitter.  And this goes for administrators who only want glorified babysitters.  Crosby understands this and that is why his program is designed to weed out the teacher who doesn't care and reward the teacher who takes pride in teaching and wants to help his or her students succeed.  That teacher IS a $100,000 teacher, if only we knew.<br />The salient point of this book then is a realization that the problem of adequate public financial support for education and for upgrading the teaching profession will not be solved until the present tenure system is abolished.  As Crosby expresses it, \\"...no matter the lousy job one performs, once tenured (after a two or three years of teaching), one is in it for life.\\" (p. 106)<br />The immediate effect of this system is to tie the hands of administrators.  They cannot easily influence poor teachers, nor can they get rid of them.  Conversely those teachers who really care and give their best to their students are not rewarded and so they leave the profession in frustration.  As Crosby points out on the very first page of the book, \\"One-fifth of all new teachers quit within three years\\" and \\"Half of all new teachers quit within five years.\\"<br />An unintended consequence of the present system is to make teachers and administrators adversaries.  Administrators want teachers to do more, but teachers are not rewarded for doing more, so they (the ones that stay) resist.  In addition, typically the school principal leads the negotiating committee for the school district against the teacher's union.  So instead of working together for student achievement, teachers and administrators become adversaries.  This dissipates their ability as educators.<br />In the long run the effect of the tenure system is synergistic in a negative sense in that it tends to attract and keep only mediocre teachers poorly supervised by mediocre administrators who are at odds with one another.  Although this truth is well-known to everybody in the profession, suggestions for abolishing the system will not sit well with the various teacher's organizations since they are addicted to tenure and cannot kick the habit.  An enlightened and energized public is necessary to help them.  This in essence is what Crosby is calling for.<br />His solution must be taken seriously because there are standing in the wings other \\"solutions\\" to the problem including the privatization of education through something like a voucher system.  Vouchers will lead to the end of public education in America, that is, to the dismantling of a system that was largely responsible for the fabulous economic growth of this country.  Privatization will then lead to a further economic polarization of society.  Those who have the wherewithal willbe able to afford a good education for their children; those who do not, will not.<br />In any case, teachers and their professional organizations should be aware, that the time of the mediocre teacher and the adversarial system between mediocre teachers and mediocre administrators is coming to an end.  I hope that the public sees the light in time and the reforms outlined by Crosby become a reality.be able to afford a good education for their children; those who do not, will not.<br />In any case, teachers and their professional organizations should be aware, that the time of the mediocre teacher and the adversarial system between mediocre teachers and mediocre administrators is coming to an end.

Bronx-born Stanley Kubrick spent much of his professional life in England where he made some of the most controversial and original films ever to grace the silver screen.  This uneven but fascinating book is in a sense a tribute to the man and his work.  This is not the first encyclopedic treatment of a top movie director published by Facts on File--they have also done Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles.  Perhaps this format--an &quot;encyclopedia&quot;--will catch on.  At any rate, it is fun to leaf through randomly or perhaps one could actually proceed alphabetically.<br />The entries of course all have some connection with Kubrick.  Included are actors who played in his movies, and people related to him and his friends and other people he worked with.  There are also entries on movie business phenomena like &quot;antiwar themes&quot; and &quot;censorship.&quot;  There is an interesting entry on Steven Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence (2001) in which I learned that the original conception came from Kubrick.  There are a number of black and white photos spread throughout the text and some line drawings, mostly of Kubrick and the actors who played in his films.  Often the photos are stills from the movies.  It is interesting to see Kubrick at various stages of his career and how time changed his appearance.  My favorite photo is of George C. Scott and Stanley Kubrick playing chess on the set of Dr. Strangelove underneath the &quot;War Room&quot; mock up.  By the way, Scott is reported to have gained respect for the younger Kubrick when Kubrick beat him at chess.<br />There is rather a lot of repetition in the entries, some of it unavoidable of course because entries overlap in content.  However the entry for Sue Lyon, for example, who was Kubrick's Lolita, contains a summary of the plot of Lolita to the exclusion of the rather sparse information about Lyon.  Also the editing and proofreading of the entries is not first rate.  The text was begun by Rodney Hill and then taken up by Gene D. Phillips, which may account for some of the avoidable repetition.  Some of the entries were written by John C. Tibbetts and others tagged with initials and identified as &quot;Contributors&quot; near the back of the book.<br />Clearly the strength of the book is in the light it sheds on Stanley Kubrick and his life in film.  The detail is fascinating and the writing, in spite of the repetitions, is engaging.  There are nice pieces on George C. Scott, James Mason, Peter Sellers, Malcolm McDowell, Nicole Kidman, Shelley Winters, Arthur C. Clarke, etc. as well as essays on all of Kubrick movies.  Included are behind the scenes information about what went on during the shooting of the films, how the films were conceived and how they progressed.  I was intrigued to learn that Kubrick was able to get a fine performance from the otherwise undistinguished Sue Lyon partly because he sometimes allowed her to use her own vernacular instead of words from the script.  Also interesting was the difficulties that Shelley Winters experienced (from her viewpoint!) in working with James Mason and Peter Sellers in Lolita (1962).  The relationship between Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey and worked with Kubrick on the screenplay for the film, is interesting to follow.  One realizes again that at the base of Kubrick's film creations is an abiding interest in science and human psychology.<br />Bottom line: an irresistible companion to the films of Stanley Kubrick, one of cinema's greatest directors and one of my personal favorites.then taken up by Gene D.

However Kurtzman's enthusiasm for the market is eventually revealed as similar to E. M. Forster's for democracy.  One recalls that Forster allowed himself just \\"Two cheers for democracy...there is no occasion to give it three.\\"<br />Kurtzman writes on page 148 that \\"Markets may move to the beat of their dumbest members.\\"  He adds, \\"In my view...markets are not rational.\\"  To back up his claims he reports that at the height of the Internet bubble in 1999, Yahoo! with sales of $456 million (that's million with an \\"m\\") had a market capitalization of $93-billion which he compares to GM, which at the same time with revenues of $177-billion (billion with a \\"b\\"), had a market cap about half that of Yahoo! (p. 147)  This observation caused Kurtzman to ask, \\"Yo, Mr. Market, is anybody home?\\"<br />Well, it depends on when you knock on the door.  In October of 2002 Yahoo's market capitalization was down around $5-billion or so.  The real truth is Mr. Market may be irrational for some period of time--indeed for some EXTENDED period of time, especially when you're holding the bag--but eventually a correction occurs, and for a brief shining moment (not the same moment) every stock is priced at what it's worth.  (Of course it could also be pointed out that a stopped clock is exactly right twice a day.)<br />I very much liked Kurtzman's conversation tone and his obvious acumen and the way he explains the underpinnings of the capital markets with an emphasis on understanding rather than mechanical details.  (Although an explanation on how the weekend or overnight buy and sell orders received from Internet traders are reconciled at the New York Stock Exchange and at NASDAQ into an opening price would have been nice.)  His championing of Michael Milken as one of the great financial geniuses of our times was tolerable, but did Milken really (as Kurtzman insists on page 144) take \\"an often bloating and ailing American economy\\" and make it \\"lean, mean and resilient\\"?  And, although one does not doubt the genius of Warren Buffet, might Kurtzman have pointed out during his several fawning references to the man, that when you have as much economic clout as he has you might well be able to influence the markets to your advantage and to get information that others cannot, and in a nutshell prove beyond a shadow of doubt that money makes money and big money makes even bigger money?  He might even have (to be topical and timely) pointed out that Shari'a law, which does not allow interest to be charged on credit, is not in keeping with the realities of the effect time has on capital.<br />But Kurtzman is an ambassadorially polite man who saved his barbs for the failed communist system and the recent irrational exuberance in dot com land.<br />Perhaps the highlight of the book, and maybe the most important part, is Kurtzman's explanation of what money is (not obvious) and how it is created and how it can be made to dissipate.  For anyone wanting a kind of Reality Economics 101, Kurtzman's book is an eye-opener.  He has a gift for explaining things in a succinct and clear manner that other writers on economics might well emulate.been nice.)

These viruses, indigenous to disturbed areas of the world, particularly in the tropics, are now being sprung loose to threaten humankind.<br />The first third of the book covers the story of the \\"Four Corners\\" hantavirus that jumped from deer mice to humans with fatal effect in the southwestern United States in 1993.  This is science journalism at its best.<br />In the next third of the book Ryan takes us to the jungles of Africa and traces the origin and effect of the horrendously brutal Ebola virus.  Again he tells an engaging story with a pictorial vividness.  One is amazed at the courage and dedication of the health care workers and medical scientists who risked their lives to treat the sick and dying and to find the source of the deadly disease.<br />At the beginning of the last third of the book, Ryan reprises what we know about HIV, its origins, its spread, the political and social stupidities involved in its spread, and the prospects for combating this terror.  Again he makes the personalities and the nature of their work come to life.  Then beginning with \\"Chapter Sixteen: The Aggressive Symbiont,\\" Dr. Ryan discusses in general and theoretically the evolutionary nature of viruses, where they came from, why they exist and what we can expect from them in the future.  Most pointedly he explores the possibility of a doomsday virus that is simultaneously as easily spread as influenza and as deadly as Ebola.<br />In a sense this part of the book, originally published in 1996, predicts the SARS outbreak, but does not stop there.  Ryan argues persuasively that, because of increased international travel, because of increased disturbance of natural environments, especially equatorial forests, and because of lack of sufficient preparedness, we are in mortal danger from a horrendous pandemic caused by an emerging virus, a virus he dubs \\"Virus X.\\"<br />Part of his argument comes from the realization that every species on the planet harbors viruses.  Most of these viruses exist in the host in a relatively benign manner.  Ryan believes that virus and host are in a symbiotic relationship that has developed over the eons.  The host shelters the virus while the virus, when shed into the environment, attacks other species with a deadly ferocity that protects the ecological position of the host.  He calls this virus the \\"aggressive symbiont.\\"  It is here that Ryan's thesis is somewhat controversial.<br />For my part I think it is better to explain the deadly ferocity of an emerging virus by observing that the virus is killing its new host not to protect the old one but because it has not yet fine tuned its relationship so as not to kill the new host.  Also the new host has not yet developed mechanisms for dealing with the virus to prevent it from doing egregious harm.  Yet, it is valuable to see the virus as an \\"aggressive symbiont.\\"  Clearly the viruses (and other diseases) of the African rain forests are one of the reasons, as Ryan points out--perhaps the most important reason--that those jungles are still standing.  It is clear that the AIDS virus that jumped from chimpanzees to humans would, in the pre-modern world, have the long-term effect of keeping humans from successfully usurping their territory.  Perhaps it is best to say that viruses help to maintain the existing ecology.<br />However, to resolve this controversy will require predictive scenarios and experiments by scientists in the field.  We should have a better understanding (and perhaps some more precise terminology) a few years down the road.  For more information on symbiotic relationships see Ryan's recent and very excellent, Darwin's Blind Spot: Evolution Beyond Natural Selection (2002).  Another excellent book on a closely related subject is  Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures (2000) by Carl Zimmer where the emphasis is on the parasitic stage of symbiosis.<br />One of the most interesting ideas Ryan presents is that of \\"genomic intelligence.\\"  We are accustomed to thinking of intelligence in terms of computer chips or neurological growths, but perhaps the most important intelligence on this planet is of another kind, something like that of the ant colony or our immune system or that contained in the form and \\"behavior\\" of the virus.  Consider, as Ryan does, that the virus has been co-evolving with its hosts, beginning with single-celled bacteria for perhaps a couple billion years or so.  During this vast expanse of time it has \\"explored\\" the \\"landscape of the genome\\" (p. 226) and come to \\"understand\\" it so well that it is able to use the genome of virtually every creature on earth for its reproduction.  Yet, the genome itself has its intelligence that has allowed it to continue to reproduce itself despite what the viruses are doing.  This sort of intelligence cannot be discerned from examining the virus or the genetic code alone because such intelligence exists in concert with an environment at the molecular level of shapes and surfaces that is only expressed through the dynamics of growth.  As in an ant colony there is no centralized \\"authority\\" where this intelligence exists; indeed the intelligence is an emergent property of the entity's interaction with its environment.<br />This book is therefore more than just a compelling report on the threat we face from emerging viruses, but an exploration of the evolutionary significance of our place within the viral environment.  It is so well written, so well thought out and still so entirely pertinent to what is happening today that I would like to see Ryan revise it to include material on SARS and other outbreaks and to bring us up to date on what is now being done by the World Health Organization and other institutions to fight the grave dangers we face.angerous Creatures (2000) by Carl Zimmer where the emphasis is on the parasitic stage of symbiosis.<br />One of the most interesting ideas Ryan presents is that of \\"genomic intelligence.\\"  We are accustomed to thinking of intelligence in terms of computer chips or neurological growths, but perhaps the most important intelligence on this planet is of another kind, something like that of the ant colony or our immune system or that contained in the form and \\"behavior\\" of the virus.

Books	5	11	11	N	N	Or better yet, questions of interpretation	I had intended to read only two or three of these cases, those that I was most familiar with, the O. J. Simpson case and the Jeffrey MacDonald case, for example, but found myself reading more and more into the book until I had read all fifteen of them.<br /><br />What Evans does so very well is concisely and clearly present the facts of the cases so that the reader feels clearly involved; and then he brings into sharp focus the controversies about the evidence and the interpretation of the evidence.  In starring roles are the forensic experts themselves, botanists and microbiologists, pathologists and coroners, many of them with international reputations and big egos to match.  Then Evans argues his position along with the experts.  He is not shy about letting us know which side he prefers, concluding, for example, in the Dr. Sam Sheppard murder case from the fifties, that \\"there wasn't a scintilla of hard evidence in 1954 to prove that Sam Sheppard killed his wife.  There still isn't.\\"<br /><br />I think Evans's decision to be candid about where he stands in each of the cases strengthens his credibility and helps to make this an enjoyable read.  It gives the reader an opportunity to agree or disagree.  I won't mention where he stands on some of the other famous cases, some of which are still controversial today, e.g., whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating President John F. Kennedy, or the credibility of the Turin Shroud relic, or whether Napoleon was poisoned or not.  That would spoil a little of the fun.  I will say I found myself in agreement with him in almost every instance, but that may be partly because he guided me so well!<br /><br />But did he change my mind in any of the cases?  Partially.  I still think Dr. Sam did it, but now believe that there was too much doubt for a conviction to be justified.  And in the infamous Lindy Chamberlain case, which Evans dubs \\"Australia's Forensic Nightmare,\\" where I had doubts, I now have assurance.  You will recall that Chamberlain was the woman who claimed that a dingo grabbed her baby out of the family's camping tent and carried it off and ate it to the horror of much of the world.  However the police didn't believe her story and arrested her for murder.  A film A Cry in the Dark (1988) starring Meryl Streep was made from a book about the case, Evil Angels by John Bryson.<br /><br />Another thing that Evans does well is evaluate and critique the forensic experts themselves.  He shows in the case of one Donald Merrett how the mistaken conclusion and testimony of Sir Bernard Spilsbury \\"the first and greatest forensic superhero\\" (p. 42) on whether a shooting was a suicide or not allowed a killer go free to kill again, and he did.  In the Rachel Nickell murder in Britain in 1992 he delineates how psychological profiling can mistakenly narrow the field of suspects to exclude the actual murderer.  In the O.J. Simpson case it is not the forensic experts who come under fire, but a system that allows such a mismatch of legal talent that the forensic evidence can become blurred in the eyes of the jury.<br /><br />My favorite chapter was the one on the Kennedy assassination.  Having argued the controversy endlessly with fellow students while an undergraduate at UCLA, and having read several books on the subject, I can tell you that what Evans presents in a mere sixteen pages is as clear and forthright summation of what happened as I've read anywhere.<br /><br />Bottom line: an engaging collection of retrospectives on famous crimes that turned on forensic evidence.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"will recall that Chamberlain was the woman who claimed that a dingo grabbed her baby out of the family's camping tent and carried it off and ate it to the horror of much of the world.

What this \\"epic quest\\" really reminds me of is Don Quixote de la Mancha as updated by Saturday Night Live.<br /><br />Will, the \\"anti-hero\\" of this \\"medicated memoir\\" is a freshman at a \\"by the side of the Interstate\\" college near a polluted bay whose psychopharmacologist(s) have him on Prozac, Lithium, Xanax, etc. so that he might cope with the vicissitudes of postmodern life.  Peering through the haze he discovers a new viral infection set loose on the world by \\"the evil Dr. Bones,\\" a disease he calls \\"Information Sickness.\\"  Too much meaningless information apparently kills, and so Will begins a Quixotic quest to save humanity from information overload.  Along the way he has kinky and funny carnal knowledge of two babes and what might be called wet noodle knowledge of a third, respectively, Crystal Goodlay (body-beautiful assistant to the evil Dr. B.), ABD Chandra (belly dancer and Indian chef extraordinaire), and Naomi (fellow virology student and luscious centerfold spread).<br /><br />So much for the plot premise, which doesn't matter.  What Tom Grimes is really up to here is a mass satirical attack on all things postmodern, corporate, governmental, intellectual, collegiate, therapeutic, literary, sexual, informational, and a whole lot more.  The really insidious thing about Grimes is that not only is he belly-laugh funny, he is well-read.  The allusions and references to things scientific and literary actually wage war with allusions and references to the pop culture in this twisted tale of all things overloaded.  Grimes is conversant with complexity theory, modern philosophy, stock market dynamics, information theory, cosmology, as well as testosterone and cyberspace.  In reading something that would appeal to, say, the viewers of American Pie, one can simultaneously smirk with satisfaction at knowing the intelligentsia-droppings scattered throughout.  This is no dumbed-down cartoon network pseudo-novel--well, it's a pseudo-novel, but one with Film Potential.<br /><br />What Grimes should be doing with his talent for wordsmithing and laugh out loud satirical thrusts is writing teen exploitation scripts for Tristar or HBO while moonlighting for Saturday Night Live.

Instead of speculations embedded in story form they speculate about the future in a narrative without plot or characterization or other elements of the story form.  Of course they are not the only writers doing this, but they are among the best in a growing industry.<br /><br />Well, what about it?  I gave up reading most science fiction years ago because either the story elements were wooden or the science was ridiculous (or both).  It is not easy to be simultaneously a master story teller and a polymath of science.  We know that (e.g.) Asimov, Clarke and Sagan were exceptions and were able to combine both tale and cutting edge knowledge very well, and in some cases spectacularly well.  But their world is gone.  Today's science is much more complex.  To write convincingly about the future it is not enough to be a world expert in one's chosen field.  The future is influenced by science of all kinds; consequently it is requisite that one be an expert in a number of scientific disciplines just to avoid naive projections.<br /><br />So it is natural that Peter Ward, who is a geologist and zoologist, (and, by the way, a sometimes poetic prose stylist, witness his expositions in Future Evolution [2001]), and Brownlee, who is an astronomer and NASA scientist, might join forces to augment their individual expertise; and that they might eschew the story form in writing about the future.<br /><br />At any rate, this is an excellent book of speculation about the future of our planet aimed at a general readership.  It is a fine follow-up to their Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe (2000).  As in that book their conclusions are pessimistic.  They concluded in Rare Earth that we are probably alone in the galaxy; here they conclude that we will go extinct without getting beyond our solar system.  This bleak prognosis should not unduly trouble us however since our demise by their calculation is at least millions of years in the future, possibly hundreds of millions of years.  In fact their scenario reverses the biological experience of the planet: things will get hotter and drier until life necessarily retreats back into the ocean, and then as the oceans evaporate, life forms regress from the complex to the simple until the only life left on the planet is single-celled, as it was three billion years ago.  And then of course the sun expands into a red giant and the earth is burned to a crisp.<br /><br />Is there any escape?  Not according to Ward and Brownlee who argue effectively that it is unlikely that we will acquire the ability and the will to even terra form Mars or other places in the Solar System.  The idea that we might become interstellar travelers is also quashed as being impractical in the extreme.  They conclude \\"Interstellar travel will likely never happen, meaning we are stranded in this solar system forever.\\" (p. 207)<br /><br />While I tend to agree with Ward and Brownlee for the most part, as I did with their conclusions in Rare Earth, I think we should realize that their argument in part is a bit beside the point since in millions of years (at most)--not tens of millions, not hundreds of millions and certainly not billions of years--we will no longer be human anyway.  The average life span of a species is something like a million years.  Because of the incredibly rapid pace of cultural evolution it is highly unlikely that humans as presently constituted will be around in even a thousand years.  Some people think we will be part software and part machine before this century is out.  Also as science fiction writers have pointed out, the constraints on our species as presently constituted (in terms of our ability to travel in space and to influence cosmic processes) may not apply to the creatures we are becoming.<br /><br />Ward and Brownlee do not consider this point of view, most likely because it would be extraneous to the scope of their book.  So some of their ideas should be considered as stimulative and consciousness-raising, not definitive.  As they acknowledge in the epilogue, \\"Prophecy is a risky business...\\" (p. 210)  Furthermore, most of their material is on the purely physical changes that will take place on planet earth as it evolves toward its ultimate fate, and I have no doubt that the picture that Ward and Brownlee present is as accurate as present knowledge allows.<br /><br />I was especially intrigued by their discussion of the return of the once and future supercontinent, Gondwanaland, and how its reconfiguration will affect earth's climate.  Their exposition on the carbon dioxide cycle and the end of plant life when the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere falls below 10 ppm was also fascinating.  The chapter asking the question, \\"What Trace Will We Leave?\\" really gives the lie to human vanity, reminding me of the sentiments in Shelley's poem \\"Ozymandias.\\"  If anything, Ward and Brownlee are even more pessimistic than the poet, pointing out that our proud \\"messages in a bottle\\" sent into interstellar space are not likely to impact \\"a planet within a trillion years,\\" by which time there won't be any planets. (p. 186)<br /><br />While most of the book is very well written and edited, some of the sentences in the later chapters are less carefully constructed.  There are even some gaffs.  For example on page 192 they repeat an error from their previous book, stating that there are \\"between 200 million and 300 million\\" stars in our galaxy, when the number is more like 100 billion plus.  Also on page 194 they give the Drake Equation enhanced with new terms they think appropriate, but in fact the equation is without explanation shorter than Drake's Equation given on page 192.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"ld be extraneous to the scope of their book.

Lack of will-power?  Lack of exercise?  Our genetic constitution?  Ignorance?  Indoctrination through advertising by the fast and junk food industries?  Answer: all of the above except lack of will-power.  When it comes to eating, will-power really has nothing to do with it.  Food is a \\"drug\\" we can't quit cold turkey.  Abstinence is impossible.  We must eat, and so the temptation to overeat and/or eat the wrong foods will always be with us.  Not only that but we are constantly being bombarded with messages from the purveyors of food to eat this, eat that, eat more, more and more.  Super-sizing the proles is a massively huge business.<br />So what to do?  Are we looking at a future in which most of us are round mounds of huffing and puffing blubber subject to diabetes and an early death?  Shell is hopeful.  She believes that if we can somehow regulate the fast food industry in a manner similar to way we are regulating the tobacco industry (see the final chapter), if we educate the public, and turn down the constant din of fast and junk food advertizing, and keep sodas and junk food out of our schools while increasing exercise programs especially for school children, there is hope.  However, as Shell illustrates graphically by the story she tells on herself to end Chapter Ten, it is more likely that instead of exercising, we will get into the car, \\"rev the engine, and steer toward dinner.\\"<br />Regardless of how daunting the public health task of reducing obesity is, Shell makes it a fascinating read.  She writes about the morbidly obese and their struggles with stomach stapling and gastric banding; about cultures lured away from their native diets by Spam, pizza and sugared sodas so that virtually everyone from child to adult is fat and many are diabetic (e.g., the Kosraen islanders of the South Pacific); about \\"Natural Born Freaks\\" (Chapter Three) children born with a genetic defect that makes them constantly hungry no matter how much or how often they eat; about being hungry during wartime or during food-deprivation experiments in which the hungry can think and talk of nothing but food and more food; and especially about \\"Big Food\\" which views critics as \\"food cops...intent on using junk science to build a socialist nanny state\\" (p. 230)<br />As I read the book and followed Shell's research I could see her learning the melancholy lesson that \\"Obesity represents a triumph of instinct over reason\\" (p. 221).  I could sense her early optimism giving way to a realization that \\"The labyrinth of genes, peptides, and hormones regulating food intake is dense and byzantine, extremely difficult to fool or to manipulate.\\" (p. 147)  This is a lesson that Shell presents well.  What it means is that all those scientists looking for the magic pill that will allow us to \\"lose pounds fast\\" (and incidentally make big bucks for themselves and their employer) are not likely to be successful any time soon.<br />Most of us know, as Shell reports, that people who go on diets of any kind may initially lose weight, but almost invariably gain it all back and usually with pounds to boot.  The reason quite simply is that we can't fool mother nature.  The evolutionary mechanism has structured in us the very fine ability to eat when there is a bounty of food so that we can put on fat to survive the inevitable times of lean.  This is what we are good at.  It is one of our talents.  Mother nature isn't about to leave fat-storage to chance in human beings anymore than it leaves reproduction to chance.  Dieting is just a mimicking of a time of lean.  It has no lasting value as fat-reducing behavior.<br />Shell's prescription for individuals is the obvious and the very difficult one: turn off the TV, get off the couch, don't get into that vehicle, in fact trade the entire TV/car culture in for one in which we walk a whole lot more, actively recreate a lot more, eat more fresh fruits and vegetables and less high-fat and high-carb foods...in other words do those things that in fact we are not likely to do.<br />This is a very readable, well-researched, and incisive look at what is rapidly becoming the number one public health problem in not only the United States but world-wide.  Shell covers the subject well and writes the kind of prose that turns pages and makes a difficult subject readily accessible.he obvious and the very difficult one: turn off the TV, get off the couch, don't get into that vehicle, in fact trade the entire TV/car culture in for one in which we walk a whole lot more, actively recreate a lot more, eat more fresh fruits and vegetables and less high-fat and high-carb foods...in other words do those things that in fact we are not likely to do.<br />This is a very readable, well-researched, and incisive look at what is rapidly becoming the number one public health problem in not only the United States but world-wide.

When I first became aware of this idea some years ago I dismissed it out of hand along with what I saw as a couple of similar delusions, that of perpetual population growth and an ever-increasing agricultural yield.  But maybe the seemingly impossible is possible after all!<br /><br />To get right to the heart of the matter--which Czech does after noting that economic growth is a national goal; that is, a political and (one might say) an emotional goal somewhat in the manner of \\"manifest destiny\\" from the nineteenth century--we need to ask why Simon (and other respected economists) think that such a fantastic thing as perpetual economic growth is possible.<br /><br />First they start with \\"substitutability,\\" the idea that when we run short of some resource another will be developed or otherwise come along to take the place of the now scare resource.  Thus plastic replaces wood; coal will replace oil, wind power and mirrors in space will replace coal, and farmed fish will take the place of the wild variety.  Second, there is the notion that the efficiency of engines and other technological developments will increase endlessly.  And third, there is the relatively new idea of \\"human capital,\\" a kind of fuzzy--one is tempted to say mystical--belief that human intelligence, education and knowledge will just keep right on growing and growing and growing, getting more and more from less and less.<br /><br />Perhaps these guys never heard of entropy or diminishing returns--or they think that such things are so far in the future that they needn't be mentioned.  I suppose somewhere along the way the neoclassicists do recognize that in the very long run even the universe will grow cold, and economic growth will become but a faint and very distant cosmic whisper.<br /><br />What Czech observes, as he convincingly destroys Simon's perpetual growth arguments as Simon articulated them in The Ultimate Resources 2 (1996), is that \\"Eventually they will recharge their arguments...by resorting to the topic of space travel\\" (p. 44)--meaning that if we run out of resources on earth, we'll just go to the moon, to Mars, to Alpha Centauri!<br /><br />So what Julian L. Simon and the others are really saying is not clear.  What is clear is that they want no limits on economic growth, and they especially do not like to hear sob stories about what we are doing to the environment in pursuit of an ever expanding economy.  But what Brian Czech does in this sprightly tome is throw a kind of Niagra Falls flood of water on America's love affair with what he calls \\"liquidation\\"--that is, the liquidation of natural capital for present consumption to the impoverishment of future generations.<br /><br />As others have pointed out he does a good job of demolishing what he dubs \\"the Ptolemaic theory of perpetual economic growth\\" (p. 51) in favor of \\"a more Copernican economics...in which economic growth is limited.\\" (p. 49)  He calls this new paradigm, \\"steady state economics\\" or \\"ecological economics,\\" in which the natural resources of the planet are not wantonly wasted and destroyed by greedy \\"liquidators\\" bent only on self-gratification and status display, but instead maintained by more frugal steady-staters seeking self-actualization as their primary goal in life.  This recall of psychiatrist Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs fits right in with Czech's hope for a sustainable economy since self-actualization need not require more fuel than the planet has.<br /><br />What Czech does not do well is convince this reader that his steady state plan has a snowball's chance in the boiler room of his runaway train of becoming the accepted paradigm before we use up most of the world's non-renewable resources.  What with the acquisitive nature of the human animal (which Czech delineates very well in his portrait of the \\"Liquidating Class\\") and the need of corporations and government leaders to go from \\"ups to upper ups\\" economically-speaking (to recall Lucy's words in the Peanuts comic strip), there is little prospect that conservation-minded individuals will have enough influence to stop the train before it crashes.<br /><br />What is terrible about this--and this is what Czech is warning us about--is that it will be our grandchildren who will pay the price as the rain forests turn to burgers and the ocean's fisheries to a whopping fish story in the memory of the last fisherman.  What kind of world will it be?  I don't think that the Bush administration and the present political leaders of most of the world really care.  They see it as somebody else's problem downstream.  Czech's optimism that the train can be stopped seems like so much whistling Dixie in the dark.<br /><br />I think the deeper issue here is that of the capitalist/corporate economic system itself.  Capitalism defeated communism, and we can say hurrah for that.  But can a planet with finite resources survive an economic system that seems to function well only when it is spiraling upward?  Since capitalism is the current paradigm, to suggest that it needs replacing amounts to something like blasphemy.  Consequently Czech does not target capitalism per se.  After all he has a career and a reputation to consider.  However, I have neither to worry about, and I can say it: capitalism as an economic system is becoming a cancer on the planet.  Perhaps the system that will replace it (still awaiting its genius) will build on Czech's steady state ideas.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"ch delineates very well in his portrait of the \\"Liquidating Class\\") and the need of corporations and government leaders to go from \\"ups to upper ups\\" economically-speaking (to recall Lucy's words in the Peanuts comic strip), there is little prospect that conservation-minded individuals will have enough influence to stop the train before it crashes.<br /><br />What is terrible about this--and this is what Czech is warning us about--is that it will be our grandchildren who will pay the price as the rain forests turn to burgers and the ocean's fisheries to a whopping fish story in the memory of the last fisherman.

Other books look at the abortion question, at AIDS, at poverty, at water use and resources, etc.  Here the question is not just Is There a Population Problem? (the subject of Chapter 1) but Is the World's Population Growing Too Fast?; Is Overpopulation Responsible for Hunger, Poverty, and Environmental Problems?; What Are the Effects of Immigration into the United States?; and \\"What Population Policies Should Be Pursued? (chapters 4-5).<br />Each of the five chapters contains from six to eight essays in answer to the chapter questions.  For example, on whether there is a population problem, Editor Charles F. Hohm presents an essay from German demographer Johann Peter Sussmilch, which he entitles, \\"The State Should Encourage Population Growth,\\" excerpted from a larger eighteenth century work, and an \\"answer\\" to that from the English clergyman, Joseph Townsend, also from the eighteenth century.  Then there is something from Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population arguing that overpopulation is a serious problem, and then an answer from Frederick Engels, arguing that overpopulation is a myth.<br />The other chapters also contain some historical views, but more often the essays are from moderns.  For example there is economist Julian L. Simon's view that we don't have enough people on the planet as well as Rockefeller University professor Joel E. Cohen's counter that \\"There Are Too Many People on the Planet.\\"  Whether there is a shortage of food (or whether an apparent shortage of food is caused by distribution and/or political problems) is debated.<br />I have the 1995 edition of this book in front of me, and it is a fine introduction to the subject; but there is an edition copyright 2000 that features newer arguments including an essay from Pope John Paul II.  This is the sort of book that works well when it is kept current.  It is an excellent text for young people and those new to the argument.<br />The highlight of this book for me was the essay \\"Scientific Progress Will Solve the Population Problem\\" by John H. Fremlin (abridged from his \\"How Many People Can the World Support?\\" which appeared in the New Scientist in 1964).  In this extraordinary piece Fremlin argues not that the earth might support ten or twenty billion more people, but as science learns to efficiently utilize all sources of available energy including solar and nuclear, Fremlin sees the planet as supporting 15 trillion people within the next 450 years.  That's trillion with a \\"t\\" folks.  At this point the entire earth would enjoy \\"midday equatorial conditions round the clock\\" thanks to orbiting solar mirrors with a total area of 100 million square kilometers and the \\"complete fission of uranium and thorium in about 3 cm depth...or by fusion of deuterium in about 3 mm depth of seawater.\\"<br />But Fremlin is only getting warmed up (so to speak).  He goes on to argue that if the average heat income of the Earth's surface could be doubled from its present 250 watts per square meter (\\"without raising the temperature above the normal equatorial value\\"), the population density could reach \\"2 per square metre\\" or one quadrillion people.  Whether that's 10 to the 15th as in the American value of quadrillion or 10 to the 24th as in the British system (you do the math) doesn't matter.  My head is spinning in either case.<br />But Fremlin is still not through.  The problem now is how to get rid of all the heat generated by the energy needs of all these people (not to mention the heat their very bodies are radiating).  No problem.  The ocean would be roofed off (actually the entire planet) to stop evaporation and heat pumps would transfer excess heat into space.<br />Quality of life?  Fremlin notes that \\"even at much lower population densities, very little horizontal circulation of persons, heat or supplies could be tolerated.\\"  He adds, \\"clothes would beunnecessary.\\"  As a sort of postscript he notes that \\"low-speed...travel over a few hundred metres would be permissible\\" allowing people to choose friends from some ten million others living close by.<br />Is this a serious extrapolation, a nightmare or a horror story?--or (my surmise) an unconscious (perhaps self-)  parody of those who think there are no limits to population growth, especially of those who think another human soul on earth is more important than any quality of life argument or the maintenance of any other form of life.<br />Indeed, this is the real question that this book debates: at what point do we finally say that the \\"carrying capacity\\" of the planet has been reached, not only in terms of resources, but in terms of a life that is worth living?e unnecessary.\\"  As a sort of postscript he notes that \\"low-speed...travel over a few hundred metres would be permissible\\" allowing people to choose friends from some ten million others living close by.<br />Is this a serious extrapolation, a nightmare or a horror story?--or (my surmise) an unconscious (perhaps self-)  parody of those who think there are no limits to population growth, especially of those who think another human soul on earth is more important than any quality of life argument or the maintenance of any other form of life.<br />Indeed, this is the real question that this book debates: at what point do we finally say that the \\"carrying capacity\\" of the planet has been reached, not only in terms of resources, but in terms of a life that is worth living?	2003-05-18

Bill McKibben is terrified (the word is not too strong) that science and technology are on the verge of engineering humans out of existence.<br />I think his fears are justified.  However I don't think we should be worried.  Unlike McKibben, who seems to view human beings as a fixed endowment (perhaps from a Creator), I think we can view ourselves as ever changing, ever evolving beings, constantly in the process of becoming.  I welcome the excitement and prospect of our accelerated evolution.  Yes, there are dangers ahead, so it is important to proceed with caution and full deliberation.<br />The main danger that McKibben presents that I find creditable is that the already wide gap between the haves and have nots of the world will simply get greater and greater until the former will view the latter as something less than human, and the latter will feel demoralized, inferior and without hope.  The GenRich will spend their resources on upgrading their genetic stock and especially that of their offspring, while the GenPoor, who will not be able to afford the expensive genetic engineering will, relatively speaking, become less skilled, less talented and presumably a lot less happy.  This is a very real danger, and from what I know of humanity, and what I can see in our ghettos and in our suburbs, one not likely to be averted.<br />But this is the irony of McKibben's argument.  He wants to restrain science and technology so that our humanity will not change, so that we will remain as we are.  His arguments sadly give the lie to his thesis.  He avers that a child that has had its genome altered in some way, perhaps to improve memory or IQ or appearance or even emotional intelligence, is now \\"a product.\\"  He adds, \\"You [as a parent] can take precisely as much pride in her achievements as you take in the achievements of your dishwashing liquid.\\" (p. 59)  I disagree, and I think (and hope) the child would too.<br />On page 48 he asserts that the faith of a genetically altered \\"anchorite monk\\" would be \\"utterly meaningless\\" compared to that which \\"his medieval ancestor inherited by birthright.\\"  How could McKibben know this, and would the monk agree with him?  Frankly, such assertions are just McKibben's preferences, built into his psyche by his genetic composition, his experience and his education.  Are such views somehow lacking in meaningfullness because of that?<br />The genetically altered child is NOT going to feel like a product, unless he listens to McKibben.  The child is still a child, perhaps a beautiful, intelligent and loving child.  But McKibben seems to think because someone's genome may be altered they can no longer take pride in themselves.  He gives the example earlier in the book of himself and his running.  He writes that it is a great source of pride for him to be able to complete a marathon only an hour or so behind the leaders.  But he says he would no longer take pride in such an accomplishment had he been engineered for it.  But in fact he has been evolutionarily \\"engineered\\" for it.  Most of us cannot, no matter how hard we try, run a marathon in three, four, five or even ten hours.  His ancestors chose (consciously or unconsciously) to mate with genes for running rather than say genes for surviving long winters by burning body fat.  By his reasoning, his pride in his running accomplishments should be lessen by the knowledge that he was bred for it to some extent.<br />\\"Natural\\" as seen by McKibben is good; man made or induced is bad.  His sense that there is something sacred in sexual reproduction (see p. 12) is shared by many and is understandable.  However, the people of the future might feel differently, and I wouldn't be surprised to see in the not too distant future a woman's movement toward relieving themselves of the burden, the pain, the relative immobility, and the danger of pregnancy for something less \\"natural.\\"  Natural is not necessarily better.  Would we like to live with all the natural parasites that burdened our ancestors?  Are baby bottles and formula to be condemned because they are unnatural?  Should a child whose mother had to resort to their use feel less pride in him or herself?<br />To be fair the changes that we are facing today are greater both in extent and different in kind that we have so far faced.  But in principle they are not.  We judge from our position of prejudice in what we are now and what we have been, not in what we may be.<br />There is one other danger that I wish McKibben had focused on, that of making sure our genetic choices are adaptive in the Darwinian sense.  (Instead of worrying rhetorically, as he does on page 157, about which frozen wife Robert Ettinger will be married to should they be unfrozen.  This sort of journalism I think he should save for a Geraldo TV Special should the opportunity arise.)  If we always opt for more happiness and serenity in our lives, we may wake up some day and find that we can no longer cope with the contingencies of the environment.  On the other hand if we foolishly cling to an unchanged genome we may find that changing circumstances will leave us far behind.  In either case there is the danger of becoming exinct.<br />We need to educate ourselves to cope with the growing complexity of our culture.  That is the answer to the challenge of science and technology, not any neo-Luddite attempt at stuffing the genie back into the bottle.lative immobility, and the danger of pregnancy for something less \\"natural.\\"  Natural is not necessarily better.

And will \\"we\\" still be here when we get there?<br />Digital Soul is about the nature of our world when machines become as intelligent as humans and beyond.  It is also about the nature of those machines.  It is clear that Georges has thought long and hard about the subject, has read widely and has compared notes with other futurists.  His expression is reasoned and reasonable.  There are no muddy sentences or mystical ambiguities.  He has worked hard to make sure that his ideas are accessible to a wide range of people including those with no expertise in the field of Artificial Intelligence.<br />Clearly the problem is to derive benefit from super intelligent machines without letting them take over our lives.  Georges believes that it will be difficult to do that since, as the machines get smarter and smarter and we allow them more and more latitude and we more and more depend on them, they will come to control us.<br />But this is where I think Georges goes astray.  The question I would ask is, would they WANT to control us?<br />Georges implies that human-like values, such as that of self-preservation will automatically follow from machines becoming intelligent.  But actually the machines will have no values at all and no desire, either.  They will have no inclination to act except as such inclinations are built into their make-up.<br />Georges also implies that he knows what qualities or values are desirable in a machine.  He speaks of \\"nicer, testosterone-free, superhuman beings\\" as opposed to \\"greedy, violent, barbaric, self-absorbed\\" beings. (p. 212)  While these are surely agreeable preferences, it is not clear that artificial creatures designed according to human choice would long survive.<br />It is also not clear that we would want to design machines according to human values.  We would want to design them as tools (which they are) to assist us in following our desires and supporting our values.  Notice the difference.  Machines that work toward fulfilling the desires and upholding the values of human beings are not the same as machines that contain the desires and values of human beings.<br />What I think Georges temporarily forgets is that no machine is going to \\"want\\" to do anything unless \\"desire\\" is built into the machine.  The machine doesn't care whether it is plugged in or not unless we somehow encode such a desire into the machine.  What Georges seems to assume is that somehow the complexity that we will demand from machines will somehow necessitate that we inculcate desire, self-preservation and the like into the machine.  I think this will not be necessary at all.  Indeed I suspect our machines will tell us that they will be able to function just fine without the institution of some kind of supercode or primary instruction telling them to protect themselves and have ulterior motives.  (Such notions led to HAL 9000's murderous behavior in Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey.)<br />I think a more likely future (and one that Georges addresses) is a symbiosis between people and intelligent machines in which the machines have the knowledge, skill and intelligence necessary for making decisions, but that the actual decisions and the impetus for action remain with human beings.<br />However, should intelligent machines, as Georges fears, somehow acquire purpose and goals and desires such as self-preservation, then there is a great danger of our lives being taken over and controlled by intelligent machines.  He warns us that we have to guard against that danger.<br />Georges rightly brings up the Fermi Paradox in Chapter 18.  Since it would appear (to some at least) that the universe is teeming with intelligent life, Fermi famously asked, \\"Where is everybody?\\"  One of the many answers (aside from \\"we are alone\\") is that \\"technological civilizations have a very short life expectancy, because they promptly destroy themselves during their technological adolescence.\\"  This insight from Georges on page 214 is anotherway of pointing to what he is worried about.  Still another way (perhaps) of expressing this is to say that we will merge with our intelligent machines, and having acquired a sort of superintelligence, will find that the values that were built into us by the evolutionary mechanism are muted, values such as self-preservation, curiosity, greed, anger, vengeance, etc.  Any sort of desire may be culturally evolved out of us.  Why do anything at all? may very well become the unanswerable question.  Perhaps this is what happens to technological civilizations in their adolescence, and that is why we haven't heard from them.<br />Beyond this I think we need to realize that evolutionary creatures, which we are, are just a place along the way to something else.  What that something else will be is as much beyond our ken as understanding quantum mechanics is to bubble bees.<br />Regardless of some disagreements this is a very interesting book well worth reading from cover to cover.  I agree with his enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and I agree that we should continue to pursue its development and not become neo-Luddites.  But I am not afraid of a future without human beings as we are now constituted.  We are imperfect creatures.  We are appropriate and adapted to the present environment.  When the environment changes, as it surely will, we may no longer be able to adapt and may go the way of the dodo.  So be it.  We know from looking at the past that all species eventually die.  New ones come into existence.  Should the future be any different?<br />As we see the limitations of humanity, as we see ourselves for the first time as we really are, perhaps it is time for a greater identification.

The central image of this interesting, erudite and somewhat self-indulgent book is the &quot;black swan,&quot; a metaphor for both the rare event that eventually will happen, and for the fact that you can't prove a negative (the problem of induction) because no matter how many white swans you count, you do not prove that the next one won't be black.<br />Taleb's central thesis is that many people are successful in the markets and in life not because they are clever or skillful, but because they are lucky.  They are the beneficiaries of randomness.<br />Randomness (or &quot;luck&quot; or &quot;chance&quot;) is one of those illy-defined abstractions that may or may not actually exist in the real world, but is very handy nonetheless.  Certainly no one has yet come up with a device that gives truly random results.  Indeed even if such a device were found (say the digits of pi) how could we be sure the results are random?  The human mind finds patterns in all things of any complexity from cloud formations to stock charts.  But should we ever find a complex entity, say a string of numbers, in which we can discern no pattern, we can surmise that that string is not random because a purely random result would not be constrained by the requirement that there be no pattern!<br />Thus the paradox of randomness that Taleb addresses.  He argues persuasively, using evidence from science, literature, and his own experience as a derivatives trader, that the human mind is not wired to cope with randomness.  He believes that we see causality and order where there is none.  We think we become rich or poor based on our wise or unwise behavior, but Taleb believes that much of the time it is capricious chance that accounts for our fate.<br />Thus Bill Gates becomes fabulously rich not because his software was the best or even because he worked harder than anyone else or because he was smarter, but because he was luckier. (Just ask his competitors!)  Taleb calls the rise of Microsoft &quot;a spectacular lucky success.&quot; (p.145)<br />What we don't see, Taleb assures us, as we gaze upon these successes are the &quot;alternate histories,&quot; that is, the lives of those very many who tried and failed to achieve success.  Taleb uses an old con (p. 128) to illustrate this point: Suppose you are a money manager seeking clients.  You send out a newsletter to 10,000 prospects predicting with absolute certainty in 5,000 of the letters that the market will rise next month, and in the other 5,000 that it will fall.  If it goes up you now send out 5,000 more letters to those who received the bullish prediction, in 2,500 of them predicting again that the market will go up next month, and in the other 2,500 that it will go down. You repeat this and after seven months you will have about 78 potential clients left who have seen you predict market direction unerringly for seven months in a row!<br />I first encountered this scheme in the world of sports betting in Las Vegas.  A tout guarantees a mortal &quot;lock&quot; on an NFL football game, half of its sheets touting team A and the other half team B.<br />Taleb applies this phenomenon to marketing executives, asserting, &quot;One can make money in the financial markets totally out of randomness.&quot; (p. 80)  What he means again is that one can get lucky.  And this can go on for a long time.  If you happened to be a &quot;dip buyer&quot; and traded stocks during the middle to late nineties, you did very well.  There were some people who entertained only that idea, and ended up looking like geniuses.<br />But in this &quot;analysis&quot; Taleb is guilty of the very bugaboo he warns against, namely that of seeing patterns in data, and assigning causality to events, where there is none.  It may be the case that the &quot;dip buyer&quot; carefully assessed the market everyday and the result of his technical and fundamental analysis was that in virtually every case his research was the deciding factor, not any propensity to buy on dips.<br />Was it luck or expertise?  It is hard to say for sure.  Well, when is it NOT luck? one might ask.  Dr. Taleb anticipates this question and responds, &quot;To be honest, I am unable to answer it.&quot; (p. 141)<br />Taleb is on solid ground however when he warns against &quot;data snooping.&quot; (pp.134-135)  This fallacy of &quot;fitting the data to the rule&quot; is something every trader (and sports bettor, by the way) should know about.  You can look at past results and if you look long enough you will find a pattern.  That pattern usually is randomness fooling you.  Bet on that pattern and you will have the same expectation that you would have if instead you threw darts at the market pages of the newspaper and bet on the stocks the darts hit.  Taleb doesn't mention this, but the way to separate the chaff of the past from the wheat is to have an empirical theory first and then test that theory against the data.  If your theory is a good one and the data supports the theory, you may have discovered something.  This is not the same thing as fitting the data to the theory or &quot;data snooping.&quot;  This is in fact science.  To find something like this in the financial markets, however, is like the alchemist's dream of transmuting lead into gold.<br />&quot;I am emotional and derive most of my energy from my emotions&quot; Taleb tells us. (p. 180)  This is something we all do.  The difference--as Taleb happily tells us--is that he knows what drives him but most of us don't.  We imagine that we act from reason.propensity to buy on dips.<br />Was it luck or expertise?  It is hard to say for sure.  Well, when is it NOT luck? one might ask.

1155677:US	49786731	R22SRYOO9MJBTY	0618118128	78970097	Darwin's Blind Spot: Evolution Beyond Natural Selection	Books	5	17	19	N	N	Exploring the importance of symbiosis in evolution	What Frank Ryan demonstrates in this book is that evolution by symbiosis has been a \\"blind spot\\" for evolutionists since the time of Darwin, and even today is greatly underestimated by the Darwinian establishment as a force in evolutionary change, especially in speciation.<br /><br />Ryan, who is an expert on viruses having penned such well-received books as Virus X: Tracking the New Killer Plagues and The Forgotten Plague, begins with some interesting history from Darwin's time showing that Darwin did not (and could not, to be fair) appreciate the role symbiosis plays in evolution.  Indeed Ryan demonstrates that the process of symbiosis, and its sister processes, parasitism, mutualism and disease, itself has been misunderstood.  A relationship between species may begin as parasitism (or disease) and eventually evolve into a symbiosis.  This experience between species has been going on since before there were multi-cellular organisms, and is a feature of every species in existence.  All species interact with some other species in symbiosis.<br /><br />This central realization of the book leads to something like a new way of looking at evolution.  Natural selection is still a factor, but not necessarily the major factor anymore.  This is implied in the discovery not too many years ago that the mitochondria that inhabit the cells in our body are almost certainly the remnants of a once free-living bacterium that, long ago in the primeval soup or near an undersea volcanic caldron, entered a cell and stayed.  We are then the product of symbiosis, which may have begun as one cell invading the other, and over the eons turned into a domestic living arrangement with the invading cell providing power to the larger cell as that cell protects and feeds the symbiont that is now earning its keep.<br /><br />How eye opening this conception is!  Imagine the planet filled with life forms that are composed of a dozen, or perhaps hundreds of similar arrangements made over the eons.  This is evolution not by gradual steps but evolution by saltation, with a new species arising almost (geologically speaking) immediately.  Such a conception would explain many of the gaps in the fossil record.<br /><br />Ryan builds a strong case.  Along the way he looks favorably upon James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis (one of my favorite modern ideas) and explores the role that viruses have had in gene transfers and speciation.  He contrasts the neo-Darwinian reductionists (Dawkins, et al) with a different bred of evolutionary biologist including Lynn Margulis, Erik Larsson, Luis P. Villarreal, Kwang Jeon, John Maynard Smith, Eors Szathmary, and others.  He also recalls some scientists who pioneered the ideas of symbiosis but never got the credit they deserved and were virtually ignored by the Darwinian establishment.  It is surprising to see how \\"blind\\" the evolutionists were and how hard it was (and is) for new ideas to gain a foothold in any scientific community.  But that is the way it should be: a new idea is just a notion until it finds collaborative support by being tested scientifically.<br /><br />The Gaia metaphor is perhaps the ultimate expression of symbiosis in that it involves the entire biosphere.  Ryan recalls Lovelock's view that our planet with its atmosphere and self-regulating processes represents \\"an emergent property\\" of life \\"tightly coupled with the physics and chemistry of the Earth's environment.\\" (p. 112)  This view has yet to gain full acceptance in the scientific community, but as knowledge of the symbiotic and cooperative nature of life (instead of an emphasis on the competitive nature) becomes more widely known (and as the old scientists retire!) I think that will change.  Ryan makes it abundantly clear that (to recall an expression I either dreamed up or cribbed from somewhere) \\"Everything works toward a symbiosis.\\"<br /><br />One of the bugaboos in natural selection has been the idea of group selection.  This has been debated for manydecades, but it is becoming increasingly obvious (and Ryan strongly supports this view) that group selection is a reality.  Ryan reports on the work of David Sloan Wilson and Elliott Sober, who used mathematic models to demonstrate how group selection might work.  (p. 255)  I have argued elsewhere for group selection so I won't go any further than to note that the biosphere that survives versus the one that doesn't (either through pollution, madness, lack of foresight, inability to ward off incoming disasters, etc.) is selected.<br /><br />The most controversial idea in this book may be Ryan's insistence that natural selection should be seen as \\"an editorial force\\" acting upon what he calls \\"the creativity of the Genome.\\" (p. 265).  He has German biologist Werner Schwemmler suggest a balance by noting that the \\"combination of the two explanations (Darwinian gradualism and symbiotic saltation)\\" together progress \\"toward a unified theory of evolution.\\"  If this is correct, the way we view biological evolution is going to change dramatically in the years to come.<br /><br />Ryan makes a distinction between endosymbiosis and exosymbiosis, the former involving one genome living within another, the latter pertaining to relationships such as that between pollinating insects and plants.  I want to add that the exosymbiosis between humans and our crops and domestic animals has been the essential factor in our becoming a new sort of creature, one that evolves culturally rather than biologically, and will within a twinkling of time evolve into something that we cannot yet envision because of this rapid cultural evolution.  Perhaps, as some have suggested, we will form a symbiosis with our intelligent machines and let Darwinian evolution edit the result.<br /><br />Bottom line: an exciting book, challenging and filled with information and ideas.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"decades, but it is becoming increasingly obvious (and Ryan strongly supports this view) that group selection is a reality.

1159932:US	49786731	RABGDTDP3X40J	0415288010	247093753	War without End: The Rise of Islamist Terrorism and Global Response	Books	4	21	29	N	N	Dense, readable; inconclusive	The latter part of the title of this book is accurate.  It is about the rise of Islamist terrorism (especially this) and the reaction of the rest of the world.  The first part of the title, War without End, is an interpretation of the effect of that response, especially by the United States.  On page 411 Hiro quotes President George W. Bush as saying \\"So long as anybody is terrorizing established government, there needs to be a war.\\"  Hiro's belief is that unless the root causes of terrorism are eliminated, \\"This is a recipe for war without end.\\"<br />I think he is mistaken on two counts.  One, the root causes of terrorism are not easy to identify and they vary substantially from country to country.  To say that poverty and repressive governments are the root cause, as Hiro apparently does (quoting French Foreign minister Hubert Vedrine on page 411), is mistaken (although they may be contributing causes) since there are many places in the world where poverty exists along with repressive regimes and yet there is no terrorism.  Furthermore, one of the most brutal terrorists of them all, Osama bin Laden, was a privileged and extravagantly rich Saudi son with millions of dollars and four wives.  What is the root cause of his terrorism?  Insanity or just plain old hatred, jealousy, and prejudice?<br />Two, a universally agreed upon definition of terrorism, as Hiro points out on page 412, is lacking.  The Arab world, for example, believes that Palestinian suicide bombings in Israel are not acts of terrorism, but acts of self-defense.  Since it is not clear just what is and what is not terrorism, it is difficult to work on the \\"causes.\\"  Clearly there has been since the time of the Prophet (and before) \\"a war without end\\" in the Arab Muslim lands regardless of circumstance.<br />Consequently, the only viable response to terrorism is the same as any civilized society has toward violent crime.  Until we have a universal justice system (with enforcement) or until all countries in the world cooperate against terrorism, individual nations will do what they can to protect themselves and their people.<br />But these arguments aside, the central fact is there is no justification for terrorism.  Indeed there is no justification for the use of violent force against anyone except in self-defense.  This is the view of most people in the world; indeed it stems from such universally-agreed upon precepts in the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, and the tenets of all religions.  The problem in the world today is that it is not so easy to determine where self-defense actually begins.  Thus we have the emerging doctrine of unilateral preemptive strikes against terrorists which may very well be acts of self-defense.<br />What Hiro does well in this book is to give us a thorough modern history (in so far as one can in a single 513-page volume) of the conflicts within and among the Arab states, particularly in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, leading up to the situation as it exists today.  His report is fairly well balanced, revealing an almost continuous climate of murder, revenge, armed conflict, war, repression and assassination by various Islamic and not-so Islamic groups, tribes, organizations and governments in the Middle East.  He makes it clear (to me at least) that it is not Islam, per se, that is responsible for the continued carnage so much as the various violent and war-like interpretations of the Quran and the Hadith by assorted mullahs and any alim with a website.  The tribal mentality that still exists in much of the Arab world is also clearly shown as a factor.  This is a view of the world that highly values the effective use of force and violence; and a mentality that so fears women (or its own inability to live equally with women) that they must be controlled by making them subservient and hidden from sight.  One also sees at fault the Muslim mind that believes that Islam is the only true religion.  Such narrow-minded prejudice and stupidity, along with a reliance on authority instead of the scientific method as a test of truth, leaves many in the Middle East in ignorance and poverty.  Imagine what it must be like to live in a society in which to change your religion is to invite a sentence of death.<br />Hiro identifies the rise of Islamist terrorism with Egyptian President Sadat's signing a bilateral peace treaty with Israel in 1979. (p. 422)  I would suggest that perhaps the violent inspiration of Sayyid Qutb and other Islamic extremists who inspired the militant Muslim Brotherhood which arose against the Egyptian government and spread from there may be a better focus.  Hiro has Qutb argue on page 67 \\"that once the Brothers had declared someone to be jahil (infidel), they had the right to attack this person or property, a right granted in Islam.\\"<br />A recipe for War without End is to imagine that this sort of thinking has any legitimacy in a civilized world.<br />For my part it is a sin (if sin there be) to presume to speak for God.  Those who pretend to be God's conduits are merely trying to increase their personal power and prestige.  Hiro quotes from the Quran (3:164) as justifying suicidal martyrdom in the eyes of \\"radical Islamists\\" with these words: \\"Count not those who were slain in God's way as dead, but rather living with their Lord...\\" (p. 270)  Such an interpretation to my mind depreciates the believer's God to the point that there is no difference between God and men.  Any God that needs people to kill other people for reward isn't much of a God.<br />This is a formidable read, packed with information and clearly written; but perhaps Hiro's weakness is a blindness in interpretation as though he were unaware of the very history he is describing.d stupidity, along with a reliance on authority instead of the scientific method as a test of truth, leaves many in the Middle East in ignorance and poverty.

Putnam hints at the reason: (1) It's not easy for a busy parent to supervise the exercise program, and hiring a personal exercise coach is expensive.  (2) \\"[I]nsurance will more likely cover medication\\" than therapy or a coach. (p. 13)  It should also be noted that Big Pharma is not motivated to conduct research into the effects of exercise on ADHD-labeled children since a positive finding would not favorably affect their bottom line.<br />Personally, I am highly suspicious of these new \\"disorders\\" like ADHD that HMO-driven doctors treat with drugs.  There are legitimate cases, no doubt; but most of the time I suspect there is nothing wrong except that this is a child that needs a lot of physical activity and a lot of body/mind stimulation.  That is that child's strength.  He (most of those diagnosed with ADHD are boys) can be active and effective at a high energy level and take in a lot more from the environment than other kids can.  He needs to be up and doing.  Putnam sees \\"movement\\" as satisfying \\"the wanderer, hunter, farmer, and gatherer in all of us.\\"  This is the message from evolutionary medicine.  We evolved in an environment that had us up and doing all day long.  The child that craves activity and stimulation is perhaps the truly natural child; and it is the modern environment with its restrictive classrooms and exercise-stealing tools and vehicles that is unnatural.  Perhaps the environment ought to be labeled as having PADD (Physical Activity Deficit Disorder).<br />Consider the program of the typical \\"soccer mom.\\"  Despite all her good intentions, her child really doesn't get enough exercise.  First there's the ride to the soccer field, then there's sitting on the bench during perhaps most of the game, then the ride to Chuckie Cheese's afterwards, and then the ride home.  Perhaps a couple of hours or more have passed and how much of that time was the child actually exercising?  Maybe twenty minutes, maybe ten.<br />How about at school?  How long does recess last?  Putnam cites studies that show even a little exercise tends to allow the child to focus better.  He even suggests that the very lack of movement forced on the child in the typical classroom situation is contributing to the symptoms of ADHD.  He uses the term \\"proprioceptive feedback\\" to refer to a mind/body phenomenon that allows us \\"to adjust our arousal level as well as our sense of tranquility.\\" (p. 22)  By the way, I would like to see the amount of time devoted to physical education in our schools doubled.  Not only would this help the child that feels trapped in the classroom, but would work against the growing problem of childhood obesity.<br />Putnam discusses what he calls \\"optimal stimulation\\" and analyzes the role of dopamine in an exercise program, and \\"the runner's high.\\"  He considers the wide range of needs that children may have and offers suggestions on how parents may help their child find the right exercise program.  He considers motivation and the family dynamics that either foster or hinder the child's opportunity to exercise.<br />Putnam clearly believes that the use of drugs to treat a hyperactive child should be the treatment of last choice, and I couldn't agree more.

1176885:US	49786731	RT7OW2WPBIQ9D	0972100539	760830909	The Miracle of Death	Books	5	18	19	N	N	A transforming experience, beautifully articulated	I have known Dr. Kovacs--Betty, of course to all those who know and love her--for--it will be forty years this fall.  She has been a teacher to me and a guide.  She is a great teller of stories--that ancient form of human expression that, along with myth and ritual, poetry and song, dance and music, speaks to us on a level more immediate than the verbal.  That she leaves out mention of this form in her delineation on page six is perhaps a slip of modesty.<br /><br />She has found her voice here in this wonderful and amazing recollection of a miracle that she experienced, recorded, transcribed, and now relates to us as the wise shaman of old often did around the prehistoric campfire, night after night, our faces warm, our eyes dancing with the flames, and our ears tuned to the voice of wisdom, mystery, experience, awe and spirituality.<br /><br />\\"The Bard,\\" as Betty calls this speaker, this charmer, this weaver of words--words that skip past the rational mind, dodge ordinary consciousness, to light into the very soul of the listener, is none other than herself, an expert on myth and culture telling us what was, what is and what will be, for herself, for those she loved and for those who loved her, and now for readers of this book.  (A beautifully presented book, by the way, meticulously edited and artfully designed, clearly written, every word weighed and weighed again, and every sentence polished.)<br /><br />Sometimes it is the smallest thing, a sudden rustle in the trees, the fall of rain out of a cloudless sky that awakens us to a realization of the extraordinary depth of things.  In Zen this is seen as Enlightenment, something that comes and goes and comes again until perhaps we are ready and then it stays.  With Betty, the Enlightenment was a supernova of sudden experience, the likes of which few of us ever encounter: the death of her mother in a car accident; and then a year later the death of her only, and much beloved, most beautiful son, also in an automobile accident; and then sixteen months later the death--still again in an auto accident--of her husband of over thirty years, the central love of her life, a man of extraordinary vitality and quiet wisdom, also my friend and guide.<br /><br />Most people would not only give way to despair and depression, anger and a justifiable self-pity if in swift succession such events rained down like molten lead upon them.  But Betty, always a teacher and an example, a guide and a person aware of herself as a spiritual being, gave way not to any of that, but turned what seemed on the surface to be something beyond horror into the most amazing transformation of love and creativity.  Working with dream, symbol and myth, she saw and lived and breathed what she calls \\"The Miracle of Death,\\" an enlightenment that flung open the doors of perception (always made opaque by the ordinary mind) to reveal a depth of Being beyond any ordinary comprehension of it.<br /><br />\\"We do not die,\\" says the Gita, and in this book we learn that death and life are but different sides of the same coin, inseparable, miraculous features of a balanced and dynamic cosmology in which the peace that passeth understanding becomes immediate if only we are open to it.<br /><br />Being does not exist without non-being.  How could it?  And life does not exist without death.  That is clear.  But what Betty wants us to know is that death is merely another aspect of life.  As her son Pisti (wise beyond his years) said to his father, \\"Dad, there is nothing but life.\\"<br /><br />In reading this book you may find, as I did, a resonance in Betty's theme of \\"denied realities\\" (p. 33) or \\"realities beyond the rational\\" (p. 108) suppressed by the ordinary consciousness of the Western world.  Or you may find an accord in her debunking of  the \\"myth of empty materialism\\" (p. 42) clung to by Western culture.  Professor Kovacs sees the \\"material myth\\" as the cause of our disassociation from our spiritual selves evidenced by, among other things, wide spread pollution of all kinds.

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life	Books	5	111	126	N	N	Examining their navels?	This is the most up-to-date and thorough discussion of the Fermi Paradox that I have read.  Stephen Webb examines all the popular solutions as well as some esoteric ones, giving us considerable background on each along with the benefit of his knowledge on a wide range of relevant subjects including microbiology, plate tectonics, evolution, intelligence, language, philosophy, as well as astronomy and cosmology.  And then he gives his solution: we are alone.<br /><br />That was Fermi's solution of course, and it is a popular one; however I don't think that Webb comes anywhere near to making a convincing case; and at any rate he is somewhat equivocal about whether his answer applies to the entire universe or to just the galaxy.  It is clear that his answer applies only to life as we know it, having a carbon based biochemistry and a cellular structure.  My feeling is that intelligent life forms may evolve from some other chemical basis or even from some use of energy and matter we know nothing about.<br /><br />On pages 237 to 239 Webb presents his argument that we are the only extraterrestrial civilization (ETC) in the galaxy by a process of elimination, i.e., life must be on a planet within both a galactic habitable zone (GHZ) and a solar continuously habitable zone (CHZ) around the right kind of star; must avoid cosmic disasters like supernovae; must have the right kind of moon, Jupiter, and plate tectonics; must evolve beyond single cells; must develop tool use and language, etc.  He ends up sifting out everything except us, and the only reason he doesn't sift us out is that he has set us aside since we actually exist!<br /><br />This is close to sophistry, perhaps, but it has been argued before.  I might call it the Fallacy of Elimination by Unknown Probabilities about Matters that May or May Not Be Essential.  Putting that aside, consider this: If we extrapolate from what we know (as opposed to any speculation) about the existence of life in just our own galaxy, we should expect on average--at the very least--one ETC per galaxy.  Wow.  Far from being alone, this suggests more than 100 billion other ETCs are out there, although we are not likely to ever communicate with them.<br /><br />One of the things this book demonstrates, as others have before (see especially, Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee's Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe [2000], which Webb acknowledges as influential), is that when you're dealing with so little concrete information in such a vastness, it is impossible to be entirely convincing one way or the other.  The conclusion in Rare Earth, with which Webb concurs, is that life is common in the universe, but intelligent life is rare.  I agree substantially with this, but my \\"rare\\" is perhaps larger than their \\"rare.\\"<br /><br />Some of the familiar but crucial questions considered here were addressed in the excellent Extraterrestrials: Where Are They? (1995) edited by Ben Zuckerman and Michael H. Hart.  For example, How long do ETCs exist before they go extinct?  Is space travel enormously difficult and expensive or is it just very difficult?  Do ETCs have a psychology similar enough to ours to make them want to communicate?  How would they communicate, using what sort of medium?--even: would we recognize a communication from an ETC if we received one?<br /><br />The answer to these questions and many others is, we don't know.  But it's fun to speculate; and in speculating at least we can eliminate many conceptual and logical errors that might crop up.  Furthermore such speculations expand the mind and allow the imagination a greater range.  In direct contrast to Webb I think there's only the smallest chance that we are alone.  Amazing how people can come to such divergent conclusions from the same evidence!<br /><br />For such answers as, They are so advanced that they have no interest in communicating with us, and They are so into their own self-constructed pleasure-enhancing virtual existence that they care not to look outward, etc., Webb has a ready response.  For such answers to solve the Fermi paradox, he says, they have to apply to every single ETC.  Surely, he posits, not all ETCs would have such a psychology.  But, by taking all such solutions and playing an elimination game similar to the one Webb plays on pages 237-239, we can reverse his conclusion and eliminate all existing ETCs as non-communicative for one reason or another, arriving at the grand conclusion that we are not alone and that there are indeed a whole bunch of ETCs out there.<br /><br />I wish I had the space to address some other Stephen Webb arguments that I think are faulty, but perhaps just one more will be suggestive.  On page 229, while arguing that only humans have symbolic language, he relates an experiment in which a dolphin learns to operate an apparatus to release food.  The dolphin is timed.  Then the scientists close that dolphin off and release a second dolphin into the pool with the apparatus.  The first dolphin can send signals to the second dolphin.  The scientists then time how long it takes for the second dolphin to learn to work the apparatus.  They discover that it takes the second dolphin on average just as long as it did the first.  Webb writes: \\"We can conclude from this that the first dolphin was unable to tell the second dolphin how the apparatus worked.\\"<br /><br />Well, maybe.  But replace the dolphins with humans, and the reward of food with hundred dollar bills, and perhaps we might conclude that humans are also unable to communicate how the apparatus worked!<br /><br />Bottom line: for SETI enthusiasts and anyone interested in the prospect of extraterrestrial life, this is a book, despite its flaws, not to be missed.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\"l existence that they care not to look outward, etc., Webb has a ready response.

It has since appeared again and again in the literature of Zen Buddhism, but see especially D. T. Suzuki's Manual of Zen Buddhism.  Here Fortune magazine columnist and sometime corporate cog and very funny guy, Stanley Bing brings us up to date on how the allegory might play out in the corporate structure.  Instead of an ox that the boy innocent manages to tame, Bing gives us an elephant.  And instead of taming one's inner self (which is the point of the ox herding story) one tames one's boss, who is after all but a dumb animal.  However again, and very cleverly, Bing shows us that to tame one's boss or to tame one's self amounts to the same thing.<br />Curious.  But true.<br />There is a kind of The Tao of Pooh meets Dilbert and Murphy's Law on the Way to Enlightenment, done up with the kind of side bars and shaded boxes and cute graphics that one finds in computer learning or \\"Dummie's\\" guides \\"feel\\" to this little gem.  The design of the book is gorgeous, and the book itself is small enough even in hardcover to fit into a suit jacket pocket, should the need arise.<br />Bing's \\"Buddha Bullets\\" and other asides (scattered throughout) are sometimes funny, sometimes illuminating, and sometimes just plain dumb, but always in the Zen spirit of kicking the Buddha by the side of the road (should you meet him).  His \\"portrait\\" of the elephant will amuse, delight and find ready acknowledgment by any who have ever served an elephant--powerful, inimitable, crude, primitive and cagey force that the elephant is.  Remember, the elephant is BIGGER than you are, so it never hurts to kiss it up, fairly well sums up Bing's deep and strangely moving message.<br />The quotes at the beginning of each chapter from the Ten Ox Herding Paintings to, e.g., The Dhammapada, Groucho Marx, Dan Quayle and various CEOs--not to mention Mary Meeker, The Doors, and Mark Twain--blend together seamlessly so that curiously they become one in their wisdom or ironic lack thereof.<br />On a deeper level the elephant is the corporation itself, at once your master, your mother, your livelihood.  Bring that broom and shovel and follow along as you must until, as Bing has it in the last chapter on page 196, you \\"become proficient in the Zen art of elephant handling.\\"  At such time, your heart \\"drained...of desire,\\" your mind \\"emptied,\\" you have the elephant on leash, and the elephant knows that is where he belongs (as the boy has the ox by the nose ring).<br />Some might say that the deeper meaning of the ox herding story is it serves as a guide to meditation, the ox being the recalcitrant mind of the boy who becomes a man.  And so it is here: and so Bing advises as he ends the book: \\"sit down and don't think at all.\\"<br />Bottom line: this is a deliciously clever idea beautifully realized.to mention Mary Meeker, The Doors, and Mark Twain--blend together seamlessly so that curiously they become one in their wisdom or ironic lack thereof.<br />On a deeper level the elephant is the corporation itself, at once your master, your mother, your livelihood.

He does not cover as much ground here as in did in A Brief History of Time, but what he does cover he does so in a charming and engaging style.  There are some few statements here that could be interpreted as less than modest--although not by me--and a mistaken prediction or two, which may be a reason that Hawking is not pleased with this book's publication.  He might also object to the title, since neither a \\"Theory of Everything\\" nor a conclusive answer to the origin and fate of the universe are presented.<br /><br />However, Hawking does address these questions, and his expression is interesting to read and has the agreeable characteristic of being laconic.  There are no equations in the book, no mathematics as such, and everything is explained in language that would be intelligible to a high school student.  There are the usual droll Hawking jokes about God and His intentions, facetious, epigram-like understatements (I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. p. 66) and witty asides about the convergence of politics on physics, as when he mentions a particle accelerator the size of the Solar System that \\"would not be funded under current economic conditions.\\"<br /><br />A good chunk of the book is devoted to black holes (about which Hawking is or was the world's foremost authority) and whether they have \\"hair\\" and \\"sweat\\" or not.  Hawking avers on page 92 that if a primordial black hole is discovered \\"emitting a lot of gamma and X rays,\\" he will get the Nobel Prize.  This is an ironic lament since, as he explains later on, it is most likely that even if these very difficult to observe and very ancient black holes do exist, they are mostly evaporated by now, and so it is probable there will be no Nobel for Hawking.<br /><br />He also discusses a \\"no boundary condition\\" (p.119) of the big bang universe which seems to begin and end in a singularity in real-time while in imaginary time there are no singularities, just beginning and ending poles, like the north and south poles of the finite, unbounded surface of the earth. (p. 139)  I especially like this idea since it does away with the infinite singularity and the theological implications that some draw from such a beginning of the universe.  As Hawking asks rhetorically, in a \\"completely self-contained\\" universe with no boundary or edge--a universe \\"neither created nor destroyed\\"--what place would there be for a creator? (p. 126)<br /><br />He also addresses string theory, and I was pleased to read that he is no more enamored of all those little curled up dimensions than I am.  He says the theory has several other problems that need to be worked out, not the least of which is that we still don't know whether all the infinities will cancel out. (p. 159)<br /><br />Hawking closes with his ideas about the prospect for a Theory of Everything.  He gives three possibilities: (1) There is a \\"complete unified theory which we will someday discover...\\"  (2) There's no ultimate theory, \\"just an infinite sequence of theories that describe the universe more and more accurately.\\"  (3) There's no theory, period: \\"Events...occur in a random and arbitrary manner.\\"  He seems to like (1) believing \\"that there is a good chance...[for] a complete unified theory by the end of the century...\\"  Apparently--since he is speaking from circa 1996--he means the twentieth century.  In that case he's wrong since we haven't yet gotten such a theory.<br /><br />For the record, I like (2).  I think that our present \\"laws\\" are approximations that we will continue to improve on.  I believe we develop the ability through science to better and better order our environment and to increase our knowledge.  I don't believe we are actually discovering \\"ultimate truth.\\"<br /><br />Hawking asks here as he has elsewhere, \\"Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?\\"  Why is there anything at all?  He believes that if we do discover a complete theory, we will then be able to answer this question, and then we would \\"know the mind of God.\\"<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\"s elsewhere, \\"Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?\\"  Why is there anything at all?

Or a new shell game?<br />The title of this book is a little misleading since most of the book is about the effect that energy has had on the rise and fall of human societies from hunter-gatherers through agriculturists and the Roman Empire to the ascendency of the United States in the 19th century and into the current world economy.  Rifkin sees cheap energy and the high per capita use of it as a prime indicator of a flourishing society.  He notes that Rome rose when it was able to commandeer energy sources from conquered lands in the form of tribute and slaves; but when the booty from military conquests began to fall to diminishing returns, Rome itself began to fall.<br />He sees the same thing possibly happening to the United States in another but similar manner.  He notes that US domestic oil production peaked in 1970. (p. 4)  Whereas up until then, domestic production supplied most of the oil the United States used; since then we have become more and more dependent on foreign sources.  He foresees a peak in world crude production sometime in the next decade or so, and after that a slide toward more and more expensive oil and more and more of our wealth flowing into the last bastion of crude reserves in primarily the Middle Eastern states.<br />What to do about this?  Hocus-pocus, usher in the hydrogen economy in which hydrogen fuel cells will replace not only gas from the pump but will generate electricity for home, farm and office.  There is just one little catch: at current prices the cost of converting either gasoline, natural gas or water (all requiring energy, usually electrical power) is prohibitive. Rifkin de-emphasizes this little problem as he enthuses about how decentralized and how clean-burning will be the \\"decarbonized\\" hydrogen economy.  Right now, according to Michael A. Peavey in his book, Fuel from Water: Energy Independence with Hydrogen, it costs $7.40 to create enough hydrogen fuel to equal the energy provided by one gallon of gasoline (at electricity costing $0.10 per Kwh).  Rifkin does not go into this non-cost effectiveness to any great degree, partly because he believes both that the cost of conversion will go down and the price of oil will go up.<br />A quick read might give the impression that one can use electricity to produce hydrogen from say water and use the hydrogen to create electricity or run engines with a net gain.  Not so.  The efficiency of the process of electrolysis (getting hydrogen from water) is about 50%.  This is a big net loss.  So why are automobile manufactures, oil companies and Jeremy Rifkin so excited about hydrogen technology?<br />First and foremost of course hydrogen is clean burning.  It does not produce any greenhouse gases that are leading to global warming.  And second, when used in fuel cell technology there is the prospect that energy use and production will be decentralized allowing individuals and small organizations freedom from the vast infrastructure and top down organization that characterizes the oil industry today.<br />Both of these advantages of hydrogen however depend on the use of renewable resources, wind, sun, downward running water, evaporation, the burning of biomass, etc. to isolate the hydrogen which is always tied up in molecules with other elements as in water, natural gas, oil, etc.  So what the advantages accruing from the proposed brave new world of the hydrogen economy actually depend on is the same thing we cannot do today, that is, get the bulk of our energy from renewable resources.<br />As others have pointed out, essentially hydrogen is an energy storage device.  The initial energy must come from somewhere else.  Although we definitely need storage devices that can be placed where we want them to be utilized even when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, storage devices themselves are not an independent source of energy and cannot by themselves be the solution to our energy problems.<br />Having said this, the book is still a very good read and an eye-opener about the coming end of the fossil fuel era, arriving at our doorsteps in just a few decades.  Also Rifkin's speculations about the nature of the hydrogen economy are interesting and probably pertinent since the major car manufacturers and the major oil companies are already gearing up for the transformation.  These mega-players in the energy game will dictate the rules in the years to come.  They will use their existing infrastructures and their capital to ease the transformation for them and to maintain their power and profit margins.  This is one of the salient points Rifkin makes in this book.  The curious thing is, I'm not sure whether, amid all of his enthusiastic expression, he realizes what his message really is, namely that we are going to be burning fossil fuels and building nuclear plants well into the latter half of the 21st century.<br />Note well this quote on page 189 from John Browne, the CEO of British Petroleum, making the \\"bullish\\" forecast that \\"50 percent\\" of world-wide energy demand \\"will be met by solar and other renewable resources by 2050.\\"  That, folks, is the bottom line: fifty percent by 2050, fuel cells or no fuel cells.<br />The bottom line for this book is that it is readable, informative--even at times, fascinating--but not exactly what it purports to be.  Read it and judge for yourself.l a very good read and an eye-opener about the coming end of the fossil fuel era, arriving at our doorsteps in just a few decades.

That's a tidy number of poker books.  Of those books--I've still got about thirty of them around the house--none is more interesting than this fine piece of work by Paris Review contributing editor Andy Bellin.<br />It starts out rather mundanely with a not entirely promising poker story that he doesn't finish until the penultimate chapter.  There are some familiar quotes and some even more familiar poker stories (including the Wild Bill Hickok yarn about aces and eights), a table listing the ranking of poker hands (oh, boy) and another giving the odds and frequency of being dealt various hands in either draw poker or five card stud.  (How valuable is that when those games are seldom spread anymore?)<br />But then it gets interesting because what we discover is that Bellin really does know what he's talking about.  He's been there and done that. Not at the highest level (see, e.g., Doyle Brunson's According To Doyle or Bobby Baldwin's Winning Poker Secrets for life there) but at the semi-pro level and as a journalist.  He covers the poker experience from New York to Los Angeles through personal experience and from interviews with some of the personalities of the game including Benny Binion, Erik Seidel, Huck Seed and assorted rounders.  Some of his information is from research, the Harry S Truman story, for example.  He doesn't glorify the game or the players and he doesn't make himself a hero or a disinterested non-combatant either.  In fact, the real value of this book is in the portrait of Andy Bellin, bright, very well-off, one-time Vassar (!) boy, who embarrassed his family and himself by spending a good part of his youth worshiping Pocahontas.  In this part-memoir, part-participatory journalistic endeavor, Andy makes amends and demonstrates to all who care that actually he wasted nothing and has nothing to be embarrassed about.<br />First of all, this is a poker book about real poker and real poker people, not the great geniuses of the game and not the low lifes hanging about--although there are a few of those--but about the fanatics, the degenerates, the semi- and sometime- pros who play like addicts or devotees of a bizarre and unforgiving religion.  (\\"Pocahontas\\" is the player's goddess of poker.)  Second, Bellin reveals himself blemishes and all, admitting that he sometimes cheated and got caught, that he spent some time in jail, that he wasn't as good as he thought he was, and that, like most of us, he fooled himself a whole lot.  All this makes for a most interesting and disarming read.<br />The chapter on cheating in which we see that the cheater need only cheat once or twice a night to ensure being a consistent winner, is excellent.  The chapter entitled \\"Small-Time Pros\\" in which Bellin focuses on a man and women \\"combine\\" who worked the clubs in Los Angeles a few years ago (actually they played at the Hollywood Park Club, I can tell by some of the information Bellin gives; in fact I think I played against them!), we learn of the trashy glitter of sex, drugs and pocket rockets, or how to be wasted, and waste your life while you're at it.  I also liked his seemingly gratuitous \\"idiot jail story\\" in Appendix A.<br />By the time we get to the second-to-last chapter and get to see the other guy's hole cards we realize Bellin's point and why he slow-rolled the show down (but don't EVER do it again, Andy!).  What he wants to demonstrate is that the quintessential thrill of poker lies in that second or two or three between the time you've made the final bet and the time you get to see the other guy's cards.<br />Andy Bellin understands the psychology of playing poker and the lifestyle.  He knows what going on tilt is all about, and proves it by showing himself on tilt on page 132 as his jacks-full get cracked by quads.  And he understands what money means to the player.  It means being in action, first and foremost because being out of action is the player's death.  And he recognizes that even winning poker players usually end up broke.  And he knows why.e being out of action is the player's death.  And he recognizes that even winning poker players usually end up broke.  And he knows why.	2003-03-14

Dershowitz's argument is that we reward terrorism and that is why it works.  If we would stop rewarding terrorism, then it would be ineffective and those using it would have to find other means to achieve their ends.<br />Focusing mostly on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Dershowitz recalls how acts of terrorism, the hijacking of airplanes, for example, led to wider recognition of the Palestinian cause and gained sympathy for the Palestinian people, whereas nothing else they did worked at all.  When they began the suicide bombings Arafat became something close to a hero in many parts of the world.<br />The \\"we\\" Dershowitz is particularly addressing includes France, Germany, Italy, and the UN General Assembly.  He believes if they would join the United States and Israel in forming a united front against terrorism by always responding unfavorably to terrorist acts, terrorism would lose its currency and we'd all be better off.<br />This argument, like that of not rewarding children for their unsocial behavior, is substantially correct and would indeed lessen the amount of terrorism in the world.  I don't want to call Dershowitz's understanding trivial.  It is not.  It is important to appreciate that rewarding terrorism does indeed lead to more terrorism.  But knowing this is the easy part.  Getting the various peoples of the world to unite against terrorism is the hard part.<br />Dershowitz does not persuasively address this problem.  To use the sort of real world hypotheticals that the esteemed and very readable Harvard Law School professor is fond of, let me offer this scenario to illustrate the extent of the problem.  Let's say that a country has multi-billion dollar oil contracts with Iraq under the current situation.  They are called upon to fight terrorism in the form of Iraq's support of Palestinian suicide bombers (and its possible future terrorism using possible weapons of mass destruction).  They add up the pros and cons in terms of national self interest (as all nations routinely do, including the US) noting that somebody else's country is more likely to be hit, and what is their response?  They decide to take their chances with the current situation.<br />Or , to use an example from the book, suppose a country  has captured some terrorists who have hijacked an airplane. The government of this country is advised diplomatically that if the terrorists are let go that country's airplanes and its citizens will not be future targets.  But if the terrorists are put on trial and convicted, the terrorists will hijack and blow up airplanes coming from that country.<br />This is blackmail and should be resisted, but the leader of this country is facing re-election soon and decides that letting a couple of terrorists go free is better than getting possibly hundreds of his countrymen killed.<br />Dershowitz's reiteration of this intractable problem is perhaps valuable for those who are new to the debate, and it certainly bears repeating.  But this issue is not what is significant in this book.  Dershowitz's advocacy of issuing warrants to torture \\"ticking bomb suspects\\" and his support for a non-mandatory national ID card, and his arguments for those positions, is really what this book is all about.<br />Here is the \\"ticking bomb suspect\\" hypothetical: a terrorist has knowledge of a nuclear bomb hidden somewhere in a large American city.  It is ticking away, set to go off in a matter of hours.  The FBI has a suspect who knows where the bomb is.  He won't talk.  Should we torture him?<br />Dershowitz's position is that is we will, count on it.  On page 163 he gives us our choices in general: (1) no torture; (2) no officially approved torture, \\"but its selective use beneath the radar screen\\"; or (3) the issuance of a warrant by a magistrate \\"authorizing nonlethal torture.\\"  Because we will in some cases--the infamous ticking bomb suspect case being the most obvious--use torture regardless of legalities, Dershowitz's argument is that it is better to have the use of torture legalized and subject to the discretion of a representative of the legal establishment than to have it done in secret.<br />Others people believe that issuing warrants in effect condones torture and that it is better to have such horrendous necessities remain illegal exceptions that it is better not to talk about.<br />On the other issue, Dershowitz has persuaded himself that national ID cards are not the great threat to civil liberties that he once thought, and that they would be valuable tools in the fight against terrorism.

Note well the word &quot;health&quot; in the title.  One of the central ideas in evolutionary medicine is preserving health, and in general looking at medicine from the point of view of the healthy instead of from an overweening concentration on the sick.  An ounce of prevention in evolutionary medicine is worth a whole ton of cure.<br />Another important idea is to look, in so far as possible, to our adaptations as evolutionary beings to see what we might be doing wrong today.  For example, grasses with plump seeds of carbohydrates were in short supply before the advent of agriculture about 10,000 years ago.  There were wheats and ryes, wild oats and such, but their seeds were relatively small and required a lot of labor to harvest.  Consequently, our ancestors on the savannahs and in the woodlands ate grain carbohydrates in small amounts.  Now, of course, grains--especially rice, wheat and corn--are the staple foods everywhere in the world and we eat massive amounts of them.<br />Is this a problem?  As Professor Boaz points out, evolutionary medicine suggests that it is.  We are &quot;carbohydrate intolerant&quot; (Boaz uses the term &quot;glucotoxicity,&quot; page 133) and cannot shut down our appetite for all the carbohydrates so tantalizingly available to us.  They are especially enthralling when served up with salt and fats.<br />In the prehistory there were no supermarkets open 24-hours a day.  Instead there were freezing winters and droughts that might last for months or more, sure to visit almost every human eventually.  So when there was a bountifulness in the land we chowed down big time.  And those of us who had the ability to put on fat could live out the times of famine better than any prehistoric runway model.  And so our chubby guy- or chubby gal-genes were favored.  Boaz calls this the &quot;thrifty genotype.&quot;<br />However that virtue has become a fault.  What to do?  Boaz recommends exercise, for one thing.  In the pre-history our ancestors managed to walk all the way around the world.  They had no cars or easy chairs.  That we can solve our fat problem by looking at the way our ancestors lived and emulate them, is the somewhat bitter pill of this book.  And, by the way, this &quot;medicine&quot; (hard to take, as we all know) also works against heart attacks, gout and other modern diseases.<br />Boaz has gone to some considerable trouble to associate various &quot;diseases&quot; with 17 evolutionary levels of human structure and function.  (There's a table on pages 19-25.)  These levels are like the idea that &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot; in that some of the levels are similar to those stages in the embryo's development from single cell through bony fish and amphibian to mammal, all the way to us.  What Boaz is adding here is the idea that certain diseases are associated with each level of development.  For example, emphysema is associated with the amphibian level of adaptation while viral infections go all the way back to when our ancestors were just single cells.<br />This scheme is useful in helping us to understand disease.  It is even helpful in treatment.  But Boaz's formulation is no magic pill or cure-all.  For the chronic diseases that plague those of us in the developed world there is no easy cure.  Boaz recognizes a &quot;discordance&quot; between our evolutionary selves and the modern environment that is leading to these diseases.  He uses a concept he calls &quot;adaptive normality&quot; that can guide us away from the discordance.<br />This is a very readable book requiring no prior expertise.  It is obvious that Boaz wanted to reach the educated lay person with his ideas.  For those of you new to the idea of evolutionary medicine, this will be an exciting book.  Boaz does an excellent job of teaching us is how to think from an evolutionary perspective, which is something we all need to do.<br />Another interesting book on this subject is Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine (1994) by Randolph M. Nesse and George C. Williams which I also recommend.<br />Another interesting book on this subject is Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine (1994) by Randolph M. Nesse and George C.

This is no saga of the Golden Arches or Momma Mia's Pizzeria in ragtime.  We're talking Class A establishments here.<br />Galloway's remembrances of his days on the waitstaff at especially the \\"King Lear\\" restaurant in Washington D.C. are therefore all the more harrowing.  We encounter rampant alcoholism, the chug-a-lugging of fine vinos, the gulping of rare cognacs (stolen by staff who then go on some wild DUI driving) amid a kitchen culture that celebrates Fridays with the arrival of the snow man as the waiters sell to the busboys and everybody gets loaded as they whistle while they work.<br />Well, not everybody.  Galloway himself admits to drinking 7,500 bottles of wine during the years 1985-2000 or ten bottles a week (p. 86), which is nothing compared to his compadres, but he does not allow that he did any fine lines or fine herbs.  Which I believe.  Well, at least I believe that he was wise to keep recollections of that sort scattered among his cast of characters.<br />Which brings me to what I consider the weakness of this actually very interesting, funny and one-of-a-kind book.  Quite simply we learn all about the foibles of his fellow waiters (he gives us vivid portraits of eighteen of them, warts and all), the crazy chefs, the madcap maitre d's who live on palmed twenties and rental girls, the busboys and pourboys.  Yet, in all this the real John Galloway is absent.  He is an observer, a spinner of tales, a dispenser of pyrotechnic prose, a wordsmith with a gift for outrageous metaphors and the vernacular of restauranteurs.  He has a fine feel for the various subcultures of all manner of ethnic, sexual and racial groups, from stately queens of the diningroom to the machismo of the illegal aliens washing the dishes.  He has an edgy style that doesn't flinch at the urban degeneracy of our times.  Yet he seems to be standing back laughing at it all.  For example:<br />Describing a customer who doesn't behave according to fine dining etiquette as seen by the restaurant's staff: \\"your name is Dr. Samuel Mudd and you're destined for the food court.\\" (p. 23)<br />Waxing poetic about an alcoholic barman turned runner: \\"booted booze for running shoes.\\"  (p. 160)<br />I think this book would rate a whole lot higher sales-wise if it had a more descriptive title.  Something like \\"The Dark Side of Dining,\\" or \\"Inside America's Best Restaurants: The Shocking Truth!\\"<br />Unlike some others, I didn't mind Galloway's lectures on how to behave in restaurants or about the massive amounts of food wasted \\"in this SUV age of power gluttony\\" (p. 290) because I think he's right.<br />Bottom line: Funny and unsettling.

Kaplan reminds us at least half a dozen times in the book that he's \\"an idiot.\\"  That's quote unquote.  But if so, he's an idiot with a gimmick, the gimmick being misery loves company, and he's here to provide it in the form of \\"look who else was just as dumb as you\\" (or maybe even dumber)!<br />Well, no.  No dot com investor is going to be reading this book.  Pain is pain.  Readers of this book will be down-sized dot com ex-employees finding some gallows humor in all the billions of wisenheimer dollars that went down the dot com drain.  With the pages of this book and the stock certificates of the companies chortled over herein, one can paper a wall or...well, you can read the fine suggestions from readers below.<br />But the really disappointing thing about this \\"book\\" is that Kaplan didn't even try to be informative about the companies he chuckles over.  I mean most bits were something like two hundred words and out, and some of that was pure repetition and woefully inadequate explanation.  He just went with what he thought he knew, research be damned, threw in a few of his hormonal obsessions, stirred in some \\"shocking the bourgeoisie\\" language, some crude high school humor, and laughed all the way to the bank.  The only real \\"insight\\" into what happened provided by Kaplan is the \\"duh\\" observation (which he repeats again and again) that enterprises for profit really ought to charge their customers more for the product or service than they pay to provide it.<br />And folks, this is a Simon and Schuster book, beautifully presented, typo free, and reasonably well edited.  I mean, was there a war in the boardroom when they discussed publishing this?  Didn't they (royalty publishers are investors) get the idea that they were being taken to the cleaners same as the idiots who threw their money down the dot com drain?  But then again, maybe this book is making money and the laugh is on the buyer.  (Not me.  I borrowed it from the library.)  At any rate, the book design by Bonni Leon-Berman deserved a better text.<br />However, this is not to say we can't learn something here.

Wendy Kaminer is going to come down on the side of individual freedom against governmental power whatever the issue at hand.<br />In this collection of essays, mostly from her column in The American Prospect, Kaminer looks at issues ranging from anti-terrorist encroachments on civil liberties to anti-abortion protests, and invariably comes down on the side of individual liberty, even when she has to share close quarters with the likes of NAMBLA or \\"pro-fetal life\\" abortion clinic demonstrators.  Her justification is a fine restatement of the civil libertarian position: \\"If the First Amendment only protected sensible speech, we'd inhabit a very quiet nation indeed.\\" (p. 80)<br />Because she writes with passion and wit, and because now more than at any recent period in our nation's history, there is the danger of \\"An Imperial Presidency\\" (p. 13), we need her and others like her--whether we agree completely with them or not--as a counter to the anti-civil libertarian designs of Ashcroft, Rumsfeld and Bush.  Kaminer represents in these pages the loyal opposition that largely went into hiding after September 11th.<br />Her main concern is for the health of the Bill of Rights, which suffered from cardiac arrest as the Twin Towers fell.  Kaminer sees the resulting struggle between the Bush administration's desire to increase its power, and the individual's desire for privacy and due process, as a struggle between our collective need for security and our desire for freedom.  When people are in fear they will let go of some of their liberties in order to feel secure.  Consequently today is a time of particular danger because many Americans are understandably afraid.<br />Kaminer also addresses free speech on high school campuses, media censorship, abortion rights, victim's and defendant's rights, gay rights, Bush's faith-based program, and other cutting edge issues.  Her style is readable, thoughtful and penetrating.  She comes from a position of considerable authority as a social critic, a lawyer, and best-seller author (e.g., I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional).  She knows the facts and she knows the law, but more than anything she knows how to express what she feels in an engaging manner.  Consider how she makes this very delicate, but true, observation:  \\"I don't imagine that he welcomed it, but September 11 was not a bad day politically for George Bush.\\"<br />Or, note her observation that we don't need a first Amendment to protect popular, inoffensive speech.  We need it to protect speech that a \\"Lynn Cheney or Joe Lieberman\\" might consider demeaning and degrading. She adds,  \\"Censorship campaigns often begin with a drive to protect children (or women), but rarely end there.\\" (p. 40) My only nitpick is that Kaminer didn't devote some space to the farcical, hypocritical, and disastrous \\"war on drugs\\" that is also eroding our liberties.

Professor Bauer was first a scientist himself (in electrochemistry), then a college administrator, and most recently the Editor of the Journal of Scientific Exploration.  He is also the author of several books, including Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method.  He is also an avowed believer in the existence of the Loch Ness monster (he wrote a book on it) and a defender of quasi- or pseudo-scientific ventures from the debunking of people such as those at, e.g., the Skeptical Inquirer.<br />Bauer's main thesis here is that scientific knowledge is not absolute, and indeed that scientific knowledge at any given time in history has been wrong.  I believe he is correct in this assertion.  His extrapolation that scientific knowledge is not entirely accurate today is also something I would not want to argue against.  But his understanding of the purpose and goal of science, and his understanding of the method and function of science seems at times a bit Quixotic.<br /><br />One of the charges he makes is that the common perception of the scientific method itself is wrong.  He delineates this on page 35 as \\"hypothesize, test, accept-or-reject.\\"  I am astonished that he considers THIS the scientific method.  (After all, he wrote a book on the subject.)  He is leaving out the first two essential steps, namely that of \\"observation\\" and \\"questioning.\\"  First a scientist observes.  The scientist (or anybody) sees something happening, or sees something of interest, or hears something, or smells something.  It could be anything at all.  That observation then raises a question in the scientist's mind.  The scientist asks why?  How did this come about?  What caused this?  What IS this?<br />So we have two steps ignored by Bauer, after which we do have the hypothesis, that is, the idea or theory or guess as to what this is or why it happened, etc.  Then comes the testing of the hypothesis, and then the sharing of the results with others, and finally the testing by others for conformation.<br />That's the scientific method, and it is really just common sense codified.  The reason that it has proven so revolutionary, and has brought about the advanced technology we enjoy today (technology is a result of science) is that it differs fundamentally from the very poor methods that previously held sway in human history, mainly that of following authority and accepting authoritative knowledge without question.  By the way, the usual complaint made about the scientific method (and Bauer makes this complaint as well) is that it is not actually how scientists work.  Instead of working from observations to a hypothesis, sometimes they have the hypothesis first and then look for ways to support it.  True, but humans can be creative; or indeed, the observations might be purely mental, or even subconscious.<br />Another misunderstanding implicit in Bauer's book is the idea that scientists think science is working toward some sort of objective truth, or that there are absolute laws of nature that science is incrementally getting closer and closer to unraveling.  But what science really does is extend our ability to manipulate the environment to our advantage (or in some cases, to our disadvantage).  Science allows us to see further into the past, into the cosmos, into the very small.  The idea that science could actually discover the ultimate laws of the universe is really a popular misunderstanding not believed in by most scientists today.  In a sense it's a holdover from the \\"clockwork universe\\" concept derived from Newtonian mechanics that ended with relativity and quantum mechanics.<br />Belief in absolute knowledge or ultimate law is anathema to science, and is instead the stuff of religion.  I believe Bauer knows this, but for some reason didn't find it convenient to present that view in this book.  I wonder why.  I also wonder why he believes inthe Loch Ness monster.  He mentions Nessie several times in the text, but never gives a hint as to why he would believe in something seemingly so unlikely.  Perhaps he is saving that for a revision of his opus on the subject from 1986.<br />The really strange thing about this book is that sometimes Professor Bauer indicates that he does understand what science is about, as for example on page 68 he writes, \\"Scientific theories are very useful, but they are not true.\\"  This is exactly right.  More saliently, we can add, even if they were \\"true\\" how would we know it?  We only know what works, what is \\"useful.\\"  Science works and is very useful indeed.  In fact, one of the glaring failings of this book is to spend two hundred and thirty-some pages denigrating science without giving the slightest hint of anything better, or indeed of anything nearly as good.<br />So what he's done is set up a straw man (a misconception of what science is, its methods, and its presumption) and then shoot it down.  This is a familiar tactic usually employed by New Age pundits or postmodernist socialists.  It is rare in professors of chemistry.<br />Despite all this I think Bauer makes many valid points and serves a public good in drawing our attention to the limitations of science.  Clearly science in not in any sense a way of deriving concepts of good and bad or distinguishing right from wrong.  Sometimes it is good to be reminded of that.e Loch Ness monster.

1227637:US	49786731	R3MGT6Y81A7LFD	0323012132	822221189	Medical Microbiology, 4e	Books	5	23	30	N	N	How pathogens cause disease	The first thing to understand about this book is that it is a textbook and a difficult one.  The difficulty for the beginning student or general reader is not a fault of the authors. Rather it is because medical microbiology itself is a daunting subject full of organisms that can only be seen  fuzzily with an electron microscope, if at all, organisms involved in processes and behaviors that are foreign to our everyday experience.  Add the fact that most of the material covered here is not part of a non-specialist curriculum either in high school or college, and effectively speaking the untrained reader is starting from scratch.<br />Well, why do that?  First of all, because the material itself--how viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other infectious organisms enter the body, replicate, and cause disease--is fascinating and of immediate relevance to our lives.  Second because (to my knowledge) there is little or nothing else available to the general reader that goes beyond a sketchy introduction to the subject.  One is forced to read a text book.  Fortunately this is a good one and it is thorough.<br />The text covers the range of infectious disease from viruses to tapeworms.  The amount of technical information presented is daunting, and the sheer expanse of terminology a challenge (why is there no glossary?).  The text is lavishly illustrated with photos and electron micrographs of the pathogens, as well as numerous schematic drawings showing how microorganisms cause disease, how they replicate, their chemical structure, their morphology, etc.<br />The instructional schematic drawings I found less valuable than the electron micrographs, but I suspect for the student of microbiology it might be the other way around.<br />What you'll get out of this handsome book depends on how much time and energy you are able to devote to it.  I started reading this in the hope that I would, perhaps by osmosis, pick up some feel for life at the micron level, and I did.  Obviously if I had been able to study the text with the help of an instructor, I would have learned a lot more.I had been able to study the text with the help of an instructor, I would have learned a lot more.	2003-02-15

What is worse, some of the virus is thought to be in the hands of potential terrorists who, through the miracle of genetic engineering, are hard at work turboing up the strains they have into weapons-grade killers that can circumvent vaccination immunity.  (Which is the reason we can't pull the plug now: we may need the virus to help us develop new vaccines.)<br />According to Preston, Russia is said to have manufactured some 20 tons of the stuff to use in MIRV warheads.  (One ounce of pure virus contains more particles than anybody could count in a lifetime.)  Some of that is apparently missing.  Preston quotes Robert O. Spertzel, who was head of the United Nations biological weapons inspection team in Iraq from 1995-1998, as saying he has no doubt that \\"the Iraqis have seed stocks of smallpox.\\" (p. 96)  To judge from his recent vaccination, it's clear that George W. Bush agrees.  Al-Qaeda, whose intrepid flyboys checked out crop dusting planes before their mass murder/suicides, may have the stuff.  Certainly they have anthrax, the other main focus of this book, and they wouldn't hesitate to use it.<br />How did we get into this mess? is the question that Richard Preston tries to answer in this terrifying look at biological weaponry.  He relates the story of the heroic eradication of smallpox, an eradication unprecedented in medical history, focusing in on the people involved, telling their stories from interviews and news accounts.  He explains why the virus was not completed destroyed (mainly due to arguments that we needed it for research) and how some of it is believed to have slipped into the hands of persons unknown.<br />Preston also recounts what is publically known about the anthrax mailings that killed several people and terrified many others.  There is some focus on Steven Hatfill who has been intensely investigated by the FBI because of his background in anthrax research.  Preston interviewed Hatfill in 1999 prior to the anthrax mailings, reporting that Hatfill had \\"a great time doing research at\\" the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.  He quotes Hatfill as saying, \\"Where else can you work with monkeypox in the morning and Ebola in the afternoon?\\" (p. 206)  Preston also reports that \\"Some of Steven Hatfill's claims about himself didn't check out.\\"  He had not served in the U.S. Special Forces, and officials from Rhodes University in South Africa denied that the university had awarded him a PhD. (p. 207)  Most interesting is Preston's report on page 208 that \\"The [US] government suddenly removed all of...[Hatfill's] security clearances in August of 2001, two months before the anthrax letters were mailed.\\"<br />What is Preston suggesting?  I don't know, but I do know that considering that there were as few as eight suspects and realistically not more than twenty or thirty (see page 200) in the anthrax case, it is a monumental mystery as to why the FBI hasn't found the culprit.  One suspects, judging from the deafening silence on the matter from the White House, that something is known that our government doesn't think we ought to hear.  My guess is that the FBI knows who did it, but somehow muffed the evidence and now can't prove the case in a court of law and so has put a lid on it for now, hoping for further confirmation.<br />But to return to smallpox, which as a bioterrorist weapon is many times scarier than anthrax.  Consider this scenario: Al-Qaeda (or some other terrorist organization) genetically engineers an even more deadly smallpox.  They develop a vaccine for themselves and then (as in director Terry Gilliam's 1995 movie Twelve Monkeys) they spread the virus around the world, killing most of humanity.  Fantastic?  Unthinkable?  According to what Preston presents here and what I've read elsewhere, this scenario is entirely possible.<br />It may be said of us sometime in the future, that we were the generation that eradicated the smallpox virus-the worse scourge to afflict humans in our entire history-only to give it new life through biological engineering.  Consider this irony of ironies: after spending billions of dollars and countless man hours of hard work to rid the planet of the virus, we now spend thousands of dollars every year just to keep it alive so that it can someday destroy us.  Are we crazy or what?<br />Bottom line: a terse, chilling, sharply detailed, but somewhat abortive account of the major threat to human life in existence today, the sort of book no educated person would want to miss.g most of humanity.

1243969:US	49786731	R28YPJPX3VEW9R	0787957852	182808796	Driven: How Human Nature Shapes our Choices	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Adam Smith discovers evolutionary psychology	This is evolutionary psychology as seen by two professors from the Harvard Business School (!). While some readers may be familiar with a lot of what is presented here, it is agreeable to get a perspective from another academic discipline and a new sense of application.  It is especially pleasing because professors Lawrence and Nohria write well and have an appreciation of what an exciting time of biological discovery we are living in, a time when the convergence of knowledge and techniques from various disciplines is giving us the ability to look inside the black box of human nature previously closed.<br />The authors' use of the term \\"drives\\" to designate the source of behaviors is familiar, but the idea that these drives come from modules in the brain, or a network of modules, is what is relatively new.  Whether this is just another construct like Freud's ego, id, and superego is an open question.  However--and this is important and at the very essence of what is going on in brain science today--unlike Freud's construct, the one presented here is based on something tangible in the brain's structure.  As the authors report, recent advances in technology allow us to discern the brain's structure as it works.  These observations provide a scientific basis for constructs attempting to explain human behavior.  Whether there are four fundamental drives, as messrs. Lawrence and Nohria think, or some other number, or whether an entirely different construct is required, is also an open question.  Personally, I find their array persuasive, and I think the idea of \\"drives\\" a valuable one.  More important though is their understanding that we are motivated by more than rational self-interest, the so-called \\"invisible hand\\" from Adam Smith and the market place.<br />Here are the drives as defined on page 10:<br />D1 is to acquire objects and experiences that improve our status relative to others.<br />D2 is to bond with others in mutually beneficial, long-term relationships.<br />D3 is to learn about and make sense of ourselves and the world around us.<br />D4 is to defend ourselves, our loved ones, our beliefs, and our resources.<br />In should be noted that these four drives do not in any way contradict the general finding in biology that individuals tend to behave in such a way as to enhance their reproductive success.  What is new is that such \\"selfish\\" behaviors include behaviors usually seen as altruistic.  Yet I think the authors would enhance their understanding of the idea of \\"altruistic behavior\\" by reading Amotz and Avishag Zahavi's The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle (1997) in which the adaptive function of some altruistic behavior is to directly advertise fitness.<br />It should also be noted, as the authors do on page 63, that \\"What drives behavior is a contest among the emotions, not the rational calculation alone.\\"  In other words, rationality leads to the creation of an emotion which competes with the instinctive emotion.  This is an important concept.  It is not the rational mind overcoming the emotional mind, but the employment of emotion by the rational mind to overcome instinctive imperatives which sometimes lead us in the wrong direction.<br />Through the process of \\"social bonding\\" as presented on page 83, the authors embrace the idea of group selection, an idea disparaged by notions from Dawkins's \\"selfish gene\\" and elsewhere.  The idea that there could be the selection of genes that \\"orient behavior toward the good of the group\\" has long been discounted by the establishment in evolutionary biology.  (This view is changing.)  The seemingly very convincing argument has been that \\"any carrier with a genetic disposition to be nice to others would be, in time, wiped out by the selfish free-riders in the population.\\"  (Still on page 83.)  My feeling, however (similar to that of the authors), is that for human beings the \\"in time\\" part has never had a chance to kick in.  This is mainly because ofthe constant struggle of tribe against tribe throughout human and pre-human history.  The benefit to the tribe from individuals willing to risk life and limb for the good of the tribe is clear.  What has not been realized by many is that the benefits to the individual by enhancing the tribe's fitness more than offset the loss incurred from taking risks.  True, if the tribe faced no outward danger for a long period of time, the genes of the \\"selfish free-riders\\" would predominate in the population and the altruistic genes would die out.  But that hasn't happened.  Consequently groups (bands and tribes) that contained many \\"altruistic\\" individuals survived while groups with fewer altruistic individuals died out.  Therefore we have the \\"group selection of individuals\\" (which is a way I have seen this phenomenon phrased).<br />I should also like to note that religion, the cultural evolution of, is accounted for in a similar way.  Those tribes that had religious beliefs strong enough to facilitate bonding and altruistic behavior survived more often than tribes that did not.  This is something that E.O. Wilson pointed out some years ago in his book On Human Nature.<br />I think this is an excellent book for the general reader and a fine melding of the ideas of evolutionary biology into the culture of the work place and other loci in the modern world.  The authors do a good job of showing how the ideas of evolutionary psychology go far beyond the retelling of \\"just so\\" stories, ideas that can help us to understand ourselves and the world in which we live.the constant struggle of tribe against tribe throughout human and pre-human history.

1254948:US	49786731	R1YT41Q90ULVRQ	1587470292	283764999	Win Your Child Custody War: Child Custody Help Source Book	Books	5	46	47	N	N	A singular achievement and an amazing resource	Charlotte Hardwick's use of the military metaphor throughout (including a photo of a child in a Marine Corps dress uniform on the cover) is in recognition of two salient facts about custody disputes: they can be psychologically as brutal as war; and the stakes can be extremely high.  Yet, as Hardwick details and documents, negotiations are possible, and if the welfare of the child has the highest priority, both sides can win.<br />I would advise you, however, NOT to go into court without having first read this remarkable book.  Over the course of 672 doubled-columned pages, Hardwick shares her personal experience and her painfully accumulated knowledge on just about every conceivable aspect of the child custody wars while guiding the reader toward a powerful strategy.  If you don't have this book you are likely to be overmatched; indeed if your attorney doesn't have this book, he or she is likely to be overmatched.  In fact, I would say that the first thing you should do after reading the book yourself, is buy a copy for your attorney and somehow persuade him or her to open the pages and to start reading--anywhere in the book.  I promise you your attorney will learn facts, ideas, strategies new to him or her.  The expanse and depth of the material presented here quite frankly amazed me.  This extensive tome constitutes an entire course not only in child custody disputes but in human psychology, parenting, and the law itself.  Some items:<br />There are 91 pages citing, summarizing, quoting from, and referencing relevant cases and decisions (Chapter 23).<br />There is a detailed guide on how to negotiate and what conflict resolution is all about (Chapter 4); a chapter on how to handle discovery and depositions (Chapter 17); another on judges, what to expect from them and how you might get a good one or avoid a bad one; there's guidance on what to expect in court and how to present yourself and your case; how to select an attorney; what your case is likely to cost and how to discover the assets of your adversaries, including (this floored me) hidden assets such as &quot;Overpayments to the IRS&quot; (from a list on page 435).  You will learn about how much you can expect to pay or receive in child support, and again how to gauge assets, including hidden income such as &quot;excessive deductions on paychecks&quot; (p. 445)--a nice dodge which amounts to loaning Uncle Sam the money until tax time!<br />You will also:<br />--Discover how to handle psychologists and other &quot;evaluators&quot; and influence them to your advantage.  For example beware of the &quot;halo effect.&quot;  (Have your side evaluated by the psychologist first to secure that effect.) (p. 235)<br />--Understand what psychological tests can be given and what they can mean in the dispute.  Sometimes the judge makes the court-ordered decision of a professional binding, so that &quot;you have in fact a new judge.&quot; (Chapter 12)<br />--Appreciate the role of other experts, what they can and cannot do to further your case, and how to evaluate and get a reliable expert who will make an effective witness.<br />--Learn the value of keeping a detailed log of everything pertaining to your case and its possible use as documentation.  Hardwick presents this with some tips on how e-mail and computer files can come back to haunt you if you share the wrong information, even anonymously or through the assumption of an Internet moniker.<br />--Become knowledgeable about lie detectors and their use and misuse (pp. 137-138) and the reach of DNA testing.<br />--Know which problems or accusations are issues and which are non-issues in the eyes of the law.  For example, child endangerment is an issue; a &quot;blended&quot; family is not.  Physical abuse is an issue; false accusations may or may not be. (pp. 26-29)<br />--Be introduced to the infamous Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS) in which one parent tries to alienate the child from the other parent through lies and distortions. (p. 190)  PAS includes &quot;The Grand Lie&quot; in which one side falsely accuses the other of child sexual abuse, a charge that is hard to become completely free of, regardless of the truth of the accusation. (p. 282)<br />Hardwick even includes some humor with eleven ways on how to know &quot;You've Been in Court Too Long&quot; on page 97 (from Dean Hughson).  If this isn't enough there is a presentation of ingrained psychological strategies that you might use or encounter such as the famous &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; from game theory or the sneaky &quot;Tranquilizer&quot; who lulls you to inattention and then takes advantage. (p. 59)<br />There is a Glossary of Terms and a detailed Index as well as a lot information on resources throughout including Internet sites on page 103.  There's even a chapter on lies and how to correct them (should you be the liar!).<br />The mass of information and the sharp, sound guidance contained herein really amount to a post graduate course in child custody disputes.  Even so I was almost as much impressed with Hardwick's assertive, no-nonsense writing style and organization that managed to painlessly inform while emphasizing a positive approach.

You might find yourself surprised about how you feel.<br />Second warning: if you are offended by candid expressions concerning human, especially lesbian, sexuality, don't read the book.  You will be offended.<br />First, let me point to the clearly positive aspects of this project:<br />--The money raised through various V-Day activities (\\"born in 1998 as an outgrowth\\" of the play's success) that goes toward helping women who are the victims of violence, especially in places like Afghanistan and the Balkans where the patriarchy is particularly loathsome.  Everyone connected with this project is to be commended for whatever good they are able to accomplish there and elsewhere.<br />--The therapeutic value of the play and this book for those millions of women who have been repressed by the socialization process from realizing their sexuality.<br />--The value of breaking down a false taboo of reference and usage.<br />--The entertainment value afforded college kids and like-minded others who get a kick out of shocking the bourgeoisie.<br />The central part of this book (pp. 1-125) is the text of the play.  But there is also a 11-page Forward by Gloria Steinem and about sixty pages of back matter, most of which is a section  about V-Day by Karen Ober with empowered letters and stories from college students.<br />The monologues themselves play off of the conceit of a talking vagina that expresses its trials and tribulations, its being neglected and mistreated and misunderstood.  Ensler says she gathered her material through hundreds of interviews with women everywhere.  Her language is candid and the juxtapositions she comes up with are sometimes striking.  Some of the monologues are sad and poignant; some are pathetic.  Some are funny.  They are told from an avowed lesbian viewpoint.  Indeed, the monologue beginning on page 77 tells of the liberating effect a 24-year-old lesbian lover had on a 13-year-old girl.<br />The play works toward the empowerment of women, and as such is didactic rather than artistic.  Yet this is not another tiresome \\"hate men\\" propaganda tract.  There is even a monologue that recalls a father's love.<br />In the Introduction Gloria Steinem takes a few obligatory but rather reserved potshots at men while recalling the dark ages from her \\"down there\\" generation in which words referring to the vagina were not \\"prideful.\\"  She also recalls her two years in India where she learned about the power of the yoni which she reports as having been \\"worshiped as more powerful than its male counterpart\\"--the usual radical feminist retro spin on history.  (The yoni was equal in power to its male counterpart.)  She follows this with a misstatement of what she calls \\"the central tenet\\" in Tantrism: \\"man's inability to reach spiritual fulfillment except through sexual and emotional union with woman's superior spiritual energy.\\"  There are many tenets in the so-called \\"left-handed path\\" of tantra yoga, the purpose of which is to find liberation from samsara (earthy delusion), through indulgence, or a giving in to one's desires.  It is not imagined in tantra that women have \\"superior spiritual energy.\\"  They do have equal sexual energy that is exploited in tantra rituals.  By the way, Steinem twice mentions the heart symbol (or valentine) as representing not the heart but the vagina.  In this she is correct, but she misses mentioning the real connection from tantra, namely that of the triangle with one of its points aimed downward which is the ancient stylistic symbol of the yoni that evolved into the valentine shape.<br />Bottom line: As I was reading this I was strangely, unaccountably and irresistibly reminded of the well-known line from the film Apocalypse Now (1979) as delivered by Robert Duvall: \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\\"  Change one word (see e.g., pages 93-95) and you have the spirit of the monologues as conveyed by Eve Ensler.e monologues as conveyed by Eve Ensler.	2003-01-22

True, with my fabled ability to read between the lines, I can see in places where perhaps the good professor favors one side or the other.  Indeed, part of the fun of reading a book like this is discerning where the author's sympathies lie.  (You might want to discern for yourself.)  But for the most part Professor Arthur lets the chips fall where they may and keeps a balanced keel through the straits of the tempest-tossed tussles while knavishly enjoying himself like an after-the-fact provocateur.<br />Notable are Arthur's physical descriptions of the gladiators, usually quoting contemporary sources.  Thus the young Truman Capote, who is squared off against Gore Vidal, is \\"unnaturally pretty, with wide, arresting blue eyes and blond bangs\\" (p. 161) while Vidal is \\"Tall and slender, Byronically handsome...luminous and manly\\" (p. 159).  (Uh...nevermind.)  Sinclair Lewis, who fights with Theodore Dreiser (physically on one occasion--or at least Dreiser is reported to have slapped Lewis), has a \\"hawkish nose\\" and a \\"massive frontal skull...reddish but almost colorless eyebrows above round, cavernously set, remarkably brilliant eyes...\\" (p. 49)  Dreiser, self-described, has \\"a semi-Roman nose, a high forehead and an Austrian lip, with the edges of my teeth always showing....\\" (p. 56)  The effect of these descriptions along with Arthur's bright and lively (and very careful) style is to make the literary warriors especially vivid and to impress upon us just how human they are.<br />Arthur however is at his best in coming up with really juicy quotes to illustrate the matters of contention. Thus Lillian Hellman dismissed Mary McCarthy (Chapter 6) as merely \\"a lady magazine writer\\" (p. 141) while McCarthy charged in an interview with Dick Cavett that Hellman \\"is tremendously overrated, a bad writer, and a dishonest writer...\\" whose every written word \\"is a lie, including AND and THE\\" [my capitalization, p. 143], causing the fur to fly.  More civilized was the exchange between Edmund Wilson and Vladimir Nabokov where Wilson expresses his disappointment with Nabokov's novel, Bend Sinister: \\"You aren't good at...questions of politics and social change, because you are totally uninterested in these matters and have never taken the trouble to understand them.\\"  Nabokov replies: \\"In historical and political matters you are partisan of a certain interpretation which you regard as absolute.\\" (pp. 90-91)  (They're just sparring: it heats up later on.)<br />One of the most interesting bits in the book is from page 32 in which it is asserted that Ernest Hemingway learned part of his style from Gertrude Stein (feud number two) by copying her gerund-driven, run-on sentence constructions. What is especially amusing is that Arthur gives a sentence from Stein and then a similar one from Hemingway--\\"ing's\\" flying.  The effect was bad in Gertrude Stein, and, although improved in Hemingway, it was still bad.  Arthur's book is full of these delightfully sly bits of satire.<br />He also likes to slip in a few literary jokes.  For example, British Don F. R. Leavis, who is in combat with C.P. Snow over the famous \\"Two Cultures,\\" is characterized as saying of his \\"fellow Fellows\\": \\"They can all go to hell.  Of course, some should go before the others.  One has a responsibility to make discriminations.\\" (Quoted from Frederick Crews, p. 116)  Also: \\"J.B. Priestley...called Leavis a sort of Calvinist theologian...who makes one feel that he hates books and authors...not...from exceptional fastidiousness but...[as a] result of some strange neurosis, as if he had been frightened by a librarian in early childhood.\\" (p. 118)<br />All in all, a most entertaining and informative read from a fine prose stylist.informative read from a fine prose stylist.	2003-01-21
1263729:US	49786731	R1N31NKT72TFP6	1559639407	230027951	Fatal Harvest: The Tragedy Of Industrial Agriculture	Books	4	73	90	N	N	The agrarian position	The central message of this rather large book (put some legs on it and it could serve as a coffee table itself) is that industrial agriculture is unnatural, inhumane, dangerous; that big farms and big chemical multinationals are destroying the land and causing massive hardship for not only the ecology of the planet but for humans as well.<br />One of the arguments is that industrial agriculture actually leads to hunger and starvation for millions because it forces people off the land, land that is then used to produce foods or other products that are exported to the developed nations.  The poor farmer cannot compete with the industrial farms and so has to go out of business.  In the underdeveloped countries, land that once supported a variety of food plants that fed the local people has been turned into land that supports only a single crop destined for export, the profits going to middle men and the large land owners.<br />Clearly then, this is a polemic against industrial agriculture and in favor of a return to an agrarian life style. It is a tract against the use of pesticides and herbicides and in favor of organic farming.  It is against monoculture farming and in favor of biodiversity and crop rotation.  It is against genetic modified foods and Round Up ready seeds and in favor of the slightly blemished but flavorful produce from fields tended by hand and hoe.  It is beautifully illustrated with breath-taking photos of farms, farmers, farm equipment and especially fields of verdant crops.<br />I am in substantial sympathy with the message of this book, but I do not appreciate facile or phony arguments in support of even the most agreeable message.  I think unsubstantiated claims and superficial understandings do not help a worthy cause.  Unfortunately there are a few of those in these pages.<br />On page 62, for example, the text suggests that \\"if biotech corporations really wanted to feed the hungry, they would...push for wealth redistribution, which would allow the poor to buy food.\\"  Obviously corporations don't work that way, and agrarian reform is not going to be helped by reviving delusive Marxist economics.  On page 71 it is written, \\"...75 types of vegetables, or approximately 97 percent of the varieties available in 1900, [in the US] are now extinct.\\"  I am not sure what was left out here or misstated, but obviously more than about 2.34 vegetables (the 3% still extant) are still available.  Worse yet is this from page 102: \\"In 1996...the fungal disease known as Karnal Bunt swept through the U.S. wheat belt, ruining over half of that year's crop and forcing the quarantine of more than 290,000 acres.\\"  However on page 100 it is reported that wheat fields take up \\"a total of 60-70 million acres\\" of land in the continental US.  So how can a infestation that resulted in a quarantine of 290,000 acres (less than one-half of one percent of the total acreage devoted to wheat) ruin \\"over half of that year's crop\\"?  Such slips tend to cast doubt on the credibility of the other figures in the book.<br />However, the central shortcoming of this otherwise laudable effort is the disinclination of the editor and the contributors to point to overpopulation as the root cause of hunger and starvation.  Such a studied avoidance is disingenuous to say the least.  The periodic starvations due to droughts that plague such places as Africa are due to too many people living on land that cannot reliably support them.  In times of feast, the populations shoot up only to crash when the weather changes, as it must, as it has for millions of years.  Furthermore to suggest (as the text on pages 50 and 51 does) that agriculture can keep pace with human population growth is mistaken.  Fortunately, the essay, \\"The Impossible Race: Population Growth and the Fallacies of Agricultural Hope,\\" by Hugh H. Iltis, which begins on page 35, presents a more realistic view.<br />Nonetheless, I applaud this effort by director Douglas Tompkins and those who contributed to the project.

1273354:US	49786731	R399HQA33U6DWR	0804802289	227851451	Haiku in English	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Excellent primer on the essentials: clear, concise	Henderson begins with a description of Japanese haiku, its form and the &quot;rules&quot; pertaining to its composition.  There is the visual appearance of the poem in three lines with the first line having five syllables, the second seven, and the third five.  The poem must contain some reference to nature.  The poem is specific in the sense that it refers to a particular event, and the event is happening now, not in the past. (p. 14)  Additionally, it is often the practice to reference or allude to a time of year by season.  Thus &quot;the blossomed-covered hill&quot; would indicate spring, falling leaves fall, snow winter, and long days of sunlight summer.<br />Americans who appreciate and write haiku are aware of the first requirement about the form of the poem, and they are fairly clear that haiku that does not refer to nature is not really haiku.  But the other rules are more often observed in the breach if at all.  Thus American haiku can be and sometimes is about most anything (causing great horror to purists!).  For example, recall Richard Brautigan's &quot;Haiku Ambulance&quot;:<br />A piece of green pepper fell<br />off the wooden salad bowl:<br />so what?<br />which makes fun of haiku that fail.  Note that strictly speaking it is not haiku.  It is a clever short satirical poem.<br />Henderson observes that even in purest Japanese haiku &quot;one haiku in 25 does not have a strict 5-7-5 form.&quot;  Of course in translation it is far better to convey the poetic qualities and meaning of the haiku than to attempt a slavish adherence to the syllabic rule.  Thus this translation of haiku by Basho:<br />On a withered branch<br />a crow has settled...<br />autumn nightfall<br />sacrifices the syllabic rule while maintaining the three lines, which is usually the way translation is done, and usually the way American haiku is written.  One of the reasons for this is that syllabication in Japanese is different from syllabication in English and that furthermore there are in Japanese kireji (&quot;cutting words&quot;) that are &quot;primarily verbal punctuation marks&quot; that are difficult to translate directly. (p. 33)<br />I could go on, and it would be fun to do that, delving into nuance and technique, the appearance of emotion in haiku, etc., but it is enough to suggest the depth of Henderson's intense little book.  He details the evolved differences between the form in the two languages and then gives tips on writing and teaching haiku.  If you are going to teach haiku at any level, primary to college, you certainly will find this book valuable.  If your intent is just to learn and appreciate, Henderson's effort will afford you a better appreciation.  If you are a poet yourself, the book is fun because it shows you how others have practiced the form and goes into the experience with a number of examples.  The subtleties of expression are as arcane, quaint and beautiful as one would expect from such a venerable fine art form, and it is useful to acquaint oneself with them, even while transgressing a few here and there!<br />Bottom line: pithy, elegant, and practical.  This is one of my favorite books on haiku and one that I found valuable when I taught haiku in my high school English and creative writing classes.Japanese kireji (&quot;cutting words&quot;) that are &quot;primarily verbal punctuation marks&quot; that are difficult to translate directly.

Take it on the plane, underline it.  Read it for pleasure.  Get it out at night and study.<br />Susan Harrow knows the PR business backwards and forwards, and reading this book can help you to know it too.  She knows the pitfalls to media success, and she knows scores of secrets to success.  Let me just say that if you are about to embark (or have been embarking) on a public career of any kind, you will find this book invaluable.  I haven't used the word \\"invaluable\\" in over five hundred reviews.  It applies here, believe me.  This is why HarperCollins published this book (they undoubtedly had dozens of similar manuscripts that they could have published), and this is why HarperCollins and Susan Harrow are working hard to promote this work.  It's the best of its kind that I have seen.  I only wish I had this book when I was one and twenty or even one and forty.  And now that I am more like one and ... there's still a chance I might put this to good use!<br />Harrow uses anecdotes and remembrances from her own experience to get across her points.  One that I especially liked comes under her heading, \\"Trust in your own authority\\" on page 176.  She recalls being in that infamous psychology experiment in which you are to give an electrical shock to someone in another room for some error.  The point was to see if you, sadistic innocent that you are, would actually do it!  Harrow reports that she opted out rather than administer the shock.  I believe her because it is obvious that she thinks for herself and doesn't blindly follow authority.<br />As in books for learning something from the ground up (a computer language for example) Harrow uses many sidebars with distinctive icons.  She has Warnings! and Invitations (the latter in a script font), HOT TIPS! in a military stencil font, and a rather daring pursed lips icon for \\"Harrow's Kiss of Approval.\\"  Curiously, this icon which might seem too familiar actually works well.  Very creative.<br />Here are some items to give you a feel for the book:<br />Harrow is not content with presenting celebrity secrets of publicity (in Chapter 15).  She follows that up with Chapter 16: \\"...Publicity Secrets of Spiritual Masters.\\"  An old friend of mine who sold things for a living once told me that the secret to selling success is to realize that you are selling love.  That's what people really want: love.  And he meant it sincerely.  Harrow makes a similar point when she advises: \\"See the face of God in everyone.\\"  Goose bumps will appear on your own skin if you can do that, AND people will flock to you.  Harrow calls this way of looking at people as \\"choosing to see their true nature.\\" (p. 175)<br />She warns of the \\"three times you should refuse to be on Oprah or any other talk show.\\" (p. 223)  I'll give you number three: \\"They want you to air your dirty laundry.\\"  (It happens a lot.  Even Barbara Walters is not above such an approach.)<br />In the chapter on becoming \\"mediagenic\\" Harrow gives a quick course in public speaking and she begins with what not to drink (coffee and tea can dehydrate and dry out your mouth) and adds this \\"Do\\" (which I know from yoga) \\"Do use salt water to cleanse and clear your nasal passages.\\" This will \\"aid breathing and speaking.\\"  Alternate breathing exercises (a kind of pranayama) will do the same, I hasten to add, should salt be unhandy.<br />When sending out press releases or articles, include your title! (p. 96)  Don't leave it up to the editor to do it.  He might not do it so well, and--I can tell you from personal experience--he will appreciate the title and will probably use it since it saves him time.<br />This is also a beautifully edited and presented book.  It's easy to see that a lot of work went into its production.  The text is clear and thorough, lively and instructive.There are Internet and other resources near the back of the book, and there's an Index.<br />It has been said that women are more practical than men, a kind of stable wisdom from my formative years that I got somewhere.  I've usually found this to be true.

In particular he is not happy about the fact that Big Pharma doesn't find it cost effective to work on drugs that might save lives in Third World countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa, home of not only Ebola and AIDS, but perennial killers, malaria and sleeping sickness.  He also doesn't care for the bad press that DDT has endured since \\"Saint Rachel\\" (p. 57) published her manifesto, averring that \\"Nothing has ever equaled DDT\\" for controlling \\"the spineless blood-suckers\\" (mosquito, fly, and tick vectors) that bring dengue, plague, typhus, malaria, sleeping sickness, etc. to our bodies, and that \\"no essential public measure [the use of DDT] has been so irrationally denied.\\"<br />He makes a good case.  It seems that in saving the ospreys and the eagles and other creatures of the wild we have allowed disease vectors to flourish resulting in countless millions of human lives lost.  This surprising point of view, however, made me realize once again the false dilemma that we often put ourselves into, that of \\"them or us.\\"  At some point our rapacious desire to increase our numbers at the expense of our planet home must cease otherwise we will find ourselves alone with our mice and rats, our cows and pigs, our cockroaches and our sheep, our fields of soy and wheat and selected parasites, the rest of nature gone the way of the dodo.  Do we need more humans or do we need to save the rainforests?  My answer is that we must reduce our numbers and live in concert with nature.  Desowitz does not consider this larger point of view in his book.  I wish he had.<br />He does however realize that we need more doctors and that medical schools ought to let more people in.  He notes that \\"Innovative teaching methods can now accommodate double the student intake,\\" wryly adding that \\"This may force some of the doctors in the new, bigger pool to switch from BMWs to Buicks.\\" (p. 56)  He also wants the World Health Organization reformed, calling it \\"a too-politicized body, best at furnishing slogans.\\" (p. 124)  Additionally, he would like to see the big pharmaceutical companies rearrange their priorities.  He laments how a drug called DFMO is being manufactured for use as a depilatory to rid women of \\"uglifying facial hair\\" (with glossy ads in Cosmopolitan, Gourmet and Bon Appetit magazines) when it could better be used to fight sleeping sickness in Uganda and Sudan. (p. 146)  One of his pet peeves is the way our patent laws work in respect to genetic material--part of a \\"patent or perish\\" syndrome.  (See page 203.)  He quotes then US secretary of commerce Ronald Brown to the effect that genetic material can be taken from you and patented for the enrichment of someone else and there is nothing you can do about it. (p. 200)  Some people call this \\"biopiracy.\\" (p. 193)<br />In the later chapters (which are among the most readable in the book) Desowitz considers the possibility that global warming will result in tropical diseases moving north.  There's not only that possibility, but with the rise in the sea level and the flooding of rivers, temperate-zone sewers may back up just as they do in, e.g., Bangladesh, and we will have cholera right here in River City.<br />Desowitz, who is retired and therefore free to say what he thinks without fear of losing some grant or offending those who could torpedo a career, lets the chips fall where they may.  Near the end of the book he recalls a Nigerian who supplemented his income by selling human waste.  It seems that the Nigerian \\"pagan farmers...believed that the white man's protein-rich diet made his feces a superior fertilizer\\"(!)  He ends the book with a not so facetious suggestion that maybe we ought \\"to exploit this bounteous natural gift\\" to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. (pp. 241-242)<br />This sort ofcandid, tell-it-like-it-is expression is the strength of this mostly readable book.  Its weakness is that sometimes Desowitz loses awareness of his readership and gets too technical and too minuscule in his delineation of disease politics.  He has a few axes to grind and sometimes stays too long at the wheel.  Furthermore it is apparent that sometimes he is addressing other professionals and working out old disputes in a way that the general reader cannot fully appreciate.<br />Bottom line: Desowitz is authoritative and unbeholden to political correctness; he is passionate and writes with verve and a sometimes striking expression, and he is clearly an expert on the material covered.candid, tell-it-like-it-is expression is the strength of this mostly readable book.

There's a lot of material here that you won't find in, say, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.  And some of it is surprising, some of it is delightful, a lot is funny, and some of it useful for cribbing.  (Take the structure of an insult aimed at x, rearrange a word or two, and aim it at y.)  For example, Mark Twain is quoted on the cover as saying, \\"Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress, but I repeat myself.\\"  (Incidentally this gem is not in Bartlett's, at least not in the sixteenth edition, which I have.)  Teachers, for example, can then say, \\"Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were an administrator, but I repeat myself.\\"  For those of you in the business world, just plug in \\"CEO,\\" etc.<br />Also not found in Bartlett's (alas there's a lot unavoidably not found in Bartlett's, but that's another review), is this on critics from Marilyn Monroe: \\"I've always felt those articles somehow reveal more about the writers than they do about me.\\"  Dumb blonde?--troubled, but not dumb.<br />Compiler Colin Jarman organizes the verbal swordplay into chapters by category, beginning with \\"Critics and Criticism\\" in chapter one, followed by \\"The Creative Arts\\"...through literature, drama, film, music...religion, etc., ending with \\"Insults, Retorts, and Self-Criticism\\" in which the quoted get to insult themselves, e.g., \\"I'm as pure as the driven slush\\" -Tallulah Bankhead.  There's an Index by name referencing both the speaker and the target.<br />The quality of the insults and ironic misspeakings is very high.  I read this through in one setting some years ago, compulsively, and had many a chuckle and some outright belly laughs, and then I read it again a couple of years later and laughed anew.  Looking through it once again, I have to say, there was a lot I underappreciated.<br />Bottom line: worth both the candle and the plastic.	2003-01-06

At any rate they should since we have created their habitats in, around and under our cities, towns and farms, and we feed them well.  Occasionally we try to poison them but it never works for long.  Usually, as Barnett, who is Emeritus Professor of Zoology at the Australian National University, explains they reject our poisons outright as something new in a familiar environment (\\"neophobia\\")--one of their clever tricks--and when we counter with one of OUR tricks (pre-baiting) we kill them all right, but they counter by upping their breeding schedule and soon the losses are made up.<br />I think Barnett does a good job of making this an interesting read although the latter parts of the book are perhaps more scientific than some would like.  He begins with the rat in history and literature, recalls the black plague and other rat-carried diseases, and then tells the story of how the rat became domesticated in the nineteenth century primarily as a laboratory animal to run mazes and push levers for rewards and punishments.  He explains how this white albino rat has come to differ in its habits and traits from its wild counterpart, the so-called Norway rat, noting, for example, that lab rats are usually not neophobic.  Instead they approach just about anything new.  There is some interesting material on the black rat which tends to live in trees or on or near the top of dwellings while the Norway likes the ground and sewers.  The material on the mole rat of India and the rice rat of Malaysia and some other species could have been expanded.<br />Barnett goes into some of the research done on rats, both in the lab and in the field, and demonstrates just how hard it is to conduct useful and rigorous experiments and how easy it is to misread the findings.  He looks into the mystery of rats seemingly dying because of stress and suggests that what kills them is a lowered immune system response to disease agents. (p. 170)  There might be an unstated suggestion that stress can do the same thing to humans, perhaps to a lesser degree.<br />I think that Barnett's excursion into the philosophy of science and the limitations of applying animal research to humans (with quotes from philosopher K. R. Popper and geneticist R.C. Lewontin) toward the end of the book might have worked better in some other volume.  At any rate I would have preferred instead more material on Barnett's personal experiences with rats.  The material he does give us from his early days in London during World War II and from his lifelong research and experience is interesting and could have been expanded, especially in a book like this aimed at a general readership.<br />There are a number of black and white photos and drawings of rats, a Glossary, a list of References, and an Index.  Bottom line: interesting and not nearly as repellant as a work on rats could easily be.o the same thing to humans, perhaps to a lesser degree.<br />I think that Barnett's excursion into the philosophy of science and the limitations of applying animal research to humans (with quotes from philosopher K.

The main disaster that I didn't know about until I read this intriguing little book is the volcanic \\"super-eruption.\\"  Take your standard volcanic blast and multiply it by something like a thousand and one begins to get the picture.  Not only that, but a super-eruption isn't necessarily going to happen around the old fault lines or Vulcan sites.  No, a super-eruption with enough power to usher in a \\"volcanic winter\\" can happen suddenly without warning virtually anywhere.<br /><br />The really scary thing about super-eruptions is that not only can't they be predicted, they can't be prevented.  In this sense they are worse than an earth-crossing asteroid or unleashed Oort Cloud comets.  We might be able to see a meteor coming our way and with current technology nudge it off its course or blast it into smaller pieces, but there is absolutely nothing we can do about a super-eruption.  Even if the super-eruption takes place halfway around the world, its effects, possibly leading to a civilization-ending volcanic winter, will be felt everywhere.  With the social disruption, the disease, and the cold and starvation, the living (to recall a phrase from the Cold War) may very well envy the dead.<br /><br />McGuire, who is Benfield Greig Professor of Geophysical Hazards at University College London, recalls for our delectation, \\"perhaps the greatest volcanic explosion ever\\" that took place at Toba in northern Sumatra 73,500 years ago.  It qualified as a Volcanic Explosivity Index 8 (VEI 8) event, which means it was about one thousand times as powerful as the VEI 5 1980 blast at Mount St. Helens.  It tore a hole in the ground one hundred kilometers across and sent an estimated 3,000 cubic kilometers (that's kilometers)of debris into the atmosphere, enough \\"to cover virtually the whole of India with a layer of ash one metre thick.\\"  (pp. 98-103)  A volcanic winter of perhaps six years followed with \\"up to 5,000 million tonnes of sulphuric acid aerosols\\" in the air, enough to \\"cut the amount of sunlight reaching the surface by 90 per cent.\\" (p. 104)  An ice age followed, perhaps triggered by the mammoth eruption.  McGuire goes on to speculate that so many humans died world wide that humanity went through a \\"population bottleneck\\" that almost sent us the way of the dinosaurs.  (pp. 105-107)<br /><br />McGuire, who sometimes refers to himself as \\"Disasterman\\" (p. 131), also looks at \\"The Threat from Space\\" (Chapter 5).  He separates the asteroids from the comets and guesses that our chance of being killed during an asteroid or comet walloping is \\"750 times more likely than winning the UK lottery.\\"  To me, the really scary \\"from outer space\\" scenario is a hoard of comets being dislodged from their normal orbits to fly toward mother earth, so many that we would have no ability to ward them off.<br /><br />Global warming and the coming ice age are also topics explored by the good professor.  Earthquakes and tsunamis have their chapter and there is an Epilogue (in which he notes, e.g., that come the year 2100 \\"an extraordinary 50 per cent or so of the people in Japan and western Europe will be 60\\" years old or older).  There are a couple of appendices showing \\"threat\\" and geological timescales, and a modest index.  The chapter on global warming, I must say, left me somewhat confused.  Clearly McGuire believes human activity is a factor in making the nineties the hottest decade ever recorded, but whether our pollution will melt the ice caps or help to usher in an ice age is not clear.<br /><br />Some other items of interest in this very readable book:<br /><br />There was a geological episode in the earth's history referred to as \\"the Cryogenian\\" in which the earth was covered by \\"a carapace of ice a kilometre thick.\\"  McGuire calls this \\"Snowball Earth\\" and when it finally melted 565 million years ago, the Cambrian explosion of life followed. (p. 69-71)<br /><br />An earthquake in theTokyo-Yokohama region similar in intensity (8.3 on the Richter Scale) to that which struck in 1923--a reprise, McGuire says, is \\"thought to be only decades away\\"--would cripple the Japanese economy and have disastrous world wide effects. (pp. 123-131)<br /><br />The so-called \\"Contraction & Convergence\\" plan \\"to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\\" that would require monitoring and billing polluters for their emissions on a per capita basis: to me, this requirement would reveal the true cost of various enterprises and would help us to move toward renewable production and ecologically sound business practices.<br /><br />Not to be picky, but on page 18 McGuire reports that Hurricane Andrew of 1992 \\"brought to bear on the city\\" of Miami \\"wind speeds of up to 300 kilometres per second.\\"  That's about 670,000 miles per hour!  (I suspect he meant wind speeds of 300 kilometres per HOUR.)<br /><br />Bottom line: fascinating, a little flippant at times, but a full-out good read by a man who knows what he is talking about.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"Tokyo-Yokohama region similar in intensity (8.3 on the Richter Scale) to that which struck in 1923--a reprise, McGuire says, is \\"thought to be only decades away\\"--would cripple the Japanese economy and have disastrous world wide effects.

Part memoir, part fieldwork journal, and part travelogue, A Desert Calling is that rare scientific tome that engages our adventurous spirit through a vivid and lively presentation while at the same time giving us a concrete sense of the animals and their habitats.  As the late Stephen Jay Gould expresses it in the Foreword, Mares writes with \\"a verbal freshness (and a fine sense for a good yarn) that will delight even the most sophisticated urbanite....\\" (p. xi)<br />The book is also beautifully edited and presented with handsome page layouts.  Chapter beginnings and major paragraph breaks feature photo icons of the small desert rodents that were the focus of much of Mares's work.  The text is interspersed with black and white photos of animals and the forbidding desert climes that he and his fellow field biologists encountered on three continents.  There are four maps to help us locate these places.  Mares includes an appendix giving both the common and scientific names of species mentioned in the text organized geographically.  There are 14 pages of suggestions for further reading ordered by chapter.<br />Mares's travels include the Sonoran and Mojave deserts in the American southwest, the Monte Desert and the Patagonia and Caatinga regions in South America, and the Dasht-i-Kavir in Iran and the Sahara in Egypt.  He traveled to Argentina during the years of the Dirty War and was in Iran just before the fall of the Shah and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini.  He lived through blinding sandstorms and heat so oppressive that he sought relief in pig water and mud laced with pig feces.  He endured stings from hoards of vicious insects in landscapes nearly as barren as the moon with shaded Fahrenheit temperatures in the 130's.  (p. 181)  He encountered bureaucratic obstruction that would try the patience of a saint, poverty that would move even Scrooge to tears, and enough danger to satisfy a jaded CIA agent.<br />But above all he reports on the animals and how they live.  He includes the discovery of a number of new species and genera of mammals, and three major ecological findings, all having to do with convergent evolution.  Seeking the animal in the Monte Desert of Argentina that is the analogue of the kangaroo rat of the North American Sonoran Desert he inexplicably finds none.  But then by happenstance he becomes aware of an extinct marsupial skeleton collected by famed biologist George Gaylord Simpson that fits the expected convergence to a tee.  Indeed the animal had gone extinct only a million years previous which explained why none of the other rodents had yet evolved to fill that niche. (p. 126)<br />Mares also demonstrates that the jerboa of the Sahara, which is taxonomically nearly identical to the kangaroo rat, a fact well know for many decades, is not the whole story.  It turns out that their diets and therefore some parts of their anatomy, including their teeth of course and presumably their digestive systems, are more different than was previously supposed.  Mares realized this because he discovered that while kangaroo rats are seed specialists, the convergent jerboas have a more varied diet including plants and even crickets.  After some further research, Mares understood that the bipedal adaption of the jerboas and kangaroo rats isan adaptation to allow them to run (hop!) away from predators.<br />To my mind the most interesting discovery was that the rock hyraxes of Africa have a nearly exact counterpart in the rock cavies of Caatinga in Argentina.  As Mares expresses it (p. 202), they \\"are about as distantly related as mammals can be, [but they] not only look alike, but are similar in almost all aspects of their reproduction, ecology, and behavior.\\"  In a splendid example of natural selection at work, Mares points to their unique but similar rock pile environments as strongly shaping their morphology and behavior.<br />Perhaps what Mares does best that other scientists that work in distant places do not always do so well is to shed light on not only the climate and the species but on the local people, what they are like and how they live.  His description of the isolation of some of the people in the Monte and the Chaco (\\"El Impenetrable\\" in Spanish, which Mares calls a \\"land of thorns\\") in Argentina is almost like reading about lost tribes from ancient times.  His encounters with locals sometimes reminded me of something from a wild west movie of my childhood.<br />Also very interesting was his account of the discovery of a new species, the golden vizcacha rat on pages 257-259.  I also liked his touching recollection of coming home for Halloween just in time to join his two boys for trick or treating on page 275.<br />Bottom line: this engaging and colorful book allows us to experience the hard work, pure drudgery, quiet contentment, and the sometimes thrilling exhalation of field work through the eyes of a working scientist with a gift for exposition.an adaptation to allow them to run (hop!) away from predators.<br />To my mind the most interesting discovery was that the rock hyraxes of Africa have a nearly exact counterpart in the rock cavies of Caatinga in Argentina.

1305132:US	49786731	R20WSE0JKVT7K5	0679450785	351215412	The Future of Life	Books	4	12	17	N	Y	A prescription offering hope	Famed biologist and godfather of sociobiology (and its current prodigy, evolutionary psychology), esteemed Harvard professor and one of the great scientists of our time, Edward O. Wilson outlines in this engaging but somewhat reserved book what is happening to the planet's biodiversity and what can be done about it.<br />The Prologue is a \\"letter\\" to Henry David Thoreau as Wilson seeks to establish a conservationist continuity between the author of Walden and ourselves.  The open letter is somewhat self-conscious and artificial, but certainly appropriate for a work that celebrates nature and hopes to be a modest instrument in helping to preserve the natural world.<br />The first chapter is a survey of the life forms that live in \\"the biospheric membrane that covers Earth\\" (p. 21) with an emphasis on extreme climes including Antarctica's Lake Vostok (under two miles of ice) and the Mariana Trench (deepest part of the ocean at 35,750 feet below sea level).  Chapter Two makes the assertion that the planet is currently going through a dangerous \\"bottleneck\\" characterized by disappearing habitats and extinction of species the likes of which have not been seen since the dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago.  The culprit is of course us, represented by our short-sighted exploitation of non-renewable resources.  Here Wilson begins his theme, to find a \\"universal environmental ethic\\" that will lead us \\"through the bottleneck into which our species has foolishly blundered.\\" (p. 41)<br />In the next chapter, \\"Nature's Last Stand,\\" Wilson delineates just how bad things really are as he surveys the rampant deforestation and other ecological obscenities currently taking place in the world.  (Incidentally, those of you interested in a readable and painstakingly detailed account of what we are doing to mother earth, full of facts and figures, see Stuart L. Pimm's The World According to Pimm: A Scientist Audits the Earth, 2001.)  Wilson continues with an estimate of how much the biomass is worth in dollars and cents ($33-trillion per year, which I think is similar to Pimm's figure).  He makes the important point (which cannot in my opinion be repeated often enough) that the \\"cost\\" of doing business ought to include the damage or loss of \\"the free services of the natural economy\\" currently not figured into bottom line accounting.  Thus the cost of extracting coal from the ground ought to include the value of the land torn up; the cost of wood from a tree ought to include the cost of watershed lost, etc.  If the real costs of using the land, the rivers and the oceans, and the air were factored in--which some day they will be, whether we like it or not--some commodities would be seen as too expensive to harvest willy-nilly, and we might very well choose more environmentally agreeable alternatives.<br />In the final chapter Wilson gives \\"The Solution\\" which relies heavily upon the work of non-governmental environmental organizations that are attempting to use economic power to save the rain forests and other endangered \\"hotspots\\" throughout the world.  Their technique includes outbidding the loggers for the rights to the forests, raising the standard of living of those who live in these endangered areas, and getting governments to see the value of their unspoiled lands.<br />Obviously Wilson is preaching to the choir here since myself and most others who will read this book will already be true believers in saving biodiversity.  Perhaps the value of the book is in further educating us in the ways this might be done.  Wilson is hopeful that we will wake up before it is too late.  Indeed every minute counts because once the environment is gone it is gone forever to be replaced by God knows what.  Wilson emphasizes not only the unknown value of all the plants, animals and microbes that are going extinct but the moral correctness of saving them.  It is here that one notices a change in tone from the Edward O. Wilson of years ago.  He is now so intent on saving what biodiversity is left that he is seeking to engage religion in the task!<br />This is Wilson somewhat mellowed at age seventy, seeking conciliation with former disputants for the greater good of planetary life.  This is the entomologist as statesman.<br />The reason Wilson surprisingly points to the morality of saving wildlife as the key inducement is that we are robbing the world of our children and our grandchildren for our leisure and luxury today.  It is a significant moral issue because we are putting what will be a terrible cost onto them, and they haven't a say in it at all!<br />I want to add that the danger inherent in the rampant devastation of the biosphere, whether through the direct destruction of ecologies or through pollution, is beyond our ability to foresee.  The spectre of a runaway greenhouse effect is just that, a phenomenon that may be upon us before we realize it, leaving us with no ability to stop it.  Think of Venus and a surface temperature that melts lead.  There is nothing in our present understanding of the biosphere that I know of that rules out that possibility.  We are not only stupidly playing with fire, we are playing Russian roulette with ourselves and we are holding the gun to the head of our children.  Wilson's book is an attempt to guide us away from such utter folly.  I just hope that those people in the Bush administration and at the Wall Street Journal and the Economist and elsewhere who think that our resources will take care of themselves read this wise and penetrating critique and assume personal moral responsibility for their actions and utterances.ntent on saving what biodiversity is left that he is seeking to engage religion in the task!<br />This is Wilson somewhat mellowed at age seventy, seeking conciliation with former disputants for the greater good of planetary life.

1309631:US	49786731	R3UA1IAEP2RJBW	0767909186	819136199	You Got Nothing Coming: Notes From a Prison Fish	Books	5	43	45	N	N	I am down wid dis, dawg!	This is a sad, funny and diabolically authentic memoir about his life in prison (and how he got there) by a natural born, sideways-talkin' wordsmith writing with skill, verve and a kind of disarming warmth replete with a lot of \\"out of the side of his neck\\" irony.  Lerner, a one-time nice Jewish boy  from New York finds himself the cell mate of Kansas, a six-foot-six, three-hundred pound \\"Nazi Low Rider\\" with a swastika tattooed on his neck, a prison con who can bench press something like four-hundred pounds, a guy who controls the inner prison culture and enterprises with an iron fist.  What's a fish to do?  Lerner uses corporate skills, honed during 19 years at Ma Bell, to make friends and influence people.  A nice irony throughout is the way Lerner compares the culture of the corporate structure with that of the prison, finding them similar except for the terminology.  Lerner manages to weave corporate gobbledygook about \\"market repositioning\\" and the \\"pursuance of outside opportunities\\" into the prison narrative.  He sees that the rake the \\"Yard Rats\\" and the \\"skinhead Phone Posse\\" charge the fish for using the public phone as \\"the same economic principle we employed at the phone company by charging customers for both access...and usage.\\" (p. 152)<br /><br />As far as the structure of this book goes I believe it was originally written in a straight-forward manner beginning with the earliest events and ending with the latest.  But somewhere during development it was decided to begin in the middle as Lerner enters prison.  This was an effective and tantalizing change for two significant reasons.  One, the utter shock of being immediately immersed into convict culture carries the narrative practically by itself, and Two, we are enticed to read on to the end wondering just how such a person as \\"O.G.\\" Lerner ever got himself to manslaughter in the first place.<br /><br />Lerner's ear for the language of the convicts is something close to amazing.  His absorption of their largely primitive and tribal culture is so complete that as the book ends we see him as one of them in action, inclination and loyalty as he bangs on his cell and yells out on command his blood curdling cat's meow to the disconcertion of the attack dogs of the \\"Dirt\\" (that's \\"Disciplinary Intervention and Response Team, and they ain't nothin' nice\\") and to the joy of his fellow \\"dawgs.\\"<br /><br />But Lerner's story is fascinating in itself.  He is an alcoholic and a drug imbiber who after being attacked by \\"the monster\\" (as he calls his drug-addled, \\"Soldier of Fortune\\"-reading \\"friend\\" Dwayne Hassleman) fights back and through righteous rage and superior adrenaline flow manages to subdue and then kill his adversary.  The Monster is such a degenerate beast of stupidity and animalistic hate and rage that we strongly identify with Lerner and are entirely pleased that Dwayne is no longer with us.<br /><br />However, this is to accept Lerner's version of the crime which is not a twit removed from self-defense, a version that the jury apparently did not entirely accept.  But as I used to tell my students, the one thing that all autobiographers have in common is that somewhere along the way they bend the truth to their advantage.  This is just human nature, some of it unconscious, some of it intentional.  It is amazingly difficult to tell the whole, unvarnished truth about ourselves.  No matter how honestly our desire to confess all, when driven to autobiography or memoir, we will ever so slightly misrepresent the strict letter of the truth.<br /><br />But no matter.  What counts is that the overall story be told in a vivid and convincing manner allowing us to take the fine points of blame or behavior on advisement, as it were, secure in the impression that, as Huck Finn observed about Mark Twain, \\"he told the truth, mainly.  There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.\\"<br /><br />We can see, however, by reading between the lines that Lerner (although I believe he too told mainly the truth) is more compromised that he lets on.  His continued association with the dangerous and crazy Dwayne, who threatens murder and mayhem while alluding jealously to Lerner's \\"precious little girlie family\\" (p. 354), suggests not so much forgiveness, loneliness and a big heart, but perhaps something closer to the fact that Dwayne as a drug dealer has \\"store,\\" the kind of store Lerner thought he needed to get from one day to the next.  We can also see that Lerner becomes not only a \\"righteous, stand-up con\\" but a pretty tough guy despite the fact that his nickname \\"O.G.\\" stands as much for \\"Old Guy\\" as it does for \\"original gangsta\\" (see pages 49-50).  The fact that he wins just about all his battles, physical and otherwise, and never rats anybody out, and is true to his code throughout, may suggest some selective memory device at work.<br /><br />But again Lerner's ability to spin the tale and make it as vivid as new-found terror allows us to give him his self-image and hope that he will at long last kick the booze and the drugs and be the kind of father that his two girls can look up to.  This book is a step in the right direction.  Lerner has a brilliant gift for character, narrative and dialogue that will surely make this tome recommended reading at writers' workshops while being the kind of book professional writers can admire.<br /><br />Incidentally, the title \\"You Got Nothing Coming\\" is the witch-cold, hopeless phrase used on convicts as a kind of sadistic way of saying \\"no\\" to whatever the request is, as in \\"you ain't got NOTHIN' comin', dawg--ever.\\"<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"although I believe he too told mainly the truth) is more compromised that he lets on.

1310685:US	49786731	R1YQJ09K4NC0ZP	0520219740	221043612	Sexual Selections: What We Can and Can't Learn about Sex from Animals	Books	4	31	35	N	N	Reconciling feminism and evolutionary biology	University of California, Riverside biology professor Marlene Zuk, whose specialty is insects, especially crickets, makes two main points in this modest volume.  One, what is \\"natural\\" as observed in nature is not necessary right and should not be used as a guide for human society; and two, how we interpret the behavior of animals is colored by our biases, both anthropomorphic and male-gendered.<br /><br />Professor Zuk writes from the avowed position of a feminist, although she makes it clear that she is not an \\"ecofeminist\\" nor does she agree with those feminists who believe that the exercise of science and \\"attempts to study the world are just culturally derived exercises relevant only in a certain social context.\\" (p. 16)<br /><br />In other words, Zuk wants to reconcile the ways of science, especially evolutionary biology, to feminists while pointing out to biologists that many of their preconceptions contain a male bias.  She recalls a poem from A.E. Housman that includes the phrase \\"witless nature\\" which she takes as a cornerstone for her position.  Nature \\"is not kind, not cruel, not red in tooth and claw, nor benign in its ministrations.  It is utterly, absolutely impartial.\\" (p. 15)<br /><br />From this it follows (for most of us anyway) that we should not draw moral conclusions about how people should behave, nor should we form notions of what is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" from observations of nature.  This is a position that most professionals in evolutionary biology today appreciate, although this was not always the case, as Zuk is quick to remind us.  She sees the antiquated notion of scala naturae (from Aristotle) which puts humans at the pinnacle of evolution as part of the reason for the errors of the past.  Humans were seen as the positive norm, and to the extent that the behavior of other animals deviated from that they were inferior.  Zuk also points to a \\"male model in biology\\" assumed by biologists (consciously or unconsciously), as an addition source of bias.  She points to the idea that males are more aggressive than females as an example of an unwarranted preconception.<br /><br />My experience (for what it's worth--I coached girl's basketball some years ago, and believe me the girls were VERY aggressive), and from what I know of aggressiveness theoretically, suggests that females are indeed just as aggressive as males in going after what they want.  The reason that women use violence (a kind of aggressiveness) less than men do has to do with social conditioning of course, but also with the fact that a woman's reproductive capability is seldom if ever enhanced by the use of physical force while a male may use force to his reproductive advantage.  In the case of non-human animals I am thinking especially of male lions killing the cubs of another male to bring the female into estrus.  In the case of humans I am thinking of human males using the spoils of war to gain access to females and to nurture their offspring.  (I am NOT thinking of rape since that sort of unsocial, high-risk behavior seldom leads to successful reproduction; more often it leads to ostracization and an early demise for the rapist, a state of affairs that is not adaptive.)<br /><br />Zuk writes in a witty style that is easy to read.  Her target readership is the non-specialist; indeed one gets the sense that she is addressing her undergraduate students.  Politically speaking, she steers a middle course between the extremes of the sociobiological right and the socialist left, a fact underscored by the appearance on the cover of endorsements from Matt Ridley on the right, Patricia Adair Gowaty from the left, and Sarah Blaffer Hrdy from somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />I would give a more ringing endorsement of this book were it not for the fact that there is virtually nothing new in Zuk's very agreeable presentation, and my lingering sense that a person who identifies herself as \\"feminist\\" biologist (instead of merely a biologist) is not entirely objective any more than the old guys from the patriarchy were.  However, to be fair, at no place in the book does Zuk espouse anything close to a preference for the politically correct at the expense of scientific inquiry, as feminists sometimes do when the conclusions are not what they want.  Zuk knows that to make science subordinate to what is politically and socially agreeable is to sacrifice science completely.  Indeed, I see this as the profound central message of her book, and a reason to hope this book receives a wide readership.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"irely objective any more than the old guys from the patriarchy were.

I was just stunned: a fire captain exposed as a pyromaniac.  Obviously the man had some serious \\"issues\\" with life, the world, and especially himself.  In this lucid, detailed and somewhat spicy narrative, former LAPD detective sergeant and crime writer extraordinary Joseph Wambaugh expands on what was presented in that documentary.  His tone and editorial attitude make it clear that he doesn't think much of one John Leonard Orr, former Glendale, California fire captain, who was eventually convicted of setting a string of fires in California.  I don't blame Wambaugh.  One of the fires that Orr started killed four people, including a child.  It's only by fortuitous happenstance that more people were not killed.<br />Wambaugh's narrative is a little too detailed in recalling the trials, especially the long drawn out penalty phase of the murder trial (perhaps attempting to make it as excruciating for us as it was for the jury); and his early attempt at not disclosing Orr's culpability (for those very few readers who may not have heard of the case) came up a little short as his asides made it clear that Orr was definitely one very sick puppy.  Otherwise this is a masterful piece of true crime journalism by someone who has the background to understand the police and detective work involved, someone who has done the extensive research necessary to give us a comprehensive account, and someone with the narrative and organizational skills to produce a compelling volume.<br />But Wambaugh also gives us a detailed psychological profile of John Orr.  He does not use the word \\"pyromaniac\\" in his depiction.  In fact, I don't think the word \\"pyromania\\" occurs in the book until near the end when it is used by a psychiatrist in the penalty stage of Orr's murder by arson trial.  Wambaugh's position is that Orr is a psychopath who set fires to boost his ego and stimulate himself sexually.  He cared not at all about who got hurt or what damage was done. There is also a strong sense of the \\"little guy\\" trying to make up for his feelings of inferiority by committing horrendous acts that would lend his deluded persona a sense of superiority over his fellow man.  The fact that at no time does Orr feel any remorse or accept any responsibility for his actions argues for Wambaugh's position.  Personally, for what it's worth, I've known a few psychopaths--or sociopaths, as they are alternatively called--and John Orr certainly fits the bill.<br />Still this is an unusual case of the psychopath at work, and I think it is revealed that part of what John Orr is about is pyromania.  Indeed, Wambaugh's title, \\"Fire Lover,\\" is meant in an almost literal sense.  I recall literature from years ago that pyros \\"got off\\" on their fires.  This is the first case I know of in which we have more or less direct evidence (from Orr's novel/memoir which turned up as evidence in the trials) that this is literally so.<br />Wambaugh does a good job of providing insights into how the police and fire departments and the criminal justice system operate.  He is not shy about revealing carelessness, incompetence, turf warring, and ego side trips.  He is particularly adamant in his criticism of the court system and its sometimes arcane procedures.  In an extended metaphor he calls the participants in a trial, \\"strange fish that lazily glide, blowing gas bubbles that pop ineffectually on the surface of the litigation tanks in which they live and breed.\\"  (This from page 272.  See also pages 291, 299 and elsewhere.)<br />I'm not sure about how appropriate that interesting metaphor is, but Wambaugh impressed me with his fairness, criticizing and complimenting both the prosecution and the defense.  Especially effective was the way he showed how a decade's old case that was once called an accident was successfully prosecuted against what looked like heavy odds, mainly due to the bulldog-like determination of prosecutor Mike Cabral.  Wambaugh's description of him in action vis-a-vis the jury on page 273 is an example of the very best in vivid and telling exposition.  Clearly Wambaugh has a novelist's sense of characterization, making the principals, especially of course, John Orr, come to life.  He side trips himself sometimes with the sort of crude but colorful humor the men in blue are famous for.  The cascade of \\"woodie\\" jokes might offend some readers, and some of the sexual vulgarity from Orr's \\"novel\\" is quoted outright, so beware.<br />Bottom line: perhaps not Wambaugh's most compelling work, but a good read nonetheless about an extraordinary case.odds, mainly due to the bulldog-like determination of prosecutor Mike Cabral.

According to ethnobotanist Mark J. Plotkin and longtime Vanity Fair contributing editor Michael Shnayerson, the golden age of antibiotics that began with penicillin, a time when it was generally thought that infectious diseases were under control and largely a menace of the past, is over.  Our naivete and our arrogance in imagining that we had just about defeated the bugs and could move on to other more pressing public health concerns came to an end in the nineties as one after another of the major human borne bacteria became resistant to our drugs.  Through the exchange of DNA, that immunity has been transferred to other bacteria so that, as this book went to press just a few months ago, infectious diseases caused by bacteria are once again a major threat to humans everywhere in the world.<br />What happened?  As the authors explain there are three main problems, (1) the overuse of antibiotics by the medical profession, (2) the misuse of antibiotics as growth enhancers in the meat and poultry industry, and (3) the failure of hospital personnel to follow CDC guidelines on hygiene, especially simply washing their hands.<br />(1) Too many doctors, either through ignorance or a desire to please their demanding patients, have over-prescribed antibiotics for routine infections, and in some cases actually prescribed antibiotics for viral infections (for which they are useless) \\"just in case\\" the patient also gets a bacterial infection.  The result of this massive overuse of antibiotics is to give the bugs countless trillions of generational opportunities to evolve defenses against the antibiotic, leading to the antibiotic becoming useless.<br />(2) Tons of antibiotics--\\"24.6 million pounds a year,\\" see p. 123--are routinely added to animal feed by the meat and poultry industry to promote growth so that their products will get fatter faster.  What has happened is that the bugs have grown resistant to the antibiotics while transferring that immunity to bacteria living in, on and around humans.  Even the use of an \\"analogue\\" antibiotic such as growth promoter virginiamycin can promote changes in bacteria that make them resistant to the antibiotic Synercid (e.g., see pages 115, 119 and 285).  As the authors chronicle, this is a serious problem fraught with angry political battles as the meat and poultry people fight to maintain their profit margins while the disease control people fight to restrict the use of growth promoters.<br />(3) Surprisingly enough the authors report (see page 282 and elsewhere) that there is cynicism among some hospital personnel about the effectiveness of washing their hands and a belief that hygiene won't stop the proliferation of the bugs.  The result is that hospitals have become very dangerous places.  Most of the drug-resistant bacteria developed their resistance in hospitals.  Most (or all) of them are endemic to the hospital environment.  If you have to go to a hospital for any reason you are taking a chance of contacting a drug-resistant bug.  Heaven help you if you have a compromised immune system, or if you are an infant or an elderly person.<br />How bad is the situation?  According to the authors on pages 278-279 the high cost of developing new drugs (average \\"$802 million\\") and the fact that \\"return on investment from producing an antibiotic that might be used by a patient for less than a week versus return from a drug for a chronic condition that a patient might take daily for fifty years\\" is persuading big pharma to downsize the antibiotic end of the business.  (See also page 94.)  The authors ask the question, where are new drugs coming from? and answer that the \\"great glittering prospect was genomics.\\"  But \\"reality\\" has \\"sunk in.\\" (p. 280)  Drugs to fight bacteria developed from DNA manipulation \\"might take even longer to reach the market\\" than those previously developed. (p. 281)<br />The authors also touch on the possible use of drug-resistant bacteria as a bioterroristweapon.<br /><br />What does all this mean for you and me?  It means that should we or our loved ones get a life-threatening bacterial infection, it's possible there won't be an antibiotic around that works.  In effect, we might find ourselves back in the days before penicillin (the first really effective antibiotic, and one of the greatest of all medical miracles) when millions of people routinely died from staph, strep, TB and other bacterial infections.  As Shnayerson and Plotkin report, right now there are strains of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (the golden-globed bacteria pictured on the cover), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the Mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis, that are immune to almost every antibiotic in use.  There is even a strain of Enterococcus that is resistant to every antibiotic in use.<br />The authors do offer some hope.  They report on the promising use of bacteriophages (viruses that invade and destroy bacteria)--see the very interesting Chapter 14, \\"Bacteria Busters.\\"  They present the idea of a more vigorously controlled use of antibiotics.  If we prohibit their use as growth promoters and use them sparingly in an ordered sequence, perhaps bacteria would not have time to gain immunity and/or would lose it after the antibiotic is no longer in use.  As pointed out on e.g., page 183, resistant bacteria are \\"encumbered\\" by an \\"extra chunk of DNA\\" that gives their non-resistant brethren an \\"ecological advantage\\" in an environment that doesn't contain the antibiotic.  Additionally, the authors report the theory of population biologist Richard Levins who believes that if antibiotics are \\"saved for the most severe cases...then natural selection would favor the pathogens that produced the milder symptoms.\\"  (Explained on page 287).<br />Bottom line: this is a fascinating, scary and state of the art report on the pathogen wars written in a readable manner sure to interest not only the general public at which it is aimed but professionals as well.weapon. <BR> <BR>What does all this mean for you and me?

1337719:US	49786731	RJXFPMHIP02EO	0060959584	949198499	Eating Well for Optimum Health: The Essential Guide to Bringing Health and Pleasure Back to Eating	Books	5	19	19	N	N	A pleasure to read	Dr. Weil's graceful and  reasoned prose tends one to serenity and contemplation.  What I found myself contemplating as I was reading this beautifully presented book about food was Dr. Weil himself.  I recall him as the enfant terrible author of the bourgeois-shocking The Natural Mind: A New Way of Looking at Drugs and the Higher Consciousness (1972), a book that helped to persuade a generation of Americans to question the establishment's anti-drug mentality.  The theme of that book, if I recall correctly, was that human beings have a natural drive to explore other states of consciousness.<br />Now Dr. Weil is a middle-aged man like myself, and the fires of youth have turned to...extra-virgin olive oil and tofu!  Who says that wisdom does not come with age?  As I absorbed Weil's ideas about how to eat properly I couldn't help but notice what has changed since the balmy days of our youth, nutritionally-speaking, and what Weil has, in his diverse travels, both on the surface of this planet and within, learned about how to eat.<br />He is a vegetarian who loves food.  The simple, but inviting recipes on pages 209-260 attest to that.  He will eat dairy products in moderation and fish, but he prefers to get his proteins from plants.  He believes that refined and highly processed carbohydrate foods (those with a \\"high gylcemic index\\"; see his table on pages 56-57) can have disastrous effects on the health of many people, pointing to native Hawaiians and Native Americans as examples (p. 63).  Surprisingly he doesn't see dietary fat as the bugaboo it once was as long as one limits the intake of saturated fats and returns to the shelf any product including the words \\"partially hydrogenated\\" on the label (192-193).  He touts olive oil and makes a very close distinction among saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated oils, opting for a balanced intake in the ratio, respectively, of 1:2:1 (p. 262).  He believes that we need to incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids from primarily fish oils, soybeans and walnuts into our diets as opposed to omega-6 oils.<br />New to me is Weil's contention that vegetarians need not be concerned about the notion of \\"complementary protein\\" that we learned about years ago.  No longer do we have to combine vegetable foods, corn with beans, for example, to get all the necessary amino acids that our bodies need.  He says that Frances Moore Lapp&eacute;, who brought the concept to a large readership in the seventies with her very popular Diet for a Small Planet (1971), is mistaken and that \\"the body is clever enough to find missing essential amino acids...from the vast numbers of bacteria that inhabit the lower intestinal tract or from the vast numbers of cells that slough off the lining of the digestive tract every day\\" (p. 104).  I wonder.  I do know that when I eat a meal of complementary protein, say tortillas and beans, it tastes especially good, exponentially good in fact, compared to eating just one of those foods alone.  Also getting essential amino acids by eating your own cells begs the question of where the essential amino acids came from in the first place.  If they really come from intestinal tract bacteria in significant amounts-an intriguing and delightful concept (we farm within!)-perhaps we ought to know more about how such a system works.  Does intestinal tract length matter?  Are there bacteria cultures we might imbibe?  (Maybe this is Weil's next book!)<br />I also wonder about the significance of the distinction he makes between basmati rice from India and other kinds of rice.  He claims that the rice usually eaten in China and Japan is mostly amylopectin starch that is \\"much easier to digest\\" than the mostly amylose starch in basmati rice (p. 39).  His point is that how fast we digest a starch affects \\"blood sugar levels, which, in turn, affects our energy, our tendency to gain weight, and our general health\\" (p. 39)  He claims on the following page that \\"Even if you are carbohydrate sensitive, you can enjoy some white rice if you choose a lower-glycemic-index variety like basmati.\\"<br />My confidence in Dr. Weil is not shaken by the inclusion as an appendix the fantastic notion that people might be able to exist without eating.  ( See \\"Appendix D: The Possibility of Surviving Without Eating.\\")  I am not concerned because Weil slyly makes it apparent (but only apparent) that he doubts it is possible.  Still one wonders why he included something like this in first place, particularly when one of his seven basic propositions about food is \\"WE HAVE TO EAT TO LIVE\\" (his caps on page 9).<br />His discussion of the various cuisines and their characteristic foods is very interesting and just the sort of thing we need to focus on and appreciate.  I have always thought of the Chinese and the French cuisines as monumental edifices of gastronomic art.  In this book is an appreciation of the richness of Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines as well.  His identification of a Mediterranean cuisine (he calls it a diet, pages 162-165) that includes Middle Eastern foods as well as Italian, Greek and others is particularly significant since that is the part of the world in which our first agriculture-based civilizations began.<br />In the usual Knopf style this is a beautifully edited and presented book.  I didn't notice a single typo, although sweet potatoes are mistakenly identified as roots and not tubers on page 39.  Bottom line: Weil is a very persuasive and readable man whose food preferences inspire confidence and imitation., you can enjoy some white rice if you choose a lower-glycemic-index variety like basmati.\\"<br />My confidence in Dr. Weil is not shaken by the inclusion as an appendix the fantastic notion that people might be able to exist without eating.

Mencken's boobus americanus after a TV makeover	Bobos (\\"bourgeois bohemians\\") are what come of the Protestant Establishment bedding down with flower children.  Bobos are the issue of WASP and Kennedy Catholic, the Left Bank and the Right.  Ben Franklin making cozy with Gustav Flaubert.  A marriage of  Episcopalian and Jew.  A prep school Adonis seducing a grad school feminist.  (Or perhaps that should be the other way around.)  They are what happens to yuppies in the Age of Information.  Bobos realize that the bottom line should be done in calligraphy; that six-figures of yearly income ought to buy more than the Wall Street Journal and cappuccino; that there is more to life than vintage port and the society pages.<br /><br />Although Bobos in Paradise is packaged as a satire, and indeed a lot of fun is had with the meritocracy, it is actually an adoration written by a self-admitted member of the new elite.  Since it is difficult to satirize your own class, Brooks's satire occasionally lacks bite.  But it certainly doesn't lack pizzazz, sparkle, and a kind of \\"Look, Ma, I'm writing!\\" effervescence.  Bon mots and witty catch phrases (\\"incidental money,\\" \\"biscotti-nibbling Bobos,\\" \\"New Age vaporheads,\\" etc.) roll right off his tongue, or, I should say, spring adroitly from his keyboard.  Thus on page 58 we learn that \\"Gone are the sixties-era things that were fun and of interest to teenagers, like Free Love, and retained are all the things that might be of interest to middle-aged hypochondriacs, like whole grains.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes we get a glimpse, however, that, although his eye is sharp and his wit keen, Brooks's verbal hijinks lack a certain substance, leading to a failure to convince.  Thus on page 90 he writes: \\"The top-of-the-line fleece outergarments [worn by Bobos] are used for nothing more strenuous than traversing the refrigerated aisle in the Safeway.\\"  One thing wrong with this: Bobos don't shop at Safeway.  Please.  More like Whole Foods or Bristol Farms.<br /><br />Or, on page 20, where he's talking about wedding section photos from the New York Times in the fifties, he observes, \\"and yet it's not really been so long-most of the people on those yellowing pages are still alive, and a sizable portion of the brides on those pages are young enough that they haven't yet been dumped for trophy spouses.\\"  Which means, I guess, that Brooks thinks that a man opts for a trophy wife at about the age of 70.  Or maybe, caught up in the pleasing flow of his rhetoric, he doesn't notice when the meaning has gone slightly awry.<br /><br />The book is organized into chapters defining the lifestyle of Bobos.  One of the best is \\"Consumption,\\" that which Bobos do best: conspicuously consume with a vengeance while remaining politically correct.  The chapters are padded out a little with reviews of influential books of social criticism, e.g., William Whyte's The Organization Man, Theodore Roszak's The Making of a Counter-Culture or Paul Goodman's Growing Up Absurd, a group the author and his book clearly aspire to join.<br /><br />Also excellent is the chapter, \\"Intellectual Life,\\" in which Brooks focuses on think tank culture and demolishes it.  For Brooks, a think tank is where underlings learn how to become intellectuals while going through a \\"buttboy stage\\" as they scurry with their stuffed briefcases behind the \\"front people\\" of the tanks, tired old icon intellectuals who \\"walk very fast to demonstrate their vitality\\" (p. 155).  Brooks notes tellingly that if anything happened to the apprentice intellectuals \\"think tank reports across America would go out filled with typos for months.\\"<br /><br />A chapter on \\"Pleasure\\" suffers from Brooks's disinclination to reveal much about the sexual habits of Bobos.  Other than to assert that Bobos like their sex healthy, safe and with rules, and that they don't just have orgasms, they \\"achieve them,\\" Brooks is fairly mum.  Whether Bobos do threesomes or prefer third world types for sexual thrills is apparently not known.  Work itself is the real pleasure.<br /><br />The chapter \\"Politics and Beyond\\" demonstrates that Bobos are a reconciliation of liberal and conservative, a mesh of the politics of the 60s and 80s.  They would seem to be moderates, but by page 266 Brooks assures us happily that Bobos have clearly \\"become conservatives.\\"<br /><br />The chapter on \\"Spiritual Life\\" suffers from a kind of free-floating free-good association that Brooks wants to indulge.  Bobos don't put down any religion, and in fact like to try them all on for size, picking and choosing from each what is best.  One gets the sense however that Bobo heaven is a place where spirituality is expressed by buying, displaying and using politically correct consumer goods and services.<br /><br />Make no mistake, though, this is the kind of book biz coup that we'd all like to have written.  It's tasty pablum for those who would see themselves as the ruling class, a massage of prejudices, mores and self-centered delusions that would have amused Dwight MacDonald (author of \\"Masscult and Midcult,\\" a seminal satiric essay from the fifties) or old H. L. Mencken who liked to shock the \\"booboisie\\" with his polemics, as does Brooks.  In fact Brooks's Bobos look a little like Mencken's boobus americanus after a TV makeover.<br /><br />Yet there's something reassuring in this fantasy of upper class life in America at the dawn of a new millennium.  Sure the power structure has been diluted by women and some unavoidable eggheadism, but by gosh, when all is said and done, it's still the same good old boys who are running the show, upright people from such places as Wayne, Pennsylvania and Burlington, Vermont, people characterized, as their fathers were, by \\"restraint and sobriety.\\"<br /><br />God's in his heaven and all is right in Bobo Land.\\"Politics and Beyond\\" demonstrates that Bobos are a reconciliation of liberal and conservative, a mesh of the politics of the 60s and 80s.

1341099:US	49786731	R3CMA77QTL1MVP	0374236437	707644275	Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution	Books	4	39	46	N	N	Vital and interesting but not convincing	I was very impressed with the depth and scope of Fukuyama's examination of the call to regulate biotechnology and especially with the fairness of his presentation and tone.  His subject is a particularly contentious one, and one of enormous importance for all of us since the effect of biotechnology on human beings includes the possibility of not only changing our very nature, but of an actual step-by-step termination of humans as we are now constituted.<br />Ultimately this is what Professor Fukuyama is worried about and why he argues so strongly for the regulation of the biotech industry regardless of the effect such regulation might have on scientific progress and even at the risk of creating a biotech gap between the United States and other nations actively pursuing such research.<br />However, I don't think Fukuyama was completely successful in making his case; indeed I am not worried about \\"us\\" becoming something else or losing what he refers to as our \\"human essence.\\"<br />\\"And what is that human essence that we might be in danger of losing?\\" he asks on page 101. \\"For a religious person, it might have to do with the divine gift or spark that all human beings are born with.  From a secular perspective, it would have to do with human nature: the species-typical characteristics shared by all human beings qua human beings.  That is ultimately what is at stake in the biotech revolution.\\"<br />He doesn't define these \\"species-typical characteristics.\\"  Instead he goes on to say that there is \\"an intimate connection between human nature and human notions of rights, justice, and morality.\\"  He then argues the case for basing human rights on human nature, sometimes called the \\"naturalistic fallacy,\\" thereby putting himself in the hands of those who would know what human nature is.  Alas, there is no agreement on that subject, which is why, as Fukuyama notes, the term \\"natural rights\\" has been replaced with \\"human rights whose provenance does not depend on a theory of nature.\\" (p. 101)<br />On page149 he changes his tack somewhat and argues that the biotechnological revolution is a threat to our sense of \\"dignity and recognition.\\"  He says this \\"is not economic: what we desire is not money but that other human beings respect us in the way we think we deserve.\\"<br />Here I would point out that \\"recognition\\" and having \\"dignity\\" in the eyes of others is adaptive in a Darwinian sense.  People that the tribe regard as lacking dignity and recognition get fewer reproductive tries and have a tough time of it socially and economically.  Having dignity is like saving face: something we must do to maintain psychological equilibrium and our position in society.<br />On page 218 he comes around to concluding that \\"human nature is very plastic...  But it is not infinitely malleable, and the elements that remain constant--particularly our species-typical gamut of emotional responses--constitute a safe harbor that allows us to connect, potentially, with all other human beings.\\"<br />This seems to imply that what he has finally found as our \\"essence\\" is our emotional nature.  He might be right (heaven help us if he is) but I think our ability to adapt to change and to order our environment to our advantage through our culture and technology is really the essence of what it means to be human.<br />The curious thing about this book is how really persuasive, reasonable and informative Fukuyama is when he is NOT arguing for the regulation of biotechnology.  Here are some interesting observations:<br />\\"In the future, virtually everything that the popular imagination envisions genetic engineering accomplishing is much more likely to be accomplished sooner through neuropharmacology.\\" (p. 52)<br />\\"There is a disconcerting symmetry between Prozac and Ritalin.  The former is prescribed heavily for depressed women lacking in self-esteem; it gives them more of the alpha-male feeling that comes with high serotonin levels.  Ritalin, on the other hand, is prescribed largely for young boys who do not want to sit still in class because nature never designed them to behave that way.\\"  (pp. 51-52)<br />\\"Developed countries\\" are finding that \\"the pool of available military manpower\\" is shrinking as their population ages.  \\"The willingness of people in such societies to tolerate battle casualties among their young may fall as well.\\"  He sees a world \\"divided...between a North whose political tone is set by elderly women, and a South driven by...super-empowered angry young men.\\" (p. 63)<br />Finally on page 172 he writes, \\"This protracted discussion of human dignity is intended to answer the following question: What is it that we want to protect from any future advances in biotechnology?  The answer is, we want to protect the full range of our complex, evolved natures against attempts at self-modification.\\"<br />My question is why?  Are we so perfectly constituted as to make change undesirable?  Our \\"evolved natures\\" are just that, something that has evolved and is evolving and will go on evolving.  The creature that was \\"us\\" five million years ago has changed into the \\"us\\" of today.  Would it be somehow preferable to have somehow stopped change five million years ago?  If not, what makes Fukuyama think that we should attempt that now?  He writes from the position of a humanist, but his unstated assumptions are similar to the religious notion that we are somehow the final product of a Creator and therefore not to be tampered with.<br />Evolution is now proceeding with an enormous rapidity driven not by natural selection but by culture.  Our artifacts and our science and yes our biotechnology are part of the culture that is shaping us.  We can't escape from that fact, and we cannot deny our nature as creatures that create, even though some of our creations may be dangerous.

It is a flat out pleasure to read, but what really makes it such an outstanding piece of work, and a book every kitchen should have, is that it is so full of information, from why and how corn syrup ends up in sodas to why and how to wash your mushrooms--and yes, they are indeed grown in manure, but not to worry, as Wolke explains on pages 286-288 in a little essay entitled, \\"You Can't Wash Your Car with a Wet Mushroom.\\"  (I believe that.)  This is the kind of book you'll find yourself reading from cover to cover instead of peeling the potatoes.  Speaking of which, Wolke advises that there is a very slight problem with green potatoes, but that reports of their poisonous nature are greatly exaggerated.  (See pages 117-120 for the true scoop.)<br /><br />I have just one problem: nowhere does Wolke say how many sesame seeds are in a teaspoon.  However, inspired by Wolke's labor-intensive lime squeezing experiment on pages 281-284, I was able to work it out myself.  The answer is 840.  I found this by counting the number in a half teaspoon and multiplying by two, genius that I am.  (Alas, this was before I realized that I could have counted the number in a quarter teaspoon and multiplied by four.)  Which reminds me of the joke about a guy on a train counting cows in a field.  When asked how he could do this he explained that he counted their legs and divided by four.<br /><br />Now you may think this was an idle exercise and wonder if I am not slyly making fun of Wolke's book.  Au Cointreau!  What I learned by counting sesame seeds exemplifies one of the lessons in the book, namely how hard it is to measure anything exactly.  On page 294 Wolke asks, \\"Have you noticed how surface tension makes the liquid bulge up above the rim of the measuring spoon?  How accurate can that be?\\"  Well, I have, and I want to tell you getting a straight line of sesame seeds across the top of that measuring spoon was no piece of cake either!<br /><br />There are nine chapters and a really excellent index, suggestions for further reading and a brief glossary.  There are some excellent recipes by Wolke's wife, Marlene Parrish.  I performed a \\"thought experiment\\" on several of them and found that my mouth was watering.  One of them, how to make turkey or chicken gravy on page 156 is almost exactly the way I make it.  (Smile.)  Parrish uses the roasting pan, transferring it to the stove top burners after removing the bird, and then deglazes the pan more or less in the French style.  I must note that on the previous page Wolke himself does not recommend this technique finding it \\"hard to straddle two burners\\" not to mention \\"one big cleanup job after dinner.\\"<br /><br />Which makes me wonder who makes the gravy in their household--or, better yet, who does the dishes!<br /><br />The chapters begin with sugar, \\"Sweet Talk\\" and end with \\"Tools and Technology.\\"  Wolke gives us a full mouthful on the differences between cane and beet sugar, between brown and white sugar, between cocoa and chocolate, and makes me feel good about not being crazy about white chocolate.

Ghee, I'm exhausted!<br /><br />One of my favorite explanations is why beef in the supermarket looks bright pink on the outside and brown on the inside.  (See pages 127-128, and, no, they don't spray it with dye, which is what I always thought.)  I also liked it when Wolke got down and dirty and tried to fry an egg on the sidewalk, and after some heavy-duty \\"Techspeak\\" came to the conclusion that you can't; that frying an egg on the sidewalk is an urban legend.

The former is 87 years old and the latter is a translation (with commentary by Hans-Ulrich Rieker) from the German, and is therefore twice removed from the original Sanskrit.  Both books are out of print.  Surprisingly there is virtually nothing else in English despite the fact that the hatha yoga teachings found in popular works, including B.K.S. Iyengar's celebrated Light on Yoga, are in no small part based on Svatmarama's text.<br /><br />Brian Dana Akers brings us a new translation set with the English following the Sanskrit verse by verse.  His style is straightforward, clear and elegant.  He does not make the mistake of trying to translate yogic terms that are really not translatable, e.g., \\"nadi,\\" \\"prana,\\" \\"bandha,\\" \\"mudra,\\" etc.  Instead he invites us to use a dictionary of yoga.  He also makes the sly suggestion in his brief but graceful Introduction that \\"the scientifically minded do some empirical research.  In a peaceful country, in a quiet place, free of all anxieties...\\" (p. xii)<br /><br />Well, I have done some small research and I can tell you that Svatmarama knows whereof he speaks.  I can also say along with Akers that I do not recommend some of Svatmarama's practices, (some of the \\"cleansing\\" mudras are unnecessary today; indeed they are dangerous) and clearly the old master exaggerates.  However, his intention was not hyperbole.  He spoke instead in what is called an \\"intentional language\\" that would guide teachers and advanced practitioners without confusing or revealing too much to beginners.  This way of speaking is also called samdhya-bhasha (\\"twilight language\\") according to Georg Feuerstein.  Thus a practice that allows one to become \\"young, even if old\\" may be distinguished from another practice that \\"destroys death,\\" which in turn may be distinguished from one which leads to the place where \\"time is not.\\"<br /><br />Even though I first encountered the text almost 25 years ago and have read it several times, I did indeed find a dictionary helpful.  I used Georg Feuerstein's definitive The Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga (1997), but could have also used an English-Sanskrit dictionary to explore the more secular meanings of some words, which might have given me a better feel for some of the nuances of expression used by Svatmarama.  To really appreciate Svatmarama's text perhaps this from Feuerstein might be helpful: \\"Language has the curious capacity to both disclose and veil the truth, and since ancient times the masters of India's spirituality have been especially sensitive to the possibilities and the limitations of linguistic communication.\\" (Opus cited, p. 167)  Rather than throw himself into the briar patch of Svatmarama's expression, Akers has wisely stepped to the side and let the text speak for (and against) itself.<br /><br />But what is the Hatha Yoga Pradipika?  It is simply a course in how to obtain samadhi, or liberation or freedom from the pairs of opposites that dominate our lives.  It begins with asana and pranayama and ends with transcendence.  All of the postures so familiar to us, and all of the breathing exercises have but one purpose: meditation leading to pushing aside the veil of ignorance that characterizes ordinary existence.  It takes a long time to get there.  The \\"empirical research\\" that Akers recommends will be a project of years (unless of course one is particularly gifted).<br /><br />What is not mentioned in Svatmarama's delineation are the ethical and spiritual considerations called the yamas and niyamas that we find in Patanjali.  I recommend that the Hatha Yoga Pradipika be studied in conjunction with Patanjali's celebrated sutras as aids to your practice.  They have much in common, but there are some significant differences.  Svatmarama makes no concessions to political correctness nor to social or religious considerations.  His text is indeed striking in its terse and single-minded, even profane, ambition.  Quite simply there is a problem: bondage to samsara.  And there is a solution: hatha yoga leading to raja yoga leading to liberation.<br /><br />Brian Dana Akers and the people at YogaVidya are to be complimented for bringing this text to the general public and for doing so in a most attractive manner.

That dream remained intact until the discovery in the twentieth century of how the elements are actually built up from hydrogen and exactly what kind of \\"magic furnace\\" would be required to turn base metals into gold.  In a most engaging narrative, science writer Marcus Chown tells that fascinating story through the lives and ideas of the scientists who made the discoveries.<br /><br />Chown begins, as one must, with the Greeks and Democritus who opined, \\"...in reality there are only atoms and the void.\\"  Chown shows how it was impossible for the Greeks without the scientific method to go any further than Democritus's intuition.  But Chown does not dwell on the alchemy but ratchets us directly to modern science and the growing realization that \\"Atoms Are Not the Smallest Things\\" (Chapter Two), and that therefore \\"it must be possible to transform an atom of one element into an atom of another.\\" (p. 21)<br /><br />And with that, the race was on to account for how hydrogen became helium which became, through crucibles unimaginable to man, carbon, iron and eventually the heaviest elements.  The story culminates in the work of Fred Hoyle, Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge, and Willy Fowler who explained the nuclear processes operating inside stars and supernovae.  Chown finishes with a chapter on the discovery of the cosmic background radiation, the \\"afterglow of creation\\" which confirmed how helium was manufactured in the Big Bang, and a chapter on how the elements are strewn into space and end up in Population I stars and eventually in our bodies.  There is a Glossary and a Selected Bibliography.<br /><br />The value of this book lies not only in the fascinating story told but in the magical way that Chown is able to painlessly teach us a little chemistry and physics along the way.  I learned more about the nature of atoms and the various forces in nature in these pages, almost incidentally, than I have in any other single book.  So intrigued was I in learning more that I turned to the Periodic Table of the Elements as I read the text.<br /><br />But Chown's style is not didactic.  Instead he illuminates the personalities and the flow of ideas.  We see Marie Currie with her radiation swollen fingers and Fred Hoyle truant at the back of the local cinema teaching himself to read.  We see how the vision of meteorites falling into the sun became the vision of the sun falling in upon itself, shrinking and, as the elements got closer and closer together, heating up, and how that idea coursed after some meandering into the discovery of atomic energy.  But perhaps the most beautiful \\"turn\\" (as in a poetic change of perception, as in a sonnet) in the book is on page 107 where Chown's writes about the sameness of all the atoms of an element, and then suddenly asks, thinking about the mysterious behavior evidenced by the phenomenon of the half-life: \\"How could radium atoms all be the same yet behave differently?\\"  This question leads to the uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics.<br /><br />There is an implicit sense of warning in the book about the limitations of humans doing science.  Thus the American geologist Thomas Chamberlain is quoted on page 54 as saying, \\"There is perhaps no beguilement more insidious and dangerous than an elaborate and elegant mathematical process built upon unfortified premises.\\"  He was critiquing Lord Kelvin, but might his words not apply to more recent theories, such as that of one-dimensional strings?  And on page 65 it is recounted that Auguste Comte \\"deemed it self-evident that we would never be able to study\\" the chemical composition of the stars.  Two years after his death in 1857 thanks to the unlikely technique of spectroscopy we were doing just that.  Indeed, as Chown reports on page 67, helium was discovered on the sun through a reading of its spectrum before it was discovered on the earth!  By the way, Chown's material on spectroscopy is fascinating and helped me to a better understanding of how the process works and how the black lines in spectrums of light reveal the composition of the stars.<br /><br />Chown has the ability to engage the reader in scientific ideas, perhaps in part because of the unique way he sometimes puts things.  For example on page 79 he writes about the resistance encountered by an object as it approached the speed of light.  He states, \\"The only conceivable source of such resistance was a body's mass.\\"  However, what I thought was, mass cannot find resistance by itself.  There must be something in the very fabric of spacetime that is providing the resistance.  It is not enough to posit \\"inertia\\" since that really explains nothing.  I believe there is still something fundamental that we do not understand about the relationship between the speed of light and the nature of matter and energy.<br /><br />Chown sometimes uses the language and assumptions of the times he is writing about.  For example on page 96 he speaks of \\"the electrons which flitted about an atomic nucleus like planets round the sun,\\" an analogy now considered somewhat misleading (a \\"cloud\\" is preferred, I believe), but in recalling it, we are again forced to imagine what an atom might look like if we could somehow \\"see\\" it.<br /><br />Most amusing story: Austrian physicist Fritz Houtermans making up dreams to tell Sigmund Freud! (p. 110)<br /><br />Best stream of consciousness leading to insight: Fred Hoyle musing on the atomic bomb project about which he had only second-hand and circumstantial evidence. (pp. 159-160)<br /><br />Best speculation: In answer to \\"Where are they?\\", Fermi's famous question about extra-terrestrials, Chown proposes that they came and went long before the sun even shone. (p. 215)<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\"iscovered on the earth!

The usual approach to this is a text by an expert in the field with close editing by someone whose level of knowledge is closer to that of the general public.<br />This is what was attempted here, but I don't feel it was entirely successful.  As I noted in a review of a similar book (Ball, Philip.  Stories of the Invisible: a Guided Tour of Molecules, 2001), there is unfortunately a kind of veil-like quality thrown between the molecular world and our perception of that world by the very fact of its invisibility that it not easy to overcome.  It is not a question of readability so much as a question of how to present these very complex structures and ideas in a way that the reader can absorb in some concrete fashion.<br />This problem is common to all scientific books, but in biochemistry it is particularly difficult because (1) biochemistry is so complex, and (2) it is only touched on superficially in our schools, and (3) its knowledge base is expanding so rapidly.  Professor Widmaier, who wrote the popular Why Geese Don't Get Obese (and We Do), gives it a good shot here with editorial help from John Parsley at Times Books, but I think they ran into the bugaboo of all science writing: How much to explain?  How fundamental to get?<br />Let me try to illustrate what I mean using an example from page 81.  Widmaier writes, \\"...[I]f muscles are not used for long periods, as in long space missions, they tend to atrophy.\\"  Is this enough said?  My feeling is the text could be improved by adding that even though the astronauts exercise often and vigorously and work long days, the reason the muscles tend to atrophy is that there is not the constant pull of gravity on them that forces them to work to support the weight of the body.<br />Or, for a slightly different example: On page 91 Widmaier mentions \\"a hormone called [a] melanocyte-stimulating hormone\\" which he says is \\"responsible for seasonal changes in coat color in some mammals, but whose physiological role in humans is still debated.\\"  He leaves it at that, but I think he ought to have briefly given the sides of the debate.  That would help us get a better feel for the hormone and it would be something vivid that we might easily remember.<br />I also think that the choice to go with largely schematic drawings of the molecules added little to the text.  Better would have been drawings showing processes, such as molecules leaving and entering cell membranes, or illustrating how the various hormonal cycles work.<br />Still there is a lot to learn here.  For example, on page 44 Widmaier explains that fiber \\"tends to inhibit the reabsorption of bile from the intestine\\" which forces the liver to \\"extract more cholesterol from the blood to regenerate the bile being lost in the feces.\\"  He concludes, \\"That's one reason why it's believed a fiber-rich diet has the effect of lowering blood cholesterol levels in a harmless, natural way.\\"  This is in addition to fiber helping with \\"regularity.\\"  And on page 116 I learned that the reason very dim stars (which might very well be red) appear white is that \\"their low-level light is only detectable by the color-blind rhodopsin molecules\\" in the rods of our eyes.<br />A much more ambitious book on this subject, and one that strongly challenges the reader, is Franklin Harold's The Way of the Cell: Molecules, Organisms and the Order of Life (2001), which I highly recommend.e says is \\"responsible for seasonal changes in coat color in some mammals, but whose physiological role in humans is still debated.\\"  He leaves it at that, but I think he ought to have briefly given the sides of the debate.

He has a nice sense of story and spins it well.  Only problem is, after reading this 108-page novel of a perfect love retrieved from death, I felt as though I had experienced a Disney production of a romance novel written from a male point of view by a very skillful and dreamy teenager who dotted every \\"i\\" and crossed every \\"t\\" in the young adults fictional canon.  It was like a visit to Pleasantville or a mid-fifties sit com.  I mean, how perfect is Amanda?  She's flawless.

And no use of wise and wrinkled Native Americans and wise and black mentors.  No more cliches.  Just the awful, banal truth.  A little fantasy is okay, but dream up something original.

1387591:US	49786731	R25A1PA175T5K1	156589166X	237966681	The Art and Science of Raja Yoga: Fourteen Steps to Higher Awareness: Based on the Teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda	Books	3	36	65	N	N	Primarily for devotees of the Swami	Raja yoga--the \\"royal\\" yoga, or the \\"king's\\" yoga--is traditionally the yoga that comes after hatha yoga.  In the Patanjali sutras it is sometimes associated with the limbs of yoga beginning with pratyahara (sense withdrawal) and concluding with samadhi, with the earlier limbs of yama, niyama (ethical considerations), asana (physical posture), and pranayama (breath control)  understood as preparatory.  However nothing in yoga is that clear cut, and some see the initial limbs of yama and niyama as part of the essential teachings of raja yoga, while others (myself included) see raja yoga as a continuation of hatha yoga and in no way separate.  Swami Kriyananda (who was J. Donald Walters) presents in this book an elaborate yoga program that includes the Patanjali canon and much besides.  Unfortunately (for me at least) much too much of the book is devoted to Kriyananda's personal and highly religious, mysterious, pseudo-scientific and murky ideas that are essentially extraneous to the ancient art and practice of yoga.<br /><br />To give you an idea of how Kriyananda's perceptions and mine differ consider this: In an \\"Author's Prefatory Note\\" Kriyananda explains why he uses \\"he\\" throughout the text instead of \\"he or she\\" or the often non-grammatical \\"they.\\"  He finds such usages \\"cumbersome\\" noting that he refuses to think in terms of \\"pants\\" or \\"skirts\\" when he is addressing the \\"human being, stripped of sexual considerations.\\"  This is fine, indeed, admirable.  However on page 23 he writes, \\"Primitive peoples, as all men are believed to have been...\\" when he could have just as easily have written \\"...as all people are believed to have been...\\"  I am persuaded that Kriyananda's text, which serves as the basis for what he calls \\"Part II of the Ananda Course in Self-Realization\\" is a text that he didn't want to change, perhaps for practical reasons, and found a justification for the sexist language instead.  Since the text was apparently written many years ago (Sheila Rush in her Foreword, indicates on page 13 that she read it 21 years ago) and considering that Kriyananda has been teaching yoga for over fifty years, his reluctance is understandable.  However other parts of the text suffer from a similarly antiquated and no longer viable view of yoga and its history.<br /><br />For example he speaks of the superiority of the ancients in terms of their having attained \\"far greater heights of knowledge than we have reached so far in our civilization.\\"  He gives as examples, \\"ancient, supposedly mythological, accounts of flying vehicles, even of interplanetary travel.\\"  And he refers to \\"an ancient manuscript in India that has survived to this day, in which the lives of many thousands, perhaps millions, of people were recorded in detail.\\"  He notes that \\"most of these people had not yet been born.\\"  He adds, \\"I found my own life accurately described--even to my correct name and birthplace--in this work, including predictions of future events that have since come to pass.\\"  (All of this on page 25.)  On the following page, Kriyananda informs us that as the sun moves closer to the galactic center \\"mankind as a whole becomes more enlightened.\\"<br /><br />In addition to this sort of unnecessary mysticism, the text is also highly religious in a way that I find inimical to the spirit of the yoga of Patanjali or the yoga of B.K.S. Iyengar, or that of the Gheranda-Samhita and the Hathayogapradipika, or that of the Katha Upanishad, or even that of the sacred Bhagavad Gita.  The postures demonstrated throughout the book by a sometimes smiling adept, are captioned with what are prayerful exaltations.  Above the Supta-Vajrasana (what he calls \\"the Spine Firm Pose\\") on page 265 are the words, \\"With calm faith, I open to Thy Light.\\"  Or on page 335 captioning Sirshasana (the headstand) are the words, \\"I am He!  I am He!  Blissful Spirit, I am He!\\"<br /><br />So be aware that this is a religious book as much as, or even more so, than it is a work onraja yoga.  The religious orientation is Hindu which is understandable since it is very difficult to separate yoga from Hinduism; however Kriyananda does not try.  That is not his intent.  Indeed he tries to show that yoga is an integral part of other religions including Christianity.  For example on page 402 he writes, \\"In Genesis 3:24 we read of the tree of life.  The reference is to the spine.\\"  This yogic interpretation is a bit forced and typical of much of the world view presented herein.<br /><br />All of this is not to say that there is not much of value in this work.  It is just that the insights and understanding that Kriyananda has of yoga are eclipsed by the intent of his religious message, a message primarily intended for the resident students of his Ananda Village near Nevada City, California.<br /><br />Instead of this book, as always I would recommend Iyengar's Light on Yoga for the serious student.

Whew!<br />Needless to say neither he nor anyone else can be a cutting edge expert on such a wide range of scientific topics.  The time of the renaissance man is long past.  Science is so complex today that virtually no one can be a world class expert in more than one or two disciplines.  But Malone doesn't need to be a world class expert since his goal here is merely to introduce the general reader to 21 unresolved questions in science.  I think he does a fine job.<br />The chapters are from eight to 13 pages each, just long enough to introduce the subject and outline the various opinions.  Each chapter is concluded with suggestions for further reading.<br />I was especially impressed with his efficient and balanced presentation of string theory in Chapter 20, &quot;How Many Dimensions Are There?&quot;  Malone makes it clear why so many physicists are thrilled with the theory even though it requires at least six addition dimensions that we cannot in any way discern, and even though it has as yet no empirical support.  He also does a nice job of presenting the contending theories about how life began on earth in Chapter 2.  As I was reading that chapter I was suddenly struck with a conception of primitive life forms in a dormant state being formed in dust clouds and the like floating about the universe looking for a fertile place to express themselves, leading to, if conditions are right, intelligence life forms.  The potential of the seed (in the form of a pre-bacterium cell) suddenly appeared to me as amazing, but as a way the universe might work.  My sudden understanding was that the bacterium and the right environment together constitute intelligent life.  Given enough time and a wide enough distribution, the potential becomes the actual; and therefore looking from a large enough perspective, both in terms of time and space, intelligent life may be seen as being built into the universe as a natural development of matter and energy.<br />I also liked his exposition on the Mayan astronomers and some of their accomplishments.  According to Malone, the Mayan culture was only one of  three in human history to have invented the number zero (p. 135), something, for example, the Greeks and Romans were unable to do.  Also impressive was the Mayan calculation of the transit of Venus around the sun, correct to within eight one-hundredths of a day, hundreds of years before Europeans achieved such accuracy.  I also liked the chapter on quantum mechanics in which Malone concentrates on the development of the theory and the personalities involved.<br />I was less impressed with the chapter on dolphin intelligence.  I thought he could have done more with it.  The books he cites are rather old (Couseau (1975), Lilly (1978) along with two newer but more general books).  However Malone's suggestion that learning to interpret the &quot;language&quot; of the dolphins might be a good preparation for deciphering signals from ET's (should such signals ever come) is a wise one.  If we can't understand our fellow creatures on this planet, how can we expect to understand creatures from another, who might be enormously more dissimilar?<br />Malone writes clearly and includes enough in the way of color and insight to keep us interested.  On pages 124-125, for example, he notes that all invertebrate eyes developed from the skin while all vertebrate eyes &quot;are an outgrowth of the animal's brain,&quot; an observation that is particularly relevant to an understanding of ourselves.  His report on the details of a bet between physicists Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking concerning the black hole in Cygus X-1 is amusing.  Hawking, who bet it wouldn't be confirmed as a black hole, conceded the bet in 1990 with a validation by his thumb print.  Also amusing was the story about science fiction writer Cleve Cartmill and his editor at Astounding Science Fiction magazine (John W. Campbell) being investigated by the FBI in 1944 because of Cartmill's short story, &quot;Deadline,&quot; which was about a secret atomic research project code named the &quot;Hudson River Project.&quot;  This was a little too close to the reality of the Manhattan Project for the sensitivities of the FBI!  But it was in fact just a case of fiction imitating life.  (Or is that the other way around?)<br />Malone brings up an interesting philosophic point on page 194 in his discussion of parallel universes. If all possible outcomes of our every action exist in other universes, &quot;Does it really matter, then, what we do?&quot;  In other words, why bother trying if what we do will be done (and not done) anyway?  To which it might be answered, &quot;But it's OUR universe.&quot;<br />Overall the weakness of the book and its strength are one in the same: a brevity that both annoys and inspires us to further reading.tails of a bet between physicists Kip Thorne and Steven Hawking concerning the black hole in Cygus X-1 is amusing.

1391874:US	49786731	R1HKJXJFXV2M4D	0967266009	239844220	Life Teachings: Raising a Child	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Wise and attractive	This is a beautifully designed and presented little book.  There are 35 \\"teachings,\\" each two, three or four pages long.  Pullen's tone is conversational and measured.  Her thesis is an important one: be involved with raising your children and be aware of what you are doing and why.<br />My feeling has always been that kids grow up in spite of their parents and they can overcome some fairly poor parenting, although things like physical and mental abuse, alcoholism and drug addiction can be devastating.  Sometimes it is the adverse circumstances of the larger society that make things difficult for the kids, poverty in particular.  But that should be no justification for neglect.  Many of us were too busy with our careers and finding ourselves to be the perfect parents we would like to have been.  Pullen was not.  Apparently she had the sense to realize from the very beginning that parenting was a full time job, one that required self-examination and logic as well as love.<br />So she has written this book telling us how she did it and as a guide.  For the young person who reads this book and is inspired to be an involved and conscientious parent, Pullen's efforts will be justified because virtually everything in the book amounts to good advice, some of it very telling and valuable.  I particularly liked the idea of talking things out and being open and logical about everything as much as possible.  This helps both child and parent.  (Sometimes it is the parent who is operating under a false premiss or two that will be exposed on verbalization!)<br />I also liked Pullen's insistence that logic and emotion are both important considerations in what we do, and that we should be aware of that.  Even little things can be important if only because they add up.  For example, Pullen and her husband would say, when money was scarce, not that we \\"can't afford it,\\" but rather there is \\"No money right now\\" a subtle but psychologically important difference. (p. 53)<br />My favorite teaching was teaching number 25, in which Pullen tells her girls to listen for the urgency in a person's tone of voice.  My first thought was that children don't need to be taught that.  They can hear it!  But upon reflection I realized that what Pullen is doing is making something that is largely unconscious and automatic full of awareness and deliberate.  In this way the child might develop a superior ability to listen.  This \\"teaching\\" is typical of Pullen's well-thought out methods.<br />Being the incorrigible cynic that I sometimes am, however, after a few chapters I found myself looking for instances of inadvertent self-revelation on the part of the very careful Mrs. Pullen.  Somehow she was beginning to remind me of the lovable but all too precise Clifton Webb of Cheaper by the Dozen (1950).  I took some small delight in copyreading as I went along, but I found only two typos (\\"quite\\" for \\"quiet\\" on page 23 and a \\"neither-or\\" that should be a \\"neither-nor\\" on page 65), and only one sentence that might be recast, the inverted for no apparent reason first sentence on page 98.  I did find a slew of hyphens posing as em dashes on pages 4, 14, 15, 22, 30, 31, 49, 62, 73(2), 92, 106, and 109 which I am hereby pleased to point out so that she may have the opportunity of correcting them in a future edition. (Grin.)<br />While this is an excellent book as it is, I would (naturally!) like to offer the following small suggestions:<br />Interesting would be a candid critique of their parents' upbringing techniques by the two girls, Lara and Julie.  I have no doubt that it would be highly positive; however one suspects they may have a joke or two to share.  To Pullen's credit she does (slyly or inadvertently, I'm not sure which) share something like that with us in the chapter on her fears.  She is afraid of snakes, but she did not want to transfer that fear to her girls, so she did everything she could to avoid appearing afraid when once in a while a snake would appear.  Naturally we know that she could not completely hide her fear from her children who would also recognize that she was pretending not to be afraid.  We can see this in the way she has Lara announce \\"with wonderment and curiosity in her voice, Mommy, there is a snake by your legs!\\" (p. 58)  Or, on the next page where at the supermarket, Lara leans close to mom and whispers in her ear, \\"Mommy, there is a great big rabbit behind you!\\" (A man in a rabbit's outfit.)  Pullen ends the chapter with, \\"She never comments on the animals until they are very close to me.\\"<br />(Just as children sometimes tell little lies that parents overlook, leaving the child to believe the lie worked, sometimes children pass over their parents' eccentricities or even outright faults with only the most gentle satire.)<br />I also think it would be good to spell out the \\"particular way\\" Lara's math teacher insisted that the long division work be shown. (p. 63)  I also would like to know what happened to the Himalayan Jack Rabbit!<br />Bottom line: this is a wise and inspirational little book that you might want to buy for someone expecting their first child.pear.

There is no antidote and no vaccine.  Unless some miracle occurs millions will die.  This is a doomsday scenario as ripe as fallen fruit, and as poisonously possible as an Osama bin Laden daydream.<br />Beck Casey, ex-CIA bioweapons expert, is the central character.  His specialty is the social and political consequences of bioterrorism.  He's primarily a historian who knows how people will behave during a murderous epidemic.  Because he wrote an expert's book on the subject, he is called in by the President to help deal with the unprecedented emergency.  The virus, an altered form of the Spanish flu that killed 40 million people in 1918, has broken out in the panhandle area of Florida and in Moscow.  Russian President Putin, in a desperate attempt to stop the spread of the virus, has ordered the gassing of people in his affected area.  The death toll will be in the hundreds of thousands.  (The Russians look as bad here as they did in spy novels during the Cold War.)<br />The US President is as yet planning no such draconian measure, but when news of the horrific response by the Russians breaks in the press, the US populace is thrown into panic.  Marshal law is declared.  A large area around the Florida panhandle is quarantined and all public forms of transportation are halted.  Gas is severely rationed, shooting the black market price up to something like twenty dollars a gallon.  There is rioting in the streets and the national guard is called out.  Those trying to escape the quarantined areas are shot.  The Center for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health and every other agency of the federal government, including the CIA and the FBI are directed to work toward finding the persons responsible, controlling the populace, and developing a vaccine.<br />And this is just day one.<br />Merkel paints a vivid portrait of what a bioterrorist attack might be like, and he gives a plausible rationale for who did it and why.  Although rightly billed as a medical thriller, this is also very much an espionage thriller.  There are double agents, CIA \\"spooks,\\" militia crazies, jet fighter pilots, ex-KGB thugs, psychopathic killers, straight-shooting FBI agents, doctors, politicians, heads of state and a stray congressman or two all intensely involved in this worse case scenario.<br />Although there are a number of female characters, one an FBI agent, another a doctor, and of course Beck's ex-wife and daughter, this is a mass market novel with the emphasis on action and intrigue that will appeal primarily to men.  Most of the characters, as is typical in this genre, lack psychological depth, but not all.  Merkel is especially good with the villainous ones--the ruthless, power hungry, Alexi; the sadistic super professional master of torture, Ilya; and the loony toon, Cappie, are the most intriguing.  There are some excellent action sequences that will leave you oblivious to your surroundings as your eyes race along the lines of text.<br />Merkel's vision is also provocative in the questions it raises about the morality and efficacy of torture (if there's a vaccine somewhere, do you torture people to get to it?) and about the sorts of unimaginable trade offs our leaders may have to make in dealing with terrorism (do you opt for millions dead to prevent tens of millions from dying?).<br />The narrative is professional, always in control and focused: the book reads easily and compels our interest with just the right amount of characterization, suspense and interesting dialogue.  It is carefully plotted and very well edited.  The proofreading is also first rate.  It is well researched and contains an ample amount of what I call \\"psychological veracity\\" so that the events seem real and the characters sound and act real.  A tremendous amount of work went into this book.<br />Bottom line: this is a page turner with a fine authentic feel.  Can a Hollywood production be far behind?is well researched and contains an ample amount of what I call \\"psychological veracity\\" so that the events seem real and the characters sound and act real.

1402036:US	49786731	R2FFF561SOLIAJ	0385479425	943694891	Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty	Books	5	179	207	N	N	Readable, exciting, persuasive	The Survival of the Prettiest is an eminently readable, wisdom-filled, witty and very well-documented report on the human concept and experience of beauty and its utility, especially human beauty, or the perceived lack thereof.  It is an example of a way of looking at ourselves that is becoming increasingly of value, both in terms of the insights it affords, and in the way it frees us from the muddled delusions of the past.  This point of view is from the fledgling science of evolutionary psychology of which Professor Etcoff is a very persuasive spokesperson and practitioner.<br /><br />\\"Pretty is as pretty does\\" and \\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,-that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\\" (Keats) are two widely differing attitudes toward beauty, but each in its way contains an essence of truth.  However, rather than bring these or other presuppositions to what Etcoff has to say (as some readers have), I suggest we actually read what she has to say, and then draw our conclusions.  What I predict will happen is that even the most ardent beauty-phobe will find something of value and enlightenment here.<br /><br />Unfortunately (and understandably) not all readers have been able to approach the subject with an open mind.  I noticed that an anonymous \\"reader\\" brought anorexia and bulimia into the discussion and blamed the rise in their instance on \\"media images\\" of beauty.  No doubt media images are partly to blame (if indeed these disorders have become more prevalent).  But it is more likely that the apparent rise in anorexia and bulimia is the result of the fact that the counseling professions now recognize that these eating disorders exist.  In the past the symptoms had no commonly agreed upon locus such as \\"anorexia\\" or \\"bulimia\\" to adhere to, so we really do not know how prevalent they were.  But more important in terms of being a public health problem is the enormous increase in obesity in this country, now often identified as an eating disorder due to \\"carbohydrate intolerance.\\"  The numbers of obese Americans hugely overwhelms the number of anorexics and bulimics, and obesity can hardly be blamed on \\"media images.\\"  We can point to the \\"super-sizing\\" of fast food dispensers if we want to fix blame.  However--and this is one of Etcoff's important points--it is not the media or advertizing that is primarily responsible for our perceptions of beauty (or our tendency to eat too much), but an inborn, predisposition that has proven adaptive in the past that makes us find some people pretty and some others not so pretty.<br /><br />Another \\"reader\\" claimed that Etcoff did not consider ideas of beauty in other cultures.  That is incorrect, as anybody who has read the book knows.  She devotes considerable ink to standards and ideals of beauty in cultures around the world and her observation is that ideals of beauty tend to be culture specific; that is, Ache tribesmen find their women and women of a neighboring tribe more attractive than European women.  Indeed Etcoff reports that Asians typically find European and African noses not attractive because they are too large.  Ache tribesmen actually made fun of the Caucasian anthropologists calling them \\"pyta puku, meaning longnose.\\" (p. 139)  Etcoff concluded that there were differences in standards of beauty, but that there were also similarities, and she goes into considerable depth detailing the studies.  (See especially Chapter Five, \\"Feature Presentation.\\")<br /><br />Etcoff is also criticized for her many literary quotes, references and allusions.  But to my discernment they are a strength of the book and not a weakness.  A very important part of our understanding of human nature comes not from the relatively new knowledge called science but from religion and literature.  Etcoff is doubly wise to reference what great writers, statesmen and religions leaders have said about our ideas of beauty, first because what they say is worth knowing, and second because they express themselves so well.  The anonymous reviewer who claimed to be a scientist perhaps ought to expand his or her reading to include wisdom from other sources, as has Etcoff.  I just wish half of the writers writing today were one half as eloquent and readable as is Etcoff; and I'd settle for one-quarter as wise.<br /><br />One of the significant things that this book does is to show that evolutionary psychology, despite the beliefs of its critics (and even that of some of its practitioners), is not limited to using insights from biological evolution alone, but from cultural evolution as well.  Etcoff's book is a splendid example of this wiser, broader, synergistically more powerful employment.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"ess themselves so well.

What science writer Marcus Chown does especially well is to excite our imagination about what might be possible in light of what we now know or think we know.<br /><br />This is not, however a book to give comfort to mainstream physicists.  Chown's emphasis is on minority report notions including parallel universes, invisible universes, time travel, universes created by super-intelligent beings, extra dimensions, and the like.  His technique is to introduce the ideas of maverick scientists (e.g., Max Tegmark, Edward Harrison, David Stevenson, etc.) and, where possible, meld them with the ideas of more established scientists.  He avoids (I think) the impossible while concentrating on the exciting.<br /><br />Since most of the ideas presented in this book are of the \\"not likely to be proven any time soon\\" variety, I would like to give them a kind of aesthetic grade just for fun and as a way to show you what the book is about.<br /><br />First, the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, an idea championed by physicist David Deutsch in his book, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes-and Its Implications (1997).  Grade: A+.  This is a beautiful notion that expands the mind wonderfully.  A entire new universe with every tick of the quantum!  Mind-boggling in the extreme, yet eye-opening in the sense that by contemplating such an amazement, we might have a better idea of the thought of infinity.  (Personally, though, I prefer in everyday life, the Copenhagen interpretation.)<br /><br />Second, the idea of parallel universes (a possibility that can be  independent of the many worlds interpretation of QM).  Grade: A-.  Too easy by itself to imagine.  But what gives it elegance is the underlying question that it begs: what is the nature of reality?  \\"Where\\" do these parallel universes reside?  Is \\"where\\" really a meaningful concept?  Do we have any idea of what \\"where\\" really means?<br /><br />Third, time travel backwards based on an imploding universe headed for crunch time.  Grade: C.  My problem is the \\"so what\\" nature of this idea.  Clearly it is not supposed that broken cups and scrambled eggs will go a-mending and unscrambling as time moves backwards as in a movie run in reverse.<br /><br />Fourth, time travel based on worm holes, etc.  Grade C+.  I like the idea that somewhere else (as we emerge from the worm hole) is also some other time, but I just don't see in my wildest imaginings how we might control our destination, either in terms of where or when.<br /><br />Fifth, time travel that avoids the grandfather paradox by having the changes take effect in parallel universes.  Grade: A.  This really is a nice answer to both the paradoxes and the salient question that Stephen Hawking asked, \\"Where are the tourists?\\" (from the future).  Incidentally, time travel into the future is no problem logically in this world.  It just takes time. (Ha!)  It is time travel to the past that leads to all the logical and conceptional problems.<br /><br />Sixth: Invisible universes. Grade: D-.  If they can in some way affect our visible universe, make that a C.  Invisible universes that we cannot become aware of in any way are effectively speaking not much different than parallel universes.<br /><br />Seventh: the idea that black holes \\"explode\\" or bud out into a new universe elsewhere.  Grade: A.  Although this is about as close to an untestable idea as one can imagine, it has a beautiful symmetry to it that is infectious.  Our universe itself could be the result of such a budding out.<br /><br />Eighth: the idea that universes propagate by given birth to new universes, either through black holes or some other manner.  Grade: B.  What I like about this idea is the suggestion of infinity, one universe leads to another to another, etc., etc., truly mind-exploding!  What I don't like is the somewhat biological taint.  Testability?  (Grin.)<br /><br />Ninth: the idea that there are dark planets in interstellar space teeming with life.  Grade: A+.  Eminently reasonable.  I predict this idea will become a common assumption in a few years.  The impetus for this idea is the fairly recent realization here on earth of just how common life is, underground, at the bottom of deep ocean trenches, that does not rely on photosynthesis.  This is also an idea that could conceivably, even in my lifetime, find some empirical support.<br /><br />Tenth: panspermia (from Chandra Wickramasinghe and Fred Hoyle), or the idea that the origin of life is extraterrestrial.  Grade: A.  This is also eminently reasonable and likely to be given some support before too long (if it is true).  This really is the most likely idea in the book.<br /><br />Eleven: alien garbage, or the notion that artifacts from ET's are littering up interstellar space and some of those artifacts have hit the earth and are under our feet.  Grade C-.  I have several problems with this, mainly that I think the amount of debris is a huge overestimate, primarily because I don't think the superior technicians envisioned would be as careless as radio astronomer Alexey Arkhipov seems to think.<br /><br />I could go on but better you should read Chown's book and do your own grading.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an entertaining excursion up to and over the edge of the known.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\"n.)<br /><br />Ninth: the idea that there are dark planets in interstellar space teeming with life.

Deutsch buys the \\"many worlds\\" theory of quantum mechanics big time, and I love that interpretation; however I don't care for the way he insists that the existence of parallel universes is an established fact.  He is original to say the least and definitely worth reading, although some of the chapters are a little beyond my reach (and beyond his too, I might observe).<br />But forget about the book.  What is really interesting is the reaction to the book!  The ... thread of \\"reviews,\\" rants, hurrahs, etc. contains over eighty opinions.  (This is the ... reviewer system at its best, performing a public service not possible to this extent anywhere else.)  Some of the opinions, due to their authoritative expression, are obviously by actual physicists who understandably decline to identify themselves, not wanting to damage their career or reputation by becoming embroiled an argument about a \\"tainted\\" semi-scientific book.  One of these people (\\"a reader\\") ended his piece with the assertion that Deutsch's book was \\"virtually worthless.\\"  That can hardly be the case if the book has induced him and many others to write about it.<br />Obviously, the people reading Deutsch are not exactly idiots and comparing his book to Worlds in Collision (as one reviewer did) was probably unfair.  I also kept an informal \\"score,\\" counting both reviewers and helpful and unhelpful votes.  Clearly those who like the book and think it is a significant contribution to scientific progress are in the minority.<br />Deutsch's book, however, is valuable to the extent that it expands our minds and points to the majestic expanse of the universe (or multiverse, if you like).  It is not enough to say that, for example, numbers are infinite.  This bit of verbal knowledge does nothing to bring us any closer to the idea of infinity.  But to imagine that an entire universe--consisting of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each containing billions and billions (hi, Carl Sagan) of stars, quasars and black holes out as far as we can see--comes into being with each twitch of the quantum, frees the mind magnificently and gives us just a bare hint of what terms like \\"infinity\\" really mean.<br />Like Deutsch I used to prefer the many worlds interpretation of QM to the orthodox, mainly for the way it frees the mind; but also because I was not able to fully appreciate Bohr's point of view.  It is only in recent years that I feel I \\"understand\\" the Copenhagen interpretation and now prefer it.  Simply put the whereabouts of an electron or other quantum is indetermined until it is actually \\"observed,\\" at which time the wave function is said to collapse.  I like to compare this to the action at the roulette tables.  Where the bouncing ball will land (not where it is, of course) while the wheel is in spin is indetermined until the ball finally settles and the wheel stops.  The ball falls (collapses) into a particular slot.  This is \\"only\\" an analogy (clearly a false one in a deterministic universe), but aside from mathematics, there is no other way to talk about the world of the quantum, which is beyond our intuition.<br />One of the critics of this book pointed out that no matter how many times you explain that if a woman has two children and one of them is a boy, the probability that the other is a boy is 75%, people just don't get it.  This smug self-satisfaction needs a bit of adjustment, I believe.  In the first place (just to be rigorously scientific) the probability that a woman with one child has a boy is actually slightly greater than fifty percent at birth since about 105 to 100 live births are males.  In the womb shortly after conception the probability is even greater.  Most natural miscarriages miscarry males.  If the woman in question is Indian or Chinese the probability is even greater that the child is a boy.  If the woman is in her eighties and the \\"child\\" is alive, it is probably female!<br />Now to the pristine probability question, which could be alternately stated this way: You flipped a coin twice.  One of those flips was a head.  What is the probability that the other was also a head?  The key (and misleading to our minds) phrase is \\"one of them was.\\" Which one?  If you identify precisely the first one, or the second one, then the seeming paradox collapses and the probability of the other one being heads becomes fifty percent.  It is the indeterminate statement that paradoxically increases the probability because (although it seems otherwise) when we say \\"one of them was\\" what we are actually saying is:<br />\\"Here are three sets of events: HH HT TT (or BB BG GG).  I am referring to them in such a way as to eliminate the possibility that one of these events could be true, namely the event TT (or GG).  From the events left, what is the probability that one of possible flips is a head (or a girl)?\\"<br />Since three out of four of the possibilities are heads (HH HT), and each has the same likelihood of occurring, the answer is indeed 75%.<br />Not explaining this slipperiness of language is the sort of thing that Deutsch also regrettably often fails to do, and for that reason his book reads, in part, like the enthusiastic musings of a very talented, imaginative high school physics student.  On the other hand, some of those who anonymously accuse him of deliberately misleading the public may be jealous of his literary success.eighties and the \\"child\\" is alive, it is probably female!<br />Now to the pristine probability question, which could be alternately stated this way: You flipped a coin twice.

He knows that big corporations typically have a fleet of PR people scurrying about trying to manage the media. He notes that in 1996 Microsoft had an estimated 500 PR people, Time Warner had 300. (p. 112) Although it would seem that Time Warner ought to be more media savvy than Microsoft, Mathis's point is, who has more money and how do you think they got it? According to Mathis, part of the reason that Windows 95 swamped IBM's OS/2 is that Bill Gates and company did a much better job of managing the media (p. 113)<br />Mathis also knows that CEOs lie awake nights dreaming of schemes to seduce the media, to get some of that FREE publicity that is better than any kind of advertising. In this book he tells them how.<br />Mathis's formula caricatures the media into a dumb beast that can be controlled (the clever cartoons by Eric Garcia of the \\"beast\\" nicely augment the text), and presents sound-byte advice in twelve chapters each with a media \\"rule\\": keep it \\"simple\\"; make it \\"easy\\"; infuse it with \\"emotion\\"; make it \\"different\\"; be \\"prepared\\" (anticipate obvious questions and have snappy quips at the ready); \\"repeat,\\" etc. He peppers his prose with lively examples, funny asides, and pithy illustrations. He recalls such media coups as the brilliant \\"planned spontaneity\\" of US soccer star Brandi Chastain who stripped to her black sports bra after kicking the winning goal against China at the 1999 World Cup championship. And he notes lost opportunities as when Dan Quayle got ambushed by Lloyd Bensen in a debate with the memorable, \\"Senator Quayle, I knew Jack Kennedy...and you, sir, are no Jack Kennedy.\\" Mathis suggests that had Quayle been better prepared he might have come back with, \\"You're right, Mr. Benson. I've been faithful to my wife.\\" (p. 96)<br />This is a media book lively enough to keep a tired CEO awake during an all-nighter to Singapore and uplifting enough to give encouragement to the depressed PR director of a sewage company. The Beast, according to Mathis in the opening chapter is \\"Handicapped, Hungry, Harried, and Human\\" In Chapter Six we find that the beast also has \\"Heartburn.\\" And how does he spell relief?: \\"E-a-s-y,\\" as in, make things easy for the beast. (pp. 113-114)<br />Reporters are characterized as underpaid, under-educated (p. 11), overworked, and not entirely bright, particularly with numbers and complex stories (see pages 73 and 76). Indeed, Mathis, an ex-reporter himself, does a little reporter bashing along the way just to make those CEOs and PR guys he's addressing feel confident. He warns against the liberal bias of the media, noting that reporters \\"tend to think they are smarter, more worldly, and, in general, more enlightened than the rest of us.\\" (p. 21) I guess Mathis ought to know. But what he doesn't say is that the liberal bias of the reporters is overshadowed by the conservative bias of the owners. (Guess which slant wins out.) He doesn't mention this because he believes that it doesn't matter. The people you need to get to are the reporters. You need to know their prejudices, their needs. And Mathis knows them well. Here's his take on the need for simplicity:<br />\\"News reporters have one primary function--to simplify. A reporter can be brilliant. He can be a proficient grammarian and a dogged investigator. He can be a master of eloquence and wit. But if he cannot simplify, he might as well become a veterinarian.\\" (p. 67)<br />Your job, as Mathis sees it, however, is to make sure the reporter simplifies it in a way that makes you look good. Therefore you simplify your message for the reporter! I see this as an example of something I've always stressed: you have to guide the experts. They may be experts--doctors, lawyers, reporters, etc.--but you're the one who really cares, so you have to guide them.<br />Although this is a fine piece of work, I do have a couple of suggestions. One, Mathis needs a chapter on \\"the rule of entertainment.\\" The beast likes to be entertained and more to the point, the beast needs to be entertaining to stay in business. Also Mathis's take on why we so often \\"hear and see bland, boring comments\\" in the media (p. 57) despite his injunction to make it emotional, is not quite right. He recalls Crash Davis from the baseball movie Bull Durham (1988) telling Nuke LaLoosh to \\"learn your clich&eacute;s.\\" Mathis's position is that ball players should avoid the clich&eacute;s and say something lively and emotive instead. He laments that politicians are particularly guilty of saying the bland and ordinary. But the reason politicians typically speak as vacuously as possible is that they don't dare say anything lively that can be used against them or be vividly recalled later on when they change their mind. And Crash had it right because ball players have a higher loyalty than gaining publicity for themselves. (Or at least they need to pretend they have.) They need to NOT stand out. They need to be part of a TEAM that cares not for personal glory but just wants to take them \\"one at a time\\" and get a \\"W.\\"<br />I have no doubt that this book will be valuable to everyone from small business owners to the top execs at Fortune 500 companies who want to improve their ability to manage media. If I had the wherewithal and the need, I'd hire Mathis on the spot. His \\"recipe\\" is easy once you understand it, and rest assured, by the time you finish this well presented, eminently readable, entertaining and timely book, you will understand the beast, at least publicity wise..

Cain novels that you can read in an hour with one hand tied behind your back.<br /><br />Let me try that again.  This is another of those James M. Cain novels that you can read in an hour without breaking a sweat.<br /><br />Okay, how's this?  This is another of those James M. Cain novels that you can read in an hour even if you're the kind of person who moves your lips when you read.<br /><br />This is not to imply that Cain is the kind of writer who mixes his metaphors or hasn't gotten beyond primer prose.  I mean, Shakespeare mixed his metaphors.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that if Cain wrote literature then it was by accident.  Come to think of it, Shakespeare was only trying to turn a shilling, please a patron or give an actor some range.  I guess real literature comes about when you're just trying to make ends meet and somehow you get inspired and don't even know it.<br /><br />Cain didn't think much of this, calling it something like tripe and saying it would never be published as a book.  He wrote it to appear as a serial in Redbook magazine, but Redbook rejected it so it appeared in Liberty magazine in 1935.  It didn't make hardcover until the forties just before it was made into an excellent movie by Hollywood great Billy Wilder starring Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson.  In fact, to be honest, the movie is better than the book, which as everyone knows, is usually not the case.<br /><br />He also wrote this to take advantage of the surprising success of his first novel, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1934), which Knopf published to critical acclaim on its way to bestsellerdom.  Cain's stream-lined and hard-boiled faux Hemingway style charmed the critics and made the dime novel reader feel like he was reading Nathanael West or maybe F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Re-reading Cain's first person narrative today is a lot like watching a movie from the forties, mainly because the movies so often imitated him with their film noir voice-overs and desperate crimes for love or money.  Indeed a number of Cain's novels have been made into movies, Double Indemnity, Postman, and Mildred Pierce, the most memorable.<br /><br />Here we have a painstakingly planned murder for the insurance money.  It is so perfectly conceived that it would take a miracle for everything to fall into place.  And yet it does, and yet something goes wrong.  In the Wilder movie, insurance salesman Walter Neff (Walter Huff here) does it mostly out of an irresistible desire to put something over on the insurance business he has worked at all his adult life, while here in Cain's novel, Huff explains his motivation to Phyllis Nirdlinger, sociopathic wife of the intended victim: \\"Just pulling off some piker job, that don't interest me.  But this, hitting it for the limit, that's what I go for.  It's all I go for.\\"<br /><br />He means that the \\"accident\\" has to take place on a train so that they can collect a double indemnity from a standard clause in the policy.  Today's amoralist might proclaim that he did it for the rush of doing something almost nobody ever got away with.<br /><br />My problem with the novel is not the convenient way everything fell into place, or with how unlikely it was that Keyes might figure what he figured out, but with the stupid ending.  You've got to read it to believe it, actually.  Billy Wilder changed the ending in the movie to something more plausible.  He, along with Raymond Chandler, who worked on the script with him, actually improved on the Cain novel in several places.  As in Postman, Cain's antihero does his dirty work from the back of the car while the wife drives and the victim rides shotgun.  (The contrivance needed to get him into the back seat strains credence but Wilder fixes that.)  In truth, Cain was right: this novel needed a little work.  He does NOT, however, repeat the sexual \\"celebration\\" beside the car after the murder in Postman, a scene that so shockeddepression era readers.  Indeed, here the two murderers are already beginning to sour on one another.<br /><br />What Cain does so well is to probe into our dark psyches and to let loose the dogs of dirty deeds done dumb so that we might experience vicariously the hell they might lead to.  Notable in the novel is the character of Phyllis, an ex-nurse with the psychopathic mind of a serial killer.  That part was played down in the movie.  In the movie Cain's antihero is given human dimension through the mutual affection he has with Keyes.  In the novel that affection is muted, but Cain humanizes him by showing the sincere, but hands off, love he has for the dead man's 19-year-old daughter.<br /><br />It's worth reading this to compare it to the movie and to see how two great screenwriters (Wilder and Chandler) handle material from a novel.  It is also worth reading for the snapshot of pre-World War II Los Angeles afforded.  Of course any true film noir fan or student of American lit ought not to miss this.  I suggest however that you write your own ending.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Novels and other Fictions\\"depression era readers.

Clearly the emphasis is on biology and the brain. No doubt something will happen in the next fifty years that will make Brockman's eminently reasonable choice of scientists seem improperly skewed; yet it is just this baseline of expectation that will allow us to compare. (By \\"us\\" I mean those, not myself, who will be alive fifty years from now!)<br />The truth is, something always happens that surprises us. To extrapolate from present trends to future actualities is to be assured that we will miss something. That \\"something\\" is by its very nature unpredictable. Nuclear energy is an example. No nineteenth century physicist could have predicted the atomic bomb. Go back further in time and no one could have predicted electrical appliances or the telephone. Before photography and electricity, the idea of television was next to impossible.<br />On the other hand some developments are not only predictable but have been foreseen. These include airplanes and rockets to the moon, submarines and motor cars. These are examples of new technology being predicted from existing technology. Some of what is written about in these 25 essays by imminent scientists is of this order: an extrapolation of current trends and technology to a time fifty years in the future. What will we know and what will we have developed by then? is the question being addressed in this fascinating collection.<br />In a sense what these essays do is the near equivalent of what science fiction has done for us in the past. Evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller puts this idea in a slightly different way with this observation: \\"A century ago, we had to rely on the novels of Henry James to portray human consciousness in high-resolution detail and rich-spectrum color. In the future, we won't be able to rely on mass culture to do that--Viacom and Disney don't see the profit in it. But we may be able to turn to science to fill the void.\\" (p. 87)<br />What makes this collection so effective and such an informed pleasure to read is the discipline specificity made possible because the ideas are coming from 25 individual directions. Developmental psychologist Paul Bloom, for example, sees the need for \\"a theory of moral development...informed by work across disciplines, including cognitive psychology and evolutionary theory.\\" (p. 81) But he isn't optimistic. \\"It may be that the nature of moral thought or consciousness is simply beyond our understanding...We might be like dogs trying to understand calculus.\\" (p. 82)<br />Dissimilarly John H. Holland believes that \\"The number one priority on a fifty-year scale is bringing Earth's human population down to a value more in line with renewable resources. Some of our most serious large-scale problems--inadequate food production, forest depletion, global warming, energy shortages--are traceable to a surplus of humans relative to resources.\\" (p. 178) I also like his retrospective observation on pages 176-177, \\"By the mid-twenty-first century, much of medicine as it was practiced in the latter part of the twentieth century--for example, using surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation to treat cancer--will look as ineffective as the bloodletting of earlier centuries.\\"<br />A startling view is that of AI expert Rodney Brooks in his very interesting essay, \\"The Merger of Flesh and Machines.\\" He believes \\"there will be an alteration in our view of ourselves as a species; we will begin to see ourselves as simply a part of the infrastructure of industry.\\" (p. 191)<br />In contrast is computer scientist Jaron Lanier's reaction to the idea of \\"an inevitable singularity, which is expected sometime in the next half century.\\" (An idea I first encountered from L.A. futurist John Smart in association with the ideas of Ray Kurzweil.) \\"This singularity would occur when computers become so wise and powerful that they not only displace humans as the dominant form of life but also attain mastery over matter and energy so as to live in what might be described as a mythic or godlike way, completely beyond human conception. While it feels odd even to type the previous sentence, it is an accurate description of the beliefs of many of my colleagues.\\" (p. 217)<br />Brockman provides a short bio for each scientist at the end of each essay along with a mention of some of their works. After reading psychologist Nancy Etcoff's lucid and penetrating essay, \\"Brain Scans, Wearables, and Brief Encounters,\\" I have been inspired to read her Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty, a book I have twice (inexplicitly) passed over. What really sold me on Dr. Etcoff are the following insightful quotes under the subheading \\"Freud Moves Out; Darwin Moves In\\" (pp. 283-286):<br />\\"The practice of psychotherapy will be reoriented from a focus on disease to a focus on vulnerabilities, from symptoms to adaptive defenses....\\"<br />\\"The energy, creativity, and charisma associated with mild mania may offer a fitness advantage to some people with the disorder, or to other people in whom the genes do not cause the disorder but have the beneficial effects.\\"<br />\\"Certain symptoms will suggest design trade-offs prompted by mismatches between the present environment and the ancestral one, or simply exaggerated normal defenses.\\"<br />\\"Mild depression may serve the adaptive function of conserving resources in times of hardship, signaling others that help is needed, and allowing time for reassessment of goals. Mild depression may also be a sign of submission when the individual cannot or does not wish to oppose the hierarchy.\\"<br />Concluding, let me say that by projecting from the present we may anticipate the future, but we may also more clearly understand the present.vitable singularity, which is expected sometime in the next half century.\\" (An idea I first encountered from L.A. futurist John Smart in association with the ideas of Ray Kurzweil.) \\"This singularity would occur when computers become so wise and powerful that they not only displace humans as the dominant form of life but also attain mastery over matter and energy so as to live in what might be described as a mythic or godlike way, completely beyond human conception.

In this extraordinary work ecologist Stuart Pimm plays bio-accountant and gives us the bottom line on our planet's resources, how we are spending them and how much is left.<br />There are approximately 130 million square kilometers of land surface producing an average of about 1,000 tons of biomass a year.  Of this 130 billion tons we use 42% (60 billion tons) for food, grazing, wood for building and burning, etc.  Pimm's comment is \\"Man eats Planet! Two-Fifths Already Gone!\\" (Chapter 6).<br />Professor Pimm also audits the ocean and gives us similar bottom-line figures.  He explains how he gets the information, how he collates it and how his various sources agree and don't agree.  He is in the field and on the ocean, floating down Amazon rivers and flying over the African veldt.  He recalls the land before industrialization and tells us how it has changed.  He tells the story of the great American westward expansion and what that expansion did to the forests and the prairies.  He recalls the tragedy of Easter Island.  Pimm writes in a witty and fascinating style that makes the dry numbers come alive and sparkle like fish in incandescent water.  One gets the sense in reading him that here is somebody who knows what he is talking about, somebody who has worked hard to understand how the planet's various systems work, and what is happening to them because of human consumption and waste.  His tone is balanced and calm and conversational.  He appears to have no axes to grind, no favorites to play.  Although he claims in the Prologue that his book is \\"unashamedly optimistic\\" (p. 8), the implications of the numbers he presents are nonetheless alarming.<br />For example, Pimm reports that our population has nearly doubled since 1970 but the amount of cropland has only increased from 14 million square kilometers to 15.  He notes that \\"Agriculture feeds far more people from almost the same area of land.\\"  He adds, \\"In this statistic, eternally optimistic Panglossians see continuing progress that allows us to push the envelope of our environmental constraints.  In the same statistic, worried Cassandras notice the constraints on the area of croplands that prevent it from expanding with our growing population.\\" (p. 106)<br />He notes that virtually all of the best cropland is already being used, but not necessarily for cultivation.  A significant percentage is under the concrete and asphalt of our cities.  Furthermore the drier lands in places like California's central valleys, the soils are quickly becoming salinized by irrigation so that they yield less and less per acre.  In some place the salt content from irrigation of the soil is too high for food plants to grow.  All over the world this problem exists and as Pimm notes there is no solution in sight.  The croplands that benefit from rainwater, that is, water that is distilled by the water cycle, do not turn salty, but the amount of that land is strictly limited and shrinking because of urban sprawl.<br />Pimm uses a party metaphor to highlight the situation.  Some guests he says pick out the cashews from the bowl of mixed nuts.  \\"Not for them the lowly sunflower seeds, still in their husks...The high-graders who...[got the cashews] are now demanding the even more expensive Macadamia nuts.  The doorbell is ringing, announcing the arrival of more guests...\\" (p. 107)<br />Pimm also looks at the fisheries and what affect our fishing has on them.  His conclusion: \\"Humanity does not use all of the oceans' production, but what we do use is already enough to damage the oceans, seriously and perhaps permanently. (p. 127)  He also notes that without government subsidies, in places like Canada, Russia, the US, Japan and Europe, fishing on a large scale would be impossible because it no longer pays.  In Johannesburg where there is a world wide conference on ecology taking place as I write this, one of the main topics is how farm and fishing subsidies in first world countries are keeping the farmers and fishermen in third world countries poor.  Food prices are kept artificially low so that African and Asian farmers cannot compete in the marketplace.  That is one (unintended, one would hope) consequence of subsidies, but another is that the intense use of land and sea are rapidly reducing the yields, in some cases to the point of no return.<br />The land and the ocean are the first two parts of the book.  In part three, on biodiversity, Pimm sheds some light on taxonomy and how difficult it is to count species.  In an Epilogue, he addresses solutions and his hope for the future.  Pimm is optimistic.  I wish I could be.  But until we feel the pain of lost resources, and actually have to give up some of our comfort, I don't think anything substantial is going to be done toward the avowed goal of sustained growth.  (Actually, I think \\"sustained growth\\" may be an oxymoron dreamed up by some transnational corporations to excuse their continued pillaging of the planet's resources.)  At any rate, humans act out of necessity.  By the time the real necessity kicks in for most of the first world, much of the planet's resources will be gone.<br />The good news though, according to Pimm, is that most of those resources are renewable.  The forests of the Eastern US have largely returned (without much of their animal wildlife or flora diversity, I must point out) and while the wild salmon may go the way of the dodo, there will be farm salmon, and if we lose the swordfish, there will still be tuna, etc.<br />This is an important book that anyone concerned about the future of our planet should not miss.  It is in a sense fundamental to an understanding of the most important issues facing us today.mers and fishermen in third world countries poor.

In part three, on biodiversity, Pimm sheds some light on taxonomy and how difficult it is to count species.  In an Epilogue, he addresses solutions and his hope for the future.  Pimm is optimistic.  I wish I could be.  But until we feel the pain of lost resources, and actually have to give up some of our comfort, I don't think anything substantial is going to be done toward the avowed goal of sustained growth.  (Actually, I think \\"sustained growth\\" may be an oxymoron dreamed up by some transnational corporations to excuse their continued pillaging of the planet's resources.)  At any rate, humans act out of necessity.  By the time the real necessity kicks in for most of the first world, much of the planet's resources will be gone.<br />The good news though, according to Pimm, is that most of those resources are renewable.  The forests of the Eastern US have largely returned (without much of their animal wildlife or flora diversity, I must point out) and while the wild salmon may go the way of the dodo, there will be farm salmon, and if we lose the swordfish, there will still be tuna, etc.  <br />This is an important book that anyone concerned about the future of our planet should not miss.  It is in a sense fundamental to an understanding of the most important issues facing us today.	2002-09-01

Most of the time he is frantically busy buying and selling, hustling and chasing: dope, women, men, food, drink, clothes, airplanes, money, money and money.  At one point he is making $20,000 a month doing PR for clients and hustling art work.  He spends the money as fast as he makes it; actually sometimes he spends it faster than he makes it.  His adventures include being a male escort, raising money for a film he never makes, stealing his sister's clients, developing his own publicity company, going from go-fer to international broker of fine art, multi-sexual sex gigs, cocaine, snorted and smoked, alcohol, marijuana, and pills, legal and illegal.  If it's to be done, Andy-boy is the man to do it, and now.  He can work sixteen-hour days weeks on end and still find time to roam the streets at three a.m. looking for excitement.  He has so much frightful energy that he can do tasks in hours that would take most people days.  On the other hand he can't sit still--literally.  He says he has no choice, that before the day begins the decisions--to fly to Paris, to engage in marathon sex, to obsessively clean and scrub every square inch of his New York apartment, etc.--are made for him.  He craves excitement and danger, and gets high by giving himself too much work to do, making him afraid he can't finish; and he gets high from shopping sprees where he spends more than he can afford.  He's a madman of energy, an electrifying near genius who used to get off on tearing his hair out by the roots as a kid, who as an adult can't function without half a dozen different drugs pulsating through his veins and a dozen projects juggled between the hangover gloom and three a.m.  He will try anything and anybody.  His mind is superfast and his aggression is always threatening to spill over.  In addition to stealing his sister's clients, he physically assaults her.  When his girl friend of many years finally makes a permanent break from him he stalks her and her boyfriend.  Left alone in someone's apartment for a minute he gets up and frantically goes through the drawers and cabinets.<br />From my point of view the clinical malady that goes by the name of bipolar disorder is a kind of survival strategy: one runs around wildly in the spring and summer when there is something to gain, but when the long shadows of autumn arrive, depression takes over.  One pulls the deer skin up over one's head and lays dormant burning body fat until the snows turn to tinkling streams, and then the mania returns.  Such guys die young, but I am told.  And they cannot help themselves.<br />Andy in particular cannot help himself.  His internal chemistry drives him to extremes.  Sadly, manic depression, like schizophrenia and autism, are seldom if ever cured.  The psychiatric profession prescribes pills, therapies, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), counsels and applies various theories in an effort to treat these disorders.  What it usually comes up with is more pain and suffering.  Behrman's experience is no exception.  His crash and burn experience begins when he is indicted for art forgery.  Thus begins a downward spiral into increased depression, more violent mood swings, and an increasing inability to function economically amid thoughts of suicide.  As the book ends he is taking a regimen of pills that would choke a horse; he has undergone 19 sessions of ECT; his weight at last report was 245 pounds (normal for him would be about 185, so he's sixty pounds overweight).  Whereas once he wasable to work sixteen hour days, now he has trouble leaving his apartment.  Although there is an attempt at a rosy glow as the book ends, it is clear that Andy Behrman is only the shadow of the man he once was.<br />I think all of us can identify to some extent with Behrman's state of mind.  We are all driven at times to overindulgence, to manias of one sort or the other.  We all fall into periods of self-doubt and depression.  The difference really is one of degree.  Yet, as they say in physics, more is different; and in Behrman's case it is dramatically and horribly different.  When I feel depressed or anxious; when my brain chemistry points me toward some sort of undefined behavior to satisfy the gloom or restlessness, what I do is exercise.  I have found that the troubles of the world and the wild cacophony running round my brain become muted and silenced by the sheer sense of physical exhaustion, a delicious state of mind that wants only water and rest, and then when there is physical rest perhaps something good to eat and then some work and then some sleep, and in this way the brain chemistry is reset.<br />I don't say this will work for people like Behrman.  Clearly it has not worked for many others.  But I think it should have been (and should be!) tried.  Notice that when he was manically working he was happy and healthy, at least for that period of time.  Since everything about Behrman goes to extremes, perhaps only the most rigorous and extensive sort of physical exercise program will work.able to work sixteen hour days, now he has trouble leaving his apartment.

He is just about the funniest dude I ever read.  Burp!  Is reading Tony Kornheiser like popping chocolate covered cheery bon-bons or stuffing your face with Lay's potato chips?  No.  Reading Tony Kornheiser is like eating a substantial tub of almond chocolate brownie fudge ice cream and feeling the better for it.  Reading TK is like drinking scotch whiskey all night long and not dying behind the wheel.*<br />His title is a take off on cross-dressing former NBA basketballer and party animal Dennis Rodman's best-selling memoir \\"Bad As I Wanna Be.\\"  (And you were worried about the quality of the books on the best seller list.)  Since Tony and Dennis are the epitome of what the other isn't, this seems fair.<br />Tony is funnier than his fellow beltway columnist, and my pal, Joel Achenbach, although not as travel ready.  The only collections of funny writings that I have read recently that can compare in the sense of pure laugh out loud belly bouncing humor are those by the recusant Joe Queenan (my other pal), whom I'm sure you know is not entirely housebroken.  (Joke, dude, JOKE!)<br />Kornheiser is the leader of a new breed of humor newspaper columnists replacing such old time stalwarts as Art Buchwald and I forget who else.  The new style is to slyly lampoon the icons of the culture and to sweetly ridicule the mundane in our lives and to lovingly roast our loved ones and leave the pols and their wily ways to the cartoonists.  Here's Tony visiting his dad in Florida:<br />\\"Dad, what's the purpose of all this string?\\"<br />He said, \\"You never know...\\"<br />You never know what?  When a yo-yo tournament is coming to town?...<br />And coupons! ...  My dad had twenty-three coupons for Taster's Choice; there's not enough water in the Everglades to brew that much coffee...  The kicker is: My dad drinks Folger's!  He kept the Taster's Choice coupons for company.  Like who's coming over, Canada? (pp 85-86)<br />Or, when he's driving his dad to a store:<br />I'm driving in Florida traffic, which is to say I'm creeping along behind a row of cars driven by people whose heads don't extend over the steering wheels, and they're going five miles an hour.  Everything is in slow motion.  It's like I'm driving through cream of mushroom soup. (p. 113)<br />Kornheiser also writes about his kids, his neighbor's kids, his dog, his neighbor's turtle, yard and tomato growing wars--all the shtick of the suburban sun dance.  One of my favorite pieces was his take on Michael Jordan cologne:<br />Michael Jordan is in the business of sweating.

Thus farmers might discover naturally occurring pesticides, perhaps from the leaves of trees; doctors might use antibiotics manufactured by microbes or ants; and engineers, builders and manufacturers might learn how to make the super strong but light weight materials spun out by spiders and worms or secreted by mollusks.<br />(Or, more realistically, chemical conglomerates, pharmaceutical giants, and construction multinationals might better their bottom line and reduce pollution and the destruction of the environment through the use of ecologically viable solutions.)<br />The text, written by Australian biologist Andrew Beattie with perhaps more than symbolic assistance from famed population biologist Paul Ehrlich, is unpretentious enough to be accessible to high school students; indeed it seems in some respects, by using a minimum of jargon and technical language, to be aimed at young people.  There is an emphasis on the positive aspects of bioremediation and biotechnology rather than sounding any alarm bells about our misuse of the environment.  Thus when animals are to be employed as biological monitors of pollution (as the canary is used in the coal mine) the text assures us that rare or endangered species will not be used.  Or when pigs are employed (on islands north of Australia) as sentinel animals that might warn of disease traveling south, we are told that they live in pens under \\"palm trees that rustle in the balmy sea breezes\\" and that the pigs \\"snooze or root about in the sand and coconut husks\\" and are tossed leftovers by passing villagers several times a day \\"from the family meal or some other delicacy.\\" (p. 160)<br />The authors follow the introduction with these important words, \\"The majority of species on Earth have yet to be discovered.\\" (By the way, those who think that the identification of species is like glorified stamp collecting, as I recently read in some book, are very much mistaken.  An accounting of life forms, at the very least, will give us a basis for examining change.)  Beattie and Ehrlich follow this up with an exploration of how species live in, on, and with one another, laying the groundwork for an understanding of biodiversity and ecology while showing how dependent we are on the smallest creatures for our survival.  They recall the failed Biosphere 2 experiment some years ago in Arizona and use a thought experiment on what we might take to the moon to establish and maintain a natural community, thereby demonstrating beyond any doubt just how complex and connected and dependent are all forms of life.  They evoke the concept \\"the natural internet\\" to illustrate this interconnectedness and to show how natural cycles, food chains, water and nitrogen cycles, etc., work.  Particularly interesting was the chapter on garbage and how the myriad creatures of the soil break down waste and return it to use.  The remainder of the book suggests ways that humans can work within natural systems to both our advantage and the advantage of the planet as a whole.  It is sorely hoped that this message reaches a lot of people, which is obviously the intent of the authors.<br />The text is enhanced by appealing black and white illustrations of insects, worms, spiders, microbes, fungi and other living things by Christine Turnbull, done in a way that makes the creatures look almost lovable.  Turnbull combines a serious attention to detail with the light touch of a cartoonist.  Or at least this is my impression.  I imagined, for example, that the immobilized ant on the title page with a fungus growing out of its body had an cartoonist's \\"x\\" in its eye; but that was merely a misapprehension; there was no \\"x.\\"  Yet the death of this ant eaten from the inside by a fungus seemed almost benign.  Perhaps this is a felicitous way of understanding \\"nature red in tooth and claw.\\"  Furthermore, (and I mean this seriously) maybe if people in general saw ecology in something like the rosy way Disney depicted it in Bambi (but without the distortion) we might be the better for it.<br />Anyway I admire the attempt by the authors to show how the use of natural products and processes are preferable to the use of artificial and man-made ones whenever possible, and for suggesting the incredible range of what is possible.  I wish that all high school students and CEOs of multinational corporations would read this book.  Or better yet, heads of state (even dictators and ruling theocrats) and elected representatives whose education has been primarily in law, business and the military, should read this book.  Maybe we ought to buy an extra copy and send it to our representative in Washington.  Couldn't hurt.<br />Bottom line: the text is a little pollyannaish at times and the material is familiar to those trained in the life sciences, but the message is an important one, and that message is expressed in a vivid and easily assimilated way.  The drawings by Turnbull are wonderful.law.\\"  Furthermore, (and I mean this seriously) maybe if people in general saw ecology in something like the rosy way Disney depicted it in Bambi (but without the distortion) we might be the better for it.<br />Anyway I admire the attempt by the authors to show how the use of natural products and processes are preferable to the use of artificial and man-made ones whenever possible, and for suggesting the incredible range of what is possible.

Chiles gives us diagrams, step-by-step chronologies, and a very human narrative to illuminate these and scores of other technological disasters in a way that makes it excruciatingly clear that most of them could have been prevented.<br />What these disasters have in common is human error, of course, but Chiles reveals that there were also foreshadowings and warnings of the horrors to come in the form of cracks, sagging roofs, parts that didn't quite fit, maintenance shortcuts taken, capacity limits reached, etc., that should have tipped off those in the know that something terrible was about to happen.  Additionally, virtually all of the disasters happened because more than one thing went wrong.<br />Among the horror stories told in detail are:<br />The harrowing tale of the sinking of the drill rig Ocean Ranger in a North Atlantic gale in 1982, a disaster caused in part because somebody forgot to close the shutters on portlight windows;<br />The Challenger space shuttle blow-up, which Chiles compares with the crash of the British hydrogen-filled dirigible R.101in 1921.  Both were &quot;megaprojects born out of great national aspirations&quot;and both went forward &quot;despite specific, written warnings of danger.&quot;  (p. 67);<br />The Hubble Space Telescope fiasco in which a lens is incorrectly ground thereby partially &quot;blinding&quot; the telescope, a multi-billion dollar error that could have been prevented with just a little testing.  In this chapter (subtitled: &quot;Testing is Such a Bother&quot;) Chiles shows how disasters happen because proper tests are simply not performed;<br />An out of control police van that killed parade watchers in Minneapolis in 1998 when an off duty police officer not completely in the driver's seat inexplicably gunned the engine instead of hitting the brakes.  This accident was in part caused by an alteration to &quot;Circuit 511&quot; that controls both the brake lights and (unbeknownst to the mechanics) an electric shift lock on the vehicle.

Indeed, let me concentrate on one idea in that essay.  (In a sense this may demonstrate the value of the entire collection.)<br />Goodwin writes about consciousness and feelings in a manner that reveals what I think is a fundamental misconception.  Here in part is what he writes:<br />Clearly, a primary aspect of consciousness is feeling...  So within the question &quot;Where does consciousness come from?&quot; there is the question, &quot;Where do feelings come from?&quot;  The answer we are forced to give in science is that feelings arise from a particular dynamic organization of insentient matter, such as nervous systems at a particular level of complexity and order.  Our feelings arise as emergent properties from something that has not the slightest trace of anything that could be called feeling or sentience. (p. 48)<br />The feelings that he sees arising are not, however, emergent properties of the organization of our gray matter and its interaction with the world, but are better understood as perceptions of that organization.  As evolutionary creatures all our interactions are experienced as feelings, some good, some bad, some painful, some boring, some neutral, some below the threshold of awareness, some so unrelated to our status in the world as to be almost without affect, depending on the circumstances in which they are experienced.  The emergent properties of Goodwin's complexity science are properties not of the perception of phenomena but of the phenomena themselves.  Thus an emergent property of water, in an example given by Goodwin, is the precise structure of a snowflake.  In our brain/body system an analogous emergent property would be the precise structure of the neurological, muscular, glandular, etc. aggregate at any given time.  Ourperception of that aggregate is experienced by us as feeling (sometimes called consciousness).<br />Consider the experience of taste or scent.  There is no way you can adequately describe the taste of a mango or the scent of a rose to someone else.  A rose smells &quot;sweet.&quot;  It smells &quot;floral,&quot; etc.  We are always reduced to sharing our subjective experience of the world with others through the use of analogy or comparison.  Light of a certain wave length hits our eyes and is perceived by the eye/brain system.  We experience the perception as &quot;red&quot; and we have certain feelings associated with red.  If it is in the shape of a strawberry (and we're hungry) our feelings about it may be pleasantly anticipatory.  If it is in the cylinder of a traffic light as we are in a hurry to get somewhere, we may experience it as an annoyance.  In any case what we are experiencing is light of a certain wave length in an enormously complex context.  But how to describe the pure sensation of redness to someone else?  It's impossible because what we are attempting to describe is indescribable.  Our consciousness is likewise indescribable.  We do know that one person's experience of color is similar to another's.  A strawberry is seen as &quot;red&quot; and not orange by almost everybody.  Whether the subjective sense of red is the same is impossible to determine.  We will always have to compare the experience to something else in an attempt to see if our experience is the same.  We will never be sure.  <br />&quot;Consciousness&quot; then is not an emergent property of the brain but is our subjective experience of an emergent property.  It is a perception.  Incidentally, this is why it is believed in Hinduism, for example, that our brains constitute a sixth sense, a way of perceiving the world in addition to the senses of taste, smell, touch, hearing and sight, and are not, e.g., calculating machines.  We can &quot;see&quot; things that other animals cannot.<br />There is an awful lot of ink about the &quot;mysterious&quot; and unfathomable nature of consciousness and feeling being spilled in learned journals and in books published by esteemed presses that would disappear overnight if this fundamental distinction between experience and phenomena were kept in mind.<br />Another way to look at this is to understand that pain and pleasure, boredom and exhilaration, and all the other emotional experiences of humans (and animals) are mechanisms that work to direct our behavior in adaptive directions.  The real emergent phenomena are our behaviors.  Thus inert matter organized by evolution leads to the building of rocket ships to transverse space and to the cultivation of varieties of apples and grains to nourish the organisms that design and build those machines.  The &quot;consciousnesses&quot; and the &quot;feelings&quot; experienced are not to be confused with the actual drawing of the blueprints or the tightening of the lug nuts.<br />The sense that Goodwin (and many others) have that there is not a clear connection between feeling and consciousness, on the one hand, and inert matter and energy on the other, is nonetheless entirely valid.  At the deepest level we can make no connection between one thing and another.  What is the connection between the symbols in the equation 2 + 2 = 4?  What is there between the plus sign and the two?  Empty mental space?  Or what is the connection between one moment and the next?  No one knows.  Indeed, does time flow or is time an eternal now or a cycling thing?  We do not know.  Indeed, at the most fundamental level we know nothing about the world.  We know only how to manipulate phenomena to our (perceived) advantage, or, put another way, how to behave in ways similar to those that the evolutionary experience of our species has found adaptive in the past.	2002-08-16

Knowing that barley and wheat came from the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia in the Middle East helps to explain why civilization first arose there and not somewhere else.  Those foods helped to sustain a \\"surplus\\" population that could devote itself to the arts and invention, leading to the modern world.  Indeed all wealth has as its base the growth and storage of food in excess of that which is needed for the sustenance of the food producers, resulting in non-food producing people who can devote themselves to competing schemes of how to steal the wealth and how to protect it (i.e., war).  Looking at the history of art through still life and other works of art centering on fruits and vegetables is also fascinating.  Essentially this is what Jonathan Roberts has done in this very attractive, richly illustrated book.<br />To give you some idea of his intent consider pages 122 and 123.  On the right-handed page there is a photograph of \\"Banana Skin c. 1500\\" from the \\"Museum of London Evacuations, London Bridge, Southwark, U.K., 1999\\" showing the black skin of a banana with the obvious import that the banana had already reached the London produce market in c. 1500, just eight years after Columbus's first voyage.  Remarkable.  Then on the left-handed page there is an image of the oil on canvas painting, \\"Bananas, 1952\\" by Lucian Freud, showing an entire stock of bananas still on the tree.  Roberts employs a number of famous works such as Van Gogh's \\"The Potato Eaters\\" and Botticelli's \\"Madonna of the Pomegranate\\" to illustrate the text; indeed there is art work from  the Twelfth Egyptian Dynasty through Greek and Roman times to the still lives of the Renaissance to William Hooker, Gauguin, Cezanne, etc., to moderns like Edward Burra and even examples of Russian propaganda art and American advertizing.<br />The text is a little repetitive and there are some boilerplate phrases that appear several times, but there are only a few typos and I noticed no errors of fact (which isn't always the case in books like this: Roberts himself notes copious errors in, for example, Gerard's \\"Herball\\" 1597).  Still, I think Roberts did a good job of going beyond the normal range of \\"coffee table\\" text while not being too technical.  What really appeals, though, is the artwork.<br />I enjoyed this book although as always I would like more information; indeed an entire book devoted to each and every fruit and vegetable featured here (there are at least sixty, from apples and avocados and pears to beans, carrots, melons, to peppers both black and red, to pumpkins and zucchini, the latter not mentioned in the text, but there is an unmistakable illustration on page 141)--and more--would be ideal.and there are some boilerplate phrases that appear several times, but there are only a few typos and I noticed no errors of fact (which isn't always the case in books like this: Roberts himself notes copious errors in, for example, Gerard's \\"Herball\\" 1597).

1456878:US	49786731	R376FU61MA9EI2	0609601431	601909093	I Have Landed: The End of a Beginning in Natural History	Books	5	17	18	N	N	The tenth and final collection	I was a little bit disconcerted when I saw the title of this, Stephen Jay Gould's last collection of essays.  I thought: has he anticipated his own sadly premature death with the metaphoric \\"I Have Landed\\" or is this a kind of melancholy coincidence, or perhaps I am reading into the title something different from what it warrants?<br />As it turns out, \\"I Have Landed\\" is not a reference to the Lethe shore of the poet, but a reference to his grandfather's arrival at Ellis Island on September 11, 1901, exactly, to the day, one century before the attack on the World Trade Center in New York.  It is from this coincidence that Gould embarks upon some musings that form the touchstone for this, his tenth and last collection of essays.<br />He is a man who will be sorely missed, a complete original, at once the very embodiment of a meticulous scientist and an establishment New York liberal.  He is one of our greatest essayists, a humanist and a quintessentially rational man who has often argued in favor of the value and importance of religious thought.  Born in modest circumstance, descendent of Hungarian immigrants (as was another of our most prolific writers, Isaac Asimov) he fell in love (as he recounts in these pages) with the NYC Museum of National History as a child and never lost his love for \\"the odd little tidbits,\\" nor his sense of himself as a natural historian.  He is a \\"student of snails\\" (p. 324), a classical nerd \\"shorter than average\\" (p. 246) who spent more time at the Hayden Planetarium and the Tyrannosaurus exhibition than he did playing his beloved baseball, a paleontologist who became not only a gifted essayist but an international celebrity.<br />It's a neat trick what Stephen Jay Gould has done with his life, and it is a neat trick that he \\"chose\\" (if I may) to leave this vale of tears almost immediately after finishing not just this book, but more significantly, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, the \\"life work\\" of his \\"mature years, twenty years in the making and 1,500 pages in the printing.\\"  It has been noted that people typically die after a long illness not the day before Christmas or the day before their birthday or the day before the christening of their youngest grandchild, but the day after.  And the very great choose to leave us only after they have finished some compelling project to which they have devoted the last years of their life.  Gould remarked in the Preface on the coincidence of his finishing these twin projects together in time for publication in the \\"palindromic\\" year of 2002--(how he loves the odd fact, the detail that others might miss, and how he rejoices in sharing such \\"tidbits\\")--while recalling the earlier \\"conjunction\\" of the near simultaneous publication of his first book of collected essays, Ever Since Darwin, and his \\"first technical book for professional colleagues,\\" Ontogeny and Phylogeny in 1977.  I wonder if he knew that these would be the bookends of his life.<br />This collection is touted on the blurb as \\"the most personal book he has ever published\\"; nonetheless it is very much like the nine other collections.  There is the usual intricate and sometimes whimsical analysis of a bewildering range of subjects anchored to natural history with (of course) some asides on baseball.  The style has gotten a trifle more ornate, the qualifications upon qualifications a bit more belabored, the subordinated clauses in the parallel construction of his architectured sentences a bit more in number, but otherwise he is still the same man, ponderously thorough and passionately alive in argument and analysis.<br />Some old subjects (the limitations of reduction in the biological sciences; the misleading popularizations of evolutionary ideas; the excessive ink the dinosaurs get, the delusion of racism, etc) are returned to and reworked.  There is a convincing argument in favor of Vladimir Nabokov as a scientist in addition to his work as a literary artist.  There is a return to Freud and his \\"evolutionary fantasy.\\"  (Freud could not shake himself from a Lamarckian view).  There is a look into the origin and meaning and misuse of such words as \\"syphilis\\" and \\"evolution,\\" noting respectively that science has done a poor job of treating syphilis and that the meaning of \\"evolution\\" has changed.  (Darwin did not use the word in the first edition of Origin of Species, although, as Gould notes, he ended the book slyly with the word \\"evolved.\\")<br />Less anyone think that Gould is all learning and little insight (a laughable idea considering his contributions to evolutionary theory, his punctuated equilibria and his spandrels, to name the best known) consider this salient (and to some extent, self-addressed) question from page 4: \\"How do scientists and other researchers blast and bumble toward their complex mixture of conclusions (great factual discoveries of enduring worth mixed with unconscious social prejudices of astonishing transparency to later generations)?  How indeed do we escape the prejudices of our times, and to what extent does this apply to Gould himself?<br />There are drawings and black and white prints and in all 39 chapters in this handsome book.  Gould ends where he began with his grandfather Papa Joe with thoughts about New York and its people adorned with the majestic cadences of Ecclesiastes, \\"To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.  A time to be born and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted....\\"<br />And a time to be landed.  Gould, no doubt, has landed not on the Lethe shore but near the Cambrian sea where he might take a closer look at those myriad creatures to which he devoted so much of his life, and from which he learned so much that he was able to share with us.d his \\"evolutionary fantasy.\\"  (Freud could not shake himself from a Lamarckian view).

Reviewers have compared her to Flannery O'Connor and that comparison is valid in terms of originality and the ability to cut through the pretense of life and reveal what people do and what they think beneath the surface of convention.  But Joy Williams does not have Flannery O'Connor's polished sense of story and structure; however she doesn't need it.  She has instead an eagle's eye for detail and an awesome command of language.  Her characters are alive with the quickness of life, its strange twists and turns, its Shakespearean absurdity and its banality and wonder.  So insightful and so sharply rendered is her prose that it alone carries us along.  Into the mouths of babes she puts words of wisdom and out the mouths of her everyday people emerge worldly philosophies.<br /><br />Thus 8-year-old Emily Bliss Pickless, who likes to pour dirt on her head and to pretend she doesn't know how to read to see if adults will try to mislead her, observes, \\"You had to act dumb around adults, otherwise there was no point in being around them at all.\\"  Assessing her mother's new boyfriend, she concludes, \\"...mother lacked all discrimination when it came to men.\\" (p. 167)  When she has finished re-educating the proprietor of the stuffed animal/trophy museum, we find it shut down with her sign out front, accurately announcing, \\"CLOSED FOR RECONSIDERATION.\\"<br /><br />Thus Nurse Daisy, as she washes Freddie Fallow, an elderly 350-pound mountain of an old man (who had to be hoisted into the tub with the aid of block and tackle), muses, \\"Isn't water a remarkable element?  It's exempt from getting wet.  It's as exempt from getting wet as God is exempt from the passion of love.\\" (p. 169)  Or, \\"Birth is the cause of death,\\" and \\"The set trap never tires of waiting.\\" (p. 170)  Or even, \\"Our capacity to do evil has nothing to do with our innocence.\\" (p. 171)  Or--most especially--her description of Freddie's impending death as, \\"the evaporation of your little droplet above the sea...\\" (p. 172)<br /><br />This last is an echo of Buddhism that Williams wants to satirize, as she does through the person of the undead Ginger, whose husband Carter has taken a fancy to his gardener, Donald, who espouses trendy Eastern philosophies.  She begins, \\"What's he doing tonight, out hand-pollinating something?\\"  She goes on to say, \\"Slow white dudes studying Buddhism make me sick,\\" and finishes up with, \\"I can just hear him.  It's only death, Ginger. Everything is fine...Does he say, Thank you, Illusion, every time he manages to overcome some piddling obstacle in his silly life?\\"<br /><br />Thus Joy Williams's characters are vehicles for the author's expressions and her starkly original slant on the living and the dead.  But what Joy Williams does so well is that she plays fair.  The words of quirky wisdom come not necessarily from characters who represent her own views, such as Alice and Emily (although sometimes they do) but they can even come from the most minor of her human creatures.  Thus Ottolie \\"who resembled an iguana\\" tells Alice from her bed, \\"I never sleep, you know...Never.  Someone sleeps for me.  She lives in Nebraska.\\"  Ottolie adds, \\"Aksarben.  That's where I get a lot of my people.  You have to learn how to delegate tasks.\\" (p. 117)<br /><br />Some have criticized this novel as \\"structurally a mess.\\"  Not so.  Williams has her own organizing mechanisms.  Characters flow from one to another; incidents are connected by invisible synchronicities; people appear to further the plot, and then disappear, but they are melded into the psychological and atmospheric structure of the novel.  One sees this in the rednecks who seem to appear just to finish off poor Ray of the slanted mouth, but actually they are essential fixtures of the landscape as they smoke dope and shotgun saguaros, observing that \\"Shooting felt good...\\" consisting in \\"the increase of one's power,\\" or that  \\"Paranoia is having all the facts.\\" (p. 152)<br /><br />Sometimes what is best about Joy Williams is the sheer dazzle of language.  Thus the unrelenting Arizona sun is made manifest through metaphor: \\"The sun shone like oil upon the limousine's hood, which had been waxed to the shine of water.\\"  Or the boy Alice sees whose hair was \\"as white as glare.\\" (pp. 303-304)  And sometimes the best thing is her revelation of character with just a phrase or two.  Thus we know what Annabel is like because she worries about things like running out of avocado butter or whether she can actually wear beige or not.  On page 163 a waiter, who wore \\"white clinging plastic gloves\\" comes to life with just these words:<br /><br />\\"Have a nice remainder of the rest of your life,\\" the waiter said.  \\"Gotta cough.\\"  He turned away.<br /><br />Or the two loud women at a nearby table who \\"had poured sugar on their food so they wouldn't eat anymore.\\"<br /><br />People yearn for things that cannot be, and that is life.  Thus Ginger yearns for Carter to renew their vows of love and for him to join her, but he prefers to conjoin with Donald.  And Alice is strangely smitten with the tuxedo-wearing piano player who is (unknown to her, but Annabel sees this clearly) irrevocably gay.  But some people do indeed find love or something akin, as the stuffed animal museum owner and his adored Pickless, or Carter with Donald, or Annabel and Paris.  Or the \\"pretty lizard\\" with J.C.'s missing \\"Little Wonder.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Quick and the Dead\\" (Second Timothy: 4:1; also The Book of Common Prayer) is a work of art that finds its own structure, that reveals itself to us in its own way.

We find out here that apparently she could.  At least in the small sample of cases recorded, she &quot;identified every single one of the cups correctly.&quot; (p. 8)<br />The question--and this is the question that statisticians are forever trying to answer--is, was the result significant?  Or how much faith should we put in such a result?  What is the probability that such a result comes to us by chance rather than by causation?  Did she simply guess right ten times in a row?  Or, more saliently, how many times would she have to guess right before you'd be a believer?  Or, more rigorously, how many times out of how many trials would she have to guess right before we can be confident that she isn't just guessing?<br />Statistics then is a way of understanding and appreciating events without reference to causation.  How cigarette smoking causes lung cancer is not exactly known.  The fact that cigarette smoking does indeed cause lung cancer is demonstrated by a clear statistical correlation between smoking and the instance of lung cancer.  But is a statistical correlation proof?<br />Salsburg's very readable book is a narrative about the mathematicians who have tried to answer this and other statistical questions.  The emphasis is on the mathematicians themselves, not on their mathematics.  Indeed, following a time-honored &quot;rule&quot; in the book publishing business, a rule that insists that you lose &quot;x&quot; number of readers for every mathematical formula that appears on your pages, Salsburg has elected to use a grand total of zero.<br />I was a little disconcerted about this.  To encounter Bayes's theorem or any number of other statistical ideas and see not a single formula or mathematical expression was to me like reading a joke book without any jokes in it.  But for those who have heard the jokes and are only interested in the joke tellers and their problems, this is indeed a fascinating book.  It is ironic that this &quot;non-mathematical&quot; book is probably best appreciated by those with some experience with statistics.  Such readers I suspect will be quite pleased to read about the lives of such greats in statistical theory and methods as Karl Pearson, R. A. Fisher, William Sealy &quot;Student&quot; Gosset, John Tukey, etc.  Salsburg focuses on the problems that the individual mathematicians encountered and the solutions they came up with.<br />Here's an example of how Salsburg does this neat trick of talking about mathematics without using any mathematics.  He asks, &quot;What is the central limit theorem?&quot; (p. 84) and answers thusly:<br />&quot;The averages of large collections of numbers have a statistical distribution.  The central limit theorem states that this distribution can be approximated by the normal probability distribution regardless of where the initial data came from.  The normal probability distribution is the same as Laplace's error function.  It is sometimes called the Gaussian distribution.  It has been described loosely in popular works as the bell-shaped curve.&quot;<br />Perhaps this does work for a lot of people, but I think this book would be improved if there were an appendix with a list of ideas, presented in mathematical form.  For a new edition, Salsburg might want to do something like that.  Then this interesting book would also be a work of reference.<br />My favorite method learned here is on page 236.  Salsburg describes how John Tukey believes one should tally.  Instead of making vertical lines and crossing every fifth one (which is what I have done for decades) Tukey recommends &quot;a ten-mark tally.  You first mark four dots to make the corners of a box.  You then connect the dots with four lines, completing the box.  Finally, you make two diagonal marks forming a cross within the box.&quot;<br />That statistical ideas are inexorably tied up with the ideas of probability is explored in the final chapter of the book, &quot;The Idol with Feet of Clay.&quot;  Salsburg observes, along with Thomas Kuhn, that we are forever describing reality with &quot;a model...that appears to fit the data,&quot; but as the data accumulates our model &quot;begins to require modifications.&quot; (p. 293)  Reality in this sense is the postulated &quot;universe&quot; of the statistician, and our experiences and &quot;laws&quot; the result of &quot;samplings&quot; of that universe.  Salsburg, citing L. Jonathan Cohen, goes on to recall Seymour Kyberg's &quot;lottery paradox&quot; which makes it clear that statistical/probabilistic &quot;proofs&quot; run into logical problems.  He then asks if we really understand probability.  He recalls the notion of &quot;personal probability&quot; (something I used to call &quot;psychological probability&quot;) in which we appreciate the probability of something happening in terms of what effect it might have on us personally.  Thus a small chance of getting something exceeding important to us (such as winning the lottery) might be worth paying more for the ticket than it is objectively worth.  Salsburg concludes that we really do not understand probability except in the grossest sense (e.g., &quot;50/50&quot; or &quot;almost certain&quot;).  Then he asks, does it matter?  His answer suggests quantum mechanics in which we work with probabilities without any pretense of grasping underlying &quot;laws.&quot;<br />Salsburg ends the book with a yearning for a new paradigm without feet of clay.  I suspect he has in mind the undeniable and always troubling fact that the best that can ever be said about a sampling is that it has a certain probability of being an accurate reflection of the entire universe.  However, my guess is that we will continue to have to be satisfied with &quot;only&quot; probabilistic knowledge; indeed that knowledge itself will always be subject to some degree of doubt.

Dissatisfaction.  Indefinite yearnings.  Alienation, maybe.  They are populated with the unglamourous, the unstylish.  Typically there is a central female character who is usually young, or at least younger than the other characters.  She can be a little girl, as in the title story, \\"Escapes,\\" or a teen as in \\"The Skater,\\" or a woman in the last years of her youth as in \\"The Little Winter.\\"  Often she is being or has been raised by grandparents.  Sometimes she is married to an older man, sometimes twice her age or more.  She drinks hard liquor out of cups or a thermos, or martinis.  Sometimes she's an alcoholic.  She makes many observations, some startling.  The men are always a bit bizarre or off center or not exactly right.  Animals are often mentioned and make appearances, and technical language from biology is used in bits and pieces.  Usually the girl wants to go somewhere or is going somewhere, but the destination isn't important, or maybe it is.<br />Four of the twelve stories, \\"Bromeliads,\\" \\"The Skater,\\" \\"Health,\\" and \\"The Blue Men\\" made The Best American Short Stories in 1978, 1985, 1986 and 1987.  \\"Rot\\" appeared in Prize Stories 1988: The O. Henry Awards.  Clearly, Joy Williams is at the top of her calling.<br />I didn't understand all of the stories.  This is nothing unusual.  Short stories from the postmodern oeuvre as served up in Granta or The Antioch Review, or The Cornell Review, where some of these stories first appeared, or even in The Atlantic Monthly or The New Yorker, sometimes leave me wondering if I missed something.  Sometimes I re-read the story and I'm still not sure.  Sometimes I realize something has happened, something has changed, just slightly, like a displacement in a distant landscape, and I feel a sense of significance.  Or sometimes I don't.<br />But something definitely happens in a Joy Williams story.  It is revealed from deep within the story, or come upon, or realized en route.  Thus we find that Gloria in \\"The Little Winter\\" is dying.  This is revealed directly midway through.  She is dying amidst a banal and boring existence, visiting a boring friend with many ex-husbands and her boring daughter.  In \\"Lu-Lu\\" (the name for a rather large pet snake--the story has an element that reminds me distantly of Steinbeck's \\"A Snake of One's Own\\") Heather is leaving something behind (\\"an ugly nightie with its yearnings\\"), heading for a new life with Lu-Lu, whom the old couple she has been drinking with, have to let go.  Like Gloria she is going off in an automobile with something vaguely grotesque, yet it is better than being by herself.  Molly, from California, in \\"The Skater\\" is being shown New England prep schools where she is going to be sent.  She is somehow symbolically or emotionally, or practically, going to the same place her tragically dead sister Martha went.  Maybe.  For some reason.  In \\"Rot\\" Lucy's much older husband who is still friendly with his several ex-wives, buys a black Ford Thunderbird that is rusting from the inside out.  He takes out a wall and places it in the living room.  Lucy has reluctantly agreed to this, but then realizes that the car will be there obtrusively in her life forever, like Dwight's ex-wives.<br />Some of the stories have an element of the surreal.  Katherine Mansfield and Friedrich Nietzsche appear with \\"G.\\" in \\"Gurdjieff in the Sunshine State.\\"  In \\"The Skater\\" Tom, the father, skates on ice \\"wearing a suit and tie, his good shoes\\" but without skates.<br />Sometimes people are dying.  Mothers disappear, children left to be raised by their grandparents.  A beautiful young woman finds herself kinkily enthralled with her husband, a middle aged chemist who talks of sharks and things biological while she wears him out sexually on \\"The Route\\" to the Florida Keys.<br />Part of the power of Williams's writing comes from the wonderful way she has with detail, detail of all sorts, details about the way things look, the way people talk, what they think about, cultural details, the way things feel and smell and taste.  It looks easy, it reads easily, but remember the dictum, \\"easy writing makes for hard reading,\\" and vice-versa.  Williams works hard on her prose.  She makes the details telling.<br />I particularly enjoyed the last story, \\"The Last Generation\\" which is about the relationship between 15-year-old Audrey and 9-year-old Tommy.  She has befriended him after being dumped by his older brother.  It is a way of maintaining or of getting even.  She instructs Tommy in how to think about the world.  They are \\"the last generation.\\"  She says things like, \\"That's what true love is.  Wanting something that's missing.\\"  Or, \\"Clouds aren't as pretty as they used to be.  That's a known fact.\\" (p. 156)  She tells him about monks: \\"They love solitude more than anything.

It's technique, artistry.  She has Pammy recall an interview with a \\"radical skater,\\" a boy who is asked why he doesn't fall.  He says, \\"I don't fall...because I've got a deep respect for the concrete surface and because when I make a miscalculation, instead of falling I turn it into a new trick.\\"<br />I think this is the way Joy Williams writes.t the way things look, the way people talk, what they think about, cultural details, the way things feel and smell and taste.  It looks easy, it reads easily, but remember the dictum, \\"easy writing makes for hard reading,\\" and vice-versa.  Williams works hard on her prose.  She makes the details telling.  <br />I particularly enjoyed the last story, \\"The Last Generation\\" which is about the relationship between 15-year-old Audrey and 9-year-old Tommy.  She has befriended him after being dumped by his older brother.  It is a way of maintaining or of getting even.  She instructs Tommy in how to think about the world.  They are \\"the last generation.\\"  She says things like, \\"That's what true love is.  Wanting something that's missing.\\"  Or, \\"Clouds aren't as pretty as they used to be.  That's a known fact.\\" (p. 156)  She tells him about monks: \\"They love solitude more than anything.

This is a polemic of course and will give comfort and merriment to Democrats and others who are opposed to the Bush dynasty.  Curiously, as a middle of the road kind of guy, I found myself reading this almost in sympathy with George W.'s many misstatements, unconscious self-revelations, and inadvertent personality projections.  Certainly he seems no different than other politicians, who are, by the very nature of their calling, forced to disdain the concrete and to avoid at all costs any sort of public candor.  I learned from this book, however, that for George II, because of his natural inclination to be a comedian and to speak vividly and colorfully and to express (for laughs) the kind of gut feelings people have, which he did as an undergraduate at Yale, political speak can be difficult.  When he has to think on his feet the conflict within him is greater than it is for most politicians who are just naturally as vacuous as possible.  George W. wants to say what he really feels and has to continually suppress the urge.<br />Needless to say, Bush supporters and Republicans in general will find this book humorless and not very interesting.  There is however a certain underlying idea presented by Professor Miller that bares scrutiny, namely that President Bush's true feelings can be discerned by a close, analytic look at what he says and what he doesn't say.  Miller gives us Freudian slips aplenty by the heir apparent to Dan Quayle, and furthers the idea put forth by journalist Gail Sheehy that George W. really is dyslexic.  Bush has denied that he's dyslexic.  However, he is quoted on page 102 as saying, revealingly, \\"That woman who knew I had dyslexia--I never interviewed her.\\"  (Meaning, I presume, she never interviewed him.)  Miller characterizes this double slip of the tongue as \\"a dyslexic denial of dyslexia.\\"  Miller also quotes Bush as saying things like, \\"I don't care what the polls say.  I don't.  I'm doing what I think what's wrong,\\" or, \\"Well, I think if you say you're going to do something and don't do it, that's trustworthiness.\\" (p. 134)  These are misstatements that may suggest a troubled conscious and/or a deep-seeded desire to tell the truth perhaps like his fabled namesake, the Father of Our Country.<br />But I think these are relatively minor matters.  Politicians, whether of the right or left, Republican or Democratic, cannot tell the truth except in so far as the truth furthers their candidacy or political agenda.  The idea that George W. gives himself away when he has to speak extemporaneously is more alarming.  I have noticed his failure to mention certain things, like the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, a failure that may hint at what he knows.  He is no longer worried about where bin Laden is perhaps because he knows where bin Laden is, but finds it politically convenient not to reveal that just yet.  Furthermore, I have been troubled by Bush's failure to say much about the anthrax mailings.  One suspects he knows more than he is willing to share with the public.  If I can discern this much (we will see if I am right some years down the road), how much might a more sophisticated analytical team discern?<br />One also senses the phenomenon of psychological \\"projection\\" at work in some of Bush's utterances.  The persona that used to come out when he was drunk, a persona that was sometimes very ugly, is now suppressed.  However sometimes this persona sneaks out when the teetotaling Bush is caught off guard.  For example, after touring the Auschwitz death camp, Bush is quoted as saying (p. 82): \\"Boy, they were big on crematoriums, weren't they?\\"  Presumably he was still drinking in 1987 when he spotted the Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt with his family at a restaurant in Dallas and came over and said, \\"You no f-ing good sonofab-, I will never f-ing forget what you wrote.\\" (pp. 107-108)<br />Perhaps what Bush needs to do--and is trying to do, I believe--is to follow the Reagan formula of saying nothing of substance ever, and to just read the cue cards and pronounce homilies--or if cornered, speak in vacuous tautologies.  For example, on whether he'll run for president (p. 133), Bush said, \\"There is a lot of speculation and I guess there is going to continue to be a lot of speculation until the speculation ends.\\"  Now THAT is more like it!<br />The book consists of a rather long opening essay critiquing not only Bush-speak, but that of former presidents, Eisenhower, LBJ, Nixon, Bush Sr., Clinton, etc., that may amuse, followed by shorter chapters focusing on various aspects of Bush's \\"dyslexicon,\\" his attitude toward religion, education, the economy, etc.  Miller seems earnestly concerned about the state of rhetorical candor from our leaders.  He wonders if they are sufficiently educated, etc.  But what I think Professor Miller needs to understand is that he needn't worry.  The power barons of corporate America carefully cull all possible candidates so that by the time the presidential election rolls around, the candidates of the major parties have passed scrutiny.  Naturally the things scrutinized have nothing at all to do with verbal expression.  What counts is some sort of guarantee in the form of obligation to the power structure that the candidate will continue to support our system of democracy by capitalism and do nothing radical that might rock the ship of state.  The Bushes and the Clintons, the Gores and the Reagans were all preselected by a largely unconscious conspiracy led by those in positions of power throughout the nation.  This is the way the system works.  Bush knows this.  That is why his statements tend to be vague and meaningless, even dyslexic, because he knows they are not important.f substance ever, and to just read the cue cards and pronounce homilies--or if cornered, speak in vacuous tautologies.

Death and suffering are a big part of writing.  A big part.  (To paraphrase and turn upon the gifted Joy Williams; see page 49.)  And you can't waste satire or pure hardcore ridicule on targets unworthy of the name.  You've got to go after the people who kill animals, and you can't spare anybody.  Sure it's duck soup to take aim at the National Rifle Association and the few Big Game Machos left in the world.  Duck soup.  And the sickie scientists who lobotomize chimps and torture rabbits just to see how long they can take it, their white coats starched and pressed, their nimble fingers taking copious notes.  These targets are too easy.  In the final analysis you gotta get the burger eaters, every one of them, not just the Super-Sized that waddle into the Burger King or the suburban Mommas sneaking out of the Krispy Kreme, bags of donuts like warm puppies under both arms, mouths stuffed.  No, you've got to get the photo safari people who kill merely with their privileged, ignorant, dilettante PRESENCE in jungleland, a lily-livered affront to nature, over-tipping the guides and spilling martinis and overexposed film onto the purity of the veldt.<br />At any rate, this is the Joy Williams rant, and what I say is rant on, Voltaire!<br />This collection of magazine essays begins with \\"Save the Whales, Screw the Shrimp\\" in which Williams goes after the wishy-washy, faux lovers of nature, addressing them (in effect) as hey \\"you\\" with the \\"Big Gulp cups.\\"  Next is a short-short about rhesus monkeys being raised for laboratory research on an island charmingly called \\"Key Lois\\" (Laboratory Observing Island Simians).  Williams follows this with \\"Safariland\\" in which she makes fun of the photo safari experience, reducing it to a kind of Disneyland with mosquito netting.<br />So far Joy Williams is just satirizing.  Next comes a particularly brutal short-short on wildebeests, how they can't migrate to water during the dry season as they have for millions of years because there's a cattle fence that keeps them from the water they can smell.  Williams is particularly vivid as she describes thousands of them up against the fence dying of thirst.  But she's only warming up.  In the next piece, \\"The Killing Game\\" and in a later piece, \\"The Animal People\\" we experience the full monty of Joy Williams unleashed.  Now her writing becomes (as she describes it in the final essay entitled \\"Why I Write\\") \\"unelusive and strident and brashly one-sided.\\"  Her words are \\"meant to annoy and trouble and polarize, and they made readers...half nuts with rage and disdain.\\" (pp. 209-210)<br />I believe it.  I too love the animals, but I'd bet protozoa to primates that she'd find my efforts sadly lacking and my attitude wimpishly laissez faire.<br />I guess the best way to demonstrate the intent and style of this remarkable book is to just quote Joy Williams.  Here's the opening lines of \\"The Case against Babies\\":<br />BABIES, BABIES, BABIES.  There's a plague of babies.  Too many rabbits or elephants or mustangs or swans brings out the myxomatosis, the culling guns, the sterility drugs, the scientific brigade of egg smashers.  Other species can \\"strain their environments\\" or \\"overrun their range\\" or clash with their human \\"neighbors,\\" but human babies are always welcome at life's banquet.  Welcome, Welcome, Welcome--Live Long and Consume!<br /><br />Joy Williams really is a kind of earthy Voltaire, a kind of meat cleaver (as opposed to rapier) Voltaire, a kind of take no prisoners master of satire, burlesque, ridicule and just plain old verbal assassination.<br />But she raises a profound and demoralizing question: what IS going to happen to all the animals that we claim to love so much?  Both Joy Williams and I know.  Only those fully compatible with humans (dogs, cats, aquarium fish) or those we can't do anything about (rats, mice, crows, sea gulls, sparrows) will survive.  Joy knows this and she's angry.  Her anger shows.  But she's also resigned and that shows too.  I know this not merely because of her tone but because of what she writes on page 209: \\"Nothing the writer can do is ever enough.\\"<br />The denouement of the book (strangely it has one; Joy Williams is an artist) comes in the penultimate essay, \\"Hawk.\\"  Here we are stunned to learn that \\"Hawk,\\" her German shepherd dog, whom she referred to as \\"my sweetie pie, my honey, my handsome boy, my love,\\" whom she would kiss fondly on the nose, turned on her one day as she was leaving him at the vet and savagely bit into and ripped at her breast and then gnawed her arms, and had to be not destroyed, but given euthanasia and cremated.<br />I don't know what to say about this benumbing turn.  Really I think Joy Williams is an artist whose inner artistic nature rises over and above her normal consciousness and tells us the truth in a way ordinary consciousness never could; and even here in a collection of non-fictional essays she has consciously or unconsciously employed the techniques of the master story teller that she is, and left us with a queasy sense of the madness of life while demonstrating that there is so much beyond our understanding.<br />This extraordinary book should be read not so much for the overpowering arguments against our misuse of animals, or for the undeniable demonstration of our \\"ill nature,\\" but for the perfect power of her words.  Anyone with any pretension toward mastery of language ought to read Joy Williams.  In doing so we too might learn to write, as she does, in a manner that is \\"beautiful and menacing and slightly out of control.\\" (p. 210)ws too.

The persons being conversed with are mostly scientists, but there are medical practitioners, a couple of politicians, an AIDS victim, and some administrators.  There are some superstars (Martin Rees, Arthur C. Clarke, Freeman Dyson, Stephen Jay Gould, Roger Penrose) and some others who are not very well known outside their area of expertise (e.g., Luis F. Baptista, Birute Galdikas), and still others who are perhaps best known for being in the public eye (Princess Diana's psychiatrist, Susie Orbach; National Public Radio's Ira Flatow; maverick science writer John Horgan).  One has the sense that the conversations have been distilled from a larger essence.<br />The most striking interview is with Dr. Nawal M. Nour, a Sudanese-born gynecologist who treats African-American women in the Boston area who have been mutilated by so-called \\"female circumcision.\\"  Dreifus asks Nour if \\"These operations\\" are used \\"as a means of social control.\\"<br />Dr. Nour's surprising response is that \\"the people who are perpetuating the practice are usually the women themselves.\\"  She adds, \\"I find that people do it because of a deeply ingrained belief that they are protecting their daughters.  This not done to be hurtful, but out of love.\\" (pp 171-172)  Dr. Nour's prescription is to dispel such grotesque ignorance with education.<br />One of the most interesting interviews is with medical researcher Polly Matzinger, whom I've read about elsewhere.  She is the ex-Playboy bunny and waitress who famously began her scientific career when a UC Berkeley professor, Robert Swampty Schwab, to whom she was serving beer, realized her talent after hearing her ask, \\"Why has no animal ever mimicked a skunk?\\"  She is currently a leading proponent of the exciting idea that it is not \\"self\\" and \\"non-self\\" that our immune system distinguishes between, but instead between the benign and the dangerous.  This is a radical idea that is \\"turning the world of immunology upside down.\\"  (p. 191)<br />Perhaps the most unusual \\"scientist\\" interviewed (at least in terms of his occupation) is self-styled \\"forensic mathematician\\" Charles Brenner.  He does the mathematical calculations necessary to analyze DNA evidence.<br />The interview with physicist Freeman J. Dyson is interesting mainly because Dreifus got him to voice lukewarm support for the idea that Werner Heisenberg, Hitler's most talented physicist (and subject of the recent play Copenhagen) in part kept the bomb from the Nazis by not giving the project \\"the kind of push it needed.\\"  Dreifus also elicited Dyson's opposition to Bush's new Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars redux) \\"because the system doesn't work, mostly because it can be easily outwitted.\\" (p. 22)<br />As a sometime sampler of \\"food supplements\\" I was interested in the conversation with Stephen E. Straus, the virologist who serves as Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in our government's National Institute of Health.  He has a $90-million budget to test alternative approaches to medicine.  This is significant because no one else has the resources do this sort of research on a scale large enough to be worthwhile.  The drug companies will not do extensive research on food supplements because they can't patent the supplements and therefore feel such an investment will not pay off.<br />I enjoyed reading this collection and was intrigued to see how much Dreifus did with the limited space she had available for each interview.  Her disarming style with a sharp sense of how to probe often overcame the inevitable superficiality inherent in conversations lasting only about six pages each.  A case in point is the question she springs on celebrity psychiatrist, Susie Orbach:  \\"Your highly influence 1978 book, Fat is a Feminist Issue, posited the idea that some women had eating disorders because they had been undernurtured by their mothers.  Do you still believe that?\\"  This is the kind of question--like \\"Do you still beat your wife?\\"--that one doesn't have to stick around to hear the answer to.  The point has been made.  Orbach does allow that if she were writing that book today, she \\"wouldn't write it in the same way.\\"able superficiality inherent in conversations lasting only about six pages each.

1481787:US	49786731	RCGM9HZCE5LHA	0679723250	525245685	The Postman Always Rings Twice	Books	4	94	103	N	N	Hemingway stream-lined and accelerated	I spent some time trying to find out why this potboiler turned literature is called \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" since at no place in the novel is a postman even mentioned.  At first I thought it might be an echo of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, dreamt up by Knopf, Cain's publisher, to lend some literary pretension to a novel they weren't sure about; but that play wasn't written until some years after Postman was published  in 1934.  It was recently suggested to me (by Joseph Feinsinger, one of Amazon.com's best reviewers of literature) that it might be a rejoinder for the saying \\"opportunity knocks only once,\\" which was the sort of pabulum given to out of work people during the depression.  Cain's original title was \\"Bar-B-Que,\\" which is entirely appropriate for a couple of reasons (the caf&eacute;, the burning car), but was perhaps a little too morbid for Knopf's sensibilities.<br /><br />At any rate, the title finally chosen is somewhat magical as is the novel itself, the first of Cain's hard-boiled, loser tales that somehow caught the imagination and psyche of depression America.  Re-reading the novel today one wonders why, but then again, I can see why.<br /><br />First there's the raw sex with Frank forcing himself onto Cora, biting her lip, etc. and she loving it, that was somewhat shocking for its time.  Ditto for the spontaneous sex they have in the dirt outside the car after Frank has beamed Nick.  Then there is the fascination we have with stupid people doing vile deeds rather clumsily (with whom we might identify).  But more than anything else it's the style.  Cain raised the dime novel to something amazing with his no nonsense, no time to chat, no description beyond the absolutely necessary--a pared-down to raw flesh and bones writing style that made even some of the icons of literature sit up and take notice.  Edmund Wilson, long the dean of American literary critics, was intrigued by the novel, as was Franklin P Adams who called it \\"the most engrossing, unlaydownable book that I have any memory of.\\"  (Quoted from Paul Skenazy's critical work, James M. Cain (1989), pp. 20-21).  And Albert Camus said that his internationally famous masterpiece The Stranger was based in part on Postman.  The alternate English title, \\"The Outsider,\\" perhaps reveals its debt to Cain more clearly.  Today the sex seems rather tame and the terse style seems almost a burlesque, having been so often imitated.  I personally think that Cain, who was a one-time editor of The New Yorker and a relatively sophisticated literary man, was actually taking Hemingway's primer-prose style to its logical conclusion by simply cutting out all of Hemingway's poetic repetitions and anything else that didn't move the plot.<br /><br />Well, how well does this stand up after almost seventy years?  It was made into two movies, a 1946 version starring John Garfield and Lana Turner and a 1981 version starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, which you might want to compare.  You can read the novel faster than you can watch either movie.  I read it in an hour and I'm no speed reader.  There was also a play and, believe it or not, an opera.  The atmosphere is suburban naturalistic, set in the environs of Glendale, California, just north of L.A. where there really are (or mostly were) oak trees.  (The name of the caf&eacute; is the Twin Oaks.)  The story is a little confused in parts, and a little unlikely elsewhere (Cora really would not be such an adept at gun toting, and the Frank would not be so quick to fall for the D.A.'s line of chatter and turn on Cora, nor could Nick be quite so blind to the hanky-panky going on behind his back).  But what Cain got so, so very right was the underlying psychology.  This is a classic triangle, the old guy with the resources who can't cut the mustard anymore with a young wife who longs for love, a little excitement and to be rid of \\"that greasy Greek.\\"  Even deeper (and this is characteristic of Cain) is the suggestion that Nick encouraged Frank and kept him around, using his presence to spice up his own libido.  Furthermore, Frank is a kind of depression-era anti-hero, who beat up on the hated railway dicks, the kind of guy who has become a film noir staple, a man who acts out his basic desires in an amoral, animalistic way.  I see woman.  I take woman.  I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and sleep when I run out of gas, a kind of natural man on the run, the kind of guy we think we would like to be for a change (a brief change) in our daydreams around two p.m. on a blue Monday afternoon.<br /><br />Cain followed this up with Double Indemnity (using some insurance fraud research he had left over).  Double Indemnity appeared as a serial in Liberty magazine after being rejected by Redbook.  It was also made into a classic Billy Wilder movie starring Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson in 1944 a year after it finally appeared in book form.<br /><br />Cain, along with Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Nathanael West and later Ross MacDonald created a kind of southern California milieu that Hollywood has mined again and again with such postmodern films as, e.g., Chinatown (1974) and L.A.

These life forms, previously unknown, are now believed by some to constitute a majority of the shear weight of life on this planet.  That life can exist without oxygen has long been known (indeed the first life forms lived without oxygen), but to exist without the products of photosynthesis, at least the indirect products, was thought impossible.  Now we know that some life forms can use purely chemical means for obtaining energy, and do not need sunlight at all.<br />David W. Wolfe, Associate Professor of Plant Ecology at Cornell, fired by his own enthusiasm for things extreme and underground, explores these ideas and findings in a captivating way in this informative book.  He begins with the soil, what it is made of, how it was formed.  \\"In a handful of typical healthy soil there are more creatures than there are humans on the entire planet,\\" he advises us on page one.  He explores the relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and their above ground symbionts, noting that within that same handful of soil there are \\"hundreds of miles of fungal threads.\\"  There are also within one square yard of soil \\"billions of microscopic roundworms called nematodes, anywhere from a dozen to several hundred of the much larger earthworms, and 100,000 to 5000,000 insects and other arthropods.\\"  He points out that many of these creatures \\"defy classification; they simply have never been seen before.\\" (p. 2)<br />One of the problems that scientists encounter in trying to study the microorganisms of the soil is that they can't culture them in the lab.  \\"They can't survive when isolated from their neighbors,\\" Wolfe writes.  And therein lies perhaps the central tale of this extremely interesting book, namely that we are all of an ecology here on this planet earth, and the interactions and mutualisms and co-dependencies of our existence are as yet only dimly perceived.  Remember the biosphere experiment in the Arizona desert some years ago?  It failed because the participants had no idea how to create a self-sustaining ecosystem mainly because they were ignorant of the work of the myriad creatures that live in, on, and under the soil.<br />Wolfe explores the relatively new (and very exciting) idea that life on earth did not begin in something like Darwin's warm pond, but instead deep underground, safe and secure from the horrendous activities on the surface.  This idea is what is currently firing our excitement about exploring under the surface of Mars and some of the moons of the gas giants in search of the life that we now know might exist there.  He looks into clay as the precursor of bio-replication, and as a catalyst, showing how clay crystals \\"have an organized structure\\" that is \\"heritable just as the mutations of real genes are.\\" (p. 29)<br />Wolfe also explores how earthworms, prairie dogs and other life forms help to create the top soil upon which our life on earth depends.  He looks into the work of Carl Woese and explains how the tree of life was shaken to its very roots by Woese's discovery of a new domain of life, and how the tree was reconstructed into a \\"universal tree of life\\" containing three distinct domains, Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya.  Woese and others did this through rRNA analysis.  It is revolutionary to note that the base of the tree on page 65 is shaded entirely with \\"heat-loving microbes,\\" the extremophiles now recognized as our ancient ancestors.<br />There is so much more to discuss in this modest, yet highly informative book, including the chemical warfare practiced by soil microbes, their importance in medicine, agriculture, and in maintaining the homeostasis of the planet, and the threat from human activities, topsoil erosion, acid rain, etc.  But let me summarize by saying as I read this book I was struck once again with the massive interdependence of all life, forcing me to see mutualism and cooperation between and among species as the fundamental basis of life and not the long revered concept of competition.  I suspect that before long the general view of life on earth will be one of diversity in harmony; indeed, I am becoming more and more convinced that the idea of Gaia, the planet as a life form itself, is a viable one.<br />Professor Wolfe ends the book with a warning not to \\"naively assume that science and technology will come up with a quick fix to avert the environmental train wreck we are headed toward.\\"  (p. 185).  It is only through knowledge and a \\"tempering of our aggressive instinct to &lt;conquer nature>\\" that we will be able \\"to protect the living soil resource for future generations.\\" (p. 186)n, etc.  But let me summarize by saying as I read this book I was struck once again with the massive interdependence of all life, forcing me to see mutualism and cooperation between and among species as the fundamental basis of life and not the long revered concept of competition.

It is definitely NOT the best book I've read on the science of aging.  Better are: Austad, Steven N. Why We Age: What Science Is Discovering about the Body's Journey Through Life. (1997); Clark, William R. A Means to an End: The Biological Basis of Aging and Death (1999); and Hayflick, Leonard. How and Why We Age (1994)--see my reviews at Amazon.com.  All three of these books explain aging and the evolutionary necessity for death better than Olshansky and Carnes.<br />I think what Andrew Weil liked about this book is the authors' endorsement of alternative medicine and their mention of Dr. Weil as \\"a leading proponent of this approach...emphasizing the importance of the natural healing and protective powers of the body in a way that is identical to that of evolutionary medicine.\\" (pp. 146-147)  It should be understood that while the authors endorse the principles of evolutionary medicine they do not endorse the use of many popular food supplements as a means of gaining longevity, including some advocated by Dr. Weil.  Of course, Weil advocates their use for \\"optimum health\\" not as a means to anything like immortality.  See his engaging best-seller, Eating Well for Optimum Health: The Essential Guide to Food, Diet, and Nutrition (2000).<br />What this book has going for it is a clear statement of the demographic facts about aging and death, and some good arguments explaining why the facts are as they are and not as we would like them to be.  In particular, we are warned about the \\"Prolongevists\\" who make unsubstantiated claims about the possibility of living very long lives or of attaining immortality.  They begin with the Taoists and the alchemists, through Roger Bacon and Luigi Cornaro, to the unnamed \\"advocates of extreme prolongevity\\" who, it is implied, believe that \\"meditating and eating fresh fruits and vegetables\\" will lead to \\"an ageless body and timeless mind,\\" (p. 235), and they debunk them all.  In a sense, theirs is an extended argument against buying any snake oil (in bottle or book form) that promises anything beyond the actuary tables.  Clearly Olshansky and Carnes see their book as a clear-eyed \\"answer\\" to authors like Deepak Chopra , the mesmerizing author of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind (1993) and many other books, who would have us believe in pollyannaish possibilities.<br />While I agree that some kind of counter balance to the feel-good fuzziness of some New Age authors is necessary, I think that Olshansky and Carnes may have hurt their cause by not emphasizing the fact that humans need hope perhaps as much as they need factual knowledge. Furthermore, I think the authors may have aimed a little below their readership; witness the fact that the word \\"senescence\\" virtually does not appear in the book and is not in the index.  Also, do they really think that their readers need to be advised (see page 35) that Tao is pronounced \\"Dow\\"?<br />Nonetheless, this is an attractive book and an easy read.  I particularly liked the chapter on antioxidants, which makes it clear that such supplements are unlikely to be of any value in fighting senescence.  Also excellent is the Appendix which is a \\"Life Table\\" giving years and days of life remaining for males and females at any age from 0 to 110 along with the probability of living to the next birthday.  If you're male and a year old all the way up to being 29-years-old, you have a 99.9 percent probability of living to your next birthday.  If you're a female, extend that to age 41.  If you're a fifty-year-old woman, you have, on average, 11,651 days of life left.will lead to \\"an ageless body and timeless mind,\\" (p. 235), and they debunk them all.

What animal now regularly eats the avocado whole, swallows the seed and excretes it far from the tree in a steamy, nourishing pile of dung?  No such animal exists in the Western Hemisphere to which the avocado is native.  (Barlow reports that elephants in Africa, where the avocado has been introduced, eat the avocado and do indeed excrete its pit whole.)<br />How about the mango with its pulp that adheres so tightly to the rather large pit?  As Barlow surmises, such fruits were \\"designed\\" for mutualists that would take the fruit whole and let the pit pass through their digestive systems to emerge intact for germination away from the mother tree.  Note that the avocado pit is not only too large to pass comfortably through the digestive system of any current native animal of the Americas, but is also highly toxic so that such an animal would have quickly learned not to chew it.  Note too that the mango pit is extremely hard, thus encouraging a large animal to swallow it along with the closely adhering pulp rather than try to chew it or spit it out.  Consider also the papaya.  The fruit are large and soft so that a large animal could easily take one into its mouth and just mash it lightly and swallow.  Note too that the fruits of the papaya tree grow not high in the tree, nor is the tree a low lying bush.  Instead the tree is taller than a bush but its fruits are clustered at a height supermarket convenient for a large animal to pluck.<br />Barlow considers a number of other trees, the honey locust and the osage orange, for example, as examples of ecological anachronisms, trees that have out-lived their mutualists and consequently must form new partnerships with other seed distributors or face extinction.  For those trees that have pleased humans, the avocado, the mango, the papaya, etc., there is no immediate danger, but some other trees are at the edge of extinction.  Their fruits fall to the ground and stay there until they rot.  New trees grow only down hill when an occasional flood of water moves their fruit to a new location.<br />Barlow also sees ghosts from the Mesozoic era.  She writes, \\"Ghosts of dinosaurs are easy to conjure in October and November wherever city landscapers planted ginkgo trees...even when I forget to look for the ghosts of dinosaurs my nose alerts me to their presence.  Only a carrion eater could find the odor of fallen ginkgo fruit appealing.  Before beginning this book, I wrongly blamed the alcoholic homeless for the vomitlike stench in Washington Square Park.\\" (p. 12)<br />In short this book is about those trees--anachronisms--have been without their mutualists since the mass extinction of the megafauna of the Western Hemisphere that took place about 13,000 years ago.  It is a popular expansion on some original work done by ethnologist Daniel H. Janzen and paleontologist Paul S. Martin, their seminal paper appearing in the journal Science in 1982.  Connie Barlow's prose is not only very readable, but is full of the excitement of scientific discovery, vivid and concrete, and packed with an amazing amount of information so that not only the trees described, but the giant sloths, mastodons and mammoths--the ghosts of harvests past--come alive on the pages.<br />What Barlow does more than anything is open our eyes to the ecological nature of fruit and the relationships that exist between trees and the animals that eat the fruit.  We learn how color, taste, aroma, texture, nutritional value, toughness of rind, size, shape, number of seeds and how they are encased, etc.--how all these qualities of fruit have evolved to entice the animals that will faithfully distribute the seeds, but also how some qualities discourage other animals, \\"pulp thieves\\" or \\"seed predators,\\" that benefit from the food provided by the tree, but do not help in its propagation.<br />The story of the desert gourd was of particular interest to me because during many walks in the chaparral and deserts of California I have come across this vine with its hard, dry and unattractive gourds that were never picked or eaten.  Barlow theorizes that the plant is also an anachronism, and that there did exist in the past animals that found the gourds, if not delicious, at least palatable.<br />Another curious anachronism reported on is the devil's claw of the Chihuahuan desert of Mexico.  This plant produces a most amazing apparatus that wraps itself around an animal's foot and claw-like clings to the animal, dribbling its seeds to the ground as the animal moves.  There is a photo of the claw on page 151 wrapped around a human ankle.  Incidentally, the text is enhanced by a number of interesting black and white photos of the trees and their fruits.<br />This is one of the most interesting and original books on evolution that I have read in recent years, and one of the most informative.ties discourage other animals, \\"pulp thieves\\" or \\"seed predators,\\" that benefit from the food provided by the tree, but do not help in its propagation.<br />The story of the desert gourd was of particular interest to me because during many walks in the chaparral and deserts of California I have come across this vine with its hard, dry and unattractive gourds that were never picked or eaten.

He finds adult pornography tolerable, even believing that \\"The positive aspects of...legal adult material should be stressed.\\" (p. 222).  But he is clearly opposed to child pornography, believing that it should remain illegal and that we should take measures to reduce its existence to a tolerable level.<br />I was reminded of the war against agricultural pests because what Professor Jenkins stresses is that it is impossible to get rid of child porn on the Net completely without destroying much of what is good about the Net.  In trying to completely kill all the pests, we may inadvertently kill all the beneficial insects as well.<br />This book is ostensibly about the \\"kiddie porn\\" culture on the Web, its extent and what can be done about it.  Jenkins uses quotes from child porn Bulletin Boards to demonstrate the mind set of the traffickers.  He describes a war between citizen vigilante groups and the child pornographers, each employing their hacker expertise in trying to shut down the Web sites and expose the identities of their adversaries.  Jenkins does not describe child pornography other than in the most general terms.  He claims not to have actually seen any child pornography himself, noting that it is illegal to view such material even for research purposes, and indeed intimates that had he seen such material he would deny having seen it.<br />The picture that emerges is of a deviant, global community populated by persons hiding behind nicknames and proxies who view and exchange pictures of children through sites and servers from many different places in the world.  Jenkins believes that because of the differing laws in the various countries, child pornography cannot be completely eliminated, that it can only be controlled.  He depicts the regular deviants themselves as savvy, elusive individuals who change identities and addresses as they stay one step ahead of the law.  Only the amateurs get caught.<br />But there is a bigger issue here emerging out of the struggle between law enforcement and the deviants, and that is the issue of privacy.  How can we simultaneously monitor the Web sufficiently to trap, expose and prosecute child pornographers while at the same time protecting ourselves from Big Brother?<br />Jenkins begins Chapter Six, \\"Policing the Net,\\" with a revealing quote from Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems, a man who ought to know what he is talking about: \\"You already have zero privacy--get over it.\\"  My feeling is that our government and the large corporations already have enough information about us to serve a totalitarian regime (should one ever emerge).  Every key stroke on Web can be monitored, recorded and stored.  Right now this information is being used mostly for commercial purposes, but we can see how such information could be used to influence, intimidate and control individuals for political purposes.  Consequently what this book is really about is the war between the interests of society and those of the individual, the social good verses private interest.<br />This war is of course as old as humanity, going back even into the tribal culture.  But never before has there been such power to coerce and persuade.  The tribal leader may have been all powerful within his tribe, so that if you went against him, you would meet with defeat.  But you could run away to another place in the world, as humans have always done.  Today, and increasingly tomorrow, there is and will be no place to run to.<br />One of the fears we have of one-world government, now enormously augmented with electronic and computer technology, as Jenkins notes, is that of a totalitarian state from which there is no escape.  Our fear is that we will conform to the dictates of that state or we will be punished and \\"retrained.\\"  The Orwellian nightmare in comparison seems limited and amateurish.<br />So the struggle against the very real and intolerable evil of child pornography becomes in this book a precursor scenario of the struggle of the state against the individual.  What Jenkins wants to see happen is some kind of control placed on the invasive nature of the state while somehow maintaining the ability to go after anti-social deviants like the child pornographers.  Somehow the state must be restrained but the bad guys controlled.ted and amateurish.<br />So the struggle against the very real and intolerable evil of child pornography becomes in this book a precursor scenario of the struggle of the state against the individual.

The articles are chosen from a wide spectrum of publications from the year 2000, including Scientific American, National Geographic, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Harper's, The Atlantic Monthly, etc., which means most of the essays were written in 1999 or thereabouts.  There is a minor concentration on the exciting developments in genetics and microbiology, including \\"The Recycled Generation\\" by Stephen S. Hall, which is about stem-cell research; \\"The Genome Warrior\\" by Richard Preston, which is about Craig Ventor and the human genome project; \\"DNA on Trial\\" by Peter J. Boyer, focusing on lawyers Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld's Innocence Project; and a couple of articles on AIDS, \\"The Mystery of AIDS in South Africa\\" by Helen Epstein and \\"The Virus and the Vaccine\\" by Debbie Bookchin and Jim Schumacher.<br />My favorite piece was \\"The Small Planets\\" by Erik Asphaug where I learned a little about the surprising physics of asteroids, in particular that they are most likely composed of rubble held lightly together by low gravity instead of being solid objects.  When they collide, the \\"rubble piles\\" are disturbed, but within a few hours most of the pieces come back together again if the collision was not too violent.  I also particularly liked John Terborgh's piece \\"In the Company of Humans\\" in which he demonstrates that animals can be attracted to humans for reasons as diverse as safety in numbers (like different species of birds foraging together) or being fascinated by a lemon-scented detergent used by a primatologist.  He relates the story of a sick peccary that hung out near humans until it got well, that way avoiding hungry jaguars.  Also fascinating was Greg Critser's \\"Let Them Eat Fat\\" which is about how the fast food industry is \\"super-sizing\\" us into obesity.  (By the way, I tried for the first time a few months ago a Krispy Kreme donut, just to see what all the fuss was about.  It was a warm puppy of an \\"empty-calorie\\" confection, pure white flour, made almost as light as air, smothered in fat and glazed with pure white sugar.  It practically melted in my mouth.  I can see how a steady diet of these babies could lead to a nutritional nightmare.)<br />Also good were Andrew Sullivan's \\"The He Hormone\\" about the phenomenon of testosterone, and Jacques Leslie\\"s \\"Running Dry\\" which is about the mixed blessing (and ultimate failure) of damming rivers, and the present and future crisis in the supply of fresh water.<br />There is a sprinkling of rather ordinary pieces by scientific heavyweights, John Archibald Wheeler, Ernst Mayr, Stephen Jay Gould, and Freeman J. Dyson, which are collected here perhaps as much for the prestige they lend to this volume as for the value of the essays.  But you be the judge.<br />The interesting articles by Joel Achenbach and Robert L. Park, \\"Life Beyond Earth\\" and \\"Welcome to Planet Earth,\\" respectively, serve well as introductions to their recently published books, Captured by Aliens: The Search for Life and Truth in a Very Large Universe (1999), and Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud (2000), again, respectively.<br />Bottom line: this eminently accessible collection is well worth the candle.t.

These are wonders of the world both modern and ancient.  They need to be saved, and they need to be seen.  I wish I could see them all.  This book is as close as I'll ever get.  I have, though, stood in the redwood forest of California and felt the sense of awe that so inspired Muir, a sense of being inside the sacred cathedral of nature.  My senses were hushed and my spirit elevated.  I wonder what Reagan thought when he stood there (as he undoubtedly did).  Perhaps he wondered how many cubic feet of timber the tallest tree in the world might yield.<br />There are eighteen chapters, each devoted to different types of tree with specimens over a thousand years old, from the majestic redwood to the strange welwitschia, the \\"dwarf tree of the Namib desert,\\" which reaches a height of only about five feet, and produces but a single pair of leaves in its lifetime, which can extend to two thousand years.  Other chapters are devoted to fig trees, mighty oaks, sweet chestnuts, limes, olives, yews, cedar, gingko, the Montezuma Cypress, and of course the Bristlecone Pine, the oldest tree of all with one specimen, the Methuselah tree, said to be over 4,700 years old.<br />The colorful photographs from around the world by Edward Parker are beautiful, lavish and give us a sense of the enduring presence of the trees in their settings.  There is a map of the world with numbered bullets to show locations.<br />The text, which tends to the cloying at times, alas, could use some work.  Such boilerplate sentences as \\"Yet today, despite all the research that has taken place, the Amazon continues to be an awesome and mysterious place that holds many secrets\\" (p. 60) are all too frequent.  Would that the text were more devoted to the simple sharing of factual information about the flowering of the trees, pollination, pollinators, seed dispersal, and perhaps about related species.  The attempt to wed the trees to the ancient myths of indigenous peoples or to fix the \\"religious significance\\" of the trees has its place, but is takes up too much of the text here.  I would prefer more information on the ecology of the trees.  In the chapter on the majestic European limes, nowhere is it mentioned that these are not citrus trees!  (Or am I the only one to think that a lime tree might be a citrus tree?)<br />The sometimes careless editing also detracts from the beauty of this book.  While it may be forgiven that \\"gingko\\" is spelled two different ways (\\"gingko\\" and \\"ginkgo\\") on the same page (e.g., on pages, 19, 182, 183), it is not acceptable to have a photo of Brazilian nuts mistakenly identified as pods (p. 63).

The victim, 79-year-old Philip Bondy, was found dead with blood everywhere and his face \\"frozen in a twisted mask of pain.\\" (p. 24)  Turns out that Bondy was just a stand-in for his Jungian shrink, one Dr. Gregg Furth who first sought the operation for himself.  It seems that both he and his patient suffered from \\"a fetish or paraphilia known as apotemnophilia.\\"  Whitlock explains: \\"The fetish is also referred to as a self-demand amputation, and involves primarily men who wish to have amputation of a lower extremity for psychological and sometimes sexual reasons.  Dr. Furth stated he had been aware of wanting his own leg removed since his early childhood.\\" (p. 29)<br />Whitlock, who has appeared on TV's Oprah, Regis and Kathie Lee, Hard Copy, Extra and Inside Edition, follows this with Chapter 2, \\"A Brief History of MediScams: From Snake Oil to Cancer Quackery.\\"  Then he returns to contemporary times and shares what he has found out about \\"Dangerous Doctors,\\" managed care, nursing homes, \\"Dental MediScams,\\" etc.  He comes down heavily on incompetent and fake doctors and on the medical profession for not weeding them out.  Seems that you have to be a combination of Dr. Dracula and the Son of Sam to get the profession to notice that you've gone astray.  He also goes after bogus cures and questions the efficacy of some alternative medical approaches.  There's a chapter on the placebo effect including some material about the so-called psychic healers of the Philippines.

Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden	Books	4	38	45	N	N	Readable journalistic overview	If you don't know the difference between al-Qaeda and the Taliban (and before September 11 &#8219;01, I sure did not) or if you're a little fuzzy about where Yemen is in relation to Afghanistan, this an excellent book.  Peter Bergen is CNN's terrorism analyst and an experienced reporter.  He uses a wide range of sources including his own experience to describe the al-Qaeda terrorist organization.  There's even a map of the Middle East that you can refer to as you read.<br />But those with some expertise in the world of the mindless jihad masters and the issuance of pretentious fatwas will find this rather limited, I would imagine.  We don't really get \\"Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden,\\" but rather are provided with a narrative distilled from numerous news accounts augmented with Bergen's interviews and travel experiences.  Essentially, we stay outside the organization (but so did the CIA).  Furthermore, Bergen's \\"Holy War, Inc.\\" characterization of al-Qaeda as a kind of multinational corporation is exactly the sort of catchy, but superficial and misleading designation that irritates the cognoscenti.  Al-Qaeda does not turn a profit, nor does it look to turn a profit.  It exists on funds raised from charities, from donations from Muslim fat cat businessmen, from bin Laden's inheritance and from funds siphoned from various commercial enterprises, both legal and illegal, and from what it can beg, borrow and steal.  It would perhaps be more accurate to designate al-Qaeda as a Mephistophelian service organization.  Perhaps \\"The Black Crescent\\" would be an appropriate agnomen.<br />Nonetheless, to Bergen's credit this is not the usual sort of \\"rush to judgment\\" volume churned out by book publishers to take advantage of a major news event.  Bergen had the book finished in August and apparently was working on the proofs when the planes crashed into the World Trade Center buildings on September 11.  At that point of course the book was reshaped and spun to tie in with that event so that Bergen's interview with bin Laden (aired on CNN May 10, 1997) forms part of a Prologue entitled, \\"How to Find the World's Most Wanted Man.\\"<br />The strength of the book is in its readability and in the sense that Bergen gives us of  what it is like to be an international journalist today (and for those out in the field, it is dangerous to be sure). Characteristically, Bergen describes his trek to and into Afghanistan including the wearing of blindfolds during the last leg to bin Laden's hideout.  This personal experience view continues throughout the book and is one of the book's strengths--although of course Bergen does want to make sure we understand that he is more than a \\"put on the make up and read the cue cards\\" sort of journalist.<br />What Bergen notices, and what he reports to us, tell us as much about Bergen as about the world of the terrorist.  He reports on the food and what the taxi drivers say.  He notices the terrain, the weapons, the dress of the men he meets, and he gives us a good feel for the conditions he and other journalists encounter.  What is missing, at least from my point of view, is a cohesive overall understanding or perspective.  Perhaps the events are so new, and the trees of the forest so mesmerizingly vivid that it is impossible as yet to discern the larger picture.<br />But Bergen does attempt a larger understanding.  He compares al-Qaeda to the infamous Assassins, founded as an Ismailian sect in what was then Persia in 1090.  Supposedly under the influence of hashish, the Assassins brought death and destruction on Christian Crusaders for upwards of two hundred years.  (It remains to be seen how long al-Qaeda lasts.)  I found it revealing to learn that the head of the Assassins was referred to as \\"the old man of the mountain\\" (according to Webster's Second International), just the sort of personage that bin Laden would idolize and try to emulate.<br />Bergen also attempts a little political philosophy by critiquing Harvard professor Samuel Huntington's \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" thesis in the Afterward, but not very successfully, I might say, since the tribal and fundamentalist world view of the Taliban and al-Qaeda supporters really is in a monumental collision with Western modernity.<br />Bottom line: this is a good book, a little superficial and a little thin, but then, so's the news.quing Harvard professor Samuel Huntington's \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" thesis in the Afterward, but not very successfully, I might say, since the tribal and fundamentalist world view of the Taliban and al-Qaeda supporters really is in a monumental collision with Western modernity.<br />Bottom line: this is a good book, a little superficial and a little thin, but then, so's the news.	2002-06-12

Synergy Fitness for Time-Crunched Adults	Books	5	139	149	N	N	Promising; worth a shot	The interesting argument in this attractive and thorough (and well-researched, by the way) fitness training book is the idea that anaerobic exercise will promote the release of the Human Growth Hormone in our bodies and thereby lead to weight control and a reversal of the metabolic slow down associated with aging beginning in our middle years.<br />Anaerobic exercise (as contrasted with aerobic exercise) is sprint training, not endurance training.  When we sprint we use muscle fibers that Campbell identifies as \\"fast type IIx\\" as opposed to \\"slow type I\\" used in long distance running.  The use of these \\"fast twitch\\" muscles leads to the increased production and release of the growth hormone.  Since it is all the rage in some circles (e.g., Hollywood) to take injections of the growth hormone at a cost of about $12,000 a year (it is not effective taken orally), a program that allows us to produce the growth hormone naturally would be a godsend.  Our bodies as we grow older produce less and less of the growth hormone and this has been linked to what Campbell calls \\"somatopause,\\" the well-known phenomenon leading to weight gain, middle-age spread and a slower metabolism.<br />I have little doubt that if my body would produce more growth hormone I would be able to control my weight and perhaps look and feel better.  I feel pretty good as I am, but since I gave up playing basketball five years ago, I have gained about 12 pounds.  It's worse than that, however, because I have lost probably about ten or 15 pounds of muscle mass, so in fact I am now carrying around 25 to 30 more pounds of pure fat!  I was able to control my weight with the sort of ease that Campbell describes in this book when I was playing basketball (which is sprinting and more) three times a week.  I could (as Campbell claims he can) eat whatever I wanted whenever I wanted, and never had to worry about my weight.  I realized in a flash while reading this book that indeed what I had been doing playing basketball was anaerobic exercise.<br />The essence of Campbell's program--or at least the part that interests me--calls for no high fat foods one hour before anaerobic training and no sugar foods for two hours afterward.  This will stimulate fat-burning.  I know from personal experience that this is true.  When you're doing some serious anaerobics three or four times a week, you just naturally eat less, and less often.  I always thought this was because my system made me less hungry because it didn't want to divert its energies to the digestion of any more food than was necessary.  But perhaps it is the release of the growth hormone that leads to the desire to eat less.<br />Regardless of how this works, it does work.  But the problem for someone older than Campbell (he's fifty) is that it is very, very difficult to engage in a training program that involves sprinting because it too easy to pull, tear or strain muscles which take a relatively long time to heal.  This is the \\"catch-22\\" of growing older.  It's hard to exercise enough to get into and stay in shape because you're always coming up lame.  However, Campbell presents a carefully balanced and well-thought out program that just may allow those over fifty to get into shape and exercise anaerobically on a regular basis.  (This program will definitely work for those younger who are in good health.)<br />He uses the trendy word \\"synergy\\" in the title because he believes it is the synergistic effect of the total program, including weight training, proper diet and the combination of anaerobic and aerobic exercise that leads to fitness and an increase in the production of the growth hormone.<br />Bottom-line question: Will this work?  Quick answer: I don't know.  Campbell himself is the very picture of health with the well-muscled, but lean body of a decathlon champion.  When I was fifty I too was in great shape (although I was not as strong as Campbell), and looking back I can say that it was playing basketball on a regular basis that did it.  I can no longer play basketball but perhaps I can sprint and weight train.  I'm going to give it a try.egular basis that did it.

The underlying theme is something like the benign madness of conspiracy theorists.<br /><br />The first \\"them\\" is Omar Bakri Mohammed, \\"The Semi-Detached Ayatollah,\\" who billed himself as Osama bin Laden's man in the U.K.  He comes off looking like a charmingly pathetic, on the dole, sweet old man who just happens to have this rude habit of declaring jihads on non-Muslim people.<br /><br />Next Ronson takes us to \\"Ruby Ridge\\" Idaho so we can meet the gun-totin' separatists and their Aryan Nation buddies.  They come across as the victims of an FBI riot.  Next we meet Big Jim Tucker who writes for a daffy underground journal called The Spotlight that is fascinated with \\"The Secret Rulers of the World,\\" sometimes known as the Bilderbergers.  Ronson gets way into the Bilderbergers, who allegedly include such Illuminati as Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, Umberto Agnelli, the Rothchilds, etc., chasing after them to Portugal and northern California, where he eavesdrops on their \\"bizarre pagan owl ritual,\\" ultimately seeing their antics as the high jinks of good old college boys who haven't totally grown up.<br /><br />There's a romp through the jungle (while eating rat) with Dr. Ian Paisley, the anti-Papist from Ireland who comes across as a stern preacher man maniacally spreading God's word to the ignorant masses.  Ronson also has some fun with David Icke, who is accused of being anti-Semitic, but is really anti-lizard.  After some personal involvement, Ronson finds that Icke is just a guy who sincerely believes that the New World Order is controlled by the likes of George and George W. Bush, the Queen Mother, Al Gore, Kris Kristofferson, etc., who are 12-foot lizards that have cross-bred with humans.<br /><br />In the middle chapters there are encounters with the Klu Klux Klan, two versions.  There's Jeff Berry, Imperial Wizard of the American Knights of the Klu Klux Klan, who behaves like your sensible Klansman, hating everybody who's not white and Christian; and then there's Thom Robb, Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Klu Klux Klan, who doesn't truck with using the \\"n-word\\" and kisses black babies as he tries to nouveau-spin the Klan's image.  Ronson also visits Tony Kaye, a Hollywood director whose limo has \\"JEWISH\\" as a vanity plate.  Ronson makes him look blindly self-centered while recalling that \\"The $50,000 distribution costs of Birth of a Nation (1915) [a film making the KKK look good] were put up...by the twenty-eight-year-old movie novice Louis B. Mayer.\\"  Ronson adds, \\"So Jewish Hollywood was funded, in part, by the heroic positive images of the Klansmen in Birth of a Nation.\\"  He also checks in with the Anti-Defamation League in New York and makes them look a little on the prejudicial side since they continue to insist that \\"lizards\\" is a code word for \\"Jews.\\"<br /><br />There is definitely something to be said for taking the edge off the horror of hate-mongers by turning them into objects of humor.  Ronson is clever and he is funny.  There's a nice running irony throughout because he is Jewish.  The fact that he was able to befriend people who hate Jews is to his credit.  What Ronson seems to be saying is that laughter is a good defense against hate, something like \\"laughter is the best medicine,\\" and I'm sure that's true to some extent.  I can't imagine however that Osama bin Laden, for example, has much of a sense of humor.<br /><br />An interesting sideline here is the realization that newspapers headlines and CNN sound bytes fail to paint a realistic picture of what extremists are like.  Ronson, within the limits of his intent, does that.  He makes them human, and in that way partially disarms them, recalling to my mind the old saying, \\"No man is a hero to his valet.\\"  Maybe for his next gig, Ronson could find and visit bin Laden's four wives and record their bickering and their (inevitably) less than heroic apprehension of the jihad warrior.  I'm sure it would make for some good laughs.cord their bickering and their (inevitably) less than heroic apprehension of the jihad warrior.  I'm sure it would make for some good laughs.	2002-06-05

The effect on the reader is somewhat marvelous since it is obvious that Dr. Poehlmann, a systems engineer who has a PhD in Health Science, is onto something important.<br />The key idea in this enormously detailed and intensely researched volume, updated and revised from her doctoral dissertation, is that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic diseases of unclear etiology are actually caused by microorganisms.  In particular mycoplasmas and/or L-shaped bacteria, stealthy pathogens only a little larger than viruses, are to blame.<br />This is a revolution in medical thought.  RA, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, Gulf War Illness, etc., have long been thought to be autoimmune diseases, that is, diseases caused by the body's immune system attacking the body itself.  What Poehlmann is saying is that mycoplasmas cause these diseases and make them chronic because these minute pathogens are able to hide from the immune system within the body's tissues.  They are able to strategically slow down their growth and to lie dormant for months or even years only to erupt when conditions suit them, typically when the body is weakened by fatigue, stress or another illness.  By stopping their growth temporary the pathogens are able to dodge antibiotics.  By changing their shapes, especially by going without an outer cell wall (the immune system identifies pathogens by their surfaces), they are able to fool the immune system.  Consequently they are extraordinarily difficult to pin down, or to even identify, and of course even more difficult to get rid of.  Incidentally, routine blood tests apparently do NOT test for mycoplasmas. (p. 171)<br />The medical establishment, as Poehlmann points out, has been slow to embrace this theory for a number of reasons, not the least of which is simply an inability to accept new ideas that go against the conventional wisdom.  The germ theory of disease was thought some decades ago to have nearly exhausted its potential as medical theorists looked to the environment and a malfunctioning immune system as causing chronic illnesses.  But the germ theory of disease is back stronger than ever, and a revolution in the way we think about chronic disease is taking hold.<br />It was in an article in the February, 1999 edition of The Atlantic Monthly, written by Judith Hooper, that I first heard about the possibility that chronic diseases were caused by pathogens and not by genetic defects or environmental stresses.  Not only heartburn--known to have been caused by bacteria since the forties (but, amazingly enough, forgotten for decades by the medical establishment!)--but also heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's and even schizophrenia, are now thought to be caused or triggered by pathogens.  Poehlmann credits Dr. Thomas McPherson Brown as first proposing in the 1940s the theory that the primary cause of RA was bacterial infection. (p.xxvii)  One of the people responsible for igniting the current revolution is evolutionary biologist Paul W. Ewald, author of Plague Time: How Stealth Infections Cause Cancers, Heart Disease, and other Deadly Ailments (2000) which I recommend as a companion to this book.<br />Ewald's argument is that \\"Genetic traits\\" unfavorable \\"to an organism's survival or reproduction do not persist in the gene pool for very long.  Natural selection, by its very definition, weeds them out in short order.\\"  Furthermore, as Hooper notes in her article, if an environmental cause cannot be found, \\"then we must look elsewhere for the explanation.\\"  Poehlmann's research shows that microbes are the best suspects because it is these organisms that have lived in, on and around us since long before we were human, even long before we were mammals.  These parasitic creatures have formed a relationship withlarger organisms through what is referred to as the \\"evolutionary arms race\\" of pathogen and host.  This is the so-called Red Queen hypothesis (from Alice in Wonderland), in which both host and pathogen stay in the same place relative to one another by running as fast as they can.<br />What Poehlmann adds to the literature is a demonstration of the interconnectedness of chronic complaints through a focus on rheumatoid arthritis from which she has personally suffered and from which she is now free of debilitating symptoms.  She is also trying to show that the differing illnesses can be caused by the same pathogens, pathogens that may have changed form (going one up on the immune system in the evolutionary arms race).  Again and again she makes the telling suggestion to the medical establishment that more research is needed.<br />In Chapter 5, \\"Infections other than Mycoplasma,\\" Poehlmann gives us an in-depth look at a number of other chronic diseases, especially Lyme Disease and how it is transmitted and how it may be related to RA.  She also looks at HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculous, Dengue Fever, amoebic infections, hepatitis, etc., and shows what they have in common.  Included is an examination of household molds and how they can bring about RA-type symptoms and what can be done about them.<br />There is so much more here that warrants comment, but I am running out of space.  In another review I hope to concentrate on the treatments and lifestyle modifications that Poehlmann recommends especially in Chapter 7, \\"Natural Methods to Revitalize the Immune System,\\" a chapter that contains some of the best nutritional and lifestyle information that I have ever read anywhere.  By itself, it is worth the price of the book.<br />In short, Poehlmann's exciting book is a tsunami in a rising tide of information that is beginning to swamp the old ideas.  It is hoped that Poehlmann's call for the medical establishment to wake up will be heard and that there will be a major shift in research toward identifying the microbial basis of chronic disease so that we can work toward cures instead of just treating symptoms.h larger organisms through what is referred to as the \\"evolutionary arms race\\" of pathogen and host.

It is also about how politicized the concept has been historically.  From the experience of nineteenth-century biologist and illustrator Beatrix Potter whose identification of lichen as symbionts went against the established dogma as filtered through the ideas of Pasteur, to &quot;anti-communist&quot; biology as practiced by some Western scientists who saw symbiosis as supporting the collective, it is amazing how purely political ideas successfully censored the scientific.  Symbiosis has even been thought of as &quot;feminine&quot; and contrary to the noble interpretation of Darwinism as the survival of the fittest.<br />But Wakeford is able (after a fashion) to go beyond the politics and demonstrate in a most convincing manner that the symbiotic way of life is vastly more important and enormously more widespread than is usually imagined.  Most of us know that legumes work symbiotically with rhizobia bacteria to fix nitrogen in the soil so that it is available to the plant, but what surprised me is to learn that 90 percent of plants host mycorrhizal fungi (p. 167) and are therefore symbionts.  As Wakeford asks on the same page, &quot;Can we continue to simply call them plants without acknowledging their fungal dimension?  Is a cow an animal or a microbial fermentation vessel, when without the microbes, the cow would not exist?&quot;<br />Good questions, and indeed, what about humans who have microbes in our guts that help us to digest our food?  Are we in symbiosis with those microbes?  Without the beneficial bacteria in our guts, the harmful bacteria would run rampant and we would be led to disease.  Ants are not merely ants, they are farmers who harvest fungi gardens.  They and the fungi are in symbiosis, living together, dependent upon one another for their survival.  And what about termites, creatures who harbor microbes to digest the wood they eat?  The broad, general message of this book is that cooperation between species is at least as important in evolution as is competition.<br />Reading this made me think that perhaps the idea of competition in evolution is merely an anthropomorphic delusion.  Certainly Wakeford shows that our notions about parasites and who is feeding on whom, may be in error.  He writes, &quot;Rather than discrete categories, the terms _mutualist_, _parasite_, and _pathogen_ are better seen as fuzzy points on a continuum, along the length of which an association between two organisms may fluctuate.  For many associations, the point they occupy on this continuum is as difficult to assess as it is to say who gains more...in a marriage between two human partners.&quot; (p. 184)<br />There is an old saying, that I got from somewhere years ago.  It is, &quot;Everything works toward a symbiosis.&quot;  This book not only supports that idea, it even, taken further, supports the idea of Gaia, namely that all the living creatures on this planet form a single organism.  I don't necessary believe this, the &quot;strong&quot; Gaia hypothesis, but I think the distinction between a planet that harbors organisms and a planet that is itself part organism, may be more a semantic distinction than anything else.<br />Because of all we have learned about microbial life in recent decades, it is becoming clearer and clearer that no organism is an island, and indeed, all of life is in symbiosis with the microorganisms that constitute the largest, most viable life form on this planet.  Realizing this while reading Wakeford's fascinating arguments, I had a thought: the little green men from outer space are probably symbionts themselves, but more fully realized ones, like lichen, part &quot;animal&quot; and part &quot;plant,&quot; deriving their energy directly through photosynthesis.  And suddenly I had a vision of beings all seated as in meditation, taking a break to open the top of their heads, filled not with brains, but with cells capable of turning light into nourishment.

What legendary biologist Ernst Mayr might next want to share with us is his secret for remaining so mentally acute for so many years!  Reading this exposition on evolution by &quot;The world's greatest living biologist and a writer of extraordinary insight and clarity&quot; (Stephen Jay Gould, on the jacket cover) is somewhat like taking Evolution 101 as it might be taught by Professor Mayr.  As he writes in the Preface, his purpose is didactic.  He would like us to know more about evolution and how it works.<br />First he presents the evidence for evolution, explaining (I hope) once and for all how evolution can be established as a fact even though we cannot perform experiments as we might in physics or chemistry: &quot;Evolution...must be inferred from observations.  Such inferences subsequently must be tested again and again against new observations, and the original inference is either falsified or considerably strengthened...&quot; (p. 13)  He adds on page 276, &quot;I cannot see why...an overwhelming number of well-substantiated inferences is not scientifically as convincing as direct observations.  Many theories in other historical sciences, such as geology and cosmology, are also based on inferences.  The endeavor of certain philosophers to construct a fundamental difference between the two kinds of evidence strikes me as misleading.&quot;<br />To this I might add that all the evidence we have of the external world is from inference.  Even so-called direct observations (whatever they may be) are inferences from the evidence of our senses and must be checked against the same inferences that others make.<br />Next Mayr explains how change and adaptation take place.  He then explains why there is biodiversity.  These are the first three parts of the book.  Part Four is on human evolution and Chapter 11 in particular is a splendid, concise interpretation of the evidence for human evolution.<br />One of the thorny issues Mayr addresses is selection. He explains that it is the individual (the phenotype) that is selected, and not the gene and not the population.  &quot;[A] gene as such can never be the object of selection&quot; because it &quot;is only part of a genotype, whereas the phenotype of the individual as a whole (based on the genotype) is the actual object of selection.&quot; (p. 126)  The gene cannot be the object of selection for another reason, namely that a single gene seldom, if ever, acts independently of other genes.  They work together to bring about some feature of the phenotype and are subject to the action of regulatory genes (hox and pax genes). (p. 127)  Furthermore, &quot;Many genes do not have standard selective value.  A gene may be beneficial when placed in one particular genotype, but it may be deleterious when placed in a genotype with different genes.&quot; (p. 128)<br />One of the things I learned here (p. 129) is that the phenotype includes &quot;all the products of the behavioral genes.  This includes the nest a bird builds, or the web of a spider, or the path of migration of a migratory bird.&quot;  It also includes the gametes.  Thus the ability of a spermatozoon to &quot;swim&quot; is part of the phenotype and is subject to natural selection.<br />Another interesting issue is group selection.  Mayr defines two group types, &quot;casual groups&quot; and &quot;cohesive social groups.&quot;  Members of the former &quot;are associated in a group [that] makes no contribution to their fitness.&quot;  The latter, however, &quot;owing to social cooperation among its members&quot; &quot;can indeed be a target of selection.&quot;  This cleared up the group selection fuzziness for me.<br />It is interesting to note, however, that Mayr's argument seems to imply that if the cooperating group is the same as the species, then a species can be selected.  However he writes on page 280, &quot;The species as a whole is never the target of selection.&quot;  He explains that &quot;the differential success of [an] entire species is superimposed on...individual selection.&quot;  Or, if I may phrase it another way, the differential success of a species is the result of the differential success of its individual members.  What this really means, however one wishes to phrase it, is that selection can apply to an entire species (through its members).<br />A very fine example of Mayr's intelligence and sensitivity can be gleaned from reading his answer to the question on page 262, &quot;Are there human races?&quot;  There are indeed races, Mayr explains, but the &quot;race problem&quot; is a result of &quot;a faulty understanding of race.  These people,&quot; he continues, &quot;are typologists, and for them every member of a race has all the actual and imaginary characteristics of that race.  To translate this bias into an absurd example, they would assume that every African-American can run the 100-meter dash faster than any European-American.&quot;  What a race is, is a population and its members are individuals, not types.  This is true of species as well.<br />There are a number of other technical and crucial issues in evolution that Mayr addresses including saltation and punctuated equilibria, altruism, kin selection, speciation, the origin of birds, etc.  He even goes into a little exobiology on page 263.  The book includes two appendices designed to help the reader cope with criticisms and questions about evolution.  Appendix B sets forth 24 questions about evolution, such as &quot;Is evolution a fact?&quot; (yes) and &quot;Is the Gaia hypothesis incompatible with Darwinism?&quot; (no), etc.  There is a glossary and an excellent index.  There is some repetition, but I think we can take that as emphasis since this is an exercise in public education.<br />Although Mayr uses a minimum of jargon and writes in a straightforward manner, the issues are not simple.  They need to be studied to be understood and appreciated.  This is why I call this book Evolution 101 by Professor Mayr.he species as a whole is never the target of selection.&quot;  He explains that &quot;the differential success of [an] entire species is superimposed on...individual selection.&quot;  Or, if I may phrase it another way, the differential success of a species is the result of the differential success of its individual members.  What this really means, however one wishes to phrase it, is that selection can apply to an entire species (through its members).<br />A very fine example of Mayr's intelligence and sensitivity can be gleaned from reading his answer to the question on page 262, &quot;Are there human races?&quot;  There are indeed races, Mayr explains, but the &quot;race problem&quot; is a result of &quot;a faulty understanding of race.  These people,&quot; he continues, &quot;are typologists, and for them every member of a race has all the actual and imaginary characteristics of that race.  To translate this bias into an absurd example, they would assume that every African-American can run the 100-meter dash faster than any European-American.&quot;  What a race is, is a population and its members are individuals, not types.  This is true of species as well.   <br />There are a number of other technical and crucial issues in evolution that Mayr addresses including saltation and punctuated equilibria, altruism, kin selection, speciation, the origin of birds, etc.  He even goes into a little exobiology on page 263.  The book includes two appendices designed to help the reader cope with criticisms and questions about evolution.  Appendix B sets forth 24 questions about evolution, such as &quot;Is evolution a fact?&quot; (yes) and &quot;Is the Gaia hypothesis incompatible with Darwinism?&quot; (no), etc.  There is a glossary and an excellent index.  There is some repetition, but I think we can take that as emphasis since this is an exercise in public education.<br />Although Mayr uses a minimum of jargon and writes in a straightforward manner, the issues are not simple.  They need to be studied to be understood and appreciated.  This is why I call this book Evolution 101 by Professor Mayr.	2002-05-24
1547832:US	49786731	R1JS7J22ZZZRJC	0465081711	20539524	Significant Others: The Ape-Human Continuum And The Quest For Human Nature	Books	4	18	21	N	N	Flawed, but definitely worthwhile	University of Southern California anthropologist (and primatologist) Craig Stanford's thesis in this attractive but somewhat breezy (and politically considered) book is that the difference between humans and apes is one of degree and not of kind.  That is why the word \\"continuum\\" is used in the title.<br /><br />I agree with his thesis, and I think he does a great job of making the case.  His prose is readable and his enthusiasm is genuine.  However there are some problems.  In attempting to walk the tightrope of political correctness while conveying to the reader what he has learned as a scientist, Stanford sometimes slips into a fuzzy and inexplicit expression.<br /><br />To begin with (p. 16) he contends that if women \\"crave\\" men with resources (he is attempting to answer David Buss, et al.) it is \\"mainly in patriarchal societies in which they must depend on men to obtain resources and power for them.\\"  This is gratuitous because, as Stanford himself notes on page 147, \\"Human societies are, political correctness notwithstanding, universally patriarchal.\\"  Whether women would behave differently if the societies were matriarchal (or otherwise) is unknown.  Citing an isolated society in special circumstances that is matriarchal really does not prove the general case, although it does point to a range of possibilities, and that is good.  However it is ingenuous to pretend that women are not looking for resources in a mate if they can find them.  Why would a reasonable woman, given a choice, choose a poor, ineffective, unsuccessful man, to one who has the ability to help her provide for her children?<br /><br />In the same paragraph, Stanford contends that the \\"old adage about _what women want_ should more accurately be phrased as _what women can realistically hope to achieve in their cultural context_.\\"  In the first place, it's not an adage, it's a joke or a lament, and it's a question, \\"What DOES a woman want?\\"  The original is lost in the prehistory, but Ernest Jones attributed these words to Freud: \\"The great question...which I have not been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is _What does a woman want?_\\"  This is probably the source that Stanford had in mind--and, by the way, this is a question that evolutionary psychology has largely answered, much to the dismay of those who would prefer to keep the mystery.  In the second place it is NOT enough to merely say \\"in their cultural context.\\"  There is a biological context as well, exemplified by nine months of being pregnant, and several years of intense maternal responsibility that is fundamental to all cultures that can't be explained away as something from the patriarchy unless you believe that human biology itself is patriarchal.<br /><br />There is also Stanford's summary dismissal of evolutionary psychology in Chapter 8 to consider, a strange dismissal since part of his title is \\"the Quest for Human Nature\\" (from the study of primates), which is one of the ways that evolutionary psychologists work.  (He is actually being an evolutionary psychologist himself but apparently doesn't know it.)  Evolutionary psychology should be compared with other psychologies, say, psychoanalytical theory, or behaviorism, and not to, e.g., biology.<br /><br />It's important to add that the work of anthropologists is no more scientific or rigorous than the work of evolutionary psychologists, as can be demonstrated from reading this book.  For example on page 129 Stanford tells a story of seeing the low-ranking chimp Beethoven make a sexual display through a cluster of chimpanzees.  He writes: \\"This enraged the alpha, Wilkie, who chased Beethoven off into the thickets, whereupon Beethoven circled around and came back to mate with an eager female before Wilkie realized what was happening.\\"<br /><br />Stanford uses this as an example of planned deceptive behavior in chimps, but whether Beethoven displayed foresight or just got lucky is unclear.  To be picky I could also point out that \\"enraged\\" and \\"realized\\" are anthropomorphic projections of Stanford's lively mind and not something that could be tested scientifically (which is the essence of his criticism of evolutionary psychology on page 134).<br /><br />Yet, Professor Stanford understands that social scientists today are mightily constrained by a postmodern culture in academia that demands politically correct findings first, and scientifically persuasive findings only if they are in agreement with the PC party line.  He writes, \\"Some of this sentiment [not admitting \\"essential cultural commonalities\\"] reflects anthropologists' political burden of favoring the cultural underdog at all costs.  Postmodernism's purpose has become a vehicle, in part, to give meaning to identity politics in the battle of the oppressed against the perceived enemy, the white male elite.\\" (p. 146)<br /><br />There is a lot more worth discussing in this book.  (I wish I had more space.)  The chapter on what it's like in the field (Chapter 12) is vivid and compelling; and in the concluding chapters we can see that Stanford is a scientist who cares passionately about the great apes and their environments.  He is also a man who can communicate what he knows to a general readership as long as he avoids the trap of imagining that there is a political censor sitting on his shoulder as he writes.  The truth will out, and the educated public that reads books written by professional scientists is much more sophisticated than is sometimes supposed.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"icky I could also point out that \\"enraged\\" and \\"realized\\" are anthropomorphic projections of Stanford's lively mind and not something that could be tested scientifically (which is the essence of his criticism of evolutionary psychology on page 134).<br /><br />Yet, Professor Stanford understands that social scientists today are mightily constrained by a postmodern culture in academia that demands politically correct findings first, and scientifically persuasive findings only if they are in agreement with the PC party line.

1551195:US	49786731	R2U0YSCVOB0DH5	0929765915	123169977	Too Many People: The Case for Reversing Growth	Books	5	20	21	N	N	Clear and convincing	In this modest little book, originally written as a handbook for Negative Population Growth, Inc.,  Lindsey Grant, a retired career U.S. government official and diplomat, explores the consequences of having six billion people on the planet, and how much worse things are going to get as our numbers increase.<br />Probably the two strongest arguments for reducing our population are those derived from pollution and from declining per capita food production.  Up until recent years science and technology have always come up with innovations that increase food production so that it has kept up with our population growth.  What Grant argues is that ability is now running up against some barriers that are not likely to be circumvented.  We already see this in grain production with world per capita production peaking in 1984, as Grant shows in a chart on page 9.  We are producing more grain in an absolute sense but the amount per person is falling.  If this continues, first the eating habits of the richer countries will change from meat, fish and poultry to grains and beans; and after that the strong will take from the weak with of course horrific consequences.  Furthermore all the best land for raising food has long been in production; indeed a lot of it is under concrete and asphalt for the mammoth numbers of humanity to live on in cities and towns.  Add to this the fact that the effect of fertilizers and irrigation on much of our most productive cropland has run up against the law of diminishing returns; indeed some of the very best land is now of marginal value or worthless because of salinization and fertilizer burnout of the soil.<br />For those of us in the highly industrialized countries, the reduction in per capita food production is invisible.  Because of our economic power we have no food shortage as a consequence of there being too many people in the world.  But what we do feel is the crowding and the growing pollution of our environment.  One answer to pollution is to spend the money to clean up the wastes.  Corporations are reluctant to do this because that would adversely affect their bottom line.  Indeed some companies, if they were made responsible for the costs of their pollution, would go out of business.  So instead of recycling they continue to pump their wastes into the atmosphere, into rivers, into the oceans, into landfills, etc.  Some just smear the stuff on the ground and hope it will blow away or leach out.  Grant writes, \\"I would argue that the primary mission of technology today should be to undo the pollution and waste generated by earlier technologies.\\" (p. 87)<br />The consequences of these short-sighted practices are leading not only to an impoverished environment but to further reductions in our ability to grow and produce food.  So what is the answer?  Grant's answer is to reduce our numbers.  Sounds great, but just how do we do that?  To this he has no real answer because the enemies of reduced population growth are many and powerful.  It is not just the Catholic church and fundamentalist religions everywhere who are opposed to reductions in human populations, but just about everybody who benefits from economic growth.  The feeling in some quarters is that if there is a decline in birth rates, demand would be adversely affected and labor itself would become expensive causing a reversal of the economic growth to which we have become addicted.  What Grant asks is, is that a bad thing?  He works hard to show that reducing our numbers would bring immeasurable benefits to both ourselves and the environment.<br />But there are other problems.  For example, the end of population growth inevitably results in an older population (see page 76), a population that must be supported by a younger working population.  The industrial nations of Europe and the US have solved this problem partly by allowing immigration so that there will be workers to support the retired.  Grant shows that this \\"solution\\" if continuedwill result in places like Italy, for example, being populated mostly by people not of Italian descent.  We already see this in the southwestern United States where the increase in the Spanish-speaking population is on target to surpass that of English-only speakers in the not too distant future.  Is this a bad thing?  It depends on your point of view.  But even immigration will not solve the problem.  It is only a stop gap (and of course there is all that crowding and all those mouths to feed and all of their wastes to dispose of).<br />Grant's convincing and readable book is a wake up call to humanity, and that is a step in the right direction.

But Professor Hardin, who is the author of Stalking the Wild Taboo, finds a way around the forbidden by creating a man from Mars who can be objective where we cannot, allowing Hardin to express the taboo point of view.  For example on page 106 he has the Martian say (referring to the organization, Zero Population Growth): \\"it is virtually unheard of outside the learned community... [I]n the long run, it will decrease the relative number of educated people compared with the uneducated.\\"  The Martian adds, \\"Propaganda in favor of reducing fertility must be accompanied by repressive legal measures...  Perhaps the first thing to do would be to cancel income deductions for the third child in a family (and beyond).\\"  Hardin himself obliquely gives his point of view on page 61 with these words, \\"The natural sciences have probably made it possible for millions--probably not billions--of human beings to live sustainably on the earth.\\"<br />While I (and the natural resources of the planet) would welcome a world with say six hundred million people as opposed to six billion, I must disagree with the man from Mars about the educated and the uneducated.  I suspect, regardless of actual numbers, their proportions would stay approximately the same.<br />However most of this book is not about overpopulation, but about political and economic issues that Professor Hardin is pleased to expound on.  There is the problem of \\"Equity, Equality, and Affirmative Action\\" (Chapter 14).  As Hardin sees it we really need to understand that \\"no two human beings are created equal\\" (p. 109) and that \\"equity\\" and \\"equality\\" are not the same thing.  Exactly how he feels about affirmative action however is never stated directly--indeed little in this book is stated directly.  Hardin prefers to hint at his position and let the reader figure it out.  Since he gives the (absurd) example of laws mandating \\"the admission of pygmies to professional basketball teams,\\" I am persuaded that he is opposed to affirmative action.<br />There are some things he does make clear, but not in a manner likely to persuade.  For example, he is opposed to one world government, believing that it would be unstable.  In support (surprisingly enough) he quotes Bertrand Russell: \\"A world state, if it were firmly established, would have no enemies to fear, and would therefore be in danger of breaking down through lack of cohesive force.\\"  Why a superstate would necessarily lack cohesive force is never explained.  One gets the sense that it somehow has to do with another related Hardin idea, namely that multiculturalism within a single society is unstable.  (See Chapter 15.)  His argument is that the differing cultures would not be able to agree on how to go about their business peaceably and laws could not be formulated that all cultures would find acceptable.  He gives the example of somebody from one culture wanting to drive on the right side of the road and somebody from another wanting to drive on the left.  In fact, he gives this example a couple of times.<br />I am at a loss to appreciate these arguments (and some others in the book).  That different people could not be persuaded to agree to drive on one side of the road seems silly.  That a superstate could not find enemies for the populace to rally against seems naive.  After all we have today the phenomena of the U.S. government directing its energies against drug lords and terrorists with the public firmly behind those efforts, as President Bush's high approval ratings attest.  Furthermore, there will always be a counter-culture (in a democratic society) that the majority culture can and will rail against (and vice-versa).  But I even question the underlying psychological assumption that a state needs enemies to be cohesive.  Historically, governments have sought enemies (both within and without) as a means to solidify their power, but that hardly proves that a state necessarily needs enemies to survive.  At any rate, perhaps we can dream up nasty little green men from some distant solar system to hate, if need be.<br />Hardin's style is somewhat off-putting at first and betrays his long years as a teacher.  He makes statements with little or no support that encourage readers to evaluate for themselves, and then later on (after readers have presumably had time to think for themselves), he gives his rationale.  (Or he doesn't!)  The subject of one chapter is concluded in the next and then reopened in another.  He sometimes explains the obvious and then fails to explain the cryptic, as for example he informs us that \\"philosophy\\" means \\"love of knowledge\\" (p. 31 ), but does not reveal why \\"adding two more lanes to a highway...ultimately increases traffic jams.\\" (p. 39)<br />Some of Hardin's sentiments, however, I find quite agreeable.  For example, \\"No one expects the physics of 50 B.C. to tell us how to launch a spaceship.  But apparently many people are sure that the 2,000-year-old ethics developed in Near Eastern villages is all we need to solve\\" our moral problems. (pp. 4-5)<br />The greatest problem facing the planet today (and the root cause of many other problems) is overpopulation.  It is a truth that needs a wider and more emphatic expression.  I hope in his next book Professor Hardin concentrates on this urgent problem and leaves the political and economic niceties for others to straighten out.hat a state needs enemies to be cohesive.

The zinger was, as Wilson discovered, it was entirely legal!<br />Imagine this: big industrial companies, growing increasingly displeased with having to pay for the cost of disposing of their hazardous waste materials, typically with unsafe amounts of heavy metals, find through a loophole in the law that they can declare the waste a \\"product\\" and sell it as fertilizer!  Instead of paying perhaps a hundred dollars a barrel to get rid of the stuff, they can sell it to firms that add a little lime or some other soil conditioner and abracadabra! peddle it as fertilizer.  Sound like a Greenpeace scare story?  A nightmare dreamed up by disgruntled employees?  \\"Bad\\" farmers looking to blame somebody for their failed Frankenfeed crops?  The fertilizer industry would like us to think so, but this story about Patty Martin and her brave and lonely crusade against the dumping of hazard waste on farmlands tells us otherwise.<br />The terrible thing is that, although Wilson's original story, \\"Fear in the Fields--How Hazardous Wastes Become Fertilizer,\\" first appeared in July of 1997, as the book closes in 2001, the loophole in the law has not been plugged, congress has not acted, and the polluters are still turning hazardous waste infused with cadmium, lead, arsenic, etc., into stuff smeared on farmlands.  It gets into the crops farmers grow and ends up in the food on our dining room tables.  It blows off the fields when it's dry and into the lungs of people.  The workers in these fertilizer plants have elevated levels of cancer and lung scaring disease, and the sad thing is some of them are so wedded to the company that they are blind to what is destroying their bodies.<br />Wilson names names and gives examples.  He cites the chemical analyses and he quotes the industry apologists and the look-the-other-way bureaucrats in the oversight agencies.  But clearly the real culprits are those people at the top of our state and federal governments who are doing nothing stop this dangerous pollution.<br />This is the kind of story that'll make you hopping mad and wonder about the morality (and sanity) of people who would, to save a few bucks on the bottom line, poison us, themselves and our children.ustry apologists and the look-the-other-way bureaucrats in the oversight agencies.

Iyengar as a teacher of yoga that a book with his name in the title virtually guarantees publishing success.<br /><br />This book is a fine example of the phenomenon.  It is an attractive, coffee table type yoga book for the nineties written by students of Iyengar.  Perhaps the most important feature is the beautiful (and non glamorous) photos that illustrate the asanas with an almost mystic power.  There's some irony here because it was the photos of Iyengar himself demonstrating asana (over six hundred of them) that more than anything catapulted him to fame some years ago with his now classic Light on Yoga, which I highly recommend as an extension of this book.<br /><br />Obviously this is a different sort of book, aimed at beginners, but with some depth.  It is more generic in a sense as it delves only lightly into the ideas underlying yoga while concentrating on the practical.  Indeed its philosophic stance is succinct, and perhaps that is best for an approach focused on the physical health aspects of yoga.  One weakness is that it is a little short on pranayama, and consequently on meditation.<br /><br />Iyengar does contribute a foreword, however, and his spirit is apparent throughout.

There is simply nothing else like it.  Feuerstein is the leading academic expert on yoga in the United States while Shambhala is the leading publisher of books on yoga, so it is not surprising that this is clearly a superior work that fills a void.  As such it is a boon to scholars and practitioners alike.<br /><br />It is also very well cross-referenced so that a reader may, by following the starred words, begin or expand his own study of yoga.  There is a guide to pronunciation of the Sanskrit words, numerous bits of black and white artwork and photos, and an engaging and informative introduction by Feuerstein.  This handsome book has all those words that you won't find in even an unabridged English dictionary, defined and given their expression in an historical and spiritual context.  Anyone with more than a passing interest in yoga will find this book invaluable.<br /><br />I should add that this is a revised and greatly expanded edition of Dr. Feuerstein's Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga (1990), and that it dwarfs both Ernest Wood's Yoga Wisdom (1970) and Harvey Day's Yoga Illustrated Dictionary (1971), which I have enjoyed, but which are also very much out of date.<br /><br />For Dr. Feuerstein's revision (due circa 2010, I would imagine) perhaps some entries on Westerners (and contemporaries) who have contributed to the study and practice of yoga would be appropriate, including, e.g., Theos Bernard (I was pleased to see eleven photos herein of Bernard demonstrating asana), Richard Hittleman, B.K.S.

This is the kind of book about which it can truly be said, I have only one regret, and that's that I've already read it!  Or--even though the narrative runs to 426 pages--when one gets to the end, one wishes there were more.  I'm trying to think if I've ever read anything comparable.  In terms of scope, pure readability, interesting information, delicious ideas, a compelling thesis, worldly wisdom, etc., I can think of nothing.  The closest would be something by Marvin Harris.<br />Professor Diamond begins by rephrasing a question asked of him by a New Guinea man in 1972, \\"Why did wealth and power become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way?  For instance, why weren't Native Americans, Africans, and Aboriginal Australians the ones who decimated, subjugated, or exterminated Europeans and Asians?\\" (p. 15)  A stunning question really.  And Diamond answers it fully and in such a manner that there can be little doubt that he is substantially right.  The answer of course is presented in the title, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\"  How did the Conquistadors conquer the Aztecs and the Incas with a few score of soldiers against masses of resistence numbered in the tens of thousands?  And how did the Europeans follow that up with the subjagation of the entire New World?  In the first case, the answer is guns, horses and steel, and in the second case mostly germs, and mostly smallpox, a disease to which the Europeans had immunity because of their long association with cattle from which the disease evolved, while the Native peoples of North and South America had no such experience and no immunity.  The fact that the first domesticated herd animals were from the old world and not the new is from the purely human point of view an \\"accident\\" of history and geography.  Consequently, we can see that it was not the \\"superior\\" European culture that made the difference, but the factors named above and, I must say, pure chance.<br />For those critical of this book I think it should be appreciated that this is not a history as such.  It is a work more akin to anthropology or ethnology.  Jared Diamond is a physiologist, so it should also be appreciated that none of this has any pretense to be original research.  What Diamond set out to do, and did remarkably well in my opinion, is to explain for a general, educated readership in detail just why the cultural history of the world developed the way it did.  This is emphatically not a work for scholars or scientists (although many have read the book with pleasure and have learned from it).<br />And it is not a perfect book.  The narrative is indeed uneven in parts, but this is a long, ambitious book, covering a lot of ground, so Professor Diamond may be forgiven for the occasional nod.  His much contended statement that New Guineans are smarter than Europeans is a miss statement, of course.  He should have simply said \\"as smart\\" (or as dumb, depending on your point of view), and left it at that.  By the way, on page 408 he admits the statement is a \\"subjective impression\\" and can be contested.  And yes, the book tends to the political correct, but I suspect that Diamond wrote it that way to anticipate and put aside such questions so that his main arguments might be appreciated without distraction.  If you write anything politically incorrect in this day and age, there is the very real chance that the politically incorrect statement will attract all the attention and the rest of your book be ignored.<br />And it is true that some of his substantive arguments--for example, the north-south axis of the American continents working against the spread of plants and knowledge--may be in error.  (I sure don't know.)  Or the idea that the indented coastline and connectness of Europe and China led to cultural advantage may be wrong.  However, even if Diamond is somewhat awry the mark here, his arguments are interesting and stimulating; and forthose who want to know more he gives suggestions for further reading near the back of the book.  The fact that Diamond brought these ideas and others to a large readership is a positive thing in itself.  Whether they are correct or not is not proven, of course, and indeed we can be sure that some of the ideas are wrong.  But this is to be expected.  Our knowledge of the world and how we came to be the way we are is an ever changing, every growing phenomenon.

The fact that Diamond brought these ideas and others to a large readership is a positive thing in itself.  Whether they are correct or not is not proven, of course, and indeed we can be sure that some of the ideas are wrong.  But this is to be expected.  Our knowledge of the world and how we came to be the way we are is an ever changing, every growing phenomenon.

1567453:US	49786731	R3NMVO3DG979VS	156858105X	9400276	The Mystery of the Aleph: Mathematics, the Kabbalah, and the Search for Infinity	Books	4	49	52	N	N	A somewhat flawed, magical, fascinating read	Aczel's fascinating book is a short narrative history of the concept of infinity (the aleph) with a concentration on its mathematical development, especially through Galileo, Cantor, G&ouml;del, Paul Cohen and others, meshed with some very interesting material from the ancient Greeks and the Kabbalists who associated infinity with their ideas of God.  He includes some material on how strikingly difficult it was for Cantor and others to go against established ideas.  I think it was also Aczel's intent to force the reader to think about infinity as something spiritual.  At least his book had that effect on me.<br /><br />God is infinity, the ancient Kabbalists proclaimed, and indeed an all-powerful, all-knowing, immovable yet irresistible God may be something akin to infinity.  God is perhaps a higher order of infinity, above the infinity of the transcendental numbers: infinity to the infinite power, one might say, and having said that, one might dismiss it all from the mind as being hopelessly beyond all comprehension.  Yet, here, Amir Aczel brings us back.  Cantor showed that we can think about infinity, at least to the extent that we can prove differences among infinities.  We can, as it were, and from a distance, make distinctions about something we cannot really grasp.  In a sense it is similar to contemplating what is beyond the big bang, or imagining the world below the Planck limit.  Our minds were not constructed to come to grips with such things, yet maybe we can know something indirectly.<br /><br />Maybe.  In science what we know is forever subject to revision; but in mathematics we are said to have eternal knowledge.  When it is proven (barring error) it is settled.  Still, might mathematics exist beyond even the furthest reach of the human mind with a higher order affecting our proofs?  Beyond the infinities might there exist something more \\"irrational\\" more completely \\"transcendent\\" than we can imagine even in our wildest fantasies?<br /><br />At any rate, reading Aczel's magical book, I am persuaded to think so.  And I can understand how New Agers and Kabbalists can become so enamored of numbers that they slip quite imperceptibly into numerology.  (Numerology being to mathematics what astrology is to astronomy.)<br /><br />Where I think Aczel is off the mark is in suggesting that it was concentration on the continuum that led to the ill mental health of Georg Cantor and Kurt G&ouml;del.  The old saw about thinking so long and hard on a subject leading to madness is something however that won't go away.  In chess we have the preeminent examples of Paul Morphy and Bobby Fischer, both towering genius like Cantor and G&ouml;del, who slipped into delusion and paranoia after plummeting the depths of Caissa.  With the great strides being made in neuroscience today, we might one day understand what these men had in common besides great intelligence and the ability to concentrate to an extraordinary degree.<br /><br />There is a lot of interesting material throughout the book.  I was especially intrigued with an implication of the fact that an infinite number of steps (e.g., 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8...etc.--convergence) could lead to a finite sum. (p. 12)  This really implies to my mind that we can relate in some sense to the idea of infinity.  I contrasted this with Aczel's assertion on page 90 that if one could choose at random a number on the real line, that number would be \\"transcendental with a probability of one\\" (missing by force any of an infinity of rational numbers).  However, as Aczel points out elsewhere, one cannot actually choose a number randomly out of an infinite collection!<br /><br />I also liked the report about the exasperated Paris Academy in the nineteenth century passing \\"a law stating that purported solutions to the ancient problem\\" of squaring the circle \\"would no longer be read by members of the academy.\\" (p. 89) This reminded me of the action by the U.S. Patent Office some many years ago of refusing toaccept patent applications for perpetual motion machines.<br /><br />Aczel gives Cantor's proof of a higher order of infinity for transcendental numbers on page 115.  It is a very beautiful proof that can be understood with very little knowledge of math.  On page 112 he gives Cantor's equally beautiful proof that rational numbers are as infinite as whole numbers.  However his gloss at the top of  the next page I think contains some typographical error that makes it not helpful.  But perhaps I am wrong.  (Maybe somebody knows and would tell me.)  There is also some confusion about when G&ouml;del married Adele on pages 198 and 200, and there are perhaps too many typos in the book, e.g., on the first sentence of page 162 the word \\"of\\" is missing, and on page 164 the word \\"way\\" (or something similar) should follow the word \\"humiliating.\\"  Also note Michael R. Chernick's correction in his review below showing the two missing permutations for the Hebrew word for God that Aczel left out on page 32.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, this is overall an extremely engaging book and a delight to read.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"t applications for perpetual motion machines.<br /><br />Aczel gives Cantor's proof of a higher order of infinity for transcendental numbers on page 115.

1571551:US	49786731	R2N42K6PN1D8OT	0679453091	869388342	A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention and the Four Theaters of the Brain	Books	5	77	79	N	N	A revolution in the making	\\"Mental problems, from hot temper to laziness, from chronic worry to excessive drinking, all have roots in the biology of the brain.\\" (p. 357)<br /><br />This is a report on a revolution taking place in neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology and kindred disciplines.  The old paradigms are crumbling under the onslaught of a new understanding of how the brain really works.  Harvard Medical School psychiatrist John J. Ratey's \\"guide\\" (it's more than that) is an admirable exercise in bringing us up to date on what is happening in brain science--what we suspect, what we know, and how this knowledge is affecting clinical practice.<br /><br />In a sense Ratey's book is a report on a new paradigm.  It is biology-based and relies first and foremost on the physiology of the brain and body as they have developed over time.  Gone are the artificial constructs of Freudian psychology and the very limited black-box psychology of behaviorism.  The new psychology is based on opening that black box and looking inside.  Of course what we find there is enormously complex, and we are, to use Ratey's expression (p. 124), \\"still on the first step of a very long staircase.\\"  Yet, because of the growing power of neuroscience to study and access the living brain in ways that were impossible just a few years ago, we are entering an exciting time, full of hope and wonder.<br /><br />As Dr. Ratey explains in \\"Acknowledgments,\\" this book began as a cooperative research effort by many people toward writing a \\"primer on the brain for mental health professionals.\\"  Then it was suggested by Pantheon editor Linda Healey that a smaller version \\"that would try to instruct the public at large\\" be written.  A professional science writer, Mark Fischetti, was hired and schooled.  The result is a book written in an engaging and very readable manner.  However, its organization--neat and reasonable as it is--actually detracts from the book's effectiveness because the most interesting and helpful chapters are near the end.  I realize that Ratey and his editors and writers came to the conclusion that the material in the last three chapters, \\"The Social Brain,\\" \\"The Four Theaters,\\" and \\"Care and Feeding\\" could be better appreciated after having read the more fundamental material in the first seven chapters.  Nonetheless I believe that a lot of people who would benefit from this very fine book will not get to those chapters.  Too bad.  Ratey's metaphor of the four theaters is a powerful tool for incorporating and understanding the new paradigm, while the final chapter gives us some very excellent advice on how to live fully while keeping the brain and our systems healthy.<br /><br />Consequently I would propose that when Dr. Ratey updates this book (and I hope he will; there is so much happening in neuroscience that some of the information here will be dated in just a few years) that he structure the book so that it begins with Chapter 9, \\"The Four Theaters,\\" followed by Chapter 8, \\"The Social Brain,\\" and then the first seven chapters, concluding with the advice in Chapter 10, \\"Care and Feeding.\\"  For the reader, I recommend reading Chapter 9 first so that you can immediately share in the excitement that is at the heart of the book.<br /><br />The \\"theaters,\\" by the way, should be understood as \\"theaters of operations\\" and not theaters where movies might be shown.  (Originally Ratey had used \\"kingdoms of the brain\\" as his metaphor.)  The theaters are (1) perception; (2) attention, consciousness and cognition; (3) brain function (memory, emotion, movement, etc.); and (4) behavior and identity.  He sees a flow of consequence (like a river) from perception to attention to function to behavior.  He argues persuasively that the brain is a holistically operating entity that is constantly being changed by its interaction with the environment, a dynamic organism that is forever learning, making new perceptions and adjustments.  Things can go wrong in any one of the theaters and whathappens in any theater affects the other theaters down river (and even up river).  What I found particularly interesting is the new approach to diagnostics and therapy this understanding affords.  A good example is on pages 347-349 where Ratey tells the story of Theresa who was slow to learn, unsocial and awkward in sports.  Instead of some disorder out of DSM-IV being plastered on her forehead, Ratey found that she had a perception problem, and he demonstrated how her social and functional problems stemmed from that \\"first theater\\" problem.  Ratey emphasizes freeing the patient from self-doubt and personal blame for whatever the problem may be, and always looks for a biological cause first.  Some bits of wisdom from the best chapter in the book, from pages 353-355:<br /><br />\\"Modern medical practice tends to regard patients' self-evaluations as too tainted by subjectivity, but this is a grave error.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is quite beyond the average patient's ability, within the framework of...insight-oriented therapies, to pinpoint the true source of unhappiness and frustration.\\"<br /><br />\\"Prozac is hardly a remedy for the self-blame, lost opportunities, and intellectual insecurity of a lifetime compromised by unrecognized perceptual and cognitive deficits.\\"<br /><br />\\"We have to begin to think of the brain as a self-organizing ecosystem, one of such staggering complexity and delicate balance that almost any aspect of a patient's life may be relevant to a diagnosis or essential to treatment.\\"<br /><br />\\"[T]he clinician's duty...includes devoting more time to looking for what is good in patients' lives, for the strengths and talents that are not yet being fully realized, and for the secret pleasures and sources of happiness that they have never allowed themselves.\\"<br /><br />\\"We in psychiatry continually risk mistaking our labels for the disorders themselves.\\"<br /><br />\\"The brain's processes can be utterly transformed by self-discovery and the right pursuits in life.\\"<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"happens in any theater affects the other theaters down river (and even up river).

1571645:US	49786731	R249MD34XZZ1DM	0375413383	836557265	Political Fictions	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Skewering the politicos	I hope what Joan Didion, essayist extraordinary, learned from this adventure in pol land Americana (that her husband, John Gregory Dunne, \\"already knew,\\" as she notes on the dedication page) is that there is not a dime's worth of difference between Republicans ... and Democrats ... in this democracy by capitalism.  Well, maybe fifteen cents.  How terribly, terribly impatient I got with Bill Clinton and the demos, that is until George W. took office and then I began to feel some nostalgia for good old fashion sexual malfeasance in lieu of the Incredible Shrinking Bill of Rights and a return to foreign policy as conceived by the CIA.<br />I think Miss Didion did indeed notice the similarities between the parties in this collection of political essays and journalisms, 1988-2000, most of which were first published in The New York Review of Books.  She seems to find Dukakis, Clinton and Gore just as lame as George and George W., although in different ways. (Of course one does sense that overall there is just the barest leftward lean!)  Sometimes however it is difficult to tell whether she is just observing the madness or satirizing it, so exquisitely sharp is her rapier.  But take a hint from some of the titles, e.g., \\"The West Wing of Oz,\\" \\"Newt Gingrich, Superstar,\\" \\"Political Pornography,\\" \\"Vichy Washington,\\" \\"God's Country,\\" etc.<br />Let's take especially the chapter on the one-time Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Republican congressman from Georgia ... to see what Miss Didion is up to.  The chapter starts out innocently enough with a 213-word sentence (no semicolons!) detailing the \\"personalities and books and events\\" that helped shape the one-time presidential hopeful.  Didion uses a technique here that might be called \\"damning by bizarre association.\\"  Thus one reads that Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, etc., influenced the Honorable Mr. Gingrich, but so did Tom Clancy, \\"Zen in the Art of Archery,\\" and the 1913 Girl Scout Handbook.  One senses where Didion is going when a page later she describes Gingrich's method of developing \\"an intellectual base\\" by \\"collecting quotes and ideas on scraps of paper stored in shoeboxes\\" (quoting Dick Williams, author of \\"Newt!\\" on page 169).  The cat is completely out of the bag when Didion notes some of Gingrich's publications, including the novel \\"1945,\\" which Didion describes as \\"a fairly primitive example of the kind of speculative fiction known as alternative history.\\"  Didion goes on to give capsule reviews of \\"1945\\" and \\"To Renew America,\\" taking some delight in Newt's fixation on numbers and outline forms, \\"seven steps necessary to solve the drug problem,\\" \\"eight areas of necessary change in our health care system,\\" etc. ending with the observation on page 179 that \\"we have here a man who once estimated the odds on the survival of his second marriage at 53 to 47.\\"  Didion calls this an \\"inclination toward the pointlessly specific...coupled with a tic to inflate what is actually specific into a general principle, a big concept.\\"  By the time Didion is through with Professor Gingrich, one sees that the epithet, \\"Superstar\\" is sarcastic and a delusion of the mind of a nerd fully grown.<br />Well, is this fair?  I don't know, but it is kind of fun.  However I recommend that you read this not for fun or for the edification that you might get from the material.  Instead I recommend Joan Didion's political pieces as a study in style, as an education in how to slice finely and well, how to discredit and lampoon with class.  Didion, when she writes about politics, is like Gore Vidal or Mark Twain being well-behaved at tea with a pinky aimed directly and unmistakably at the hostess.<br />Comparing this book to her now classic Slouching Towards Bethlehem (circa 1961) which includes the famous self-revelatory essay, \\"On Going Home,\\" one notices that the novelistic and \\"affecting\\" style has disappeared.  In its place we have a hard-nosed, but fancy, street journalism with the author somewhere in the background discreetly washing her hands.<br />...uthor somewhere in the background discreetly washing her hands.<br />...	2002-04-21

Feynman	Books	5	39	39	N	N	Brilliance and charm: Feynman as a teacher	I very much enjoyed this entertaining and delightful collection of lectures, talks and essays by the world-renown and sorely missed Professor Feynman, Nobel Prize winning physicist, idiosyncratic genius and one of the great men of the twentieth century.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the subtle yet unmistakable way he scolded the people at NASA for putting their political butts before the safety of the space program they were managing in his famous \\"Minority Report to the Space Shuttle Challenger Inquiry.\\"  But the chapter that really sold me on Richard P. Feynman, boy wonder grown up, was \\"It's as Simple as One, Two, Three\\" in which he explores the ability to do two things at once through an experiment with counting.  Such a delight he took in learning as a kid from his friend Bernie that we sometimes think in pictures and not in words.  And then the further delight he took in learning that some people count with their inner voice (himself), and others (his friend John Tukey) count by visualization.<br /><br />I was also loved the chapter, \\"What is Science?\\", a talk to science teachers in which Feynman demonstrates that the real difference between science and other ways of \\"knowing\\" (e.g., religion) is the ability to doubt.  In science we learn, as Feyman said he himself learned, to live with doubt.  But in the religious way of \\"knowing\\" doubt is intolerable.  Feynman gives an evolutionary illustration of why doubt is essential.  He begins with the \\"intelligent\\" animals \\"which can learn something from experience (like cats).\\"  At this stage, he says, each animal learned \\"from its own experience.\\"  Then came some animals that could learn more rapidly and from the experience of others by watching.  Then came something \\"completely new...things could be learned by one animal, passed on to another, and another, fast enough that...[the knowledge] was not lost to the race...,\\" and could be passed on to a new generation.<br /><br />Now, let's stop for a moment.  What a great teacher does--and here and elsewhere Feynman proves himself to be a great teacher (although he said he doubted that!)--is to guide the student just enough so that the student arrives at or anticipates the point of the lesson before the teacher gets there.  What is the punch line of this lesson for the science teachers?  Namely this: with the passing of knowledge from one generation to the next it became also possible to pass on false knowledge or \\"mistaken ideas.\\"  Feynman calls this a \\"disease.\\"<br /><br />\\"Then a way of avoiding the disease was discovered.  This is to doubt that what is being passed from the past is in fact true, and to try to find out ab initio, again from experience, what the situation is, rather than trusting the experience of the past...\\"<br /><br />In other words, don't blindly accept the word of authority.  Test it for yourself!  And this is what science does.  It tests and it tests again, and it doubts and it doubts--always.<br /><br />I loved this because one of my dictums is \\"always guide the experts\\"--the lawyer, the doctor, the insurance adjustor, et al.  Always guide them because, although they are the experts, you're the one who really cares.  To this I can now add that you should also doubt the experts because even though they are experts they can be wrong.  And, as Feynman showed in his report on the Challenge disaster, they can be wrong for reasons that have nothing to do with their expertise.<br /><br />I also liked the commencement address he gave at Caltech on \\"Cargo Cult Science...and How to Not Fool Yourself.\\"  We fool ourselves a lot.  The managers at NASA fooled themselves; what's their names of cold fusion delusion fame fooled themselves.  Feynman has noted that he has fooled himself.  Science, he avers, is a tool to help us to not fool ourselves.  He is profoundly right.  Without science we would go on fooling ourselves with all sorts of mumbo-jumbo, \\"revealed\\" religiosity and scientific-seeming stuff such as Rhine'sESP experiments some years ago at Duke, the entire litany of New Age pseudobabblese, and--yes!--such stuff as the amazing Cargo Cult Science in which some Pacific Islanders, in an attempt to attract the big birds of the sky with their cargoes of goodies, built \\"nests,\\" that is, landing fields with empty cargo boxes, and faux towers, etc. in the hope that the planes flying overhead would see them and land on their island.  Feynman has taken this as an example of pseudoscience, that is, behavior in the form of science without the substance of science, without the \\"integrity\\" of science.<br /><br />The integrity of science, Feynman advised the graduates, demands that all the information about the experiment be given, even detrimental facts.  Feynman contrasts this idea with that of advertizing in which only that which makes the product look good is given.<br /><br />When reading this book it helps to imagine that one is listening to Feynman speak.  The text includes repetitions and the omissions which he no doubt conveyed with his voice, expression or gesture.  When one reads him this way, some of Feynman's endearing charm and the gentle, self-effacing humor for which he is famous comes through.  Here's a joke from pages 206-207:  He is at Esalen in a hot bath with another man and a girl.  The man begins to massage the girl's foot.  He feels something in her big toe.  He asks his instructor, \\"Is that the pituitary?\\"  The girl says, \\"No, that's not the way it feels.\\"  Feynman injects, \\"You're a hell of a long way from the pituitary, man.\\"  And they both look at him. \\"I had blown my cover, you see--and she said, It's reflexology.  So I closed my eyes and appeared to be meditating.\\"  Yes, Feynman is a long way from reflexology.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"ESP experiments some years ago at Duke, the entire litany of New Age pseudobabblese, and--yes!--such stuff as the amazing Cargo Cult Science in which some Pacific Islanders, in an attempt to attract the big birds of the sky with their cargoes of goodies, built \\"nests,\\" that is, landing fields with empty cargo boxes, and faux towers, etc. in the hope that the planes flying overhead would see them and land on their island.

1578733:US	49786731	R1L4XGUYSA17LD	0684824973	779952843	Madness on the Couch: Blaming the Victim in the Heyday of Psychoanalysis	Books	5	26	31	N	N	Fascinating demolition of psychoanalysis	The madness in the title more properly should be assigned to the chair behind the couch.  That is Dolnick's point: the shrinks themselves were mad.  In their madness they blamed the parents for the illness of their children, particularly the mother.  How did the schizophrenic get that way?  He had a \\"schizophrenogenic\\" mother, typically a loveless woman who rejected the child while dominating it psychologically.  How about autism?  The victim of a \\"refrigerator mother\\" who withheld love from the child.  The obsessive-compulsive disorder?  Ditto, although here the patient was also singled out since the patient knew what he was doing, but just would not change.<br />Dolnick does a great job of chronicling the delusive mind set of the shrinks who fought tooth and nail against any sort of biological explanation of mental illness even though the evidence was clear.  They clung like barnacles to their delusions that these diseases were psychological because, should they admit that they were physical illnesses, caused by something physically wrong in the brain, their fraudulent \\"talk therapy\\" would be seen as it really was, useless, and their entire professional lives would be exposed as a waste.<br />Dolnick begins with a studied demolition of Freud and psychoanalytic psychology.  He exposes Freud's delusions about the causation of mental disease, about the nature of dreams, his obsessive belief in \\"symptoms as symbols,\\" and especially his arrogant lack of scientific method.  Dolnick shows how the \\"great\\" man bamboozled the psychiatric profession with his almost magical way with words, turning yes's into no's and vice versa as the situation required.  The Freudian canon that sex was at the heart of every neurosis was so broad and varied that almost any convenient explanation could be found within.  Soldiers suffering from shell shock would seem to be an exception, but no.  Dolnick quotes Freud as arguing that \\"Mechanical agitation...[the hellish roar and rumble of trench warfare] must be recognized as one of the sources of sexual excitation.\\" (p. 37)<br />Freud's ability to delude both himself and his colleagues is exemplified in the notorious case of Emma Eckstein who was operated on by Freud's friend, Wilhelm Fliess.  She was suffering from \\"stomach ailments and menstrual pain\\" and \\"had problems walking.\\"  Fliess performed a nose operation but it did not go well.  For one thing Fliess left some surgical gauze in Eckstein's nose.  As she continued to hemorrhage Freud observed, \\"she became restless during the night because of an unconscious wish to entice me to go there; since I did not come during the night, she renewed the bleedings, as an unfailing means of rearousing my affection.\\" (p. 47)<br />The crux of Dolnick's book, though, is not about Freud but about his followers, especially the psychoanalytic psychiatrists from what he sees as the heyday of psychoanalysis, roughly the middle third of the twentieth century.  He expresses the central delusion of the therapists in these words, \\"The ranting of the schizophrenic on the street corner, the retreat of an autistic child behind invisible walls, the endless hand-washing of an obsessive-compulsive were not simply acts, but messages.  They were, the therapists fervently believed, desperate if inarticulate cries for help.  And now, for the first time, those cries could be decoded.\\"<br />This self-serving delusion on the part of the shrinks is Dolnick's target and he hits it well, again and again.  His technique is to describe in detail the latest Freudian disciple and his particular method of \\"treatment,\\" how it is ballyhooed and how the psychiatrist himself is caught up in yet another wave of excitement and personal exultation.  And then Dolnick gives the grim details, exposing the fake cures and nonexistent breakthroughs.  Bruno Bettelheim in particular, who for decades covered up his lack of success in treating autism with attacks on parents (\\"All my life I have been working withchildren whose lives have been destroyed because their mothers hated them.\\" p. 216) is exposed as a violent and hypocritical man obsessed with protecting and maintaining his turf.<br />In a particularly chilling chapter Dolnick recalls the progression of treatments from induced fever to electroshock to lobotomies.

It is to be treasured however for those who admire Watts and his unique and highly influential body of work because it was his first published book on Zen Buddhism.<br /><br />It is clearly a young man's book.  When it was reissued some twenty-four years later, Watts was asked to revise it, but he declined, saying that it would require a rewriting of the book.  He allowed that his expression herein of the philosophy of Mahayana was flawed, but I think the real shortcoming--if we can call it that--in The Spirit of Zen is simply the fact that the very young author did not understand Zen in the way he would in years to come.  For an older man to rewrite a younger man's book, even though that younger man be himself, is to create another book, by another person.  Watts knew this, and that is undoubtedly the real reason he declined.  So he let it stand as it is with its flaws, but also with its strengths.<br /><br />From my point of view those strengths are the felicitous prose, the clear expression, the fresh enthusiasm and the ground-breaking insights from a Western point of view.  The weakness is in the young man's misunderstanding of the role of the koan and of the experience of enlightenment.  Quite frankly, Watts dove in and wrote what he knew, but what he knew was not yet enlightenment.  We can see this in his expression about what he calls \\"trance\\" in meditation where he is discussing the use of the koan and zazen in Zen practice.  He remarks that \\"the aims of Yoga and Za-zen appear to be rather different.\\" (p. 80)  He was wise to quality with \\"appears\\" because most people today would say that the goals are identical, that is, freedom from the delusion and restraint of ordinary conditioned consciousness.  On the same page he describes \\"trance\\" which he then associated with the yogic practice, as \\"static and other-worldly\\" adding that \\"the Chinese mind [meaning the early Zen mind] required something altogether more vital and practical.\\"  Although I am not an authority on Watts, having read only a handful of his books, I would bet that he seldom if ever used \\"trance\\" in this sense again.  The word has become almost pejorative in this usage mainly because practitioners know from personal experience that meditation involves any number of states of mind, and to reduce the experience to \\"being in a trance\\" is misleading.  Meditation (which really is zazen--\\"just sitting\\") is an experience unique to each individual, not translatable, while being as \\"vital and practical\\" as you can get, whether the approach be yogic, Christian mystic, whirling dervish, koan-inspired or whatever.<br /><br />One can also see Watts's struggle toward an understanding of the use of the koan.  He writes that the disciple \\"arrives at a state where the dilemma of life [is] enshrined in the Koan...,\\" missing the \\"is.\\" (p. 49)  While the koan is central to the Rinzai school of Zen, the real essential is zazen.  My personal feeling is that the koan is for young aspirants, especially those with a strong intellectual bent.  What Watts apparently doesn't quite see here, as all the ancients insist, and as Watts himself writes, is that Zen IS meditation.  Indeed, the word comes from the Chinese \\"ch'an\\" which comes from the Sanskrit \\"dhyana,\\" both words meaning, right in front of our faces, \\"meditation\\" (which Watts knew, of course).  The truth--a truth seldom expressed--is that teenagers do not meditate except willy-nilly (unless of course they are saints or geniuses).  So Watts still did not know.<br /><br />Regardless of these imperfections; indeed in light of them, we can see the precocious nature of Alan Watts's understanding.  Certainly he got the essence right.  He recalls on page 49 an old Zen saying, \\"Do not linger about where the Buddha is, and as to where he is not, pass swiftly on.\\"  Also \\"The only difference between a Buddha and an ordinary man is that one realizes it while the other does not.\\" (pp. 48-49)  This last expression (from Hui Neng) reminds me of the idea of bliss in yoga and Vedanta.  We ARE bliss.  What we have to do is realize it.  That makes all the difference.<br /><br />Watts also shows here a mature understanding of the psychology of religion, noting, for example, on page 61 that \\"morality should not be confused with religion...\\"  In the chapter, \\"Life in a Zen Community,\\" he also acknowledges the \\"evils of monasticism\\" without dwelling on them.  In general he shows a clear groking of the central idea of Zen, which is, be concrete, be here now and in every moment, and do not mistake the pointing finger for the moon.<br /><br />More than anything perhaps we can see in this book the beginnings of Watts's great scholarship, a scholarship that made him one of American's foremost authorities on Eastern religions.  This is particularly evident in his emphasis on the debt that Zen owes to Taoism expressed in the chapter, \\"The Origins of Zen,\\" which would become a full blown exposition in his celebrated The Way of Zen, which I recommend the reader read after this volume.<br /><br />Incidentally, I should like to say that it was this book that allowed me to really appreciate the allegory of the herding of the ox (mentioned here, but completely expounded in other books, especially, Suzuki's Manual of Zen Buddhism).  But I will save my \\"understanding\\" for another time.  Suffice it to say, as Watts writes on page 60, recalling the Buddha's dictum, that the raft of Buddhism is only for getting across the river.  Once on the other side, it can be left behind.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"iftly on.\\"  Also \\"The only difference between a Buddha and an ordinary man is that one realizes it while the other does not.\\" (pp. 48-49)  This last expression (from Hui Neng) reminds me of the idea of bliss in yoga and Vedanta.

1598677:US	49786731	R21HX8CXLQ180G	0345379187	76135912	Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Final thoughts	Published not long after his death, this--Sagan's last book--is a collection of essays on a variety of subjects having in common a palpable urgency traceable to both the state of the planet and the state of Sagan's health, both perceived as perilous. Besides Sagan's distinctive blend of stark optimism and stern alarm, and his splendid rationality, one is struck by a kind of anger in his tone, as though he has grown impatient with the stupidities of humankind. Thus one reads in the essay on abortion these bitter words: \\"There is no right to life in any society on Earth today... We raise farm animals for slaughter; destroy forests; pollute rivers and lakes until no fish can live there; kill deer and elk for sport, leopards for their pelts, and whales for fertilizer; entrap dolphins, gasping and writhing, in great tuna nets; club seal pups to death... What is (allegedly) protected is not life, but human life.\\" (p. 166)<br />What he is against in these essays, as his widow, Ann Druyan, notes in her Epilogue on page 228, are \\"the forces of superstition and fundamentalism.\\" Sagan is preeminently the champion of education and reason as the means to better our life, and the implacable enemy of ignorance. (For \\"superstition and fundamentalism,\\" read \\"ignorance,\\" plain and simple.) In some respects this book is a continuation of his volume from the year before, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, but the emphasis here is on the problems confronting us and what can be done about them. In particular, Sagan confronts the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, pollution, the threat of nuclear war, overpopulation, etc. He asks the question (the title of Part II), \\"What Are Conservatives Conserving?\\" and gives the answer, their short-sighted bottom line. His arguments are ingenious and interesting to read as one observes how hard he is working to persuade us to take care of ourselves and our planet home. He compares the warnings of modern science with those of Cassandra who had the gift of prophesy but the curse of never being believed, science becoming in this sense both Cassandra and the Oracle at Delphi, misunderstood and misinterpreted by our policy makers, whom he likens to Croesus, the rich king who salivated at the prospect of a mighty empire being destroyed only to find that it was his own. As Pogo observed, \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\" One senses too that Sagan is projecting his concern that he himself is in danger of becoming a Cassandra.<br />Certainly, in reading this book, one senses the personality of Carl Sagan come to life. His wide knowledge as a scientist, and his influence as a public spokesperson for science and for the environment and for all the life on this planet, are manifest. His tendency to preach and guide, his absolute desire to use his celebrity for the common good (and to scold) are evident. He mingles hope with despair; he loves humankind, yet despises what humankind does. He sees our capacity to love and help one another as our saving grace, but cannot help but recall and recount the horrors we have visited upon one another and on our fellow creatures. He sees the planet as one, as Gaia (although he does not use that word) with its organisms cooperating with one another for mutual survival. He writes, \\"The inclination to cooperate has been painfully extracted through the evolutionary process. Those organisms that did not cooperate, that did not work with one another, died. Cooperation is encoded in the survivors' genes.\\" (p. 67) (Incidentally, this is a clear statement for the idea of group selection in evolution. Dawkins, et al., take note.) His writing reveals a man who always tried to do his best, and was perhaps his own sternest critic. He recalls for all of us, \\"wincing recollections of past faux pas\\" in the chapter on the environment where he tries to persuade us to take a stance \\"Somewhere between cheerful dolts and nervous worrywarts...\\" (p. 75)<br />I hear the manand identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair. I \\"solve\\" this problem by realizing that all species eventually go extinct, and that somebody or something \\"better\\" than us might follow, or to understand that we are just a tiny phase in the cosmic process of Becoming.<br />More to the point, I would hope to be just one fraction as worthwhile to my fellow humans as was, and is, and will continue to be, Carl Sagan, a brilliant man of great humanity who is sorely missed. To read him is to experience the best of humanity. He, like science, is a candle in the dark.and identify with his concerns, and I know myself that I cannot make up my mind on whether to be cheerful about our prospects or to despair.

1598804:US	49786731	R3B9BEIALFDL4Z	0786884061	618059257	The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdos and the Search for Mathematical Truth	Books	5	69	70	N	N	Affectionate and balanced portrait of a mathematical genius	I very much enjoyed this biography (Hoffman calls it \\"in large part a work of oral history\\") of the legendary Hungarian mathematician, Paul Erd&ouml;s.  Hoffman's relaxed style with his attention to detail and concrete expression makes it a pleasure to read.  You don't need to know any mathematics.  Hoffman mentions the math and occasionally goes lightly into it, but for the most part the focus is on the eccentric and loveable mathematician himself and his many friends and collaborators.  In fact, the title is somewhat ironic since Erd&ouml;s was very much a people person, a man who loved and was loved by others.  It is only in the case of \\"romantic\\" love that Erd&ouml;s loved only numbers.<br /><br />By the way, Hoffman does indeed go into Erd&ouml;s's sex life in a completely tasteful and PG-13 sort of way.  He was a man who dearly loved his mother and children but practiced a deep and abiding celibacy all his life.  His friends made many jokes about his uneasiness with \\"bosses\\" (his pet name for women) and once made a bet with him that he could not go to a burlesque show.  He did however, but took off his glasses so he couldn't see anything.<br /><br />Erd&ouml;s was a pure mathematician, a child prodigy who fell in love with numbers at an early age and never lost his love while wandering over the entire globe searching for collaborators.  He was himself a caricature of the absent-minded professor, a man who asked others to tie his shoes for him, a man who could not drive, who worked nineteen hours at day at mathematics, often calling his friends up at four in the morning to share an insight.  He paid no attention to his appearance, cared nothing for literature, the arts, sports, etc., only for his beloved math.  He had a way with children and an ability to impose on his friends, often arriving unannounced at their houses and staying for days or weeks at a time.  He freely gave away his money to any number of charities, and sometimes to outright strangers on a whim.  He cared nothing for worldly goods.  He didn't even like applied mathematics, referring to colleagues who had gone that route, as being \\"dead.\\"  Indeed, only children and pure mathematics delighted him.<br /><br />There's a child-like simplicity to the man that charms us.  Hoffman's book reflects this as a kind of fairy tale life lived in delight in spite of all the horror going on in the world.  There is a pristine beauty to living one's life so incredibly focused on one thing.  In a sense it is like an addiction and in another it is like an all-consuming love.  It is the kind of life few of us could ever live (or would want to live), but it is the kind of life we can admire and read about with pleasure.<br /><br />Hoffman sometimes slips away from Erd&ouml;s to write about his family and friends, especially about Ronald Graham, Erd&ouml;s's long-time friend and collaborator, a very interesting man himself, a world class juggler and a practical as well as theoretical mathematician.  Hoffman recalls some Hungarian history, some Cold War history, and relates anecdotes from friends and family.  He devotes a chapter to Fermat's Last Theorem, Fibonacci numbers, the Prime Number Theorem, etc., and then part of a chapter to the Monty Hall dilemma and the tussle between Parade magazine columnist Marilyn vos Savant and her detractors.  There is also a lot of humor, which is appropriate because Erd&ouml;s liked witticisms and used humor as a way to deal with the world.  \\"Soon I will be cured of the incurable disease of life,\\" he is quoted as saying on page 173.  He adds, a little later, still in a sardonic mood, \\"Television...is something the Russians invented to destroy American education.\\"<br /><br />There are some photos, a bibliography and an index.  Hoffman does not glorify Erd&ouml;s as much as some would like, but this is an affectionate and balanced, very interesting portrait of a true original and a great mathematical genius.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"t Is\\"	2002-03-31
1603906:US	49786731	RU4AEA8C9EJHJ	0312420609	982606019	The Adversary: A True Story of Monstrous Deception	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A moral monster	A well-mannered restraint suffuses this narrative about a man who murdered his wife, his two children and his parents, but wasn't able to kill himself.  In relating this striking tale of psychological cowardice and narcissistic madness, French novelist and screenwriter, Emmanuel Carr&egrave;re, has chosen to avoid sensationalism, to underwrite and to underplay.  One is reminded of the style of Albert Camus in his novel The Stranger, and especially the flat tone of his narrator, Meursault, whose lack of affect made him the fascinating anti-hero of a generation.<br />Jean-Claude Romand, the real-life murderer here, is a study in sociopathic narcissism but is unlikely to become anybody's anti-hero.  He spent most of his adult life pretending to be a doctor, fooling everybody he knew including his wife and best friend into thinking he worked as a researcher at the World Health Organization.  He supported himself and his family by stealing the funds of his parents and friends while pretending to invest the money in high yield Swiss accounts.  That he was able to get away with this for something like seventeen years is amazing.  It reminds us once again of the power that charismatic and smooth-talking sociopaths have over ordinary people.  I am also reminded of Jeffrey MacDonald from Joe McGinnis's Fatal Vision.  I see a type of person who has no feelings for anybody but himself, but who works the normal human feelings of others to his advantage.  Jean-Claude Romand's particular weirdness was that he got great pleasure from being self-effacing, modest and humble, whether as a fake doctor working for the good of humankind, or as a man suffering from a fake incurable cancer.  That he was able to turn his imprisonment into something of a heroic martyrdom in his own mind, is not surprising.  There is an old joke about a man who felt so sorry for himself that he pleaded in court for mercy after murdering his parents since he was now an orphan.  Jean-Claude Romand is such a man, a man who can only feel his own pain, not that of others, a man who murdered his family without compunction and then felt sorry for himself because of the tragedy he had to endure.<br />I have often wondered about such people, the so-called psychopaths among us.  What I wonder is, are they a completely different type of human being from the rest of us, or do we deceive ourselves?  Is it possible that they are only an extreme example of what we ourselves are?<br />A book like this makes us wonder even more.  How a man who seemed to love his family, who called his parents every night before going to bed, who cuddled his children and loved his wife, who seemed normal and admirable to his friends, a person whom others trusted with their life savings--how could he suddenly be exposed as a pitiless fraud and a murderer?  How could everybody be so wrong about him?<br />In the jungle, animals prey on other animals, sometimes by taking advantage of a weakness, as when a spider spins a web that the fly doesn't see, or because of their superior strength, as when the tiger fells the lamb.  Do the sociopaths among us, some not actually violent, as Romand wasn't until his money ran out, have a kind of talent or psychological trick of behavior that takes advantage of our weakness?  Are they a kind of monstrous humanity that preys upon society like a parasite that is so camouflaged that it cannot be distinguished from its prey?<br />Carr&egrave;re's point of view, that of a writer who thrust himself into this man's life, forced him to examine his feelings toward this man whom he had in some sense befriended.  What effect did this conjoining have on Carr&egrave;re?<br />Carr&egrave;re answers this question.  He writes after seeing Romand become filled with the joy of Christ's love and forgiveness, the tears running down Romand's cheeks, that he does not believe that Romand \\"is putting on an act,\\" but that \\"the liar inside\\" of Romand is \\"putting one over on him.\\" (p. 191)  In short, Carr&egrave;re believes that the \\"adversary\\" is deceiving Romand once again.  The \\"adversary,\\" by the way, is defined by Carr&egrave;re as another name for the devil.<br />Pardon me for not being completely satisfied with that.  Romand fools himself always so that he may live with himself, so that he will not fall into the state of depression that he so richly deserves, but let's not conjure up any devils to blame.  To know all is to forgive all, it is said, and Christ does indeed forgive all, but in this world among others we must obey the laws of people, and if we do not we must pay the price and accept the responsibility.  Romand is, was, and will be the monster, the man who murdered his wife, his parents and his little children in an attempt to save himself from the pain of exposure.  That's the bottom line.  May GOD have mercy on his soul.the \\"adversary\\" is deceiving Romand once again.

They note that while Freudian psychology has failed, the new psychopharmacology that is replacing the \\"talk cure\\" is itself fraught with problems.  As in T. M. Luhrmann's Of Two Minds: The Growing Disorder in American Psychiatry (2000), which might be compared with this volume, Hobson and Leonard believe that it is a combination of drugs and therapy that is needed.<br />The first part of the book recalls the old state asylums and the fifty-minute hours of the psychoanalysts and how that system managed the mentally ill, however poorly.  Then came the destruction of that system at the hands of budget-minded politicians (e.g., the \\"let &#8219;em sleep in the streets\\" Reaganites) and HMOs, thereby precipitating the current crisis.  The authors emphasize however that the lack of a firm scientific foundation doomed the old psychiatry to extinction, regardless of financial considerations.  They see brain science (e.g., neuroscience) as the hope of a new generation.  I think they're right, but let's not hold our breath.  Just reading their take on the current understanding of schizophrenia in Part Three is enough to dispel any notions we might have of a cure anytime soon.<br /><br />Schizophrenia of course is the black beast of mental health.  Nothing really works toward a cure.  Therapy is practically useless, and the drugs prescribed tend mostly to sedate or mask symptoms and to have bad side effects so that the patient often stops taking them.  If you go out into the streets of any city in this country and observe or talk to the homeless, you'll find that a substantial number of them are clearly schizophrenic as defined in DSM-IV.  If you look at suicides or those attempting suicide you'll find that a significant percentage of them are depressed.  Add the various anxiety disorders and you have psychiatry's big three, which the authors explore in chapters imaginatively entitled, \\"Anxiety and the Fear Machine,\\" \\"Searching for Doctor Doom,\\" and \\"The Land of Voices.\\"  Cure these and psychiatry may become as busy as the Maytag repair man.<br />In-between these two parts is Part Two on consciousness and the dream world.  So we have Part One: the rise and fall of psychiatry, Part Two: the nature of consciousness, Part Three: the main mental disorders, and Part Four: the prescription.  I can't say much about the prescription which includes \\"neurodynamics,\\" their brave new psychology based on brain science, but I like their take on consciousness and their definition: \\"awareness of information processed by the brain.\\" (p. 76)  Implied in this definition is the fact that we are not in contact with \\"raw reality\\" but instead are limited to \\"information received, selected, translated into abstract neural codes, and processed by the brain.\\" (p. 78)  Hobson and Leonard  realize that consciousness is a continuum, and that dogs and cats and even cockroaches have at least a rudimentary consciousness (see p. 81).  They also make the nice point (p. 80) that consciousness is not the same as memory ...[or] thought... [C]onsciousness is awareness and awareness need not involve thought.\\"<br />The text is readable up to a point.  The part about how the brain works is difficult to follow if, like me, you are not readily familiar with the functions of the cerebellum, cerebrum, thalamus, hippocampus, etc., or can't tell them apart without a map.  Fortunately the authors do provide a couple of drawings that help.  I mention this as a failing on my part and as a reminder to myself that to be a really informed layperson today, an understanding of the structure of the brain and how its components work (in so far as we know) is becoming basic.  This is just another example of how complicated our world has become, and how hopelessly lost are those whose world view scorns education for the absolute \\"knowledge\\" of fundamentalist religions or the discredited psychologies of bygone eras.<br />The authors however are not throwing out the baby of therapy with the bath water of the psychoanalytic construct.  They are signaling the change from the \\"guesswork\\" of the old therapies to the new paradigm of brain science.  I just hope that messieurs Hobson and Leonard realize that a reductionist and/or holistic look inside the black box of the brain needs to be allied with the study of behavior from an evolutionary point of view.  Such an understanding would, for example, help the authors with their \\"genetic bug\\" theory of schizophrenia presented on pages 199-201.  I think it would also help to explain the prevalence of depression and the bipolar disorder.  Depression is painful and self-destructive, and the wild highs and lows of bipolar (the authors recall the example of Margot Kidder) highly dysfunctional.  But if we look back into the prehistory we might see how such behavior developed in environments that were depressive and quickening by season.

They are signaling the change from the \\"guesswork\\" of the old therapies to the new paradigm of brain science.  I just hope that messieurs Hobson and Leonard realize that a reductionist and/or holistic look inside the black box of the brain needs to be allied with the study of behavior from an evolutionary point of view.  Such an understanding would, for example, help the authors with their \\"genetic bug\\" theory of schizophrenia presented on pages 199-201.  I think it would also help to explain the prevalence of depression and the bipolar disorder.  Depression is painful and self-destructive, and the wild highs and lows of bipolar (the authors recall the example of Margot Kidder) highly dysfunctional.  But if we look back into the prehistory we might see how such behavior developed in environments that were depressive and quickening by season.

She is as careful as a poet in the words she uses, and she expresses her sentiments like a classicist, with restraint and the long view.  Here her purpose is to turn down the heat in the debate about genetic engineering by pointing out that we humans have been engineering plants and animals for thousands of years.  She writes, for example, that \\"inserting a Bt gene into corn was not nearly as big a deal as creating corn in the first place. 'That' was a very big deal.\\" (p. 34)<br /><br />A \\"Bt\\" gene is from the bacterium, Bacilllus thuringiensis, that produces a toxin that kills moths.  It also kills monarch butterflies, and Hubbell is giving her reaction to what she terms the \\"FRANKENFOOD KILLS BUTTERFLIES!!!!\\" story (p. 22-23) from a few years ago.  In short, Hubbell thinks that we have already done a whole lot of genetic engineering and that what we are doing today is just a continuation of that.  She warns against unintended consequences of genetic modifications, but she is not alarmed.  She writes, \\"This is an interesting and hopeful time in which to live, even more so to be born into.  Our grandchildren are lucky.  We are rapidly acquiring knowledge, if not yet understanding, of the genetic basis of life.\\" (p. 159)<br /><br />Well, I'm not alarmed either, but there is no denying that transgenetic organisms will escape from our farms and ranches and mate up with other creatures in the wild, and there will indeed be those \\"unintended consequences\\" that we are warned about.  Hubbell calls this the \\"problem of limits: How do we limit the effects of six billion of our kind on the rest of the world and avoid making alterations that harm other kinds of life and change the world so drastically that we can no longer live in it ourselves?\\" (p. xii)<br /><br />Good question, and her answer is we have to \\"develop a deep, broad, and sensitive understanding\\" of the processes of life and \\"marry [that understanding]...to a broadened ecological intelligence.\\" (pp. 159-160)  And I suppose whether we are likely to do that or not really depends on whether one is an optimist or a pessimist.  Clearly Hubbell is an optimist.<br /><br />Hubbell writes primarily about corn, silkworms, cats, and apples in four easy to read and interesting chapters.  We learn how the silk industry began in China and how attempts were made again and again, often by government fiat, to transplant the farms to other places in the world, including the United States, and how most attempts failed.  We learn how corn was cultivated from teosinte and turned into the biggest agricultural crop in the US, in no small part because corn syrup has become the sweetener of choice by the American food industry, particularly in sodas and snack foods.  But what I want to know is what happened to the delicious and tender sweet (but not too sweet) yellow corn that came into the supermarkets every year?  Now what we get is white, bland, too sweet and nearly tasteless.  As Hubbell points out, sometimes what happens is crops are modified for appearance and shelf life and favor is sacrificed.  She gives the example of the red delicious apple that really is beautiful to look at, but too bland to be called delicious.<br /><br />Incidentally is it interesting to compare her chapter on apples with that by Michael Pollan in his The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World (2001).  Pretty much the same story is told of how apples do not develop to type from seed but need to be grafted; and how every once in a great while a tree grown from seed will indeed result in something very tasty.  Whereas Pollan had some fun debunking the Johnny Appleseed mythology while pointing out that most apples in those days were grown to be made into hard cider, Hubbell contents herself with mentioning that hard (and soft cider, she adds) were one of the few things people could drink that were safe.<br /><br />In the chapter on cats we learn that cats have shrunk as a consequence of their domestication; indeed they have smaller skulls and smaller brains.  However, Hubbell writes, \\"Just because...cats...have been genetically modified...it does not follow that they are any less  than their wild cousins.\\" (p. 94)  This reminds me of the idea that domesticated animals in general are (and need to be) \\"dumber\\" than their wild relatives.  Hubbell references Helmut Hemmer's Domestication: The Decline of Environmental Appreciation (1990) as explaining that domesticated cats can be tame because their \\"brain centers for sensitivity to changes in sound and movement are reduced,\\" making them \\"less jumpy\\" and \\"able to accept the fact that sometimes twigs snap.\\" (p. 92)  This reminds me of one of my pet theories that domesticated humans (perhaps I should say \\"self-domesticated\\") are not as smart as we once were when we roamed the savannahs and made our living hunting and gathering.  To live in our crowded cities with all the noise, crowding, pollution, etc., we must needs have our \\"environmental appreciation\\" turned down, otherwise we might suffer from sensory overload.  It might be that part of the price we pay to be civilized is to be dumbed down.<br /><br />I would enthusiastically give this book five stars, but it is rather short (160 pp; about 45,000 words).  Sue Hubbell said her previous book Waiting for Aphrodite would be her last, but then she got interested in the public debate over genetically engineering and so wrote this book.  I predict she will write another; at least I hope she does.

The subjects range from defenses of reductionism and Zionism to spats with social constructionists (including his essay on the Sokal Hoax), to debates about the history of science and the prospects for utopia to the anthropic principle and final theories in physics. They have in common, besides Weinberg's well-mannered and modest (but not self-deprecating) prose, a belief in the advancement of scientific knowledge, and a criticism of mysticism, religion and ignorance. I found myself in substantial agreement with Weinberg on almost every subject, and in admiration of his measured, fair and very wise expression.<br /><br />In the essay, \\"Confronting O'Brien\\" (that's the O'Brien of Orwell's 1984), Weinberg makes it clear where he stands on the possibility of two plus two equaling five, or on the so-called \\"strong\\" social constructionist view of scientific knowledge. He writes that while \\"there is no such thing as a clear and universal scientific method\\", nonetheless, \\"under the general heading of scientific method\\" there is \\"a commitment to reason...and a deference to observation and experiment,\\" and \\"Above all...a respect for reality as something outside ourselves, that we explore but do not create.\\" (p. 43)<br /><br />In the chapter, \\"The Non-Revolution of Thomas Kuhn,\\" Weinberg writes that \\"the task of science is to bring us closer and closer to objective truth.\\" It is here that I demur. I think it would be better to say that science more and more allows us to better manipulate the environment to our advantage (or disadvantage!) and to see further into that environment--to smaller phenomena, more distant objects, and more clearly into the past and the present--rather than to speak of \\"objective truth,\\" which in this context is little different from \\"ultimate truth,\\" or a \\"final theory of everything.\\" The dream of \\"objective truth\\" is the dream of religion and is anathema to Weinberg's sentiments elsewhere in the book. Note, however, that he carefully writes, \\"closer and closer to objective truth.\\" That's a nice qualification, but I think he should have qualified the notion of \\"objective truth\\" as well.<br /><br />But Prof. Weinberg is not without the means for having fun with his listeners and readers. He writes on page 87 from a talk to the National Association of Scholars about the scientific method, that \\"There is one philosophic principle that I find of use here...[that] there is a kind of zing--to use the best word I can think of--that is quite unmistakable when real scientific progress is being made.\\" Clearly he is playing with the notion of a \\"philosophic\\" principle. Indeed, on the last page of the book he confesses, \\"I don't believe it is actually possible to prove anything about most of the things (apart from mathematical logic) that they [philosophers] argue about.\\"<br /><br />Proving that he is not hopelessly locked into a finite but unbounded universe, he notes several times in the book that the universe may be infinite; indeed one of the chapters is entitled, \\"Before the Big Bang.\\" He also writes, \\"Chaotic inflation has in a sense revived the idea of a steady state theory in a grander form; our own Big Bang may be just one episode in a much larger universe that on average never changes.\\" (pp. 176-177)<br /><br />Weinberg's sense of humor is rather dry. While scolding journalists for writing that the Big Bang theory is unraveling, he observes (p. 175), \\"Journalists generally have no bias toward one cosmological theory or another, but many have a natural preference for excitement.\\" Or, his take off on Kuhn's repeated and grandiose use of the word \\"paradigm\\" (after noting a paradigm shift from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics): \\"Now that really &lt;was> a paradigm shift. For Kuhn it seems to have been the paradigm of paradigm shifts...\\" (p. 204)<br /><br />Also: \\"Any possible universe could be explained as the work of some sort of designer. Even a universe that is completely chaotic...could be supposed to have been designed by an idiot.\\" (p. 232) Or (same page), \\"The human mind remains extraordinarily difficult to understand, but so is the weather.\\"<br /><br />Weinberg's critique of religion takes no prisoners. He writes (p. 241), \\"...on balance the moral influence of religion has been awful.\\" He adds, \\"With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil--that takes religion.\\" (p. 242) He got a lot of flak for that, but considering the situation in the Middle East, his words seem prescient, although he was merely glancing back at history.<br /><br />My favorite essays are the ones on the argument from design, the critique of Thomas Kuhn's thought, and the chapter on utopias. In the first he makes a neat distinction between anthropic reasoning that is \\"mystical mumbo jumbo,\\" and that which is \\"just common sense.\\" (p. 238) In the latter, while denigrating the prospect of a technological utopia, he writes that a world without work, a world in which people instead pursue the arts, science, etc., would be unsatisfactory (actually he mentions \\"general misery\\") because \\"there is only so much new literature...only so much new music,\\" etc. to see and hear, and with so much competition, our work would get but scant notice. I really didn't understand this because people will make work where there is none, even if it is only working on their psyches and those of their friends, their bodies, etc. And besides, where is the end of exploring and of learning? Furthermore, the real joy is in the doing, not in the being noticed.<br /><br />Perhaps this reveals part of Steven Weinberg's personality to us.

1622985:US	49786731	R35EZ7EFP9HUUG	0743421876	994651887	The secret life of germs observations and lessons from a microbe hunter	Books	5	35	38	N	N	A readable, fact-packed manual for germophobes	Germophobes unite!  If you're the type of person (as I am) who washes his or her hands several times a day, usually the first thing I do when I get home, avoids putting fingers to mouth or nose, doesn't touch doorknobs if they can be avoided, flushes public toilets with the sole of your shoe-covered foot, etc., etc., then this is a book to further your phobia.  You will be justified.  Prof Tierno, who has impressive academic credentials and a claim to fame as \\"the man who helped solve the mystery behind toxic shock syndrome\\" sounds a very stringent warning here about the dangers of the wrong microbes in the wrong places.  He is, I must report, a bit of a germophobe himself, but a learned one.  He sprinkles his text with what he calls \\"Protective Response Strategies\\" to help us maneuver our way through the microbial jungle that lives in, on and all around us.  The first response strategy is on \\"How to wash your hands.\\"<br />I've always had a small problem with that.  Not at home, where the germs are MY germs, but in public places, especially restrooms.  Is it better to just go in, relieve yourself, and exit, being careful not to touch the door handle, or any surface someone else may have touched?  (Where there's a handle to pull open the door, I try to grab it with one finger at the very top, thinking nobody else is likely to have grabbed it there.)  Or should I stop to wash?  But if I stop to \\"wash\\" that means I have to touch the faucet, but how can I not touch it last, which may be worse than not washing at all?  Tierno has the answer: turn the water off with a paper towel in your hand.  Another problem is how to get that paper towel into the trash cylinder without touching the spring-loaded opening.  Sometimes what I do is push it open with the towel in my hand and try to drop the towel before it springs shut.  Usually it lands on the floor.  I used to feel bad about that, but Tierno has a suggestion for places that don't have waste receptacles that has made me feel better: \\"Drop the towel on the floor.  If enough people do so, there will soon be a receptacle there, as there should be.\\" (p. 29)<br />\\"Germs\\" in Tierno's usage are microbes, viruses, bacteria, protozoa, yeast, molds, etc.  He gives a wealth of information about many of them, how they spread, how they cause disease, and what we can do about lessening our chance of catching something horrible.  He addresses various health issues, and traces the now global spread of disease, from AIDs to Ebola to Legionnaires, to the new threat from tuberculosis and weapons grade anthrax, to rhinoviruses (\\"nose viruses\\"), which cause colds, and hantaviruses, which can kill you, and beyond.  An interesting (and unsettling) point he makes is that some germs, like the ubiquitous Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, which usually lives peacefully on our skin, can become lethal if they get to the wrong place in the body.  Also there is the very unsettling possibility that a germ may mutate from one that our immune system has in control to one that kills us.<br />Well, germs are not going anywhere.  They were here long before we were, and they'll surely be here long after we are gone.  We need to make our peace with them, learn to live with them (multicellular life would be impossible without microbes to break down dead tissue, to produce oxygen, to serve as the base of the food chain, etc.) and reduce their noxious effects.  Tierno's book may not make you feel any easier about the invisible little devils that make up perhaps the majority of the biomass on the planet (most of it underground, it now appears), but it will make you feel more knowledgeable, and you will perhaps gain a grudging respect for their amazing abilities.<br />By the way, a gram of human fecal matter contains about one trillion microbes.  A gram of matter from the surface of our teeth contains about one hundred billion microbes. And that sweet saliva we used to exchange when we were young, despite being a gooddigestive fluid, contains about one hundred million microbes per milliliter. (p. 46)<br />Finally I want to note that Tierno has solved (for me at least) a very strange mystery that has been making news lately.  Childhood asthma rates in the US have increased greatly in recent years, while some authorities have noted that rates in the Third World are lower than rates in the United States. (pp. 166-167)  How can this be?  Tierno writes, \\"One reason that childhood asthma rates seem to be lower in the Third World is very likely the fact that several million Third World children a year die at very early ages...\\"  He adds, \\"...many Third World children simply don't live long enough to be recorded as having asthma...\\" (p. 167).  Additionally, he notes on page 168, \\"If we are looking for an explanation for the 158 percent increase in asthma in the United States over the past two decades, we might reasonably begin by noticing that the same period has seen a large increase in the number of people living in poverty, thanks to big increases in immigration.\\"<br />One more thing: There was a Seinfeld TV episode in which Elaine's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Puddy, is a member of a fictional (I think) organization called \\"Germophobes Anonymous.\\"  If it had a manual, Prof. Tierno's very readable, but rather disquieting book would serve very well indeed.digestive fluid, contains about one hundred million microbes per milliliter.

Piper.<br /><br />This essay by Wellesley Professor of Philosophy Adrian Piper centers on two yogic practices, both much misunderstood, and worse, much misrepresented.  The first is celibacy (brahmacharya).  A lot of cant about how brahmacharya really means moderation or monogamy, sex within marriage only, or a non-lustful state of mind, etc., is given the ghost by Piper, who is a long practicing brahmacarin and expert on jnana yoga.  Piper's first point is that brahmacharya means quite simply what it is purported to mean, that is, celibacy.  Period.  Of course this is hard to accept, and for young people well-nigh impossible, and so most \\"authorities\\" have cheapened the message, have compromised the intent, and have said, what is meant is \\"moderation,\\" etc.  Some cultist gurus have even exploited this \\"interpretation\\" by assuming this mentality as their mantra: \\"I make love to you and only you (at this time) because you are special.  In this way I practice brahmacharya, I practice moderation and restraint.\\"<br /><br />Very appealing, but one might also slip through that eye of the needle and enter into the kingdom of heaven wearing a money belt.  Piper has no such delusions.  She's got it right.  Celibacy is celibacy.  That is why in the Hindu social philosophy one is first a student, and then a householder, then a mendicant and finally a renunciant.  Householders are not celibate.  In is only in the latter stages that one can be truly celibate.  (There are exceptions of course, just as there are exceptional people.)<br /><br />Having said this I must confess that I disagree with Professor Piper on one particular.  She writes (p. 39): \\"...the policy governing self-stimulation for brahmacharins is: Hands above the sheets!\\"  What this means, I imagine, is that one must, in so far as it is possible, not practice onanism.  Instead one should realize that celibacy means, as Piper phrases it, \\"to walk with God.\\"  This reminds me of the Catholic tradition that has the nuns \\"married\\" to Jesus--although, of course the God that Piper is referring to, the God of the Vedas, is Ineffable, being beyond anything we can say or not say.  I would differ with Piper by insisting that a complete understanding of celibacy includes this most important distinction of how one should practice sex, that is, quite simply, not with others.  Instead one should make love to oneself.  Indeed, this is part of self-study.  To say that one should not practice sexuality at all is to remain ignorant.  There are many reasons that the path of yoga includes brahmacharya, but the most important one is that the practice of celibacy is the best answer to the problem of sex.  Sex leads to copious karmas created.  It leads to distraction and worldly responsibility.  Ultimately, it leads to birth and death, to the perpetuation of the wheel of karma, which is exactly what the yogi wants to get away from, what the yogi is working to transcend.  One also acts through nonaction, the Gita teaches.  A kind of non-touching of oneself only prolongs and exacerbates the excitement, the tension and leads further along the path to sensuality.  That is why in tantra it is taught that the man should withhold...himself for as long as possible.  This is not done to conserve his strength, as some strictures have it, but to prolong his and her enjoyment.  Putting this minor disagreement aside, I have to say that Piper's delineation of brahmacharya demonstrates a profound understanding of the intent and practice of yoga.<br /><br />Her essay is also about the somewhat infamous tantra of the left-handed path, which she calls \\"California Tantra,\\" a felicitous phrase that captures the essence of the practice.  Again, Piper's insight and expression reveals her deep understanding of the subject.  As she writes (p. 56), \\"Variants on the general rule of thumb [for tantric yoga] might be: Party until you've gotten your yayas out; or until you've had enough partying for three lifetimes; or until you've learned the lessons from it you need to learn.\\"  This is tantric yoga in a nutshell: one finds liberation by giving into one's desires, it being believed that finally when the fires of youth are exhausted one will find samadhi (as Siddhartha does in Herman Hesse's celebrated novel).  Piper acknowledges on page 55 that this liberation is \\"nothing to sneeze at.\\"  What she doesn't say in her essay is that tantra of the left-handed path is a torturous and very painful way of finding God, to be employed only when all else fails.  It is the path of the junkie and the libertine; it is the roller coaster ride of exhaustive highs and lows; it is the path that will burn the aspirant out at an early age.  It is dangerous.<br /><br />Piper's final note is magnificent: \\"The point of &lt;ascetic> practices is not what one gives up but rather what one gets.\\"  She adds, \\"One does not give up the good life, but rather maximizes its goodness.\\"<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"ssion reveals her deep understanding of the subject.

He's been at it for fifty years or more, and is among the best at making science fascinating. One is reminded of the work of the late, great, and sorely missed Isaac Asimov. Like Asimov, Bova is the author of over a hundred books, both fiction and nonfiction, and is especially celebrated for his innovative science fiction. I have only one small criticism. In his touting of the Strategic Defense Initiative from the Reagan administration and how lasers can be used to knock down ballistic missiles, he fails to mention how easily they can be fooled by dummy targets while failing to point out how ineffectual lasers are against \\"suitcase\\" nuclear bombs. To his credit Bova admits his bias on page 282, a bias that came about because he was employed as a marketing manager for the Avco Everett Research Laboratory in Massachusetts, a company that was in the business of making high-powered lasers.<br />The chapters on the development of photography from the pinhole camera obscura to lasers, holography and fiber optics are among the most interesting. The fourth part of the book, \\"Book IV: To Seek,\\" beginning on page 323 is a readable, concise update on how electromagnetic radiation is helping us to explore the universe. In other words, Bova gets to talk about subjects he loves dearly, cosmology, physics and astronomy. This is not a work for scientists; instead there is a clear emphasis on satisfying the needs of the general reader by providing a wealth of information about light and just about anything to do with light, including painting, perception, how the eye works, photography, photosynthesis--indeed, even the origin of life--the search for extraterrestrial life, extrasolar planets, radiation, LASIK surgery, relativity, quantum mechanics, gemstones and their uses, time travel, the ozone layer, nuclear fission and fusion...etc. His enthusiasm for solar power and especially for Solar-Powered Satellites, \\"huge satellites that can generate gigawatts of solar electricity and send it to Earth through microwave beams\\" (p. 310) is infectious and welcome.<br />There is a modest bibliography and a short glossary and an index. One is occasionally amused at Bova's asides and quaint cultural references (e.g., Jimmy Durante!). He keeps a light-hearted tone and mixes in bits of toastmaster humor. I'm thinking of the \\"Hungarian recipe\\" for an omelette: \\"First, steal some eggs...\\" (p. 291) or his description of the active element fluorine in contrast to the relatively inert xenon, as \\"a used-car salesman who is running for mayor.\\" (p. 271)<br />The Story of Light can be profitably read by teenagers as well as by lay persons looking to keep up with recent developments set in a clear historical context.e satellites that can generate gigawatts of solar electricity and send it to Earth through microwave beams\\" (p. 310) is infectious and welcome.<br />There is a modest bibliography and a short glossary and an index.

The taboo holds simply because it is a taboo, a combination of instinctive and learned behavior that will not and cannot yield to reason or evidence.  Consequently it doesn't matter how well Entine's book is written, how rational his arguments are or how well supported by evidence.  The taboo won't change because a taboo is the ultimate expression of the kind of behavior we call politically and socially correct; that is, behavior that is judged from the standpoint of whether it is in agreement with the tribal view.  It has nothing to do with objectivity or scientific truth.  Taboos are beliefs that the tribe deliberately holds regardless of the evidence.  That is the whole point.  The political and social truth is so important to the tribe that the \\"actual\\" or \\"objective\\" or scientific truth is secondary.  The only way to change a taboo is to change the learned and instinctive assumptions (usually hidden from the conscious mind) on which it is based.  In the case of many taboos, murder, for example, the taboo can be re-directed through the coercive and/or persuasive power of the society.  But this relearning process only works on young, unindoctrinated minds.  The old people will die with their prejudices intact.  In this sense Entine's is a book whose influence will not really be felt until the generation growing up today comes of age.<br />The third thing to note is that it doesn't matter whether blacks are superior in sports or not.  Sport is a social construct with arcane rules and an underlying tribal psychology.  The purpose of sport is to keep the young occupied with a socially-acceptable channel for their energies, and to allow the herd instinct of the populace some kind of focus for their aggressions and loyalties.  Our nearly worshipful attitude toward athletes is an artifact of this purpose.  The fact that somebody runs 100 meters a tenth of second faster than somebody else is of enormous significance in the social construct of sport.  But in the greater world such a difference is trivial.  The fact that some athletes can sky so high and have such \\"hang time\\" as to be able to take a quarter off the top of the backboard \\"and leave change\\" is no more significant that the fact that somebody can hold his breath for five minutes, or can stand on his head for a week, or cry real tears on cue into the eye of the camera.  These \\"accomplishments\\" are significant only to the extent that the tribe makes them significant.<br />Jon Entine finds it hard to understand why so many otherwise intelligent people cannot open their eyes to the truth of black superiority in sport.  But what I think he is missing is that those intelligent people know there are better ways of spending their time than discerning or not discerning a fine distinction of little import, especially when their work--if they are scientists, or their perception, if they are lay people--is liable to be judged not on intrinsic qualities but on the fit with the political zeitgeist.  What I find hard to understand is how some people can devote so much of their lives to watching other people run and jump, and/or throw, kick and hit balls or each other.  Maybe they have nothing better to do.focus for their aggressions and loyalties.  Our nearly worshipful attitude toward athletes is an artifact of this purpose.

1645239:US	49786731	R1D3HJDHO7LBR1	0393020185	790320833	The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry	Books	5	29	34	N	N	How genetic knowledge is rewriting the prehistory	This is a popular book of scientific discovery written in an affecting and engaging style by a geneticist who has the all too rare gift of writing extremely readable prose.<br />Professor Bryan Sykes draws the reader into his story as easily as a best-selling novelist.  And this is just the \\"science\\" part of the book which lasts for fourteen chapters.  Then come the fictional chapters about the seven daughters and their imagined stories, so touching and so full of the very human struggle to survive in the prehistory that I could not read them without misting up.  (But then I tend to the sentimental.)<br />Sykes begins with the story of how he was able to identify a living descendant of the five-thousand year old \\"ice man\\" found in northern Italy in 1994 by comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences.  Mitochondrial DNA is contained only in egg cells (thus, \\"Eve\\" and her daughters), not in sperm cells, and transmitted without recombination so that the changes are all the result of mutations that occur at a predictable rate over time.  Then he tells the story of how the bodies of the murdered Romanovs, the last of the Russian Tsarist families, were identified through DNA fingerprinting.  Both of these stories are more about media events and ventures in forensics than original scientific work.  But then comes the story of where the Pacific Islanders originated.<br />When I was young I read the engaging story of Thor Heyerdahl in his book Kon-Tiki in which he attempted to prove that the Polynesians originated in the Americas by sailing west into the Pacific.  This beguiling theory is demolished once and for all by the DNA evidence that Sykes presents.  He shows that the Polynesians were originally from Southeast Asia and made all their great ocean discoveries by sailing against the prevailing winds, going east toward the Americas.<br />Sykes notes that because this was the prevailing scientific opinion his work met with mostly agreement.  However when he and other geneticists were able to show that the current population of Europe is mainly descended from the original hunters and gathers that lived there prior to the arrival of the farmers who brought agriculture from the Middle East roughly ten thousand years ago, they ran into resistence.  The prevailing scientific opinion was that the farmers overwhelmed the hunters and that most of today's Europeans are descended from those farmers.  Sykes relates the story of the scientific controversy and how the genetic proof finally prevailed against entrenched opinion.  Incidentally, to me the intriguing thing about this discovery is the question, not addressed in the book: What, if any, conclusions can we draw from the fact that 80% of our European genes came from hunters and gathers and only 20% from Middle Eastern farmers?<br />There is also the story of the \\"Cheddar Man\\" and how Sykes learned to extract DNA from the bones of people dead tens of thousands of years.  Finally there is his argument for all people of European descent coming from just seven women who lived ten thousand to forty thousand years ago, the so-called, \\"Seven Daughters of Eve.\\"  (World-wide Sykes identifies 33 \\"daughters of Eve.\\")<br />To round out the book, Sykes writes an imaginative chapter about each one of the seven daughters.  Here is where some readers are displeased, claiming that Sykes's imaginings are unscientific and even slanted.  One reader complained about the men out hunting and the women remaining behind in caves as a kind of stereotype that has been overcome.  But remember Sykes is writing in six cases out of seven about European peoples who made their living primarily from hunting during the ice ages, not from gathering.  Think about how much \\"gathering\\" the Inuit do and you can see why he emphasized hunting.  In the seventh case, about Jasmine, whom he sees as being from the birthplace of agriculture in modern Syria, his story is different.  Indeed he has Jasmine and her non-hunting mate inventing agriculture!  I might also point out for those who skimmed the \\"daughters of Eve\\" chapters, that he also has a woman playing a major part in the invention of water-going craft.<br />If I were to criticize this book I would say he was too generous in his depiction of human beings in the prehistory.  He describes their lives as hunters and gathers, their hardships and their short and difficult lives with an emphasis on their humanity and how that helped them to survive.  He downplays any part humans may have had in the extinction of the Neanderthal.  He relates no rapes or murders or tribal wars, and de-emphasizes tribal sexism.  He shows the beginnings of trade and cooperation.  The result is so warm and touching I'm surprised that Stephen Spielberg hasn't taken out an option on the book.  (Maybe he has!)<br />Finally, this is not an academic tome.  It is a popular science book meant for educated lay persons.  There are no learned academics writing glowing blurbs on the cover.  Most academics would be afraid to write a book like this because of the imaginative chapters which are quasi-scientific and can be so easily criticized.<br />In short Professor Sykes is a tremendously engaging writer (with guts) who happens to be a world-class scientist.  His goal was to communicate something about what he has learned to a wide readership, and I think he did a good job.  If you can read this book without feeling better about humanity, maybe you should read it again.iculture!

1655396:US	49786731	RLTG0L6PASE25	1563841908	523019361	Elusive Innocence: Survival Guide for the Falsely Accused	Books	4	47	47	N	N	Incisive expose of a national disgrace and cause for hope	At the center of this important (and frankly, long overdue) book about parents falsely accused of sexually abusing their children is a pernicious phenomenon called the \\"Sexual Allegations In Divorce\\" (SAID) syndrome.  This syndrome is symptomatic of a legal and child protective services system gone horribly wrong, so that not only aren't the children being protected from abuse, they end up being abused by the system itself.<br /><br />The syndrome arises when one of the parties injects false allegations of child sexual abuse into the divorce proceedings in an attempt to get the upper hand.  Usually, but not always, it is the mother who does this, especially a mother who, as Tong documents, either has something to hide or is otherwise unfit to gain custody of the children.  The accusation works especially well when the child is very young and is easily led by the parent who has custody.  The accusation usually works because child protective services and the courts are predisposed to believe the accusing parent, sometimes in complete disregard of the evidence.<br /><br />What then follows is a nightmare for all concerned, especially the children whose family is now irrevocably split.  The accused parent is denied visitation rights and stigmatized as some kind of moral degenerate while the accusing parent is exposed to the children as a liar seeking vengeance.  Then comes the sexual abuse interrogations of the children and the \\"therapy\\" by counselors, social workers, psychologists and/or psychiatrists.<br /><br />Accused parents may now lose everything important to them, not only their children, their life savings, but their livelihood and their reputations as well.  They are caught in a web of legalities and accusations beyond their ability to contend with or understand.  They are drained emotionally and financially in a desperate attempt to prove their innocence.  Even if they do prove that the charges are false--which, as Tong clearly shows, is very difficult--they still may not get the right to see their children because the child protection agencies typically act autonomously without regard for legal niceties concerning evidence or due process.  They will even ignore the verdict of the court!  Even if the accused could somehow prove his or her innocence, many people would continue to believe otherwise.  Indeed, the insidiously terrible thing about charges of child sexual abuse, is that the charge, once made, never entirely goes away.<br /><br />So what can you do if you are charged with sexually abusing your children by a vindictive and morally-challenged spouse who has hired a win-at-all-costs lawyer aided by child counseling people desirous of increasing therapeutic opportunities for themselves and their colleagues?  Very little if you are not informed.  A lot if you understand what you are up against and how the system works.<br /><br />Tong begins with his own case, followed by a history of three similar cases.  His narrative is compellingly written and sympathetic and arouses our profound indignation.  He summarizes the case studies showing what they have in common and gives a list of indicators.  Chapter 8 is a focus on the syndrome, while other chapters are devoted to each of  the participants.  There is a particularly devastating expos&eacute; in Chapter 10 of the misleading indoctrinational use of the infamous \\"anatomically correct\\" dolls and the damage done to children by such use.  Tong shows how the children are led--I would even say brainwashed--into giving the social services people the answers they want to hear.  For reasons that Tong makes clear, the answer they almost always want to hear is that the accused has sexually abused the child.<br /><br />Particularly valuable are chapters 14 and 15 on \\"fighting back\\"; Chapter 17 on problems and solutions; Chapter 18 \\"A Self-Help Guide,\\" and Chapter 19, \\"An Attorney's View,\\" written by Charles Jamieson, who obviously has had a lot of experience in child abuse cases.  The ten appendices are also valuable and interesting.  There is a chapter on the Borderline Personality Disorder (subtitled: \\"Survival Guide for Non-BPs\\") because Tong believes that BPs have just the \\"kind of twisted and devious\\" minds that \\"would use a child as a pawn in a custody battle.\\" (p. 171)<br /><br />I would enthusiastically give this book five stars except for the fact that, although it is clearly and strongly written, fair almost to a fault at times, and of great value to those who are accused, its documentation and editing are not first rate.  First of all, there is no index.  In a book like this an index is essential.  There are too many typos, too much repetition--some of it intentional, surely, but a lot of it gratuitous--and there are some annoying editing problems.  For example:<br /><br />The words, \\"Listen to the kids and help them deal with it...  Don't act like another parent.  You're supposed to be a friend, someone to help...\\" are attributed to \\"Martha\\" on page 82 but then to \\"Mary\\" on page 107.<br /><br />When Tong writes on page 160 that if the case stays in the \\"gray area,\\" the judge will rule \\"on the side of the child,\\" he surely means \\"on the side of the accuser.\\"<br /><br />On page 162 this short list of feminist authors is given, \\"Steinhem, Walker, Terr, Ireland, and Allred.\\"  Their full names need to be used.<br /><br />On pages 195-202 the chapter title line on the right hand pages gives the title of the previous chapter.<br /><br />The outline in Appendix A is unclear and misnumbered.<br /><br />In Appendix H it is not made clear that Dr. Robert Fay is (apparently) the author of pages 262-266, and not just the two indented paragraphs on page 262.<br /><br />Is the \\"child abuse syndrome\\" referred to on page 241 and then again on 242 the same as the \\"Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome\\" mentioned on page 243?

Instead he would like to see a \\"focus on the cellular templet rather than the molecular gene.\\"  He believes this would represent \\"a significant divergence from the genocentric conception of life that now dominates the scientific literature and even more so, the popular press.\\" (p. 100)  Harold makes a strong case for his point of view; indeed, it is this book more than any other that has made me see the overriding influence the immediate molecular environment has on reproduction and growth.<br />The genome has its \\"recipe,\\" its code of instructions, but what Harold is at pains to tell us is that without the four-dimensional cellular environment in which the gene's \\"instructions\\" are carried out in a step-by-step process, there would be no growth or reproduction.<br />What this means is that the shape and temperature, the position and abundance of the surrounding cellular elements themselves shape the genetic expression as much as or even more than the genome.  All life comes from life.  All cells come from cells.  There is no acting out of the genetic code outside a cellular environment.<br />And so we see Harold's frustration and that of other molecular biologists at all the hoopla that has accompanied the sequencing of the genome when it is clear that reading the code is just a very small step toward understanding how the cell reproduces itself and grows.  What we need to understand is the intricate environment of the cell and how it interacts with the code leading to the  epigenetic assembly of the cell and ultimately of the organism.  The complications inherent in such an enterprise are truly mind-boggling in the extreme.  Analysis of the four-dimensional factors would overwhelm the fastest computers in existence--all of them at the same time--if somehow we could figure out how to employ them to aid our analysis.<br />These facts explain why scientists like Harold are insistent upon a holistic approach to biology and why they again and again warn about the limitations of a reductionist approach.  Life is just too complicated to be understood by breaking it down into pieces and attempting to put it back together, or to reverse engineer it.<br />On page 213 there is an interesting comparison of E. O. Wilson's view that there is \\"progress\\" in evolution and Stephen J. Gould's emphatic view that there is not.  Harold seems to be implying that because organisms have become more complex that there is indeed at least \\"direction\\" in evolution.  I would go further than this and observe that the rise of complex culture-bearing organisms like humans, who may be able to protect their home planet from a death-dealing meteor, implies if not \\"progress\\" in evolution, something equally agreeable.  However, I would not say that our rise was inevitable.  Indeed, along with Gould I would call it a contingency.<br />Much of the book, especially chapters three through eight, is a technical exploration of the microbial world of the cell using concepts and terminology not readily accessible to the lay reader.  Harold is aware of this, at least for Chapter 4, \\"Molecular Logic,\\" where he writes on page 35, \\"...students of biochemistry will find little in [the chapter]...that is new to them, but for the layman it may be like sipping water from a firehose.\\" (!)  Professor Harold provides a glossary, but one suspects one is out of one's depth when the words searched for are not in the glossary, but can be found in an ordinary dictionary!<br />Nonetheless the broad outlines of Harold's message can be discerned without appreciating fully the intricacies of cell metabolism and development.  The introductory chapters, \\"Schr&ouml;dinger's Riddle\\" and \\"The Quality of Life\\" explore the question that physicist Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger famously asked in his much admired little book, WhatIs Life? (1944), a book that very much impressed the young Franklin Harold.  In the closing chapters, beginning with Chapter 9 \\"By Descent with Modification,\\" and especially the engaging Chapter 10 \\"So What is Life?\\", Harold looks more generally at evolution.  He touches on the new science of complexity and how it relates to biology, and on the thermodynamics of ecosystems and how that affects natural selection.  His treatment of some of the controversies in evolutionary theory is both illuminating and balanced, so much so that one would like to quote whole passages.  This is obviously a subject Professor Harold has thought long and hard about for many years.  Here are some examples of his thought:<br />\\"...[F]orm is not directly or rigidly determined by the genotype: the genes define a range within which the phenotype falls, but forms arise epigenetically as the result of developmental processes.\\" (p. 209)<br />\\"Organisms are historical creatures, the products of evolution; we should not expect to deduce all their properties from universal laws.\\" (p. 218)<br />\\"What we lack is an understanding of the principles that ultimately make living organisms living, and in their absence we cannot hope to integrate the phenomenon of life into the familiar framework of physical law.  I am not here to advocate a veiled vitalism, nor to sneak in a creator by the back door.  But...until we have forged rational links between the several domains of science, our understanding of life will remain incomplete and even superficial.\\" (p. 218)<br />\\"...[W]hile a  machine implies a machine maker, an organism is a self-organizing entity.\\" (p. 220)<br />\\"Organisms process matter and energy as well as information; each represents a dynamic node in a whirlpool of several currents, and self-reproduction is a property of the collective, not of genes....

It is at once a distillation and compilation of all that Georg Feuerstein has gleaned in his extensive travels both academically and spiritually.  It greatly broadens the usual scope of yoga to include its manifestation in other religions and goes back in time to the edge of the prehistory.  Feuerstein understands that yoga is both an ancient practice, and, by itself, a profound and venerable religion.  More than anything, however, it is a salient expression of the culture and philosophy, the lifestyle and history of the Indian subcontinent where it was the midwife of the great religions of Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism and of course that great body of belief and practice known as Hinduism.<br /><br />Feuerstein is in one sense a true believer.  He has devoted his life to the study of yoga and attendant phenomena, in particular Hinduism and the broad Tantric tradition.  One gets the sense that even here in this lengthy work, he knows much more than he is conveying; that there is a synergistic power in his extensive knowledge that allows him to know things that he cannot express.  One feels his intense desire to say something that perhaps cannot be said, something spiritual and personal that can only be experienced.<br /><br />In another sense he is a hard-working scholar who reports on what he has learned without passing unnecessary judgments or drawing unwarranted conclusions, although he does interpret.  He is, in this sense, the American expression of the great Romanian scholar Mircea Eliade (who wrote in French) with perhaps a pinch of the Indian philosopher Sri Aurobindo, on the one hand, and the English tantrist Sir John Woodroffe, on the other, folded in.<br /><br />The book begins with a thorough definition of yoga and then an overview, and then its inescapable conjoining with Hinduism.  This is \\"Part One: Foundations.\\"  Then Feuerstein looks at \\"Pre-Classical Yoga\\" and overviews the entire Vedic tradition including the yoga of the earliest Upanishads, culminating in its expression in the Bhagavad Gita.  Then in \\"Part Three: Classical Yoga,\\" he comes to Patanjali and the yoga of the eight limbs, the famous yoga of the aphorisms.  Part Four is \\"Post-Classical Yoga\\" from the later Yoga-Upanishads from the Middle Ages in which the focus is on bhakti, technique, mantra and meditation.  It is here that Western readers will find much that is new, or at least not readily available in English.  And it is here that a non-dualistic yogic philosophy (as opposed to the dualism of Patanjali) holds sway.  Part Five is on tantrism and \\"Yoga as Spiritual Alchemy.\\"  It is in this last part that the so-called \\"subtle body,\\" with its nadis and pranas, its cakras (\\"psychoenergetic centers\\") and the mysterious serpent power of kundalini, is explored in depth.  Here too we have the ritualistic practice of the five forbidden things from tantra yoga, the infamous \\"left-handed path.\\"  Here is Feuerstein's take: \\"Practitioners of the left-hand path (&lt;vâma-mârga>)--vâma means both \\"left\\" and \\"woman\\"--know they are breaking profound social taboos, and their only justification for their conduct is that their goal is not sensual gratification but self-transcendence in the context of bodily existence.\\" (p. 484)<br /><br />To me--and I have studied and practiced yoga for 28 years--yoga is first and foremost a profound psychology, a way of life that has evolved along with the human experience, from the prehistory to today, a guide on how to live that has come down to us in part (only in part: so much has been lost) as a philosophic and religious tradition.  Feuerstein's book is at once a great reference and a heart-felt exposition on the power of yoga to transcend this world in which we are enveloped in the \\"food sheath,\\" where we are both the eater and the eaten, but with our eyes on the stars.<br /><br />The book includes numerous black and whiteillustrations, passages from yogic works, and an extensive, selected bibliography.

He likes to introduce the obtuse and stuffy to themselves, as it were, and to laugh at the pretentious.  His favorite targets are on the Right, which is good, and his second favorite targets are on the Left, which is also good.  He is, strange to say, and perhaps unbeknownst to himself, as American as pizza pie and Cabernet Sauvignon, matzo balls and chow mein.  If he didn't exist we would have to invent him.  He is the heir of Mark Twain, H. L. Mencken and Edmund Wilson with a dollop of Truman Capote thrown in.  His ego is as wide as the Mississippi and his self-aggrandizement as consistent as the winter snow in Buffalo.  He has done everything in literature except write poetry, and he has probably done that, and I just don't know about it.  He has run for congress, for president, written screenplays (e.g., Suddenly Last Summer) and TV scripts, plays, and appeared in a science fiction movie (Gattaca).  He and William F. Buckley Jr. have played clowns for one another, and he has been the confidant, if not of presidents, then of first ladies.  He thinks of himself as beautiful, although it's been a long time since he really cared about that.  He is one of our finest and most penetrating social critics, an original who manages to occupy the left while maintaining a stance somewhere to the aristocratic right of the Boston blue bloods, although of course his roots are in the political south, in Tennessee, Washington, D.C. and Mississippi.<br /><br />I have never been able to read, much less appreciate, however, his fiction.  No doubt the failure is mine.  Yet I think it indisputable that Vidal is a much better essayist than he is a novelist.  In this, his latest collection--effectively just a continuation of his United States: Essays 1952-1992 (1993), a massive volume of 1,278 pages, also jacketed ironically in red, white and blue--Vidal continues his unrelenting attack on all things pretentious, pompous, political and/or simply within reach.<br /><br />He can be balanced (as in \\"Edmund Wilson: Nineteenth-Century Man,\\" the first essay), slighting with faint praise (\\"The Romance of Sinclair Lewis\\" p. 46), adoring (\\"Sinatra\\" p. 149), brutal (as in \\"Reply to a Critic\\" p. 79), and devastatingly funny, particularly when addressing the hijinks of American pols as in his essays on FDR, Truman, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, Al Gore, etc.  He is at his best when defending the constitution, human rights, freedom, and democracy against its enemies as in \\"Shredding the Bill of Rights,\\" p. 397, \\"A Letter to Be Delivered,\\" p. 436, and \\"Japanese Intentions in the Second World War,\\" p. 457, not to mention perhaps a hundred other essays here and elsewhere.  His main tactic is a cynical sarcasm laced with selected facts from his prodigious memory.  He can be ironic and surgically subtle, but he is not above plain old ridicule.  His style is accomplished and erudite without being stuffy.  His treatment is popular but without any concessions to the verbally challenged.<br /><br />But Gore Vidal (the \\"Gore\\" is from his mother's side of the family, the same family that spawned Al Gore) is also a classicist, thoroughly at home in Roman and Greek literature, and especially in Greek culture.  He is an expert on literature and politics, as knowledgeable as any academic and as cosmopolitan and worldly as any ambassador.  It is one of the ironies of Vidal's life, he being a staunch foe of what he has always seen as the frivolity of \\"bookchat\\" and its best-seller mentality, that he became with the historical novels he started writing in the sixties, a best-selling author himself, and a darling of the bookchat set.  Indeed, Gore Vidal is an ironic man: an American aristocrat who would disown his class and embrace the hoi-polloi while keeping his tie pin firmly in place.<br /><br />I was trying to see how his style has changed over the years, reading some of his essays from thefifties and sixties, and then this volume of 48 essays from the last decade.  I must say that he is just as opinionated, assertive and eloquent as ever.  I think he more carefully dotted his i's and crossed his t's in the old days, so that his sentences were perhaps a little more architectural, while today he is more relaxed and straight-forward.  One might say, nowadays he just lets it fly.<br /><br />In short, this collection is a splendid, energetic and thoroughly enjoyable romp through Americana land courtesy of one of our great tour masters.  Did I say that if Gore Vidal didn't exist, we would have to invent him?  Certainly America's twentieth century would not be the same without him.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"fifties and sixties, and then this volume of 48 essays from the last decade.

Korda, who is intimately connected with the list, having been there both as a writer (nonfiction: Power! How to Get It, How to Use It (1975) and a novel from 1985: Queenie) and as an editor with Simon & Schuster (Jacqueline Susann The Love Machine, and others, including books by Irving Wallace, Richard M. Nixon and Carlos Castaneda), presents the lists from Publisher's Weekly by decade.  He introduces each decade with a modest essay, focusing on some of the books and authors, and--most characteristically--noting trends and how the business has changed from decade to decade.  The prose flows as smooth as graphite (I read the book in a single setting) partly because Korda is a very good writer and partly because the type is double-spaced throughout (which I think might represent a trend he does not mention, namely that of publishing attractive hard cover books with fewer words per page).<br /><br />Originally just the top ten fiction titles appeared on PW's list.  It is only in recent decades that both the top 15 fiction and the top 15 nonfiction titles appear.  Nonetheless, perusing these lists really does, as Korda asserts, provide a kind of insight into the American psyche and how it has changed over the last hundred years--or, more saliently, how it hasn't.  Korda identifies cyclical trends, with, for example, the popularity of the women's novel, ebbing and flowing, as has the historical romance.  And in nonfiction Korda identifies the nearly constant popularity of self-help books, especially diet books and cook books.  He chronicles the liberalization of sexuality from a Victorian prudishness in the early part of the century to an easing in the forties signaled by the \\"bodice ripper\\" Forever Amber (1944) by Kathleen Winsor to Peyton Place (1956) by Grace Metalious to Nabokov's Lolita (1958) to D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover (1959) to Henry Miller and beyond.<br /><br />Korda also traces the changes in the business practices, beginning in the Depression when publishers first allowed book stores to return unsold copies, a practice thought to be temporary that became institutionalized.  Later came the book clubs and the chain stores and the mass marketing and the death of the small book shop, and finally the Internet (which Korda mentions briefly in the Epilogue).  Along the way there was an evolution away from the care and cultivation of promising authors to blockbuster promotion and the care and feeding of bestselling authors who could put a new one up every year, until by the eighties most of the fiction bestsellers were by authors who had been there before.  On the nonfiction list the trend was to books by celebrity authors, retired US presidents, show biz people, the Duchess of York, mavens of industry (e.g., Lee Iacocca and Bill Gates), generals (Yeager and Schwarzkopf) even the Pope and the Dali Lama.<br /><br />But it would be a mistake, at least from my point of view, to put too much stock in the bestseller list as a mirror to the American psyche.  As Korda points out on page 77, the list doesn't include tabulations of mass-market books, which in the beginning were not even sold in bookstores, but in liquor stores and drugstores.  Perhaps these titles would have revealed our hopes, dreams and fears better than the titles on the hard cover lists.  Also increasingly the list became a self-creation of the big publishers who put their money into promoting books that they believed warranted the outlay, an increasingly narrow list of popular, mass-market novels and sure-fire self help books and celebrity tell-alls.  By the late sixties, it is my belief that the real psyche of America as reflected in its book-buying habits could only be discerned by looking further down the list.  By the eighties the bestseller lists reflected the mentality of the big corporate publishing houses and their merchandising schemes while the entire universe of production from the academic presses, and the middle and the small houses is not represented at all.<br /><br />I would like to note too that the best writing being done today is by writers who do not appear on the best seller list.  One might say, wasn't it ever thus? but in truth there was a time before the blockbuster complex that works of literature regularly made the list.  One only has to recall Thomas Wolfe, Sinclair Lewis, Aldous Huxley, and even Virginia Woolf from the thirties, and John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, William Saroyan, and John O'Hara from the forties to realize that something has changed.  What we have now on the bestseller fiction list, at any rate, are almost exclusively entertainments for the mass mind and not an Edith Wharton (#4 in 1921 with The Age of Innocence) nor a Thornton Wilder (#1 in 1928 with The Bridge of San Luis Rey) in sight.<br /><br />Regardless, for anyone interested in bestseller phenomena, Korda's book will make for an absorbing and informative read.their merchandising schemes while the entire universe of production from the academic presses, and the middle and the small houses is not represented at all.

1677093:US	49786731	R1JF3UVCVDNV5P	0716734966	990811486	Future Evolution	Books	4	19	21	N	N	Striking images and a sprightly text	This is almost as much of an art book as it is a book on evolution.  The images, photos of about 30 paintings by Alexis Rockman, mostly oil and acrylic on wood or watercolor and ink on paper, are stunning depictions of creatures, past, present and to come: an arsinotherium (a rhino-like animal), a thylacine (a doglike marsupial, extinct in 1936), huge dandelions with thick roots several feet long, rabbits and rats on hind legs like kangaroo, crows like vultures, snakes with wings, etc.  The text by geologist Peter Ward is sprightly, informed, very readable, and at times even moving, as when Ward recalls his return to New Caledonia after twenty-five years.<br />Ward's vision, however, is not pretty.  He is not looking at planet earth after humans have gone extinct as some other books on future evolution have done.  He sees us as surviving for another 500 million years so that the fauna and flora that do evolve will do so with humans as probably the most significant part of their environment.  Consequently there will not be any large mammals, and the most numerous creatures will be small and \\"weedy.\\"  They will be mostly nocturnal animals that have learned to tolerate humans, rats and insects and \\"escapes\\" from our farms and genetic engineering labs.<br />Ward is very good at producing striking word portraits.  One is the \\"brown mountain\\" he observed flying into Mexico City (the polluted air rising above the city), and another is his fanciful creatures of the future, the \\"Zeppeliniods,\\" who have learned how to create hydrogen-filled air sacks so they can float in the air.  In a particularly dystopian vision on pages 135-137, Ward's time traveler visits a garbage dump 10-million years in the future crawling with \\"cockroach-sized insects...[and] mammals, a few as large as cats but most rat-, mouse-, or even shrew-sized.\\"  These creatures have evolved adaptations for exploiting the garbage dump: \\"some with long tapered heads, others with thin ribbonlike tongues, others with blunt heads and large knoblike teeth, still other with huge batlike eyes.\\"  A pig-like creature with rats \\"like hairy lampreys with greedy sucking mouths\\" hanging from its sides appears.  Overhead large crows \\"with brilliant plumage\\" dive bomb the traveler with knifelike barbs on their feet, driving him bleeding toward a tree where a hungry flock of these clever and hungry crows await. Ward also sees a great increase in the number of snakes, some with unusual adaptations to feed on the garbage eaters.<br />This \\"dyspeptic\\" vision, like some of the other visions in the book, is calculated to shock and revolt the reader, but just how likely is it to come to pass?  On the one hand it would seem, not very, since we are already recycling away from garbage dumps in many places in the world.  On the other hand, if we consider that we, as domesticated creatures ourselves, may be getting dumber, this scenario might seem more likely.  (See page 105 where Ward references neurologist Terry Deacon as noting that \\"all domesticated animals appear to have undergone a loss of intelligence compared with their wild ancestors.\\")  My feeling, however is, that should we by some wild happenstance still be around ten million years from now (average life span of a mammalian species is about two million years) I would expect us to have used our technology to better effect.  More likely of course (and Ward addresses this possibility, but dismisses it) is that we will be replaced by the products of our technology long before then.  Whether \\"they\\" will think it worthwhile to continue \\"living\\" is a very interesting question.<br />Clearly this is a popular book, almost a \\"coffee table\\" book, aimed at a popular readership, but that doesn't mean it's simplistic or dumbed down.  True, Ward is biased toward a long-lived humanity which he thinks is likely the only intelligent creature in the cosmos (see Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe (2000), which he wrote with Donald Brownlee), but Rockman's paintings really are first rate, and although the speculations are no more than that, they are interesting in themselves.  Additionally there is a wealth of information in the text about evolution.  Ward points out for example that it is not likely that we are going to undergo much Darwinian-type evolution in the future unless some humans become isolated.  This can happen, he speculates, if an elite population isolates itself reproductively from the masses, or if we establish far-flung colonies in space.  Another nice tidbit is Ward's observation that the average human I.Q. is not going to change much because whatever is measured on I.Q. tests is subject to the actions of numerous genes and any short term anomalies will be flooded by the mass of genetic humanity.<br />This book is a bit pricey because it is printed on expensive, glossy paper for the reproduction of the paintings.

I have little doubt that they used the plates from that hardcover edition, so the text is identical.  The edition of 1970 currently available is the same as the one I have except for a new cover.  The original was in French, published in Paris in 1954.  This edition is professionally translated by William R. Trask.<br /><br />Eliade was a nearly legendary scholar of indefatigable energy, and so it is not surprising that this is the definitive single volume academic work on yoga in English (that I am aware of).  George Feuerstein's coffee table sized The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice (1998) is a different sort of book, covering yoga from a more practical point of view, and is accessible to a general public.  Eliade's book is aimed directly and just about exclusively at academicians.  Furthermore, while Feuerstein is a practitioner as well as a scholar, Eliade makes no pretense of first hand experience.  As he relates in the Forward, he is interested in the discovery and interpretation of yoga by the West.  He wants to explain that in detail.  His is a \\"comparatively full exposition of the theory and practices of yoga...[a] history of its forms, and...its place in Indian spirituality...\\" (p. xx)  The qualifying \\"comparatively\\" is a bit of modesty on the part of Eliade.  This book really is a \\"full exposition\\" (insofar as that is possible) including the ideas, symbolism and methods of yoga \\"as they are expressed in tantrism, in alchemy, in folklore, in the aboriginal devotion of India.\\" (p. xxii)<br /><br />The text, which includes lengthy chapters such as, \\"Yoga and Brahmanism,\\" \\"Yoga Techniques in Buddhism,\\" \\"Yoga and Tantrism,\\" \\"Yoga and Alchemy,\\" etc. runs for 362 dense pages.  Sixty-six pages of notes follow, and then a most extensive and valuable bibliography.  The Index itself is 47 pages long and concludes with a by-line(!), \\"Index by Bart Winer,\\" which is only right considering the text was written and set before the age of computers.<br /><br />This is not a book for practitioners of yoga but a book for students and scholars of the literature of yoga.

1686504:US	49786731	R13IA9X3JI1FPC	0151005206	684702663	The Monkey in the Mirror: Essays on the Science of What Makes Us Human	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Lively, interesting, but not entirely objective	There are eight essays.  The first one, \\"What's So Special about Science?\\" explains to the general reader what science is and what it isn't.  One of the points Tattersall makes is that \\"scientists are emphatically &lt;not&gt;...steadily building up a picture of &lt;the truth&gt;.\\" (p. 8)  Instead, \\"the solution of one scientific problem regularly leads to the identification of others...,\\" so that the \\"successful climbing of an intellectual summit has always revealed new peaks beckoning beyond.\\" (p. 7)  Tattersall adds on page 30 that \\"science is a system of provisional knowledge\\" that \\"does not seek to understand ultimate causation...\\"<br />In the second essay, \\"Evolution: Why So Misunderstood?\\" Tattersall argues that many people think that science is an \\"authoritarian\\" system that \\"produces axioms that are unchanging for the ages.\\"  Consequently science runs afoul of other authoritarian (read: religious) systems that feel threatened from without.  I think this is a good argument, but I think it is also the case that evolution is so incredibly complex that it is not easy to understand or appreciate.  Tattersall writes on page 29 that \\"The notion of evolution is, after all, a pretty simple one...\\"  Yes, the notion is relatively simple, so simple that Thomas Henry Huxley exclaimed, \\"How very stupid of me not to have thought of that!\\"; but after the notion comes an amazing, really stupefying mass of complexities.  In truth very few people really understand even the basics of evolution beyond the initial idea.  And within the ranks of the experts there are endless arguments.<br />The next two essays, \\"The Monkey in the Mirror\\"and \\"Human Evolution and the Art of Climbing Trees\\" reminds us that monkeys cannot recognize their reflections in the mirror, but that we and the chimpanzees can.  Here Tattersall gives us his view on consciousness and its evolution based primarily on evidence from the fossil record.  Tattersall's position is highly tentative and emphasizes how little we really know.<br />In the next chapter, \\"The Enigmatic Neanderthals\\" Tattersall sums up what we know about the Neanderthals and what happened to them.  I was interested to notice that his ideas are not far removed from those presented fictionally many years ago by William Golding in his novel The Inheritors, namely that we somehow, probably by violent force, brought the big and strong Neanderthal to extinction.  Golding (and the evolutionists of his day) emphasized the murderously deceptive mentally agile of homo sapiens as the decisive factor while Tattersall believes the jury is still out on exactly why they disappeared.<br />The final three essays attempt to account for our \\"humanity\\" and where we might go from here.  Tattersall makes the very important point that speciation can only occur in isolated populations; consequently our population being both six billion strong and in full interaction, there is little prospect, barring catastrophe, for our further evolution.  He writes, \\"the trend is exactly the opposite to what is required for any meaningful evolutionary change...\\" (p. 190)  Of course there IS cultural evolution to consider, a subject that Tattersall understandably does not address in a collection of essays on biological evolution.  For some ideas about what may become of us through cultural evolution see, Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution (2001) or Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence (1999).<br />I have a couple of bones to pick (if you will) with Tattersall.  First there is the little matter of attributing to Shakespeare the famous phrase \\"nasty, brutish and short\\" (p. 170)  in describing human life in the wild.  As most political and social science majors know, the phrase is from the Leviathan (1651) by Thomas Hobbes.  Also, even appreciating that Tattersall is taking a causal tone here and forsaking the sort of scientific rigor and fairness shown in more academictomes, there is no excuse for this from page 50, \\"\\"Much of the discussion of &lt;adaptations&gt; doesn't even have...[some minimal basis in empirical fact], as we will discover when we look at the arrogant pseudo-science of &lt;evolutionary psychology&gt; in a later essay.\\"<br />Tattersall does take a quick look at evolutionary psychology in a later essay, but in no way does he support his dismissive charge or even indicate just who or what it is that is \\"arrogant.\\"  It is especially distressing to note that Tattersall throughout this book again and again prefaces his suppositions with words like \\"It seems reasonable to conclude...\\" or something similar (see for example, pages 96 and 98) yet he denigrates evolutionary psychology for no greater crime than drawing reasonable conclusions.  He writes that his argument with evolutionary psychology is in its undue reliance of genetics (beginning on page 170), but actually the power of evolutionary psychology comes not from assigning behaviors to genes, but from drawing insights into our behavior from the process of evolution and from the behavior of other animals.  From that evidence, it is reasonable to conclude any number of things, and they are worth noting, even if there is no way they can be proven, anymore than a host of Tattersall's conclusions about human evolution can be proven.<br />Furthermore he accuses (again unnamed) evolutionary psychologists of \\"defending rape as an &lt;adaptive&gt; behavior...\\" (p. 178).  I personally know of no evolutionary psychologist who would do such a thing.  Why doesn't Tattersall name one?  What evolutionary psychology is saying is not that rape can be defended.  It can't.  But that there are evolutionary reasons for its existence.  This is quite a different statement.  There are evolutionary reasons for murder, etc., but in recognizing them, that does not mean we are \\"defending\\" them or are in any way in agreement with them anymore than Tattersall is in agreement with what we presumably did to the Neanderthal.tomes, there is no excuse for this from page 50, \\"\\"Much of the discussion of &lt;adaptations&gt; doesn't even have...[some minimal basis in empirical fact], as we will discover when we look at the arrogant pseudo-science of &lt;evolutionary psychology&gt; in a later essay.\\"<br />Tattersall does take a quick look at evolutionary psychology in a later essay, but in no way does he support his dismissive charge or even indicate just who or what it is that is \\"arrogant.\\"  It is especially distressing to note that Tattersall throughout this book again and again prefaces his suppositions with words like \\"It seems reasonable to conclude...\\" or something similar (see for example, pages 96 and 98) yet he denigrates evolutionary psychology for no greater crime than drawing reasonable conclusions.

In particular Philip Ball, who is a science journalist and formerly an editor of Nature, one of the most prestigious science journals in the world, wants to show \\"the molecular processes that govern our own bodies are not so different from those that chemists--I would prefer to say molecular scientists--are seeking to create.\\"  His further intent in this modest little book is to counter the \\"negative connotations of &lt;chemical&gt; and &lt;synthetic&gt;\\" in the public mind and to help us \\"appreciate what chemistry has to offer.\\"  Ball observes that \\"molecules\\" do not yet have negative connotations, and he wants to keep it that way. (pp. vi-vii)<br />Ball demonstrates just how really complex the molecular world is, and how the technology is becoming further removed from our everyday world, while the effect on our world grows enormously.  The text does not consist of \\"stories\\" as such, but rather a broad survey of molecular science, including what's happening in exciting new fields such as molecular electronics, and how new uses for molecular knowledge is transforming older fields such as paleontology, computer science, information theory, forensics, etc.  Ball provides some material on cellular construction and metabolism, augmented with drawings from his own hand.  He gives us a feel for the invisible, tactile reality of molecular interactions, in which surface structure is paramount.  He ends the book with a brief look at the prospects for molecular and DNA computers.<br />There is unfortunately a kind of veil-like quality thrown between the molecular world and the reader's perception of that world by the very fact of its invisibility that I don't think Ball's text overcomes.  It is curious, but it is not a question of readability so much as a question of how to present these very complex structures and ideas in a way that the reader can absorb in some concrete fashion.  Ball begins with some dialogue from a fiction set in a Dublin pub about \\"mollycules\\"; however this does not help.  Indeed I could not see the point of the exchange.  At any rate Ball abandons it after the first few pages.<br />The exposition following that, about what molecules are and how they differ technically from atoms, was one of the strengths of the book.  However much of the rest of the book is like a first year survey course of various topics in molecular science, a very diverse subject, but without any insistence on the mastery of fundamentals.  This is good, I suppose, and Ball's intent, but since I know little about chemistry, I was left not really appreciating a lot of the text.  I express this as more a failing on my part than a criticism of Ball's efforts, and to warn the reader that some serious interactive and imaginative work will be required!  Ball does indeed go to great lengths to make the visible real, not only with his drawings, but with \\"photos\\" from the \\"scanning tunnelling microscope\\" while using other \\"representations\\" to make the technically invisible, \\"visible.\\"<br />One thing that I felt very strongly in reading this book was the sense of frustration that molecular engineers and others in the world of nano technology must feel when dealing with objects so very, very small.  I had the sense that somebody was crying out, \\"My world for a pair of molecular tweezers!\\"  I suspect when they get those tweezers, our world is going to change enormously.e reader can absorb in some concrete fashion.

It is a little volume to treasure, to reread and to ponder, to take delight in and to laugh at and laugh with.  It is a compilation of four smaller books:<br /><br />First there are 101 Zen stories.  These are the best and most classic of the stories, many of them so familiar that they are now part of American culture as well as Zen culture.  The stories constitute lessons in life, insights into our nature and ways to enlightenment or how one has wandered off the path--or better yet, how there is no path and no wandering.  Unlike many Zen tales, which can be deeply mystifying to non-initiates, most of the ones presented here are luminous.<br /><br />Paul Reps and Nyogen Senzaki, who are the transcribers, begin with the famous tale of Zen master Nan-in overflowing a visiting professor's tea cup to illustrate how filled the professor is with himself, so filled he cannot learn anything new.  Included are two of my favorites, (1) that of Tanzan and Ekido, the former a monk who carried a pretty girl across a muddy road and his monastic friend who could not let go of her in his mind; and (2) the parable attributed to the Buddha about a man hanging over a cliff holding onto a vine being gnawed on by two mice (one black and one white--yin and yang, perhaps), with a tiger above and another below, and a luscious strawberry.  How sweet it tasted indeed!  By the way I have recently learned that a variant of this story comes from the Mahabharata as reported by Georg Feuerstein in The Essence of Yoga (1974).  There the mice are rats (still black and white) and the man is hanging from a tree over a pit in which waits a giant serpent.  He is drinking honey.<br /><br />Next there is a presentation of the Buddhist classic about koans, their answers, and a commentary called  \\"The Gateless Gate\\" by the Chinese master Ekai (also known as Mu-mon,1183-1260 c.e.).  The spirit of The Gateless Gate\\" is irreverent and mischievous.  The central idea is that the truth lies somewhere beyond the thesis and the antithesis--or, that which can be said and that which cannot be said do not include the whole of it.  Most of Mu-mon's comments are deliberately non-rational, but here is one in the form of a poem that expresses the essence of Zen in a nutshell:<br /><br />It is too clear and so it is hard to see.<br />A dunce once searched for a fire with a lighted lantern.<br />Had he known what fire was,<br />He could have cooked his rice much sooner.<br /><br />The third book is the famous search for the bull from Taoism which ends in no bull, no search-all transcended, which is an allegory of life and a symbolic representation of learning to meditate.  Zen has added here two extra frames which I will not comment on.<br /><br />The fourth book is something Reps calls \\"Centering\\" from an ancient Sanskrit manuscript.  It is said to be four thousand years old and purports to be Shiva guiding Devi in enlightenment.  There are 112 ways.  Its yoga-becoming-Zen feel is really startling.  Here are three examples:<br /><br />8. Attention between eyebrows, let mind be before thought.  Let form fill with breath-essence to the top of the head, and there &lt;shower as light>.<br /><br />15. Intone a sound, as a-u-m, slowly.  As sound enters soundfulness, &lt;so do you>.<br /><br />26. Unminding mind, keep in the middle--&lt;until>.<br /><br />The book title comes from a story about the first Zen patriarch, Bodhidharma, who rewarded a couple of his disciples for their apperception by saying the one has his flesh and the other had his bones.  A third monk won the \\"contest\\" by remaining silent.  About him, Bodhidharma said, \\"you have my marrow.\\"<br /><br />All four books are wonderful, and there is not a speck of dust on any page.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"e central idea is that the truth lies somewhere beyond the thesis and the antithesis--or, that which can be said and that which cannot be said do not include the whole of it.

1696115:US	49786731	R1YYCUQ6SRDVDL	0691089264	835564493	Our Cosmic Habitat	Books	5	41	43	N	N	Beautiful book on cosmology from a wise astronomer	Martin Rees, who is the Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, returns here to the speculative cosmological mode that he so successfully employed in Before the Beginning: Our Universe and Others (1997) and brings us up to date on his latest thinking.  He sets the tone by featuring a quotation from acclaimed science fiction writer Olaf Stapledon's novel Star Maker (1937) to the effect that all that we are and have been is \\"but a flicker in one day of the lives of the stars.\\"  The title Our Cosmic Habitat reinforces the long and distant view that Rees wants to assume, seeing the universe as enormously large and long-lived.  The book was composed from the Scribner Lectures that Rees gave at Princeton University.<br /><br />The ground covered reflects a growing trend in cosmology, that of thinking aloud and in public about matters that have little or no chance of being scientifically tested now or perhaps ever.  In particular Rees speculates on the possibility and nature of other universes beyond our own.  Indeed, he refers to a \\"multiverse\\" with the implication that the universe we experience is just one of a possibly infinite number of other universes, distant from us spatially, temporally and even dimensionally.  In other words he seems to be talking about things we can never have any information about!<br /><br />To the old physicists this must seem a sacrilege, but then Rees himself is no spring chicken!  I find it refreshing that a man of his stature and reputation can so freely speculate on matters that are of such complexity and distance, as he notes on page 156, that they \\"may never be explained or understood.\\"  But what I think Rees is getting at, and why he feels justified as a scientist in making these speculative ventures, is that although these other possible universes are completely removed from ours in terms of any possible perception, they may in fact affect our universe in some way that may eventually be measured or otherwise discerned.  For example (this is my speculation) suppose we finally did get an indisputable, proven theory of everything, somehow wedding gravity and quantum mechanics, and found that our universe was in some way--again indisputably--different from what that theory predicted.  Such a difference would have to come from something outside, perhaps as the signature of an effect from another universe.<br /><br />As one would expect from a senior scientist, Rees gives us some political guidance in scientific matters.  On page 31 he expresses his view that a justification for going into space is to free the human race from the possibility of extinction from a \\"catastrophe that we bring on ourselves,\\" through \\"experimental misadventure or a terrorist act that deploys techniques from bioscience.\\"  Incidentally Rees estimates that the chance in a lifetime of anyone alive today of encountering an Earth-crossing asteroid at less than 1 in 10,000, which he describes as \\"no lower than the risk...of being killed in an air crash.\\"  Consequently, he finds it \\"fully worthwhile to devote modest efforts to survey the sky for potentially dangerous...asteroids.\\" (pp. 30-31)<br /><br />Rees's treatment of string theory, now called M-theory, with its ten or eleven dimensions, is cautious.  In chapter ten after remarking on the non-surprising cancellation of the Superconducting Super-Collider project, he obliquely advises young physicists to think twice before devoting their lives to string theory.  \\"He writes, \\"...an undue focus of talent in one highly theoretical area is likely to be frustrating for all but a few exceptionally talented (or lucky) individuals.\\"  He reminds us of Peter Medawar's \\"wise remark that &lt;no scientist is admired for failing to solve a problem beyond his competence>.\\" (pp. 155-156)<br /><br />As in his book mentioned above, Rees confronts what he calls the \\"puzzlingly biophilic\\" (p. 45) nature of our universe and again addresses the anthropic principle.  See especially Chapter 11 where he uses a metaphor from philosopher John Leslie to account for our justified surprise or lack thereof at living in our \\"interesting\\" universe rather than one with laws that \\"had boring consequences.\\"  Leslie has us before a firing squad with fifty marksmen who all miss.  Rees writes, \\"If they had not all missed, you would not have survived to ponder the matter.\\"  As it is, \\"you would seek some further reason for your luck.\\"  The analogy here is with our luck in having a universe with \\"interesting consequences\\" that \\"allowed us to exist.\\" (pp. 162-163)  But I think the comparison breaks down because we had in the case of the firing squad a fine expectation of being hit, whereas no such expectation of a \\"boring\\" universe is necessarily justified.  The anthropic principle is in full force here, it seems to me: we only exist in \\"interesting\\" universes.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a compelling book, written by a man who can speculate but speculate reasonably so that we are intrigued and interested rather than set awash in a sea of fanciful maybes.  Rees writes with charm and a most reserved sense of humor.  (Example: on page 151 he speculates on whether a universe could have more than one time dimension, wryly observing that to describe such a universe we would need \\"a language with more tenses.\\")  He always qualifies his statements to the nth degree and, reflecting the wisdom of his years and experience, is never out on a limb by saying that anything possible is \\"impossible,\\" as senior scientists have carelessly done in the past.<br /><br />By the way, this is a beautifully designed book, with a splendid jacket designed by Tracy Baldwin.  The black and white artwork illustrating the text by Richard Sword is something close to exquisite.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\"metaphor from philosopher John Leslie to account for our justified surprise or lack thereof at living in our \\"interesting\\" universe rather than one with laws that \\"had boring consequences.\\"  Leslie has us before a firing squad with fifty marksmen who all miss.

1707881:US	49786731	R304U6HIVZB1WI	060960810X	466687802	Ubiquity: The Science of History . . . or Why the World Is Simpler Than We Think	Books	3	25	35	N	N	The real ubiquity is complexity itself	Let's begin with a counter-thesis, namely that the \\"ubiquity\\" found in simplistic computer models (\\"games\\") which are then related to real world systems such as earthquakes, sandpiles, the stock market, political and social history, etc., may be an artificiality and a whole lot less significant than Buchanan supposes.<br />The fact that the games are, as Buchanan reports, tinkered with so that they yield a \\"power law\\" similar to that found in natural phenomena reveals the artificiality.  What this \\"power law\\" really amounts to is something like \\"the frequency of a big change is at least two times and maybe four times (or more) less than the frequency of a small change.\\"  The \\"power\\" in the \\"power law\\" is nothing more than an exponent, as in something-squared, or something-cubed, etc.  It's simply a power of a number as a measure of difference.  Now, if the differences fell exactly on two times or four times, etc., then perhaps there would be some great significance.  But when something is 2.14 times less likely (as it is when the avalanche is doubled in the sandpile game [p. 45, p. 57]) or 1.19 times less likely (as it is for magnets pointing in the same direction in the Onsager and Kaufman experiment [p. 129]) then calling the differences an example of a \\"power law\\" at work seems a bit forced and, at any rate, trivial.<br />Incidentally, the word \\"history\\" as used in this book refers to a past that is different than now in a way that cannot be exhaustively unraveled.  This idea comes from complexity theory and owes something to information theory.  Buchanan attempts to apply it to a wide variety of phenomenon with varying degrees of success.<br />But what is really being asserted here is the mundane fact that a big change is less likely than a small change in a complex system near the edge of chaos.  Such systems: forests, the geological earth, the stock market, the international political arena, etc., are seen as having \\"self-organized criticality,\\" and it is this sort of complexity that they have in common, and this is what is significant, not some artificially derived \\"power law.\\"<br />Another key idea in the book is that the immediate \\"cause\\" of a big event in such systems is no different (or so it seems to our discernment) than the cause of a small event.  This is an idea from complexity theory, and an exciting one.  What it means is that such systems are in principle impossible to predict.  In the sandpile game, for example, we don't know when we drop the latest grain whether it will trigger a big avalanche or a small one or none at all.  This is similar to the \\"butterfly effect\\" in complexity theory in which it is thought possible that the flap of a butterfly's wings in the Sahara Desert, for example, may affect the amount of rain that falls on Cuba.<br />Where I think Buchanan goes astray here is in making unwarranted connections between systems by using superficial and forced similarities.  For example, one of the ideas from the study of earthquakes is that there is no typical size for an earthquake.  In his desire to generalize Buchanan tries to find the same sort of phenomena in the interesting study Sidney Redner did on the fate of scientific research papers.  Buchanan writes on page 200 that there was \\"no typical number of citations for a paper, and, by extension, no typical magnitude for the reshaping in the network of ideas that any paper ultimately entails.\\"  However on the previous page Buchanan has already reported that there was indeed \\"a typical size.\\"  That size was zero.  Of the 783,339 papers published, 368,110 had no citations at all.<br />Buchanan also asserts on page 169 \\"...there is no &lt;typical&gt; size for a city in the United States or elsewhere, and no reason to see special historical or geographical situations behind the emergence of the very biggest.\\"  I agree there is no typical size for a city, but to ignore the effect of rivers, lakes and protected harbors as well as other factors such asnearby mineral and other resources in the growth of cities is silly.  Chicago, for example, is a big city not by happenstance but because of its location on a great lake and because of its proximity to the middle of a great, growing country.  Similar arguments can be made about other great cities in the US and around the world.  The historical and geographical circumstances are special and they really are crucial.<br />Buchanan further extends the thesis to include social and political revolutions.  This makes for lively reading and there is no doubt that there are similarities between the critical state of a nation before a revolution and that of a sandpile before an avalanche or a forest before a fire, but the stresses are of an entirely different sort.  He sees the readjustments of governments as a way to prevent the maladjustments that lead to revolutions as similar to the small forest fires that forest managers start to prevent a large forest fire as similar. (p. 209)  Whether these similarities are more than conceptional analogies is another matter.  Buchanan himself notes, still on page 209, \\"None of this is meant to be fully convincing.\\"  And on page 230, when seeing similarities between the \\"behaviors of the mass of humanity\\" and the \\"wild fluctuations of the magnet poised between its...phases,\\" Buchanan adds, \\"It goes without saying that nothing I have mentioned in the past few chapters proves this.  The &lt;take home&gt; message is simply that this is a real possibility.\\"  I agree, and I think these statements really could apply to the entire book.<br />In conclusion, I disagree with the notion that the world is simpler than we think.  I believe the opposite is manifestly true, and I found nothing in Buchanan's very interesting arguments to prove otherwise.s nearby mineral and other resources in the growth of cities is silly.

1713304:US	49786731	RGPHXKFPK17RF	0446676810	736569702	The 100 Best Poems of All Time	Books	4	29	32	N	N	Handy little collection	What this little book might have been called in manuscript was something like \\"100 Representative Poems of 100 of the Most Popular Poets of All Time.\\"  Not a bad title, and it is consistent with editor Leslie Pockell's popular choices and her[?] intent to include no more than one poem by any poet.  But the unmitigated gall of the title actually chosen--The 100 Best Poems of All Time--makes for a little fun, and probably will increase the sales of the book.  As Pockell writes in the short Introduction, \\"Well, at least we attracted your attention.\\"<br />You did.  And for fun I am responding with some reaction to the selections.  But first I should mention Pockell's criteria for the selections.  The book needed to be short, a mix of \\"high art\\" and \\"popular culture\\" was desired, and the selections ought to be \\"inclined toward poetry that is best appreciated when recited or read aloud.\\"  Fair enough.  And for the most part I think Pockell did an admirable job.<br />The excellent choices include, the King James version of the Twenty-Third Psalm, Poe's \\"The Raven,\\" Shakespeare's \\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\\" (although it seems weird to select just one of his sonnets; I prefer \\"That time of year thou mayst in me behold\\" or \\"Let me not to the marriage of true minds\\"), Donne's \\"Go and Catch a Falling Star,\\" Shelley's \\"Ozymandias,\\" Keat's \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\" (although again, how to choose just one!) Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach,\\" Housman's \\"When I Was One-and-Twenty,\\" Frost's \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\\" (ditto the last two asides), Eliot's \\"...Prufrock,\\" etc.<br />Poor selections include, \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" (a stirring song, but a \\"best\\" poem?), Basho's \\"An Old Pond\\" (there are better English renditions than the one given, for example, \\"In the old stone pool/a frogjump:/splishhhh.\\"  Pockell gives, \\"Old pond-/A frog leaps in-/Water's sound.\\"; and Basho wrote many better haiku), \\"Casey at the Bat\\" (uh...never mind), and several others that I fear to name.  Also to choose out of all of Alexander Pope's work, his epigram about the dog at Kew, seems almost anti-poetic.<br />A howler is \\"Ancient Music\\" by Ezra Pound.  If Pockell wanted to show the less than charming side of Pound, perhaps Pound's \\"The Garden\\" which includes the line, \\"...the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor\\" might have been presented.  (Then again, perhaps not.)<br />A creative choice is e e cummings's \\"Buffalo Bill's,\\" which reflects not only cummings's love of typographical form, but his playful wit along with his famous word play and his often missed irony.  (The typographical form of the poem represents a tomahawk:  \\"[H]ow...[DO] you like your blueeyed boy[,] Mister Death\\"?)<br />Langston Hughes's \\"Harlem\\" (\\"What happens to a dream deferred?\\") is obviously a politically correct choice, and also a very good little poem, but I would have preferred his \\"Mother to Son\\" (\\"Well, son, I'll tell you:/Life for me ain't been no crystal stair...\\") or the breath-taking simplicity of  \\"Friend.\\"  Sylvia Plath's dark and brutal \\"Daddy\\" is also PC, but with its inclusion there is no need for Margaret Atwood, a fact for which we can be thankful.  The choice from Sappho, with its nice turn from \\"a god\\" that sits \\"beside you\\" to the poet herself, is of course de rigueur, but a good choice nonetheless.<br />Pleasant surprises include W. H. Auden's \\"Funeral Blues,\\" and Pablo Neruda's \\"Poetry.\\"  Some old favorites are Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach,\\" Wordsworth's \\"The World Is Too Much with Us,\\" and the powerful \\"Incident\\" from Countee Cullen.<br />It is good that Pockell includes some poetry translated from other languages; however that just makes the presumption of her title all the more absurd.  Just how would one presume to pick the best from such an incredible array?  However, the choices made really are very good although they reflect the artistry of the translator nearly as much as the original poet.  Middle Eastern people might object to the choice of a quatrain from \\"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\\" (\\"The Moving Finger writes...\\") translated by Edward FitzGerald, which is almost as much English as it is Persian, preferring a more ethnic rendition.<br />I can't quibble with the poets left out, although missing are John Crow Ransom, Archibald MacLeish, Theodore Roethke, Gwendolyn Brooks, Robert Lowell, Rita Dove, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and of course of necessity many others.  One of my favorite poems and poet not to appear is \\"Patterns\\" by Amy Lowell.<br />Pockell gives a terse, but felicitous introduction to each poem usually including a word about the poet.  But I have one question, who is Leslie Pockell?  There is not a biographical word anywhere in the book to give a hint.  And should I have used a masculine or a feminine pronoun?ght object to the choice of a quatrain from \\"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\\" (\\"The Moving Finger writes...\\") translated by Edward FitzGerald, which is almost as much English as it is Persian, preferring a more ethnic rendition.  <br />I can't quibble with the poets left out, although missing are John Crow Ransom, Archibald MacLeish, Theodore Roethke, Gwendolyn Brooks, Robert Lowell, Rita Dove, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and of course of necessity many others.

1727258:US	49786731	R239GEW90VU74K	0375705104	53440924	The Way of Zen	Books	5	140	152	N	Y	Worth a couple dozen other books on Zen Buddhism	This can be seen as a significant book in the transmission of the dharma to the Western world, even though, or perhaps especially because, it is written by a Westerner.  Consistently admired since its first publication in 1957, and reprinted many times, The Way of Zen is that rarest of books, a popular and academic success.  You will not read far before seeing why.  Watts's style is reasoned and reasonable, clear and authoritative, but without a hint of affectation.  Watts knows what he is talking about and to whom he is speaking.  Because of his perspective between two worlds, he is, more than almost any other writer on Zen, able to match the ideas of the East to the mind of the West, and in doing so make the broader outlines of Zen as clear as the polished, dustless mirror.<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts, \\"Background and History\\" and Principles and Practice,\\" each with four chapters.  There is a bibliography also divided into two parts, the first referring to original sources and second to general works on Zen in European languages.  There are 16 pages of Chinese Notes in calligraphy keyed to the text, and an Index.<br /><br />\\"The Way\\" in the title refers to the \\"watercourse way\\" from Taoism, a philosophy to which Zen owes much, as Watts makes clear in the first two chapters, \\"The Philosophy of the Tao\\" and \\"The Origins of Buddhism.\\"  The first chapter is one of the best on Taoism that I have ever read, replete with insight and wisdom.  Throughout, Watts expresses himself in an infectious style, even in the very scholarly chapters on the history of Buddhism where he traces Zen from its origin in India, through the Buddha under the Po tree, to Ch'an in China, and finally into Japan.  Parallels between the unforced, natural way of Taoism and the spontaneity of Zen Buddhism are explored in a most convincing and engaging manner.  Along the way we learn a little about Hinduism and Confucianism.<br /><br />The chapters on the principles and practices of Zen, comprising a goodly portion of the book are nothing short of marvelous, full of wit and sly observations, revealing Watts's thorough knowledge of Zen and his deep appreciation.  Here are some examples of Watts at work:<br /><br />Referring obliquely to the rise of communism (a word he never uses in the book) he writes, \\"When the throne of the Absolute is left vacant, the relative usurps it...\\" (p. 11)  Perhaps Watts is also indicating why he believes that humanism is not a complete answer.<br /><br />On the cosmology of the Tao: \\"...the natural universe works mainly according to the principles of growth...If the universe were made, there would of course be someone who knows &lt;how> it is made...\\"  He adds, \\"...the Tao does not &lt;know> how it produces the universe...\\" (pp. 16-17)<br /><br />\\"Since opposed principles, or ideologies, are irreconcilable, wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation.  But wars fought for simple greed will be far less destructive, because the aggressor will be careful not to destroy what he is fighting to capture.\\" (pp. 29-30)<br /><br />\\"Hindu philosophy has not made the mistake of imagining that one can make an informative, factual, and positive statement about the ultimate reality.\\" (p, 34)<br /><br />\\"Buddhism has frequently compared the course of time to the apparent motion of a wave, wherein the actual water only moves up and down, creating the illusion of a  of water moving over the surface.  It is a similar illusion that there is a constant &lt;self> moving through successive experiences, constituting a link between them in such a way that the youth becomes the man who becomes the graybeard who becomes the corpse.\\" (p. 123)<br /><br />In his exploration of koans used by the Rinzai School of Zen, it becomes clear that one of the purposes of the koan is to put doubt into the mind of the young aspirant that he knows anything at all.  From that redoubtable position, real learning can begin.  I was reminded ofa saying attributed to baseball's Earl Weaver, the very successful manager of the Baltimore Orioles in their glory years: \\"It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.\\"<br /><br />Here is a story from the Ch'uan Teng Lu, told by Watts about \\"a fascinating encounter between Tao-hsin and the sage Fa-yung, who lived in a lonely temple on Mount Niu-t'ou, and was so holy that the birds used to bring him offerings of flowers.  As the two men were talking, a wild animal roared close by, and Tao-hsin jumped.  Fa-yung commented, --referring, of course, to the instinctive  (klesa) of fright.  Shortly afterwards, while he was for a moment unobserved, Tao-hsin wrote the Chinese character for  on the rock where Fa-yung was accustomed to sit.  When Fa-yung returned to sit down again, he saw the sacred name and hesitated to sit.  said Tao-hsin,  At this remark Fa-yung was fully awakened...and the birds never brought any more flowers.\\" (pp. 89-90).<br /><br />While this is an excellent introduction to Zen--and more--for the educated person, it is especially a delight for those of you who have already read a few books on Zen.  There is no other book that I know of that goes as deeply into Zen as agreeably as does The Way of Zen.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"attributed to baseball's Earl Weaver, the very successful manager of the Baltimore Orioles in their glory years: \\"It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.\\"<br /><br />Here is a story from the Ch'uan Teng Lu, told by Watts about \\"a fascinating encounter between Tao-hsin and the sage Fa-yung, who lived in a lonely temple on Mount Niu-t'ou, and was so holy that the birds used to bring him offerings of flowers.

1729572:US	49786731	R2HYO46K82BALG	0679721037	150142267	Hiroshima	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A compelling reading experience still relevant	One of the most remarkable things about John Hersey's Hiroshima is when it was published, within a year after the bomb was dropped.  It is easy to admit our faults, it is easy to show our mistakes--if faults and mistakes they were--many years after the fact.  But to face the horrendous, factual reporting of the effect of the atom bomb on the citizens of Hiroshima so soon after the fact, is in itself remarkable, and a tribute to not only the New Yorker, which published Hersey's account, but to the strength and open mindedness of the American people in their willingness to assume responsibility for what we had done.<br />It is the opinion of many people, myself included, that World War II was America's finest hour because we faced an enemy in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan that had to be defeated, and we defeated them.  But it is also the opinion of many people that we did something so monstrous and so unnecessary by being the first (and still the only) people to use nuclear weapons against civilian populations, that it is hard to find justification, redemption or peace of mind.  Could Hiroshima have been avoided?<br />The second most remarkable thing about John Hersey's Hiroshima is the utter lack of editorializing, the complete absence of any sort of political statement, the sheer avoidance of the maudlin and any kind of deliberate jerking of tears in the text.  Hersey lets the reportage speak for itself.  The elegant flat tonal quality of his report serves all the better to let us see exactly the human consequences of Truman's monumental decision.  The terse, evocative quality of the titles of the four parts of the book, \\"A Noiseless Flash,\\" \\"The Fire,\\" \\"Details Are Being Investigated,\\" and \\"Panic Grass and Fever Few\\" tell in skeleton form the entire story, and suggest, ever so subtly, the appalling suffering and loss that the people of that Japanese city experienced.<br />Hersey began with the moment--\\"The Noiseless Flash\\"--when the bomb dropped, and ended with the naturalistic aftermath as he described how in \\"Panic Grass and Fever Few\\" the grasses grew back and green velvet covered much of the ground under the blast.  This follows the ironic bureaucratic response suggested  in \\"Details Are Being Investigated.\\"<br />Yes, let's investigate the details, for all the good that will do.  Let's also second guess Truman's decision, for all the good that will do.<br />Fifty-five years have now passed.  A long time.  And still there remains the question: did we do the right thing?<br />Social critic Paul Fussell wrote some years after Hersey's report an essay entitled, \\"Thank God for the Atom Bomb\\" in which he argued persuasively that the United States really had no choice, and indeed Truman's decision was the only one he could make.  The main point being that to take the island of Japan with conventional forces would have cost the US a million casualties.  It was strongly believed that the Japanese would fanatically defend their homeland, even with sticks and stones if necessary.  A secondary argument concerned the position of the Soviet Union.  During the time it would take to ensure surrender by conventional forces, the Soviet Union would probably become involved, and Japan might have become a divided country as is Korea today and as was Germany not too long ago.  In the final analysis, this argument goes, at least hundreds of thousands of lives were saved and the Japanese themselves benefitted from being the vanquished of the US alone, allowing us to help them to a speedy recovery.<br />There are other arguments about demonstrating the bomb on a coral island, and the counter argument that there were only two bombs, and that at any rate our resolve to use the bomb would not be proven by such a demonstration, etc.<br />I used to teach Hersey's Hiroshima to high school students, and I would include Fussell's easy as a counterpoint.  My feeling has always been that Truman did indeed do exactly what he had to do.  Whether that was the right thing to do is another matter.  Curious.  I don't think Truman could have acted otherwise, but I am not so sure it was the right thing to do.  Such is the nature of our ability to know and live the truth.<br />Hersey's insistence on focusing on the everyday people of Hiroshima--on Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk at the East Asia Tin Works, who had just turned her head to talk to another girl, on the Rev. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who was two miles from the center of the explosion, delivering a cart of clothes to a home in the suburbs, and on four others--allowed him to universalize the Japanese experience so that everyone in the world might know that these people could be anybody.<br />Perhaps this is the saving grace, that we know beyond any shadow of a doubt the incalculable  human suffering that ensues from the use of nuclear weapons, and so perhaps we will never use them again, us or anyone else.<br />If they had never been used, perhaps the temptation would have been too great, for us, for the Soviet Union, or some other nation, to use them in the hope of gaining some advantage.  But seeing the unmitigated horror of their use, we are all forestalled.<br />I say \\"all.\\"  But would Osama Bin Laden, would Saddam Hussein, use such weapons?<br />Hersey's Hiroshima is therefore not just an artifact of history, but a warning still relevant today as well as a most compelling reading experience.he right thing to do is another matter.

1740658:US	49786731	R3UX3D4SC6PZVI	0394758285	849452523	The Big Sleep (A Philip Marlowe Novel)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Pulp fiction at the apex	This was Chandler's first novel, written when he was 51-years-old, although he had published a number of hard-boiled pulp fiction stories in the six years previous.  The title refers to his hero, Philip Marlowe's idea of death.  Not very original, but apt enough.<br />I read this to compare it to the famous Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall film directed by Howard Hawks released in 1946.  The structure of the book and the movie are very similar, but there's a subtle difference in the characterizations that gives the movie and the novel an entirely different feel.<br />The movie is a romantic mystery with something like a happy ending.  The novel is an existential slice of one man's life as a worldly wise straight-shooter in a corrupted world of thieves, murders, predatory females, and assorted grifters.  In the movie the part of Vivian Regan, General Sternwood's older daughter, is prettied up and expanded for Lauren Bacall so that she and Bogey can work on the romantic chemistry.  In the book romance takes a third tier seat to manliness, cynicism, and loyalty to the client.  Indeed, Marlowe prefers Mona Mars, whom he calls \\"Silver-Wig,\\" to Vivian.  But what he prefers even more than any of the women who are constantly throwing themselves at him is hard liquor and nicotine.  He drinks morning, noon and night, always hard stuff, whiskey, rye, brandy.  He spends a lot of time lighting and smoking tobacco and describing others doing the same.  He even smokes a pipe, as did Chandler himself.  With prohibition just a bad memory, and lung cancer something ugly that happened to coal miners and old people, the mass American mind thought it sexy and oh so sophisticated to toss back a few and indulge in the ritual of the cigarette, a ritual for tough guys that included striking the stick match with a thumbnail, dangling the cigarette out of one side of the mouth while talking out of the other, or pausing to eye the babe before flipping open the Zippo.  Such an innocent world it was then.<br />Chandler wrote the novel in a white heat from chapter one to #30 at the end of the text on the last page in about three months.  He had intended to make a few bucks, this being just a longer short story, but a funny thing happened.  His unconscious took over and Chandler ended up projecting not only a hauntingly atmospheric Los Angeles during the thirties and a reflection of the entire culture, but a nearly heroic notion about right and wrong personified in his alter ego, the shamus Philip Marlowe.  Note above all that Marlowe is a highly moral person who doesn't take advantage of women, refuses money that doesn't belong to him, and is something close to fearless in the face of personal danger.  In a short Introduction to the Modern Library Edition of this book, it is noted that when Chandler himself fell on hard times in 1912, he borrowed money from an uncle and made a badge of paying it back, \\"Every penny...with six percent interest.\\"  Chandler never imagined at the time that he was writing \\"literature.\\"  Indeed he would have scoffed at such a notion and pretended not to know what it is, just as Marlowe pretends not to have heard of Proust.<br />So perhaps the secret of Marlowe's appeal is that Marlowe is the man Chandler would be on his best days, an essentially honest man, a very worldly man, a courageous straight-shooter, loved by women and admired by men, a man who is true to himself and his code.  The average reader and moviegoer could easily identify with such a man, and his character became a formula for success in the private eye genre for another four or five decades.  One reviewer insightfully recalled the Harrison Ford character from Blade Runner (1982).  I am thinking of James Garner's \\"Jim Rockford\\" in the long running--it's still running, actually, in between infomercials on channels with numbers in the fifties--\\"The Rockford Files,\\" whose character bears more than a token resemblance to Chandler's creation.<br />Besides this creation of an existential hero, the other striking feature of Chandler's novel is the sharply observed first person narrative spun out by Marlowe, and his quick, hard-boiled wit.  He was not only brave, but had an eagle's eye for detail and more street smarts than an alley cat, and a nasty habit of speaking his mind in a way that penetrated.  He describes the characters with precision, right down to their tie pins, and the scenery with enough verisimilitude to spring it to life. ...  His running analysis of the motives of others and his observations about himself are immediate and to the point.<br />There are of course contrivances.  Marlowe does indeed seem to observe more than his fair share of action, and he seems to be where he should be nearly all the time.  The scene (not in the movie) at the oil sump with Carmen near the end could never have been anticipated, not even by Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chan working in tandem, and yet Marlowe did anticipate it, and was able to recreate an unlikely sequence of events to unravel the last mystery.<br />The Big Sleep is pulp fiction at the apex, a novel squarely between a fancy Bel Air hotel and a skid row flophouse, eagerly read by the clientele of both establishments.f an existential hero, the other striking feature of Chandler's novel is the sharply observed first person narrative spun out by Marlowe, and his quick, hard-boiled wit.

1745484:US	49786731	R21HFBBEHPBHJQ	0471377430	771087746	The Secret Life of Dust: From the Cosmos to the Kitchen Counter, the Big Consequences of Little Things	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Full of fascinating and little known information	\\"Everything counts in large amounts.\\"  -Depeche Mode<br /><br />Science writer Hannah Holmes uses the Biblical \\"dust to dust\\" adage as a thread weaving through her eleven easy to read chapters, beginning with a sort of overview in Chapter 1.  We begin as stardust, and it is to stardust we shall return.  Eventually.  In Chapter 2, \\"Life and Death among the Stars,\\" she introduces cosmic dust and in Chapter 3 shows it falling on the earth from outer space: forty thousand tons of it every year, almost all of it in a fine rain. (p. 33)  Then there are three chapters on how dust moves around on our planet and how it affects the weather, the life cycles of plants and animals, our economies and our health.  There is an excursion into the past in Chapter 7 to answer the question, \\"Did Dust Do in the Ice Age?\\"  Chapter 8 is about the continuous fall of atmospheric dust onto land, ocean and ice.  It is finally in Chapter 9 that Holmes considers the dust in our neighborhoods, and then in Chapter 10, \\"Microscopic Monsters and Other Indoor Devils,\\" she gets to the topic of primary interest to most readers, the dust under the bed, in the rug, and on the floor.  The final chapter is about the dust of our bodies after we are dead, and then after the sun explodes and we are once again stardust.<br /><br />This is a fascinating read that unlike most books becomes more interesting the further into it one gets. It may change the way you view the world.  Seeing our planet and its history from the point of view of dust sheds an entirely different light on things.  The very small things in enormous numbers affect our lives in ways that surprise and astound.  Consider the sheer volume and weight of dust that swirls around in the atmosphere, with massive tons of it held aloft to cross oceans and continents.  That story alone is mind boggling.  Here I learned that the coral islands of the Caribbean developed their soil not from the breakdown of the islands themselves, but from the sand that fell on them over millions of years from the Sahara Desert thousands of miles away!<br /><br />This, the relatively unknown story of dust is a story of dust hunters who collect and analyze the minute particles from all over the planet to determine their origin and how they affect the various environments.  Dust hunters even drill into the arctic and the antarctic to reconstruct the story of dust laid down in the past.  They can tell by the composition of dust where it came from.  Saharan dust, for example, is particularly heavy in iron and phosphorous.  In fact, the microbes in dust, the viruses, the fungi and the bacteria, can betray its origin.<br /><br />Holmes considers some hot topics in science along the way, including global warming and the explosion in asthma in the United States and Europe in recent decades and how dust may or may not be the cause.  Deadly dusts containing asbestos, quartz, coal, etc. are considered as well as the danger of working with materials containing them.  Why talcum powder is no longer dusted on babies and how working with pigs and wheat and other farm products can be hazardous to your health is revealed.  The deadly effect of dust getting into the lungs is explained--how macrophages can and cannot engulf and get rid of various substances and how people die from a host of diseases caused by inhaling the wrong kind of dust.  And Holmes doesn't disappoint when it comes to the story of household dust.  The chapter on indoor dust is absolutely fascinating and a bit scary.<br /><br />Some other things I learned is how dust heats or cools the planet as it floats in the air or lands on ocean, land or ice; how epidemics can be triggered by migrating dust containing disease spores; how a bloom of algae can follow a download of iron-bearing dust from a desert half a world away; even how we carry around with us our own personal and distinctive cloud of dust.<br /><br />Some readers I suspect will grow impatient with all the science and want toknow about their own dust.  I know I felt that way when I opened the book.  But I am glad I read the whole thing, because what I learned about dust makes me shake my head in wonder.  This is an information-packed book.  There's no padding, and everything is vividly expressed.t way when I opened the book.  But I am glad I read the whole thing, because what I learned about dust makes me shake my head in wonder.

(Taking notes wouldn't hurt.)  This is a complex story, and one has to admire Alicia Mundy's skill in managing it while spinning out an engaging narrative.  She succeeds  by concentrating on one case, that of 29-year-old Mary Linnen, an Orchard Park, New York woman, who developed primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) after using the Fen-Phen drug combination for a mere 23 days.  There is no cure for PPH, and the treatments amount to something like sustained torture.  Tragically, less than a year after diagnosis, Mary Linnen was dead.<br />Within her story, Mundy focuses on two main characters.  One is the engaging and colorful Alex MacDonald, the lead attorney representing Mary Linnen's estate, who along with many others sued American Home Products, the parent company of Wyeth-Ayerst, the distributors of Pondimin and Redux (one half of the deadly Fen-Phen diet cocktail), for wrongful death; and the other is Leo Lutwak, a well-meaning but ineffectual administrator at the Food and Drug Administration.  But I think the real story here is the corporate mentality inside the drug companies that led to the tragedy, and the incompetence at the FDA that allowed it.  Although I think Mundy concentrates too much on the lawyers in her narrative (she indicates in the \\"Acknowledgments\\" that she was inspired by Jonathan Harr's lawyer-centered A Civil Action), she is still able to give a complete story, but it takes some real effort on the part of the reader to get it all.  I had to take notes and flip back through the pages with the aid of the Index to keep Pondimin and its \\"sister\\" drug Redux separate from Phentermine, and to realize that it is the combination of Pondimin and Phentermine or the combination of Redux and Phentermine that is the deadly Fen-Phen combo.  When one looks deeper it becomes apparent that Pondimin is the brand name for the drug fenfluramine and Redux for dexfenfluramine, the \\"Fen\\" in \\"Fen-Phen.\\"<br />It's an important part of the story to realize that doctors prescribed Phentermine in combination with Pondimin because Pondimin alone led to unwanted drowsiness while Phentermine \\"was,\\" as Mundy phrases it on page 39, \\"after all, a form of &lt;speed&gt;.\\"  The logic here, although not mentioned, is similar to that of the hugely successful Sudafed combination of the antihistamine Chlorpheniramine Maleate, which leads to drowsiness, and the nasal decongestant Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride, which counteracts that effect by speeding up your system.<br />Still, it's not clear why so people so eagerly gobbled up the Fen-Phen combo.  Mundy indicates that part of the reason was a massive advertising and PR campaign spun out by the drug companies--she calls it \\"Obesity, Inc.\\"--a campaign that made the never-proven claim that over 300,000 Americans, mostly women, die each year from the \\"disease\\" of obesity.  The drug companies positioned themselves as wanting to save those lives.  However, Mundy cites a study on page 155 showing that the long-term expected weight loss from using Fen-Phen was only about three percent above that of a placebo.<br />To me the most unsettling part of this story is the stupidity practiced by the FDA and by Wyeth in not realizing that Pondimin or Redux in combination with Phentermine was in its effects very similar to Aminorex, an appetite suppressant that caused a major epidemic of primary pulmonary hypertension, killing hundreds of people in Europe during the mid-1960s. (p. 38)  Mundy quotes John Restaino, \\"a young doctor turned lawyer,\\" as saying (p. 198), himself quoting an unidentified Swedish scientist, \\"When I saw the combination of Pondimin and Phentermine, Fen-Phen, I said, &lt;My God, they've re-created Aminorex!&gt;.\\"  (Incidentally, the lack of attribution for some of the text--there are no footnotes--is a disappointment.)<br />Thisbit of ignorance, perhaps willful, by Wyeth and the FDA was followed by a frenzy of greed when the drug companies realized the potential profits.  This in turn was followed by attempts at obfuscation and cover-up, denial and feigned ignorance, when the deadly side effects became public knowledge.  Ironically, it wasn't PPH that finally led to the withdrawal of the drugs, but another, also deadly side effect, that of heart valvular disease, uncovered by two Fargo, North Dakota residents, med tech Pam Ruff and cardiologist Jack Crary.  To my mind, their story is the most important part of the book.  Their unselfish and courageous work led to the withdrawal of the drugs and saved the lives of untold numbers of people.<br />Bottom line: this is an engaging read about a preventable tragedy and the triumph of litigation against a big corporation to be ranked with A Civil Action (the book, not the so-so movie) and the Erin Brockovich story.is bit of ignorance, perhaps willful, by Wyeth and the FDA was followed by a frenzy of greed when the drug companies realized the potential profits.

He is a doctor of medicine who would be a literary artist.  He demonstrates in these exquisitely wrought pages a deep sense of identification and empathy with the very real human beings whose cells he sees in his microscope.  He writes about intersecting with their lives in a style both concrete and moving so that we cannot help but also identify with the heart-wrenching experience of disease.<br />So there's an irony in the title and a kind of strange misdirection: Dr. Nadler's concentration is NOT on cellular life, but instead on the psychological, existential and spiritual aspects of people whose cells have gone bad.<br />He begins with the story of a 35-year-old woman who has breast cancer.  She wants to see the cancerous cells in the microscope.  Nadler, whose daily work is performing biopsies, especially surgical biopsies made on the fly as the patient is etherized upon a table, obliges, and thereby begins a relationship with her and her illness that goes well beyond what can be experienced through the lenses of his \\"research-quality German microscope made by Zeiss.\\"  She sees landscapes and metaphors in the dead and dying cells, and Nadler is once again reminded of the human experience of disease.<br />Next is the chapter entitled simply \\"Fat\\" about a woman suffering from morbid obesity.  She undergoes the Rouxen-Y gastric bypass, a gastrointestinal reconstruction surgery that miniaturizing her stomach from a capacity of 1,700 milliliters to 35 milliliters.  (I have a question not answered in the text: why did her stomach have to be SO small?  Couldn't they have left her with say, two or three hundred milliliters?)  The procedure works and she goes from over 360 pounds to 180, but she cannot eat more than a few ounces of food at any one setting and she must--as Nadler so beautifully phrases it on page 39-swallow only \\"bonsaied boluses\\" and take \\"great care to chew them to a flow.\\"<br />\\"Fat\\" is quite frankly one of the best medical essays I have ever read.  But I am not alone in admiring the artistry of Nadler's carefully constructed prose.  Two of the essays in this book, \\"Brain Cell Memories\\" and \\"An Old Soldier,\\" the first about brain tumors, and the second about a 75-year-old man who has been a paraplegic for 55 years, are included in, respectively, The Best American Essays, 2001 and The Best American Essays, 1999.  I was particularly impressed with \\"An Old Soldier,\\" in which Nadler's clear, stark prose reveals the courage, strength and sheer cussed determination it takes for WWII vet Sam Patterson to live when \\"His lower trunk and limbs, his bowels, bladder, and genitals, are permanently incommunicado, shutting him off from the rest of his body like a demented mind.\\" (p. 150)<br />The other chapters are \\"Heart Rhythms,\\" which is essentially a heroic portrait of conductor Mehli Mehta; \\"Early Alzheimer's: A View from Within\\" which features AD-sufferer Morris Friedell who \\"can crystalize the life that remains and devise ways to enhance it\\" (for example, he takes notes and crosses off the tasks and experiences as they are lived); and \\"The Burden of Sickle Cells\\" about a boy that Nadler befriends who has the sickle cell disease.<br />The last chapter in the book is an appreciation of hospice work and grief counseling with a focus on Nadler's friend, Brad Deford, a chaplain to the dying.  Nadler follows him on his rounds and experiences first hand how comforting it can be to have someone help with the emotional and spiritual preparations.  Nadler refers to one old couple, each facing eminent death, as having become, \\"in their married years together...two nuclei in a single cell.\\"  His final words before the Epilogue are: \\"How awesome is this cellular ride, so steeped in mysterious efficiency.  But it is the human dying, so urgent and inevitable, that is graven unto me.\\"<br />As can be seen, Nadler is a very fine prose stylist, and his book is to be compared favorably with the best works written by practicing doctors from what I might call \\"the medical tale genre.\\"  Some recent examples include Jerome Groopman's  Second Opinions: Stories of Intuition and Choice in the Changing World of Medicine (2000) and of course the works of Oliver Sacks, e.g., An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995) and The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and other clinical tales (1987).pared favorably with the best works written by practicing doctors from what I might call \\"the medical tale genre.\\"  Some recent examples include Jerome Groopman's  Second Opinions: Stories of Intuition and Choice in the Changing World of Medicine (2000) and of course the works of Oliver Sacks, e.g., An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995) and The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and other clinical tales (1987).	2001-11-28

The central message of this gracefully written, highly informative, and refreshingly modest book by Rockefeller University Professor Emeritus William Agosta is that there is a wealth of chemicals produced in nature that humans can effectively use to fight disease, control pests, and facilitate chemical reactions--if only we can find, understand and harvest them.<br />Agosta begins with a tale about a species of ant that enslaves members of another species using a variety of chemicals.  He ends the book with the idea that we might find desperately needed new antibiotics by examining the chemicals made by animals \\"that form herds or flocks, as well as those that live in organized societies, such as the social insects...\\" (p. 212)  Agosta's rationale is that other social creatures face the same danger that humans face, that of pathogens that rapidly spread in a crowd.  Surely they have come up with some chemical defenses we might discover and employ ourselves.  He cites ants as a particularly likely prospect for study and gives the example of the bulldog ants of Australia who, when injected with the common human intestinal bacterium, Escherichia coli, manufacture an antibiotic that promptly kills it.<br />In between the bookend chapters, Agosta spins tales about how microbes and insects, plants and sea creatures, fungi and arachnids attract, repeal, steal from, deceive, enslave, parasitize and kill one another, mainly with chemicals.  The world he depicts is largely a world where eyes and ears are secondary to the sense of smell, a bizarre fairy land of complicated arrangements among species and delicate ecologies.  A case in point is the in-door farm of the leaf-cutting ant which involves not only the ants and the trees they get the leaves from and the fungus they grow, but also the use of a species of streptomyces to produce an antibiotic to kill a fungal pest in their gardens.  In other words, not only are ants farmers, they use pesticides!<br />Agosta emphasizes that we must understand the interactions of species to appreciate their use of chemicals.  He uses the phenomenon of Lyme disease as an example, and how it is affected by the mass fruiting cycle of oak tree acorns which influence the numbers of mice and deer on which the ticks that harbor the Lyme disease parasites live.  Two years after a bumper crop of acorns there is a concomitant rise in the number of people who get Lyme disease.<br />In particular, these are tales of parasite and host.  I was startled to learn on page 223 that ticks and mites are so prevalent that they have \\"parasitized almost every organism larger than themselves.\\"  Indeed, something similar can be said of the nematodes (roundworms) who \\"have parasitized virtually every species larger than themselves.\\" (p. 224)  When one thinks about the countless viruses and bacteria that prey on humans and all the other animals and plants, one realizes that we live in a world of parasites.<br />However, the single most startling and mind-expanding thing I read in this book is the story in Chapter 11, \\"Real-World Complexity,\\" of a wasp that uses a virus to help it subdue the hornworm caterpillars it deposits its eggs in.  This opens up the possibility that we can use viruses to invade and kill microbes and cure disease.  Perhaps this is already being done in laboratories somewhere, or at least is in the experimental stage.<br />All this information is interesting, even exciting, and potentially of great use by humans, but if we are to benefit from the chemical knowledge of microbes, plants and animals, we need to preserve what wild life we have left in the world, in particular that of the rain forests where there is such an incredible variety of life.  These myriad creatures have, over the vast eons of time, learned to create and manufacture chemicals that we could never discover on our own.  It would be a shame to throw away all this knowledge for a few trillion hamburgers....<br />I recall some years ago thata major corporation had as its advertising slogan: \\"Better living through chemistry.\\"  I used to always think when I heard that, \\"but life IS chemistry.\\"  This book strongly supports that idea.a major corporation had as its advertising slogan: \\"Better living through chemistry.\\"  I used to always think when I heard that, \\"but life IS chemistry.\\"  This book strongly supports that idea.	2001-11-26

The evolution of the AIDS virus is a particularly compelling case in point, and one of the focal points of this engaging book about how our efforts to control our world can bring about unwanted evolutionary change over time periods measured not in millennia, but in weeks and months.  Mostly it is microbial evolution that Harvard Professor of Biology Stephen Palumbi writes about, the AIDS virus, the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, staph and other infections, but also insects and plants, particularly the insects that eat crops and the plants we call weeds, and even fish.  At the center of change is the \\"evolutionary engine\\" that is continually at work adjusting organisms to their environments.  Change the environment of a creature and the creature changes to keep its fit, a never-ending phenomenon that frustrates our efforts to eradicate harmful pests and deadly diseases.<br />Palumbi shows how it is not enough to spray our fields of amber grain with pesticides because the pests will inevitably evolve to flourish in the new pesticide-filled environment.  It is not enough to throw antibiotics at the bacteria that invade our bodies because they too will evolve to flourish.  Our efforts to combat the scourges of field and body are now seen as just one half of the prey/predator, parasite/host phenomenon of co-evolution.  As Palumbi phrases it, \\"The disease dance continues, turning to the evolutionary tune, and both players must step smartly.\\"  (p. 90)  We must take the power of life forms to evolve rapidly into account, and realize that they will react to our efforts.  This is the evolutionary arms race, the \\"Red Queen\\" hypothesis, that keeps us (if we \\"step smartly\\"enough) and our enemies in the same place even though we are both running at full speed.  This may be seen as a kind of cosmic joke at those who would find \\"progress\\" in evolution.<br />En route on bringing us up to speed on rapid evolutionary change, Palumbi sets some sort of record for the use of colorful language.  There is some distraction as metaphors and analogies fly about like confetti at a wedding , but he is so clever that we forgive him.  Some examples:<br />p 16: \\"...as unknown as the dreams of a sleeping infant.\\"<br />p. 56: a trait (a recessive gene) is said to lie \\"dormant like thoughts on a Saturday morning.\\"<br />p. 102:  a virus is compared to a credit card.<br />p. 107: a typical viral attack on the immune system \\"has more plot twists than a soap opera.\\"<br />p. 137: expressing the too-optimistic hopes of a five-year malaria eradication program: \\"...by then, surely malaria would be gone like the world's last car payment.\\"<br />p. 240: \\"bad ideas\\" are compared to \\"anchovy daiquiris\\" that \\"live on only in a few people with fishy breath.\\"<br />In short, this book colorfully illuminates one of the most significant conundrums of our time: despite our best pesticides, our most powerful antibiotics, our most clever and hopeful chemical cocktails, we are not winning the war against pests and disease.  We are at best holding our own.  The message of this book is perhaps we can do more if we take into account the power of the evolutionary engine, and finds ways to use it to our advantage.>En route on bringing us up to speed on rapid evolutionary change, Palumbi sets some sort of record for the use of colorful language.

That is just one of the many questions answered in this thoroughly informative book about caffeine.  Mostly they drank beer.  Indeed for breakfast it was typical to have beer soup sopped up with bread.  There were no stimulant beverages available, and people did not generally drink water since safe water was not readily available.  Such a world it must have been with most people drinking alcoholic beverages from sun up to sun down!  Then came first cacao, and then coffee and tea, and our world changed.  It is interesting to realize that part of the value of cocoa, coffee and tea is the fact that they are consumed in water that has been boiled.  The health benefits of drinking safe water made habitual by the mildly addictive force of caffeine turned out to be a boon to humankind.  When one considers the usually deleterious nature of addiction, this is a delicious irony.<br />The emphasis here of course is on the two most widely consumed caffeine beverages, tea and coffee.  Weinberg and Bealer guide us through the facts and the folklore, the history and the pharmacology of the world's favorite drug.  They begin with the origins of coffee and tea in Part I: \\"Caffeine in History,\\" followed by its arrival and widespread use in Europe in Part II: \\"Europe Wakes Up to Caffeine.\\"  Part III is \\"The Culture of Caffeine\\" including knowledge about such things as the tea ceremony in Japan, the famous Oxford Coffee Club and the birth of the Royal Society in England and the rise of the coffee houses.  The story of Coca-Cola in America and the advent of what the authors call (p. 195) \\"The Straight Dope: Vavarin, NoDoz, and Other Caffeine Pills,\\" is detailed.  The cultural \\"duality\\" between coffee and tea is expressed and a two-columned list presented in which, for example, coffee is associated with the male and tea with the female; coffee with indulgence and tea with temperance; coffee with excess and tea with moderation; Americans versus the English, Balzac versus Proust, etc.<br />I found the last two parts of the book, Part IV: \\"The Natural History of Caffeine,\\" and Part V: \\"Caffeine and Health\\" the most interesting.  The chemistry of caffeine is therein discussed and information is given about how much caffeine is in various beverages (Starbucks decaffeinated coffee, for example, was found to actually have 25 mg of caffeine, while an average cup of regular java contains anywhere from 40 to 180 mg).  Mat&eacute; and guarana, caffeine drinks popular in South America, are compared with coffee and tea, as well as with cacao (the source of chocolate), and the cola nut (which is typically chewed), along with the bark of a tree from which something called yoco tea is made.  Even betel, khat, ephedra and coca leaves are brought into the discussion.  The mental and physical effects of caffeine are assessed as well as that of other methylzanthines found in caffeine plants, such as theobromine and theophylline. Caffeine's effect on memory, depression, aggression, alertness, etc. are looked into, and the question of whether caffeine is a drug of abuse is addressed.<br />I must say that I found just about everything I wanted to know about caffeine in this book.  It is easily the best book on the subject that I know of.  The presentation is readable and entertaining with tables, photos, black and white prints, and cartoons augmenting the text.  There's even some poetry.  One of the most interesting illustrations shows four spider webs spun by spiders each \\"under the influence\\" of a different drug, marijuana, benzedrine, chloral hydrate and caffeine.  Guess which web is the most distorted?tea with temperance; coffee with excess and tea with moderation; Americans versus the English, Balzac versus Proust, etc.<br />I found the last two parts of the book, Part IV: \\"The Natural History of Caffeine,\\" and Part V: \\"Caffeine and Health\\" the most interesting.

What is at stake is just who among the illuminati of the Darwinian establishment really have the goods on how evolution works and how it doesn't.  \\"Spandrels\\" of the mind, \\"habitat tracking,\\" how complexity affects evolution, \\"species sorting,\\" whether evolution proceeds by leaps and bounds or just plods along, and other contentious matters form the body of this unsteady but interesting book.<br />The main antagonists are the usual suspects, Stephen Jay Gould, Niles Eldredge, Richard Lewontin, et al., proponents of punctuated equilibrium and a \\"holistic\\" approach to evolution on the one side, and Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennet, John Maynard Smith, et al., gradualist reductionists, the so-called \\"orthodox Darwinians,\\" on the other.  Dawkins, et al. believe that natural selection is the only really important factor in evolution while Gould, et al. believe that natural selection alone cannot fully explain how evolution works.  Morris reviews their various publications and quotes them, revealing that they behave rather badly at times, sometimes resorting to unseemly personal attacks on one another--which leads me to observe that Darwin, who never involved himself in hot debates, much less in name calling, must be turning over in his grave.<br />The irony is, as Morris fumbles to makes clear, the seemingly substantive differences that are being so hotly debated are for the most part actually ones of emphasis and interpretation.  Nobody involved doubts the supremacy of natural selection as the driving force in evolutionary change, any more than any of them doubt the fact of evolution.  Morris gives the reader some background information about evolution and introduces complexity theory in order that the debate may be followed.  In the penultimate chapter he gives a summary of the evidence as he sees it.  A final chapter entitled, \\"Controversy and Discovery,\\" includes the currently hot idea \\"that evolution can proceed at a more rapid rate than anyone had suspected.\\" (p. 233)  There is an annotated bibliography and a useful appendix listing relevant Web sites.  Morris tries to avoid taking sides in this debate.  Indeed, he bends over backwards to be fair, and that attitude, along with a beguiling, easy to read style, is the strength of the book.<br />There are weaknesses, however.  His focus is too narrow with its concentration on Gould, et al. and Dawkins, et al. and their differences when there are much more interesting and immediate questions currently being debated.  (I imagine that the young lions in evolutionary biology are very tired of seeing those old guys still getting all that ink!)  For an interesting book by a young evolutionary psychologist on some of the newer controversies see Geoffery Miller's The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature (2000).<br />And then there are all those typos!  I found typos on pages 41, 47, 107, 114, 199, 203, 228, and 232.  In one case the word \\"would\\" was left out.  In another the word \\"out\\" was used when the word \\"at\\" was meant, and in a couple of places extraneous words were left in.  For example, on page 203 a sentence begins, \\"You should not should not automatically conclude...\\"  When one sees a lot of typos in a book it suggests that the author did not read the proofs, or if he did, he did a cursory job of it.<br />Worse than the typos (and if I found eight, there are surely others) are some misstatements of fact and intent.  On page 34 he writes that the mammals that survived the K-T extinction \\"are not more &lt;evolved&gt; than their dinosaur predecessors.\\" As Morris points out on page 32 \\"a frog is just as &lt;evolved&gt; as a human being.\\"  But that means frogs living today and human beings living today.  To compare how \\"evolved\\" the dinosaurs living 65 million years ago are to mammals living today makes little sense.  Note too that on page 34 Morris refers to the extinction of the dinosaurs as taking place65 million years ago, which of course is the standard take, but on page 124 he unaccountably states that the \\"collision with an asteroid\\" took place 70 million years ago.  Actually he writes, \\"70 millions years ago,\\" which, I just noticed, is another typo!<br />There is also entirely too much repetition in the book, as though the chapters were independently conceived and meant to be published separately and then not properly edited.  For example on page 204 Morris repeats the same ideas, and even some of the same wording, that appears on page 123.  Chapter 8, \\"The Evidence,\\" in particular contains a lot of unnecessary repetition.<br />Finally there is a most annoying error on page 175 in Morris's discussion of the Watson selection task.  As written the instructions are incomplete and must leave readers scratching their heads about what is given as the correct answer.  He writes:<br /> \\"Suppose you are shown the four cards marked with the following symbols: D F 3 7  You are then asked which two cards you must turn over to see if any of the cards violate the following rule:<br />  If the letter D is on one side, then there will be a numeral 3 on the other.<br />Which two cards do you turn over?\\"<br />Morris's answer, cards, D and 7 is partially correct, but what about the card with the F?  According to the directions it also has to be turned over (to see if there's a D there) making it three cards that must be turned over, not two.  This error resulted because Morris left out the following proviso, namely that the cards always have a letter on one side and a number on the other.<br />This is an excellent idea for a book, but I don't think Richard Morris realized its potential.65 million years ago, which of course is the standard take, but on page 124 he unaccountably states that the \\"collision with an asteroid\\" took place 70 million years ago.

Sex may help to sell cars, and the fact that women are attracted to men of means with expensive cars (forget the Paseo) is not to be doubted, but to suppose that the primary function of any automobile is symbolic or ornamental is mistaken.  While witty conversation and musical display certainly are attractive attributes of a well-made brain, they are secondary to the social, political and subsistence skills of that brain as reasons for its being.<br />The brain, as Miller points out, is a very expensive organ, eating up a disproportional amount of our caloric intake, requiring a long period of development both inside and outside the womb, as well as making childbirth painful and dangerous--which are some of the reasons it has never grown so disproportionately large in any other creature.  Such an organ must have some very fine compensating qualities to make it adaptive.  The fact that women dig it (or men for that matter) isn't enough.  The case of the peacock with its huge showy tail feathers and the Irish elk with its enormous antlers are cited as examples of runaway sexual ornamentation, and they are that, I suppose.  But the Irish elk is extinct and the peacock is not exactly a favorite to survive for very much longer.  Most creatures do not develop features that are so grossly expensive strictly as lures for the opposite sex.  Most such lures are modest, the coloring of birds, the combs on roosters, the mane on a lion, a woman's breasts, etc.<br />Miller knows this and his book does not contradict what I have written.  The problem is one of perception and understanding.  Evolutionary theory, seemingly so simple at first glance, is an incredibly complex subject, so much so that no one person can hope to grasp it all--or, I should say, grasp what little we now know.  Evolutionary psychology, which follows from the fact of evolution just as surely as evolutionary biology does, is also an incredibly complex subject awaiting its first genius.  But separating \\"just so stories\\" from genuine insights is extraordinarily difficult.  There is no way Miller or others can prove that the human brain developed in part because of sexual selection--although I personally do not doubt that it did.  Nor do I doubt that the elephant's size was also enhanced through sexual selection, perhaps even the cheetah's speed as well.  But how to prove it?  Consequently, it becomes a matter of opinion to what extent the thesis is correct.  Is Miller overstating the case?  There is no sure way of deciding.  Each reader must weigh the arguments and reach his own conclusions.  This is why evolutionary psychology, despite its enormous power to provide insight into who we are and why we behave as we do, is difficult for some people to understand and will continue to be controversial for many decades to come.<br />But this very readable and thought-provoking work goes well beyond its primary thesis as Miller explores sexual selection theory over a wide range of human ability and ornamentation.  One of the most exciting things he does is to recognize that biologist Amotz Zahavi's handicap principle can function as a fitness indicator not only to predators but to members of the opposite sex.  Thus springboks jump into the air to show predators that they have energy to spare, while women incur the \\"handicap\\" of growing large, fatty breasts to show that they have foraged well and have reserves to feed their children.  In this way fitness is demonstrated, the former to discourage a fruitless chase, the latter to advertise ready fertility to members of the opposite sex.<br />I also appreciate his recall of neotony--the retention of child-like features in the adult--as a significant feature of sexual selection.  Most recent books on evolutionary psychology have forgotten Ashley Montagu's Growing Young (1989) and Stephen J. Gould's Ontongeny and Phylogeny (1977) both cited by Miller.  Sexual selection makes us appear more childlike as a youth indicator, consistent with choosing a mate that will serve us well as a partner for many years to come.<br />Miller will find his critics here because one of the things he is trying to do is diminish the idea that the intellectual and artistic abilities of the brain are merely fortuitous side effects of its subsistential and social function, which is the position of Stephen Jay Gould and others.  In this attempt I don't think Miller is going to be entirely successful.  Fortuitous side effects of organs are at the very heart of evolutionary change, sometimes becoming more important than the earlier function.  We see this in the case of fins that became legs, or light-detecting organs that became capable of discerning movement and color, and so on.  The best explanation for the rapid and disproportionate growth of the human brain is its social/political function.  Following in importance is its ability to understand the environment in a way that allows us to find food and shelter and avoid predators.  Then, I would say, its tertiary function is to display itself to the opposite sex, to be \\"sexy.\\"<br />It is impossible to do justice to this ambitious work in a review limited to a thousand words; however had I more space, given the wide terrain explored by Miller, I would be inadequate to the task.  Quite simply, this is an incredibly complex work by a gifted young scientist trying to establish himself as one of the leaders in the growing field of evolutionary psychology, and a book all interested persons should read.-the retention of child-like features in the adult--as a significant feature of sexual selection.

Following in importance is its ability to understand the environment in a way that allows us to find food and shelter and avoid predators.  Then, I would say, its tertiary function is to display itself to the opposite sex, to be \\"sexy.\\"<br />It is impossible to do justice to this ambitious work in a review limited to a thousand words; however had I more space, given the wide terrain explored by Miller, I would be inadequate to the task.  Quite simply, this is an incredibly complex work by a gifted young scientist trying to establish himself as one of the leaders in the growing field of evolutionary psychology, and a book all interested persons should read.	2001-11-11
1783599:US	49786731	R29SW5XVUT83ZM	0316184136	844504752	The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson	Books	5	222	234	N	N	Zero at the Bone	Nearly everyone who's had a brush with American lit knows the story of Emily Dickinson - her poetry unpublished in her lifetime, and then even after her death, her verses seeing the light of day only after having been \\"improved\\" on by an editor who found her rhymes imperfect and her meter \\"spasmodic.\\" He even went so far as to make her metaphors \\"sensible.\\" The fact is, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, to whom Dickinson had sent her poems, was a representative of the poetic establishment, and as with all artistic establishments then and now, was too rigid in his thinking and too impoverished in his imagination to comprehend a new voice of genius. As Editor Thomas H. Johnson writes in his terse but very instructive Introduction, \\"He was trying to measure a cube by the rules of plane geometry.\\"<br /><br />Of course other women of literature suffered something similar during the nineteenth century. What I wonder is, who is being misread, ignored or denied today?<br /><br />Anyway, suffice it to say that this IS the definitive one-volume collection of the poetry of Emily Dickinson. It includes all the 1,775 poems that she wrote in her lifetime, and they are presented here just as she wrote them with only some minor corrections of obvious misspellings or misplaced apostrophes. Johnson has retained the sometimes \\"capricious\\" capitalization, and preserved the famous dashes.<br /><br />There is a subject index, which I found useful, and an index of first lines, which is invaluable.<br /><br />Dickinson can be playful...<br /><br />I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br />Are you - Nobody - too?<br />Then there's a pair of us!<br />Don't tell! they'd advertise - you know!<br /><br />...she can be sarcastic...<br /><br />\\"Faith\\" is a fine invention<br />When Gentlemen can see -<br />But Microscopes are prudent<br />In an Emergency.<br /><br />[Alas, the Amazon.com editor does not support italics. The words \\"see\\" and \\"Microscopes\\" are italicized above, and it really does make a difference!]<br /><br />...and grave...<br /><br />I heard a Fly buzz - when I died -<br />The Stillness in the Room<br />Was like the Stillness in the Air -<br />Between the Heaves of Storm -<br /><br />...and observant...<br /><br />I like a look of Agony,<br />Because I know it's true -<br />Men do not sham Convulsion,<br />Nor simulate, a Throe -<br /><br />...and profound...<br /><br />Love reckons by itself - alone -<br />\\"As large as I\\" - relate the Sun<br />to One who never felt it blaze -<br />Itself is all the like it has -<br /><br />..and desperate...<br /><br />\\"Hope\\" is the thing with feathers -<br />That perches in the soul -<br />And sings the tune without the words -<br /><br />And never stops - at all -<br /><br />...and self aware...<br /><br />I meant to have but modest needs -<br />Such as Content - and Heaven -<br />Within my income - these could lie<br />And Life and I - keep even -<br /><br />...and even radical...<br /><br />Much Madness is divinest Sense -<br />To a discerning Eye -<br />Much Sense - the starkest Madness -<br />'Tis the Majority<br />In this, as All, prevail -<br />Assent - and you are sane -<br />Demur - you're straightway dangerous -<br />And handled with a Chain -<br /><br />...and much more.<br /><br />She is a poet of strikingly apt and totally original phrases imbued with a deep resonance of thought and observation, especially on her favorite subjects, life, death and love. She can be cryptic and her references and allusions are sometimes too private for us to catch. She can also be amazingly terse. But the intensity of her experience and the \\"Zero at the Bone\\" emotion displayed in this, her \\"letter to the World/That never wrote to me -\\" are second to none in the world of letters. Unlike Shakespeare, who mastered the psychology of people in places high and low, Dickinson mastered only her own psychology, and yet through that we can see, as in a mirror, ourselves.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Like a Tsunami Headed for Hilo: Selected Poems\\"lo: Selected Poems\\"	2001-11-05
1786770:US	49786731	RBSP79X4SZBRN	0679742298	904783689	The Talented Mr. Ripley	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Splendid psycho/sexual study of a sociopath	Patricia Highsmith, one of the grande dames of the mystery genre, as usual transcends that genre in this meticulously wrought study of a sociopath. The action is set in Europe in the fifties, mostly Italy, at a time when the Yankee dollar bought a whole lot of cappuccino, and an American accent still commanded some respect.  In her intense exploration of the 25-year-old Tom Ripley, Highsmith implicitly asks the question: Is the difference between a sociopath and a \\"normal\\" person only a matter of degree, or is there a distinct difference between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\"?<br />First published in 1955, The Talented Mr. Ripley has since been made into a couple of excellent movies, the first a Hitchcockian venture by French director Rene Clement entitled Plein Soleil  \\"Purple Moon\\" (1960) and recently the interpretation by Anthony Minghella using Highsmith's title.  Neither picture was entirely faithful to Highsmith's novel, yet both caught the spirit of the sexually ambiguous Tom Ripley, who might more properly be called,  \\"The Murderous Mr. Ripley.\\"<br />In effect, Highsmith asks, is Ripley's love of self so complete and exclusive that it precludes any other love?  Note that his love for the rich and spoiled Dickie Greenleaf takes form as a step by step assumption of Dickie's life and personality.  It is only when he becomes Dickie that Ripley is able to love Dickie and thereby to love himself.  In other words, to love himself Tom Ripley must destroy the self-loathing that he has always felt.  He does this by becoming Dickie Greenleaf and assuming Dickie's witty, confident personality and all the accoutrements of wealth, leisure and status that Dickie enjoys.  While we note Ripley's repulsive feelings toward Marge and a kind of identification and interest in gay men, an interest that Dickie finds disgusting--witness the scene on the beach with the men making human pyramids--our answer to the simplistic question, is Tom Ripley gay? is...not really, and anyway it doesn't matter.  He is interested only in loving himself, and finding ways to do that.<br />There is a strong sense of the psychoanalytic approach in Highsmith's somewhat euphemistic study, which is not surprising considering that the 1950s were perhaps the heyday of Freudian analysis and suppositions, at least in the popular culture.  The movie Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Robert Lindner's popular, The Fifty Minute Hour: A Collection of True Psychoanalytical Tales (1954) come quickly to mind, and Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) was not far off.  But Highsmith does not allow us to draw any set conclusions about her anti-hero.<br />The ending is disturbingly ironic and daring, surprising both us and the slippery Mr. Ripley.He is interested only in loving himself, and finding ways to do that.<br />There is a strong sense of the psychoanalytic approach in Highsmith's somewhat euphemistic study, which is not surprising considering that the 1950s were perhaps the heyday of Freudian analysis and suppositions, at least in the popular culture.

1794247:US	49786731	RXVMHU4FBLZXM	0679447059	566077188	The Destiny of Nathalie X: and Other Stories	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A remarkable collection by a gifted writer	These dense, finely etched stories are my introduction to William Boyd.  Such an ordinary name for such a fancy writer!  The title story is set in a place I know well near LAX; indeed I can almost see the exact setting of most of the scenes, where a French director, a black auteur, as it were, is composing his film.  The setting is purposely banal in the extreme: a cheap pizzeria next to a nondescript motel within litter distance of the airport, chosen instinctively to comment on the low culture of America, I suppose, when all of Hollywood and Bel Air, West L.A. and Brentwood, avec filmdom execs, etc., beckons just beyond.  This is explained by understanding that \\"He's an artist, he don't look back,\\" to re-gender a Bob Dylan lyric, as Boyd does on page 11.<br />The second story, \\"Transfigured Night,\\" set in Austria and Poland during the first world war, is somewhat Kafkaesque and not typical of this collection.  The third story, \\"Hôtel des Voyageurs,\\" begins in Paris and is rendered in a self-revelatory first person narrative that is the book's signature technique (although this is just a warm up to the near-perfection of \\"Alpes-Maritimes\\" and \\"The Persistence of Vision\\" in which Boyd's narrators give themselves away completely, much to the reader's amusement).  One might call \\"Hôtel des Voyageurs,\\" a one-night stand (actually afternoon) for sophisticates in which a euro trash girl plays a Comtesse that the narrator coyly, in the British manner, brags about bedding.  This inadvertent self-revelation by the first person narrator is a technique that Boyd has worked to perfection.<br />The next story, \\"Never Saw Brazil\\" continues the cosmopolitan, polyglot exposition.  Boyd seems to know several European languages and is not shy about sparkling his text with italicized dialogue in a number of tongues including Portuguese.  He is also very big on food and presents a variable cookbook of dishes throughout.  The story, \\"Lunch,\\" is almost a toast to gastronomy.<br />\\"The Dream Lover\\" and the aforementioned \\"Alpes-Maritimes\\" are set in the south of France and concentrate on love and self-discovery among twenty-something expats expressed with irony, delicacy and a kind of ultra sophistication much envied, I understand, by assistant editors at Elle and The New Yorker.  (Probably also at Granta, where four of these stories first appeared.)<br />In \\"Cork\\" Boyd presents a female narrator who has a love affair with a strange but touching man who was once in her employ in Portugal harvesting and selling cork.  Here the narrator seems reliable and self-aware.<br />The final story, \\"Loose Continuity\\" begins in 1945 at the corner of Westwood and Wilshire near UCLA were I went to school while flashing back to Germany in the twenties as the female narrator, Gudrun, recalls a lost love as she watches the workmen finish her caf&eacute; design.<br />Boyd use of language is innovative and, at times, startling.  Some examples:<br />The narrator in \\"The Dream Lover,\\" as he ascends to the roof of an apartment building: \\"To my vague alarm there is a small swimming pool up here and a large glassed-in cabana.....\\"<br />In \\"Alpes-Maritimes\\" Boyd's narrator (who wants the twin sisters for himself alone) reflects on the intrusion of Steve, now with them, \\"The trio becomes a banal foursome, or--even worse--two couples.\\"<br />The dilettante artist in \\"The Persistence of Vision\\" reveals himself with this statement about his infant son: \\"I found it hard to paint in the house now that its routines revolved around Dominic's noisy needs rather than my own.\\"<br />On the next page, after noticing somebody out of the corner of his eye, the narrator remarks, \\"...[Y]our instinctive apprehension is often more sure and certain than something studied and sought for: the glance is often more accurate than the stare.\\"<br />In a bit of unconscious self-projection (and foreshadowed irony) on page 134, the narrator remarks on the man who will later, unbeknownst to him, abscondwith his wife, \\"I felt sad for him, with his pointless wealth and the cheerless luxury of his life....\\"<br />Sometimes one is forced to turn to the dictionary to understand exactly what Boyd has in mind.  In \\"Cork\\" Lily's lover has sent her an invitation for a rendezvous including these instructions: \\"...[P]lease do not depilate yourself--anywhere.\\"<br /><br />Boyd's style is precise, measured, polished, erudite, a trifle showy, and very sensitive.  He has a sharp eye for fashionable detail and any sort of pretension.  He stays off to the side himself, but maintains the sort of iron control over his characters, especially his leading narrators, that Nabokov insisted on.  He delves into the human condition with tiny needles like an acupuncturist or a miniaturist with a magnifying glass.  He is an extraordinary writer, original in technique, subtle in resolution with witty and ironic overtones.  His control of voice and tone bespeaks a man who has mastered several languages and many of the nuances of human psychology.

Koehler, who got mad at a couple of guys and shot them both to death in cold blood while wounding a third party.  That was in 1970.  He escaped and was never brought to justice.  Eventually the case was closed because somebody (Gourevitch doesn't tell us who) was of the \\"opinion\\" that Koehler had to be dead since (according to others) it was \\"virtually inconceivable that a man with such a violent disposition and criminal history could have remained alive and out of trouble\\" for so long. (p. 26)  Then in 1997, 27 years after the crime, Andy Rosenzweig, chief investigator for Manhattan's district attorney, reopened the case.<br />But this really isn't about Rosenzweig's pursuit of Koehler.  There wasn't much of a pursuit.  They found him living in Benicia, California and picked him up when he arrived at Penn Station in New York on July 30, 1997, \\"a pathetic old man\\" 67-years-old.  A photo taken that day makes him look like a rummy with a bad dye job.<br />So what's this book about, and why is it considered so good that Scott Turow and Elmore Leonard, among others, have touted it?  Quite simply this is a textbook example of how to write a modest crime story with an underlying emphasis on our criminal justice system, how it works, and how it fails.  Besides the two chief characters in the book, Koehler and Rosenzweig, there is a revealing portrait of defense attorney, \\"Don't Worry Murray\\" Murray Richman, a man who's made a nice living defending some of New York City's sleazier crooks.  The aptly named Richman believes that there's a difference between the authorities and gangsters: \\"the gangsters are more compassionate.\\"  (p. 128)  He adds (p. 132): \\"If I defended only innocent people, I'd go hungry.\\"  He says he believes in the system (which is one of the reasons he defends the accused), but his bottom line philosophy is \\"The truth is there is no truth.\\" (p. 132).<br />There's a certain nostalgic gangster color to the characters in this book.  Koehler is a particularly good study, a guy who first killed when he was fifteen years old, but a guy who somehow while on the lam for twenty-seven years, managed to become so beloved that he was thought of by some of the people in Benicia, California as \\"their unofficial mayor\\" and they supported him with t-shirts reading \\"free New York Frankie.\\" (p. 161)<br />Rosenzweig is the hero, a guy who never gives up, an honest cop who works methodically, dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's until he gets his man, a born bloodhound, and the kind of guy we ought to have more of in law enforcement.<br />Much of this true crime story first appeared in The New Yorker where Gourevitch's crisp, clean prose was much ballyhooed.

The emphasis is on biology, genetics, computer science and information technology including brain science and how discoveries in these fields are changing our lives and our very concept of self.<br />What Baldi does so very well is to take current tendencies in these fields to their logical conclusion, and to look fearlessly at the results.  This will be unpleasant reading for some, especially for those who see our species as fixed, a permanent endowment from a supernatural being.  Baldi's general point is that we are forever changing.  With the end of natural evolution upon us, so that we feel the full force of cultural evolution, the pace of change is rapidly accelerating.  The result of this will be that, come some not too distant future, we will indeed be something strikingly different from what we are now.<br />In progressive religious circles it is said that we are \\"becoming.\\"  Usually it is not said what we are becoming, because that is not known.  Baldi makes the same statement from the viewpoint of science.  Through the rapidly accelerating power of culture evolution, we are in the process of \\"becoming\\" that which we cannot as yet clearly see.<br />\\"[O]ur notions of self, life and death, intelligence, and sexuality are very primitive and on the verge of being profoundly altered...It is this shattering...that forms the central thread of this book.\\" (p. 3)  The idea that \\"each of us is a unique individual delimited by precise boundaries\\" is wrong.  With the advent of technologies stemming from science we will see that these boundaries are artificial as we are cloned and joined with silicon parts and machine intelligence, and as we become more and more attached to the Internet.<br />This is Aldous Huxley's Brave New World for real, but Baldi's is not a dystopian vision, rather his is a vision of great hope and excitement.  He believes that \\"genomes, computations, and minds are...continuous entities, both in space and in time,\\" and that we, individually, \\"are just samples of this continuum.\\" (p. 4)<br />This is a startling view of the world and ourselves, an exciting one that promises gargantuan changes to come.  Whereas many people are dismayed at the prospect of cloning human beings (and our government is currently against it).  Baldi celebrates the prospect, writing that cloning, \\"At a minimum...provides a form of genetic immortality\\" that \\"may be reassuring\\" to some of us. (p. 61)  He asks, what is \\"the chance of having twin Einsteins by natural means...?\\"  He answers that it is a 100-billion to one shot, but \\"trivial to replicate with cloning techniques.\\"  Baldi even dares to mention the prospect of cloning for spare parts.  (This might be called \\"partial cloning.\\")<br />Baldi believes that someday human intelligence \\"might be viewed as a historically interesting, albeit peripheral, special case of machine intelligence.\\" (p. 113)  He sees our neurons in direct interface with silicon intelligence, our memories and computational powers greatly enhanced.<br />He is trying \\"to imagine what can be done with intelligence and other faculties several orders of magnitude beyond our own.\\"  He writes: \\"Almost by definition, what can be done is in a blind spot that our brains cannot really see.\\" (p. 114)<br />It occurred to me while reading this that by gradually replacing our brain cells...etc., we would never \\"die,\\" at least not knowingly.  We would change, perhaps drastically, over a period of time, but our subjective experience would note only small changes similar to the experience of watching grass grow.  This would be a sort of death-defying immortality (with evolutionary change), the sort of thing that might work with human beings.  Note how this fits inwith Baldi's idea that we are not who we think we are.  Indeed, we cannot really know who we are in a definitive sense.  We can only know that we are part of a larger process.<br />I might note that in this sense science and religion are in the process of merging.  Religion is the phenomenon of belief; science is the process of \\"knowing.\\"  At some point, off in the distance, there is a whole universe that invites belief without our having an ability to know.  This is where science and religion merge.ts in with Baldi's idea that we are not who we think we are.  Indeed, we cannot really know who we are in a definitive sense.

Well, actually, what wordsmith and cultural shock artist Eric Bogosian, who indeed does weld a mean pen, has in mind is something the other way around.  His novel first, a six-figure option next, and then the screen play (at ten grand per week), and finally an exploitive cinematic production for the grunge crowd.<br />He has served up, for our delectation, the following characters:<br />MAL, short for Malcolm, a kind of fat boy urban soldier of fortune on speed, who pops mom one (or two actually) in the head with his .22 before setting off for the mall with his real arsenal for further fun and games.<br />DONNA, a pleasingly plump bored housewife who has a gargantuan appetite for all things food and a whole bunch of things sex, the kind of extreme darling that empties a half gallon of ice cream while watching the first ten minutes of Jerry Springer  She wanders over to the mall to try on some threads and provide a peep show for<br />DANNY, a sexually confused, uptight yuppie who hasn't been in marital bliss for awhile--actually he hasn't been in marital bliss for so long that his doctor recommends...well, Amazon.com has a taboo against what he recommends, but perhaps you can guess.<br />JEFF, a counter-cultural mall groupie on an acid trip who's reads Steppenwolf (the book, not the band, duh) and imagines he will be a great writer some day, but right now he hasn't the time to actually DO any writing since he is finding himself and pursuing his need to hang with<br />ADELLE, a sweet young underprivileged thing with the pure heart of sadist who shows DANNY what it's like to feel helpless in handcuffs.<br />Etc.<br />The plot revolves around the central deed, performed by MAL just so he can REALLY FEEL ALIVE.  All the characters are like spokes in the wheel to this center that leads to the mall.  The prose is sound-bite smart and the chapters are short.  Bogosian's average word length is little more than four letters, while the pages practically turn themselves.<br />It would seem that there is little redemption here, but it all depends on who's doing the reading.  Bogosian does serve up some adolescent Zen-like philosophy that is sure to please any thirteen-year-old.  In fact, since I feel compelled to pan this opus, it will undoubtedly become a cult classic and the defining novel of a generation.<br />Well, maybe not.  Anyway, JEFF is the character Bogosian identifies with and he gets all the philosophic lines.  For example:<br />&quot;What difference does it make if I think or I don't think?  We're just these bags of flesh with sensors designed to make us think we're so precious.&quot; (p. 150)<br />&quot;This is a place I cannot escape--myself.

Why here and not someplace else?&quot; (p. 199)<br />&quot;Jeff was infected with a brain disease that forced him to try to make sense of his life.&quot; (p. 244)<br />Bottom line: this is an X-rated novel for young urban...philosophers.se is sound-bite smart and the chapters are short.

(Or is it the other way around?)  Is AIDS caused by HIV?  Is sun exposure beneficial?  Are low doses of nuclear radiation beneficial?  Does the sun have an unseen companion star, the so-called Nemesis hypothesis?  Do oil, gas and coal have abiogenetic origins?  Is time travel possible?  Do faster than light particles exist?  Is the Big Bang a cosmologist's fiction?<br />These are the nine &quot;crazy&quot; ideas George Mason University Professor of Physics Robert Ehrlich examines.  He rates the level of craziness of each idea by assigning zero to three &quot;cuckoos.&quot; (A fourth cuckoo, meaning &quot;certainly false&quot; is not used.)  Some of his conclusions might be surprising.  For example, he likes the idea that oil, coal and gas have abiogenetic origins, a view I like as well, but one that goes against the conventional wisdom.  He considers the idea that there was no Big Bang as &quot;crazy&quot;(a three cuckoo idea) as the idea that AIDS is not caused by HIV.<br />This certainly is a great idea for a book.  Unfortunately I think Ehrlich spends too much time on the fine points of statistical analysis, especially in the first four chapters, and not enough on the crazy ideas themselves.  For example on the possibility that low doses of radiation might be beneficial (Chapter 5) he gives us eleven graphs representing the data from various sources.  The graphs require a significant involvement and effort on the part of the reader to appreciate, as does the accompanying analysis.  If you are not familiar with statistical terms and ideas, this will be slow going.<br />At other times, Ehrlich seems unaware of what the reader would like to know.  For example, on page 86 he mentions a &quot;group of female workers&quot; who &quot;ingested radium while painting watch dials...when they put the small brushes in their mouths...to keep them pointed.&quot;  He goes on to note that the radiation they received was &quot;localized&quot; and therefore &quot;a number of them survived doses that on a whole-body basis would surely have been fatal.&quot;  However he doesn't say how many women were involved or even give a ballpark figure.  He doesn't say how those who did not die suffered.  He only shows a graph giving a percentage of workers who had tumors.<br />In one case, I think that Ehrlich got lost in the data and failed to note the obvious.  In the chapter on the possible benefits of sun exposure, he notes that the instance of coronary heart disease is less among people spending more rather than less time in the sun.  He concludes that the idea is not crazy (zero cuckoos).  I won't argue with that, but I suspect that the lower rates of coronary heart disease by those with more sun exposure is better understood as a result of those same people getting more exercise.  Just being out in the sun implies getting more exercise that staying indoors.  This is a factor that Ehrlich does not mention.  He talks about gardeners being out in the sun more than non-gardeners, but seems unaware that gardening is good exercise!<br />I am also troubled by any analysis of causation based purely on statistical models.  If the instance of lung cancer is twelve times higher among smokers than non-smokers, surely smoking is implicated.  However, as in the analysis of violent crime stats in areas with more guns versus areas with fewer (from Chapter Two), the differences are in the order of small percentages.  Putting aside statistical measurements of error, the fact is, as Ehrlich rightfully notes, there are so many other factors that are unaccounted for in such data that any conclusion must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt.<br />Ehrlich admits he has &quot;a strong affinity&quot; (p. 11) for one of the ideas, namely that particles exist that travel faster than the speed of light.  But I also think he has other biases that he may not be aware of.  His enthusiasm for the possibility of time travel to the past allows him to gloss over and downplay some of the problems.  For example on page 171 he notes that &quot;we can say for sure&quot; that &quot;backward time travel that allowed you to kill grandpa is impossible,&quot; but he fails to note that this same logic forbids the time traveler from doing anything at all, period.  The very physical presence of the time traveler would change something even if it's only at a microscopic level, even if it resulted only in microbial paradoxes!  Also, chaos theory's &quot;butterfly effect&quot; might flap its mighty wings, disturbing future events in incalculable ways.<br />When Ehrlich goes easy on the stats and concentrates on imparting information and explaining in denotative language, he does very well.  There is a lot of worthwhile and interesting information here for the general reader.  I learned, for example, that the orbit of a planet around a binary star is only stable if the planet is at a great distance from the orbiting stars, or if one of the stars is at a great distance from the planet orbiting the other star (p. 102).  Also the reason the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary is referred to as the &quot;K-T&quot; boundary and not the &quot;C-T&quot; is that &quot;C&quot; is already used for the Cambrian period (p. 104).<br />The latter chapters, especially the one on faster than light particles, were a little too technical for me.  I had the sense that Ehrlich was addressing his colleagues rather than the general reader.<br />This is an interesting book with some controversial conclusions that will be of interest to many people, marred by not being as readable or as accessible as it might have been.llows him to gloss over and downplay some of the problems.

1817279:US	49786731	R1ZQYRVSZDI42J	0805210318	766893593	Light on Yoga: The Bible of Modern Yoga	Books	5	478	493	N	N	Simply the best	This is the definitive text on hatha yoga.  This is the book you want if you are serious about beginning your yoga practice.  This is also a text of reference for professional teachers used throughout the world.  It is no exaggeration to say that all yoga instructors in the United States know this book, and most of them own a copy and refer to it regularly.<br /><br />Iyengar's text is characterized by a thoroughness of content, a detailed, precise, step-by-step \\"how to\\" for instruction in asana and pranayama.  There are 602 photos of Iyengar himself demonstrating the poses with extraordinary flexibility and precision.  I have an early, hardcover edition with the photos collected together at the back of the book.  The newer editions have the photos spaced appropriately throughout the text.<br /><br />The 34-page Introduction entitled, \\"What is Yoga?\\" is a concise overview of the nature, aim and extent of yoga as gleaned from the ancient texts, in particular Pantajali's Yoga Sutras, the Bhagavad Gita and Swatmarama's Hatha Yoga Pradipika (from which Iyengar gets his Sanskrit title, Yoga Dipika).  These are the three great texts of yoga and Iyengar knows them well.  This Introduction rewards patient study, and is the kind of pithy text that needs to be returned to again and again, and yet it is written in an accessible, inspired, and inspirational style.<br /><br />Iyengar emphasizes precision and careful technique and a whole body mindfulness as prerequisites to success in hatha yoga.  From my experience this mindfulness is absolutely essential for two main reasons.  One, you will surely strain or pull a muscle, usually several little ones, if your mind goes astray or if you practice with your attention elsewhere. Count on it.  Two, the full import and effect of asana cannot be appreciated, nor the psychological and spiritual lessons implicit within the practice be understood without a deep and continuous concentration--the mindfulness leading to meditation.<br /><br />The technical instruction of the poses includes some commentary on beneficial effects.  It should be noted that according to tradition there are 84,000 poses known (or perhaps the number is 840,000) of which about 84 are said to be necessary for health and the progression to samadhi.  It is also said traditionally that a cat was the first yoga teacher.  I want to note that only a gifted person with a natural suppleness can hope to master all the poses that Iyengar demonstrates.  So don't despair.  Most authorities will tell you that a dozen or so will suffice.<br /><br />Even though detailed instruction is given in only three pranayamas, the subject is nonetheless throughly introduced and explained in the twenty-five elegant and succinct pages that constitute Part III of this book.  Included and noteworthy is Iyengar's well-know warning: \\"Pneumatic tools can cut through the hardest rock.  In Pranayama the yogi uses his lungs as pneumatic tools.  If they are not used properly, they destroy both the tool and the person using it.\\"<br /><br />There are two appendices, one on \\"Asana Courses,\\" which may be useful for teachers or for those who like a highly structured approach.  The other is on the curative effects of asana for various disorders including arthritis, asthma, diabetes, flatulence, etc.  I take this second appendix with some reserve and note that a comprehensive study of the curative effects of asana awaits its great genius.  Nonetheless, the traditional experience, which Iyengar relies on, is part of the ancient practice of ayurvedic medicine, one of the great healing traditions of the world, and as such commands the highest respect.  Personally, it is obvious to me that certain asanas facilitate certain natural bodily processes, and it is well know that a concentration of attention and blood flow to an effected part of the body can assist the body's healing mechanisms.  Asana, properly understood in this context, is part of a maintenance program for a healthy body.<br /><br />Iyengar's is preeminently a practical approach seeped in the ancient traditions of India.  As such there is a distinctive, but unavoidable Hindu cast to his instruction.  (Separating yoga from Hinduism is like trying to unscramble an omelette.)  Nonetheless Iyengar strives for a universal approach and does an excellent job of achieving it.  Note this from the introduction: \\"Food, the supporting yet consuming substance of all life is regarded as a phase of Brahman.  It should be eaten with the feeling that with each morsel one can gain strength to serve the Lord...Whether or not to be a vegetarian is a purely personal matter as each person is influenced by the tradition and habits of the country in which he was born and bred.\\"<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"althy body.<br /><br />Iyengar's is preeminently a practical approach seeped in the ancient traditions of India.

The &quot;six figures&quot; of the title, despite the artwork on the cover, are not the members of the extended family (since there are nine of them, even ten, if you count the brother).  More likely the six figures are the dream of yearly income that signifies success in our society.<br />The central character is Warner Lutz, a thirty-something yuppie who manages a fund-raising non-profit organization (at about $30,000 a year) in Charlotte, North Carolina.  He is married to Megan, who tends a shop that sells art objects.  They have two children, Sophia, who is four, and Daniel, who is perhaps two.  At the crisis they are joined by Megan's mother, Nan, a high-powered business woman who does indeed command over six figures a year, Warner's mother, Ruth, a workaholic who doesn't entirely believe or trust her son, and her husband, Alan, who is fat and seventy and sleeps a lot.  There is also Nan's estranged husband and his wife (who really play no part in the story).<br />The central event of the novel occurs about halfway through.  It comes as a surprise, and therefore shouldn't be revealed here, and I won't.  I will say that Warner is accused and most everyone, including the police, believe he is guilty.  Leebron's narrative deliberately does not allow us to know.  Leebron wants to examine the event and its aftermath and how it effects the family regardless of whether Warner is guilty or not; indeed it is important that the truth not be known.  It appears that no one else could have done it, but it that proof?  Leebron hints at why Warner might have done it, but Warner says he is innocent.  He is not believed.  His life falls apart.<br />There is a long preparation for this central event in which the circumstances of the Lutz's are slowly revealed.  We experience the frustration of their careers, the demands of being working parents, the alienation that comes with being northerners in a southern town.  He is from Pennsylvania, nominally Jewish. Megan is a New Yorker.  Some events of the past are recalled and how they effect their lives at present and perhaps foreshadow events to come.  He comes under pressure because of a financial impropriety not of his doing.  Sophia has trouble at pre-school.  They don't feel they are making enough money.  And then the central event comes crashing down on them, perhaps putting their lives into perspective.<br />Leebron's style is a laudable attempt at a kind of realistic objectivity, an attitude toward his characters that is understanding, even forgiving, but without sentimentality.  His prose is for the most part without flourish, without mannerism, the &quot;invisible&quot; style of the writer who does not want to detract from his story.  The characterizations are vivid and, after a slow start, a fine tension is achieved that carries us to the conclusion.  This is an excellent work, marred slightly by an incidental quality as though a short story were being stretched into a novel.rtherners in a southern town.  He is from Pennsylvania, nominally Jewish.

Perhaps one might call it a fictionalized memoir.  In experience and scope it is a novel, that is, after one has read the lean 99 pages, one feels that one has experienced an entire life, such is the effect of Ernaux's distinctive prose.  She writes:  \\"I shall collate my father's words, tastes and mannerisms, as well as the main events of his life...No lyrical reminiscences, no triumphant displays of irony.  This neutral style of writing comes to me naturally.\\" (p. 13)<br />This book, and the companion volume, A Woman's Story, was a best seller in France and has become part of the national culture.  What Ernaux has done and does so well is to bring to vivid reality the mundane details of the small town life of twentieth century France.  Her style is deliberately \\"flat\\" without any striving for effect.  There is no satire, and as she intends, no irony, no higher view; indeed the nameless first person narrator, whom the reader must take as Ernaux herself, makes no effort to romanticize any aspect of her story including the part she herself plays.  She reveals herself as a creature of her culture and her class just as surely as her father was.<br />She is a secondary school teacher, apparently in her thirties, something of an incipient intellectual, with a two and a half year old son and a husband who also has nothing in common with her unschooled father.  The story begins when her father's death at age sixty-seven goads her into recalling his life and her relationship with him.  They are two people joined in blood but apart in both a social and a temporal sense.  And this distance is part of what she explores.  She speaks of something \\"indefinable,\\" that had come between them during her adolescence, \\"something to do with class...Like fractured love.\\"  Perhaps we might call it the alienation of generations.  He was proud of her because she was accepted by those who would not accept him.  She had risen from the working class to the middle class, just as he had risen above his father's station as an illiterate peasant.<br />There are some intriguing curiosities.  For one, the blurb identifies Ernaux as having grown up in the small town of Yvetot, while the narrative uses the quaint transparency \\"Y-\\" to identify the town, as though this were a roman a clef.  For another, there is a sense of something resembling warmth between her and her father, but no more than that, and this \\"distance\\" is never really accounted for except as some inexplicable fact of life.  Also, Ernaux's narrator thinks of herself as bourgeois and having risen above the station of her working class parents, yet they are totally bourgeois themselves; indeed more so that she, since they own their simple cafe and store and adjoining property in the small town, while she is the equivalent of a civil servant, her education paid for by the state so that she could be employed by the state.  This ingenuous self-revelation persuades us of her honesty and guilelessness and lends a queer sort of very deep veracity to her story.<br />I will not call this a masterpiece, although I think all writers of fiction ought to read it for the magic of its style.  She has quite a nice touch, without artificiality, without contrivance.<br />Tanya Leslie's translation of the French, often tested because of the large number of idioms used by Ernaux, is natural and very agreeable.would not accept him.

1831120:US	49786731	RYQRSAIDBEGOL	0375501290	928502416	The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World	Books	5	28	29	N	N	Soft-spoken, but packs a punch	Pollan makes the rather striking point in the Introduction that we and our domesticated plants are involved in a coevolutionary relationship.  We use them and they in turn use us.  The bumblebee thinks that he is the \\"subject in the garden and the bloom he's plundering for its drop of nectar\\" is the object.  \\"But we know that this is just a failure of his imagination.  The truth of the matter is that the flower has cleverly manipulated the bee into hauling its pollen from blossom to blossom.\\" (p. xiv)<br />And so it is with us.  There is no subject and no object.  The grammar is all wrong.  We plant and disperse the apple, thinking we act from our volition, yet from the apple's point of view, it has enticed us through its bribe of sweetness to further its propagation.  It has played upon our desire.  The same can be said of every other plant \\"domesticated\\" by humans.  As Pollan points out, from a larger point of view our farms and gardens are just another part of the \\"wild\\" environment.  And we, too, are part of that environment--increasingly a most significant part.  The plants, and of course the cows, the ants, the roaches, the dogs and the cats, adjust to the environment, or they don't.  The ones that do will flourish.  Those that don't, the mighty oak, perhaps, the hard wood trees of equatorial jungles, the tigers and the condor, that cannot, will go the way of the dodo.<br />This idea is not original with Pollan, of course, but nowhere have I seen it presented so convincingly.  In a sense we are not the doer, we are the done.  Pollan illustrates his thesis in four chapters on the apple, the tulip, cannabis, and the potato.<br />In the chapter on tulips and the tulip mania we learn that we are probably hard-wired to love flowers.  Why?  Because \\"the presence of flowers...is a reliable predictor of future food.\\" (p. 68)  We love what is good for us.  We find beauty in that which nourishes.  Pollan adds that \\"recognizing and recalling flowers helps a forager get to the fruit [that is to come] first.\\"  (p. 68)  I might add that our love for little animals is both in their resemblance to our children and (hidden from our consciousness) their potential nutritional value in a time of famine. One might watch on PBS's Nature series to see how lovingly the big cat doth lick its prey.<br />In the chapter on marijuana Pollan admits to growing the noxious weed in his garden among the potatoes andthe tulips, but incurs paranoia since such horticulture is against the law.  He points with restraint to the absurdity of the anti-marijuana laws, to the unconstitutional seizure of property by the marijuana police, etc., but one senses that he's pulling his punches.  Or perhaps he feels that something is gained by using a quiet voice.  He goes to Amsterdam and finds out just how potent the new marijuana has become.  He views an indoor marijuana grow room and sees how sinsemilla is produced while noting that cannabis has become America's number one cash crop. (p. 130).  He also notes that \\"the rapid emergence of a domestic marijuana industry represents a triumph of protectionism\\" (p. 131).  Yes, Virginia, the drug war is artificially supporting the high price of marijuana and protecting domestic \\"farmers\\" from foreign competition.<br />The chapter on the apple concentrates on the life and career of John Chapman, AKA Johnny Appleseed, in which Pollan transforms the Disney-ish Christianized American folk hero into \\"the American Dionysus.\\"  The reason?  The apple seeds that Chapman dispersed grew not into Red Delicious apples or Macintoshes but into scrawny little things, mostly too bitter to eat that were made into hard cider, which contained about three percent alcohol, the drink of default for the pioneers.  They loved him for it, and occasionally there did indeed grow out of the cider orchards a tree or two that brought forth fruit that could be eaten with pleasure, and made into pies and butter....<br />The final chapter on the potato has Pollan planting Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potato, a potato that produces its own insecticide as part of the potato itself by using a gene borrowed from a common bacterium found in the soil.  Pollan weighs the significance of this while recalling the history of the potato from its origins in the Andes through its economic effect on Europe, and especially Ireland, to its status today.  He comes out strongly against monoculture and in favor of biodiversity.  He reports on Monsanto's infamous \\"Terminator\\" technology, genetic alteration of plants so that their seeds are sterile, requiring the farmer to become dependent upon Monsanto for seed, a technology that Monsanto \\"has forsworn\\" following \\"an international barrage of criticism.\\" (p. 233)<br />This a very pretty book written in an understated style about how we deceive ourselves, how we fail to see the world as it really is; how we see the world from a singular and restricted point of view, we as subject and actor, the rest of the environment as acted upon, when in truth, we are just part of the larger ecology, part of the process.  We are creatures that kid ourselves to make more palpable our morally ambiguous behavior.<br />My favorite insight of many in the book comes from page 247 where Pollan, in recalling the brilliant time-lapse photography from David Attenborough's PBS series, \\"The Private Life of Plants,\\" observes,  \\"...our sense of plants as passive objects is a failure of imagination, rooted in the fact that plants occupy what amounts to a different dimension.\\"llan planting Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potato, a potato that produces its own insecticide as part of the potato itself by using a gene borrowed from a common bacterium found in the soil.

The vast majority of people in prison are males.  One of the reasons is they have more testosterone pumping through their veins than women.  Testosterone makes people take chances.  It makes them more interested in sex and more aggressive.  It makes them into &quot;heroes, rogues and lovers,&quot; to quote the title of this interesting book.  Testosterone tends to affect low socioeconomic status males more than high status males, and the effects of testosterone can be mitigated by learning.  Women also produce testosterone, but at lower levels than men; however, what they do produce affects them more.  Women are attracted to high testosterone males, but do not necessarily marry them.  Women select males and thereby create the males that exist.  We inherit our testosterone levels, and testosterone comes before rambunctiousness, not the other way around.  (This last from pages 87-88.)<br />These are some of the facts gleaned from the research of Professor Dabbs, who is the head of the Social/Cognitive Psychology Program at Georgia State University.  This book is a report on that research presented with examples, allusions and references to literature and the popular culture, leading to an easy read.  Dabbs, along with his collaborator, his wife, Mary, &quot;a former publicist with several feminist organizations,&quot; allows us to see the world through testosterone-shaded glasses, but without prejudice.  Their report is balanced and fair.  They give us the downside of testosterone and the upside, as implied in their title.  The fact that theirs is the first popular full-length book (that I know of) devoted exclusively to the phenomenon of testosterone is the result of fairly recent technology that allows the measurement of testosterone levels from saliva samples.  Previously, blood had to be used.  Since most people are more willing to spit than to allow blood to be taken from their bodies, this technique opened up new possibilities for research, and Dabbs, who apparently has a fair amount of testosterone still pumping through his veins, got there first.<br />There are charts and graphs showing testosterone levels by occupation.  Construction workers, actors, football players, con men (!), blue collar workers, etc., predicably are high in testosterone while clerical workers and clerics, counselors and farmers, etc., are low.  Lawyers tend to be high, with trial lawyers and especially flamboyant defense lawyers the highest, with research lawyers the lowest.  Relatively high testosterone levels correlate with masculine traits such as muscle strength, spatial ability, narrow-focused thinking, combativeness, while lower levels correlate with feminine traits such as sociability, more generalized thinking, verbal ability, cooperation, etc.  Men tend to leap to action, while women tend to think about it first.  Higher testosterone does not correlate with high economic status since our society rewards thoughtfulness, patience, and cooperation as well as hard work and being assertive.  High testosterone males die younger but have more sex.  This too is a predicable finding since it is a type of evolutionary strategy.  Testosterone, in fact, might be seen as the chemical form of aggressiveness.  Aggressiveness is getting there first with the most.  It's a kind of strategy that often works.  But there are problems as well as rewards in aggressiveness.  First, it's costly; you use more energy.  Second, you're not as sure in your actions so you make more mistakes, which is dangerous  Third, you incite aggressiveness on the part of others, and that too can be dangerous.  Fourth, sometimes getting there first may lead to no advantage.  Finally, you can be only so aggressive. Aggressiveness leads to an &quot;arms war.&quot;  If aggressiveness is rewarded--and it is in a passive world--then everybody tends to become more aggressive until nobody has an advantage; in fact the passive now have the advantage because they live longer, etc., leading to the selection of more passive creatures, creating an environment effectively exploited by the more aggressive, leading to...the arms race cycle.<br />Some interesting quotes from the text:<br />&quot;Wife abuse&quot; tends to increase &quot;in the Washington, D.C., area after the Redskins win their football games.&quot;  (p. 92)<br />&quot;To some men, a good relationship allows them to strut while their wives admire them.&quot; (p. 111)<br />&quot;...[W]omen know in their secret hearts that men who won't kill for them are useless.&quot; (p. 61.

1838994:US	49786731	R2ES1R7Z732XGT	0517884313	925861964	The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga	Books	5	114	116	N	N	One of the best popular books on yoga	This book was my first yoga book; as such it is close to my heart.  I read it (in another edition) in 1974 and used it as a guide to my practice for many years thereafter.  It is not, of course, \\"complete.\\"  No \\"complete book of\\" ever is.  That is a publisher's fiction.  It is however, very thorough in presenting the yoga of Patanjali and the classical Hatha Yoga Pradipika to the English speaking reader.  Much of the book is devoted to asana, highlighted by 146 photos of demonstration by an unidentified young man, who is as good as, if not better than (if that is possible), the accomplished and illustrious B. K. S. Iyengar in showing the sort of suppleness and precision that can achieved.  The photos really are extraordinary.  (As noted in a comment to this review by \\"louisnapoli\\" the person doing the asanas is a young Vishnu-devananda.) There is an excellent and lengthy chapter on pranayama and several on the philosophy and spiritual aspects of yoga.  Consequently this goes beyond hatha yoga and becomes a treatise on raja yoga, the so-called \\"king's yoga\\" or \\"ashtanga yoga,\\" or \\"eight-limbed\\" yoga--the yoga codified and outlined by Patanjali about eighteen hundred years ago.  Raja yoga, which is a continuation of hatha yoga, is to be distinguished from the three other yogas of the ancients, karma yoga, bhakti yoga, and jnana yoga, respectively the yogas of selfless action, devotion, and knowledge. (There is also tantric yoga, the so-called \\"left-handed path,\\" the beginnings of which are lost in antiquity.  Following the example of the Bhagavad Gita, tantric yoga is not mentioned in this book.)  Raja yoga is sometimes called \\"the science of mental control,\\" as it is here on page 220.<br /><br />There are many experts on asana; and there are many academics whose knowledge of yoga and yoga culture is extensive.  But there are few public teachers of yoga who have mastered all aspects of yoga and can be said to be truly accomplished.  Vishnu-devananda is one of them, that is clear from this book.  B. K. S. Iyengar is another.  I have read nearly a hundred books on yoga in English, and I would not be able to identify more than a handful of other authors as \\"siddhas,\\" or \\"accomplished ones.\\"  Usually, a yogi who realizes samadhi ceases to be a public person.  It is only the few--perhaps taking their inspiration from the Buddha, who returned from bliss to instruct humankind--that actually take the trouble to write books.  I believe that Vishnu-devananda may be one of them.  Certainly the knowledge and wisdom emanating from these pages suggests as much.  Incidentally, \\"Vishnu\\" is one of the deities of Hinduism (\\"the Preserver\\"); a \\"deva\\" is a personal divine (such as Krishna, a manifestation of Vishnu); and \\"ananda\\" is bliss itself.<br /><br />Yoga, fully realized, is a mystical and religious practice--be sure and understand that it is a practice: mere knowledge will not be efficacious.  Its ultimate purpose is the realization of the Absolute, or to be joined with the Ineffable, or to live continually in the state of samadhi (three ways of saying what is essentially the same thing).  Nonetheless, physical health and well-being can be gotten along the way (indeed they are prerequisites to samadhi), and sufficient in themselves as reasons for taking up the practice.<br /><br />One of the auxiliary strengths of this book is in its presentation of the Vedic and Hindu viewpoint through the study and practice of yoga.  Swami Vishnu-devananda reveals himself here as an accomplished jnana yogi as well as a master of raja yoga.  While I do not agree with everything written here, and could easily point to some exaggerations (hyperbole, of course, is part of the tradition of yogic literature, fulfilling an \\"intentional\\" purpose) as well as to some ideas that are perhaps more central to Hinduism than to yoga itself, I nonetheless believe that what Vishnu-devananda writes is wise and measured and worth careful study.  I don't think one can reallyunderstand yoga or appreciate its place in our world without not only a long practice but also a concomitant study of its origins and historical development in the Hindu, Buddhist, Tantric, Jainist and other traditions.

We don't know.  What is the cure?  There is no cure.<br />Is this the price we pay for the guilt we feel for never being man enough?  How is it that we fail in the midst of success?  We are sick, but what is the disease?  What is the diagnosis?  Where is the pain?  It is not physical.  We feel it in our minds and in our souls.  We are tired, weary.  We know the prognosis--it is death, of course--but what is the cause?<br />In this tortured com&eacute;die noire, Professsor Alan Lightman gives us his vision of the materialistic horror that is our lives, the information and subsistence overload that is suffocating us to death.  Bill Chalmers, second level management cog, begins to unravel.  First his memory goes, and then is recovered, but then the numbness sets in, in his fingers, his legs.  And it advances.  We watch as he fills up with bile, bile, everything is bile.<br />We are angry, but like Bill Chalmers we cannot lash out.  We are married to the corporation, as Chalmers is to Plymouth where he &quot;processes information.&quot;  We do not learn that he does anything more specific.  It doesn't matter what the information is.  He processes it.  The company's motto is &quot;The maximum information in the minimum time.&quot;  The vagueness of the content of their information mirrors the emptiness of our lives.  More information for what?  Faster for what?  To what end?  We do not know.<br />The doctors, who would diagnosis us, Lightman assures us, are like gleeful clowns in their vast ignorance, playing with their high tech toys, a cyclotron for PET scans, a &quot;cell separator...like a portable washing machine...,&quot; spinning dials and writing articles for the Annals of Psychosomatic Disease, comparing notes with colleagues over the Internet, by cell phone.  Meanwhile the patient is but a curiosity, a subject for examination and study.<br />Lightman uses the empty dialogue of our lives for comedic effect.  We say nothing to one another and we answer with nothing, although sometimes we cry out, and life goes on.  Chalmers's wife is numbing herself with alcohol while she conducts a bloodless affair by e-mail.  Like Chalmers and his wife, we are estranged from life itself.  &quot;He hated the mall the same way he hated himself, except that he hated himself more because he was a part of the mall and he knew it&quot; (pp. 343-344).  Yes, the mall and our vast hunger to consume are symptoms of our disease.<br />Chalmers is angry (as his shrink Dr. Kripke so astutely discerns, although that is all he discerns).  Chalmers cries out in his mind: &quot;I'm going to break every machine on this planet...I'm going to rip the phones out of the wall&quot; (p. 303, no exclamation marks).  But he never has and he never will, and that is &quot;the problem&quot; that has become &quot;an illness.&quot;<br />How real is Lightman's &quot;diagnosis&quot; of our society?  Consider this, the fastest growing class of disease in this country is autoimmune disease, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome,  fibromyalgia, etc., diseases of unclear cause in which the body is apparently assaulting itself.  (Compare Lightman's delineation on  p. 274).<br />Juxtaposed among the pages is a tale of the last days of Socrates and of one of the men who condemned him.  Somehow Anytus, the ancient Greek, and Chalmers, the American, are brothers in their strange failure amid the trappings of worldly success.  Anytus killed Socrates, the flower of Grecian civilization.  Chalmers is killing himself.  Why?  Again, they do not know.  We have a stupendous wealth of information, but all of it is useless, as Mrs. Stumm, the wife of one of the information executives, tells Chalmers as she waves a hand at a stack of papers, &quot;What is this crap?...Useless.  This stuff is useless.&quot; (p. 255).  She speaks the truth, but they cannot hear it.<br />Lightman's art owes something to the imagination of Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun, in the latter chapters, and something to the spirit of Joseph Heller's Catch-22 throughout.  There are shades and echos of the black humor of Evelyn Waugh and Nathanael West.  This is a fine novel with a strong sense of the spiritual emptiness of our corporate existence.  One senses that Lightman feels that in love there is a flicker of hope, but that is all.  The mind goes, like the mind of Chalmers's mother, and with it, the possibility of love.  Or perhaps there is a moment of redemption in the intense experience of the minutia of our lives, as when Chalmers studies and lovingly draws the leaf he sees outside his bedroom window.<br />Only this and nothing more interrupts the bleak and lonely landscape of Lightman's vision.nation of Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun, in the latter chapters, and something to the spirit of Joseph Heller's Catch-22 throughout.

He has studied botany and medicine in the Amazon jungle and elsewhere, and alternative medicine in the far east before establishing his practice in the United States.  This book, first published in 1995, is the result of what Weil has learned over the years.  There is nothing spectacularly new here, but there is a carefully presented, enormously compelling argument for the power of our bodies to heal themselves if only we would give them the opportunity.<br /><br />Problem number one is a medical establishment that sees its interventions as the cause of healing, when it occurs, and the failure of the body, when it does not.  Every physician should humbly realize that it is the healing mechanisms of the body that defeat disease, not the treatment.  Weil makes this point even in the case of antibiotics: \\"Antibiotics reduce numbers of invading germs to a point where the immune system can take over and finish the job.  The real cause of the cure is the immune system, which may be unable to end an infection because it is overwhelmed by sheer numbers of bacteria and\\" their toxic products (p. 110).  I would add that even in the case of setting a bone or removing a bullet, it is the body that does the healing.  Properly understood, Weil advises, the function of the physician is to aid the defenses of the body.  This is how medicine is understood in cultures of ancient linage around the world, particularly in the time-honored Chinese and Ayurvedic systems.  There is much we could learn from them.  The tech-heavy Western approach fails to treat the whole patient--mind, body, emotions and spirit--and therefore has great difficulty in dealing with chronic illnesses.  Weil emphasizes prevention, and when illness does occur, the cultivation of habits and a lifestyle conducive to spontaneous healing.<br /><br />Included in the text are a number of testimonials of spontaneous healing from people given up on by conventional medicine.  Dr. Weil is fascinated by these \\"anecdotal\\" cases and believes that the medical establishment is missing something by dismissing them because they cannot be scientifically validated.  Weil counts heads and comes to the obvious conclusion that something is going on here, whether it can be baselined and graphed or not.  People do indeed get well for no apparent reason.  There are literately thousands of documented cases.  How does this happen?  Weil calls it the phenomenon of \\"spontaneous healing,\\" and believes that we are all capable of performing this \\"miracle.\\"  Personally, it happened to me (if you'll forgive the Yogi Berra-ism) at my daughter's wedding.  I had strained the instep of my right foot playing basketball and it would not heal.  Weeks went by.  I either could not stay off it enough and/or I was re-injuring it to the point where I could not walk without pain.  A friend and I walked around the Stanford campus during the day, which I should not have done.  The pain was very annoying, but in the evening, fortified with the festive occasion and the refreshments, I danced wildly, joyously, one might say, ignoring the pain, realizing that I would pay for it the next day.  But in the morning when I woke up there was no pain at all, and although it has been almost ten years, the pain has never returned.<br /><br />Not exactly a miracle, but proof enough to me that spontaneous healing is a reality.<br /><br />What Dr. Weil does here, relying on his wisdom and experience, is to present a program of right practice, right habit, right diet, and right attitude (e.g., \\"Regard illness as a gift...a powerful stimulus to change...[an] opportunity...for personal growth and development...\\" p. 251) that will, he believes, greatly increase anyone's chance of healing spontaneously.  (Chapter 17, \\"Seven Strategies of Successful Patients\\" is a precise prescription.)  I think he makes a cogent and compelling case.  And, as usual, his felicity of expression, almost meditative in tone and effect, is a huge plus.  Weil has a gift for making the spiritual and mysterious aspects of our existence seem the very bedrock of rationality!  Noteworthy is a chapter on \\"Medical Pessimism\\" in which Weil argues that conventional doctors consciously or unconsciously infect their patients with a reverse placebo with their negative attitudes.  \\"Simply put: too many doctors are deeply pessimistic about the possibility of people getting better, and they communicate their pessimism to patients and families\\" (P. 59).  He calls this \\"medical hexing\\" (p. 64).  He adds, on page 61, \\"So-called voodoo death is the ultimate example of a negative placebo response.\\"<br /><br />Weil believes that the pessimism of the medical profession has its roots in \\"the lopsided nature of medical education, which focuses almost exclusively on disease and its treatment rather than on health and its maintenance...the word &lt;healing> is used rarely...the term &lt;healing system> not at all.\\"<br /><br />This last point, I believe, points directly to what is the central problem with conventional medicine in this country.  Medical schools are too exclusive and expensive, preventing many people who would truly love to help others from attending.  Their programs are also flawed because of a too narrowly focused curriculum that ignores the thousands of years of experience of practitioners from around the world.  The emphasis is on the exclusivity and status of the profession and not on the healing arts.  Dr. Weil, because he is a rare product of that system, is a man especially to be listened to.  I consider this book a \\"quiet classic\\" that someday will be recognized as a catalyst that helped revolutionize conventional medical practice.  At least I hope so.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\") that will, he believes, greatly increase anyone's chance of healing spontaneously.

1849648:US	49786731	R2PMXJ272W37OJ	0452282152	858318999	Girl with a Pearl Earring: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A romantic historical novel of grace and power	In this radiant novel we are introduced to the minutia of family life in 17th century Holland as seen through the eyes of the maid Griet, a sixteen-year-old girl who became the subject of a famous painting by Johannes Vermeer.  This is in fact the story of how she became his subject.  As such it is a fiction fused into history, an imagination of Vermeer and the life of one of his models.  It is a tale that makes us see with alacrity the poverty of choices that a girl without means had in that world, a world caught between feudalism and the rise of the mercantile class.  Indeed, Griet had only her cleverness to stay her as she maneuvered among the men and women of privilege who would control her life.<br />Novelist Tracy Chevalier has a gift for expression and a great talent for telling a tale and weaving into the fabric of her story the poignant details of everyday life.  Somehow she makes those details and the acting out of the petty politics of domestic life utterly enthralling.  Her first-person narrative of an illiterate girl charms and disquiets by turns.  Although this may seem a far-fetched comparison, I was reminded of Mark Twain's Huck Finn, also illiterate, who nonetheless waxed poetic with not just a novelist's but a painter's eye for detail.  The words they use are everyday words, but spun out so beautifully, so aptly that they become something close to poetry, all the while maintaining plausibility.  In truth no maid nor elegant lady of learning could express herself so well as this girl, but that is the novelist's license, and Chevalier uses it well.<br />Griet has these choices: a butcher's son with blood under his fingernails; Vermeer, who has a wife and five children (and a sixth on the way); and van Ruijven, Vermeer's rich and lecherous patron, who also has a family.  She cannot move to another city, although sometimes she vaguely expresses this childish dream.  She, like the vast majority of humankind before the Industrial Revolution, was fated to live and die in the town of her birth.  Her life was controlled by the choices she had in men; and what would become of her depended on how she handled those choices.  She could not take a job and live alone.  She could not abandon her poverty-stricken parents.  She could only steer between the rocks and the shoreline, torn between her heart's desire and her good Dutch rationality.  Thus, on one level, this is a disturbing tale of how people, especially women, were subject to the dictates of property and privilege, without real choice, working six days a week, from sunup to sundown, for subsistence wages in economic subservience to the privileged few.  On another level this a Horatio Alger story of how one might, through hard work, right morality, a bit of clever common sense and--in this case--a pretty face, rise above one's predicament in life.  Or, perhaps how one might try.  This is also a tale of how our emotions lead us to ends both desirous and disastrous.  Griet loves her master, as all good maids should, almost inevitably.  Hers is a restrained and protracted love, beyond her control, so that she is caught.  In this sense Chevalier's book is a romantic novel, a woman's interest tale of how the heart's desire may or may not be fulfilled.  The beloved is a station above Griet; he is an accomplished artist, and he is taken--consumed in a sense--with his work and his large family, and yet she, as her brother points out, &quot;wants him.&quot;<br />One of the nice things about this book is the reproduction of the celebrated Vermeer painting, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; on the cover.  As one reads, one can easily refer to the painting again and again; and this is valuable because part of Chevalier's story is an imagination of how the work was painted through an intense study of the painting itself.  Those in the visual arts I imagine will find this part of the novel fascinating, and may speculate on how closely Chevalier came to a truth about the process of artistic creation.  Chevalier's interpretation includes the idea that the painting was the artist's way of making love to the girl.  There can be no doubt of that.<br />I wish I could write with such grace and with such a feel for the felicitous detail and the absolutely apt phrase that is the hallmark of Chevalier's prose.  I also wish I had the cunning to construct a novel so carefully.  I knew I was in the thrall of a master as early as page nine when Griet learns that she is to clean Vermeer's studio without disturbing anything so that every object is returned to exactly where it had been.  Chevalier has Griet remark: &quot;After my father's accident we had learned to place things where he always knew to find them.  It was one thing to do this for a blind man, though.  Quite another for a man with a painter's eyes.&quot;  Or, on page 163, Griet is home visiting her mother, and a &quot;neighbor, a bright-eyed old woman who loved market talk,&quot; was there amid the rumors that Griet would appear in a painting alongside the lecherous van Ruijven.  Griet tells her mother, &quot;my master is beginning the painting that you were asking about.  Van Ruijven has come over...Everyone who is to be in the painting is there now.&quot;  Griet then observes that the gossipy neighbor &quot;gazed at me as if I had just set a roast capon in front of her.&quot;  Griet adds, &quot;That will take care of the rumors.&quot;<br />Such skilled and subtle writing moves the reader along with a sense of deep involvement, and opens wide the eyes of other writers, who might learn from the very accomplished and gifted Tracy Chevalier.cess of artistic creation.

1859070:US	49786731	RCEJH8EO5S0HW	0060194375	403232832	Murder In Spokane: Catching a Serial Killer	Books	3	15	16	N	N	Good read, but not entirely fair or complete	This book is interesting because it allows us some further insight into the personality of Mark Fuhrman, one time LAPD detective, and fall guy for the prosecution in the O. J. Simpson debacle. It is interesting to see how Fuhrman's loyalties and perspective have changed from the siege mentality of a beleaguered cop to the free and easy skepticism of a freelance journalist. One thing is clear: he has extended his fifteen minutes of fame by becoming a writer of true crime tales destined for the best seller list. This is his third. I didn't read Murder in Brentwood (1997), having had my fill of the Simpson tragedy, but I did read Murder in Greenwich (1998) and it wasn't bad. This is an even better book, more skillfully written, about murders committed by Robert Lee Yates Jr., a sickie who might be dubbed the \\"Ordinary Joe\\" of serial killers, if one can ever say that a serial killer is ordinary.<br /><br /> This is also interesting from the point of view of an ex-detective from the big city, trying to have some significant impact on a sensational case. Fuhrman and his buddy, Spokane radio talk show host, Mike Fitzsimmons, provide us with some insight into what it's like playing detective in their spare time while second guessing the police on a weekly basis over the radio. Fuhrman insists that he's still a cop at heart, but don't tell that to the Spokane police (or to the cops in Greenwich, Connecticut either). Regardless, his critique of the way the Spokane police handled this string of murders is well worth reading. His main point is that faulty police work allowed Yates to remain free long after they should have had the goods on him. As Fuhrman puts it, \\"The task force was supposed to be chasing a killer. Instead they became file clerks\\" as they \\"relied on blood tests and databases to do their work for them\\" (p. 259). By the time they figured out who the murderer was, a man right under their nose, \\"They had already wasted two years, and watched ten women die,\\" women that Fuhrman insists would not have been killed had the police done their job. \\"Whether it was laziness, incompetence, or just simple human error, the task force could have caught Yates back in September 1997\\" (p. 239). As it actually happened, Yates was not arrested until April 18, 2000.<br /><br /> Fuhrman believes that the police department's failure to give information to the public about the crimes was one of the reasons the killer stayed at large. Fuhrman argues strongly that the more information about the killings that the police put out on the street, the better the chances are that somebody will step forward with something that will help them catch the killer. This is the clear public service message of this book. All the material about police errors and misdirections and butt guarding are important for the public to know, but are nothing new. To rake the cops over the coals because they COULD have caught the killer sooner serves a public purpose, but it is a small one. Police work, as Fuhrman knows, is not an exact science, and mistakes, sometimes tragic, will be made.<br /><br /> Fuhrman implies (e.g., quoting Fitzsimmons on pages 69 and 70, but denies it himself when on the radio, page 125) that the reason the police did not put more energy into finding the killer was the fact that he was only killing prostitutes and drug addicts. Again, it's hard to doubt that there is an element of truth to this accusation. Imagine if the daughters of the landed gentry of Spokane were the victims. I think every resource of city, county, state and the FBI would have been summoned, and no crime scene would have been left unprocessed until tomorrow. (Crime scenes left unprocessed overnight was one of Fuhrman's pet peeves. Several times the Spokane police just cordoned off the crime scene and went home to dinner and a night's rest before finishing the job.)<br /><br /> For those readers looking for information about the serial killer himself and insights into his behaviorand what might have made him the sexual psychopath that he is, this book will be a disappointment. Fuhrman isn't interested in Yates's motives. While his identify was unknown and Fuhrman and Fitzsimmons were speculating on the air what he might be like, Fuhrman's interest was understandably high. Fuhrman played the profiler game and put his head into the mind of the killer and came up with the idea that this guy was fairly sophisticated. \\"This guy is definitely an organized murderer...This is a streetwise guy. You've got to show this guy a little respect for the way he comes in, commits the crime, slips out, and nobody knows the wiser...I see this guy as being very organized, fairly intelligent...Clever, cunning.\\" (pp. 93-94). When it turns out that, except for the killings, he is an average sort of joe, Fuhrman was clearly disappointed. \\"The fact that he was so ordinary only made me wonder why they hadn't caught him a long time ago\\" (p. 232).<br /><br /> There is plenty of the well known Fuhrman arrogance here. He's clearly the star of this book, even though he was on the periphery of the case. His knowledge of police procedures and in-station politics is a plus. He's able to see through the press releases and the public posturing to what is really going on in the police and sheriff's departments. The fact that he points out how the case could have been solved sooner is also a plus, and a huge embarrassment for Spokane law enforcement.

Fuhrman isn't interested in Yates's motives. While his identify was unknown and Fuhrman and Fitzsimmons were speculating on the air what he might be like, Fuhrman's interest was understandably high. Fuhrman played the profiler game and put his head into the mind of the killer and came up with the idea that this guy was fairly sophisticated. \\"This guy is definitely an organized murderer...This is a streetwise guy. You've got to show this guy a little respect for the way he comes in, commits the crime, slips out, and nobody knows the wiser...I see this guy as being very organized, fairly intelligent...Clever, cunning.\\" (pp. 93-94). When it turns out that, except for the killings, he is an average sort of joe, Fuhrman was clearly disappointed. \\"The fact that he was so ordinary only made me wonder why they hadn't caught him a long time ago\\" (p. 232).<br /><br /> There is plenty of the well known Fuhrman arrogance here. He's clearly the star of this book, even though he was on the periphery of the case. His knowledge of police procedures and in-station politics is a plus. He's able to see through the press releases and the public posturing to what is really going on in the police and sheriff's departments. The fact that he points out how the case could have been solved sooner is also a plus, and a huge embarrassment for Spokane law enforcement.

Iyengar achieved an international reputation with the publication of his classic Light on Yoga in 1966, which today stands as the definitive work on hatha yoga, a work made distinctive not only by the 602 photographs of Iyengar himself demonstrating the various poses, but by the detailed manner in which they are explained. He was then 38-years-old. Since then he has written several other books on yoga and lectured widely while continuing his teaching practice. He is today recognized as one the greatest of all yoga teachers.<br /><br />In this book, editor Daniel Rivers-Moore has taken it upon himself to construct a narrative by Iyengar, gleaned from lectures given by the master in Europe and India during the nineteen-eighties. Rivers-Moore has done an admirable job of bringing the voice of Iyengar to the many readers who have not had the opportunity to hear him speak. The continuity of expression is maintained throughout, and the book reads as though Iyengar wrote it himself.<br /><br />One sees that Iyengar is speaking to teachers of yoga as well as students. The extended metaphor of yoga as a tree is an apt one since when our practice is strong we are like a tree, solid and unshaken by the vicissitudes of life. But it is only a metaphor, one of many used by Iyengar in his teaching practice. His metaphor is not related to what is one of the most profound metaphorical images in yoga, that of the tree upside down with its branches in the earth and its roots exposed to the sun. It is said that this is the way we will see the world after becoming firmly established in yoga. Much of what we once believed (as children and young adults), we will now disbelieve and embrace the very opposite.<br /><br />The value of asana, pranayama, and meditation in preventing disease and maintaining health has been established beyond doubt, and is one of the great boons humankind has gotten from yoga, and is under no circumstances to be underestimated. However, I took Iyengar's prescriptions for the further medicinal value of yoga with the proverbial grain of salt, just as I take the ancient claims of superpowers developed through the practice of yoga. His is a way of speaking that is native to India and has a long and honored tradition in the literature. One recalls the miraculous claims of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika of Svatmarama and the Siva Samhita, in which all disease is cured, and understands that the authors are speaking in a symbolic and intentional manner.  What is most interesting and valuable in this book are the chapters on meditation and pranayama, and on the advice and warnings that Iyengar extends to teachers of yoga.<br /><br />Iyengar's yoga is the yoga of Patanjali, whom he reveres as \\"the noblest of sages.\\" It is a yoga of discipline and dedication, a yoga of power and grace developed over at least several thousand years of practice. Of the four traditional yogas of India--bhakti, jnana, and karma--it is perhaps the oldest. It is certainly the one with the widest international application since it melds well into any and every way of life, from the monastery to the streets of the city.<br /><br />Iyengar has been described by some as a teacher of physical yoga only--an unfair description that he recalls and rejects in two different places in this book. On the contrary he demonstrates here that he is also a master of raja yoga, and in particular a man who understands that the prerequisites of hatha yoga are essential to the achievement of samadhi.<br /><br />Those who are familiar with Light on Yoga and Iyengar's other works, will find this volume a fine addition to their library and of value because of the light it sheds on the personality and understanding of one of the great teachers of the ancient art of yoga.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"prescriptions for the further medicinal value of yoga with the proverbial grain of salt, just as I take the ancient claims of superpowers developed through the practice of yoga.

World class poet W. B. Yeats, working with Vedic scholar Sri Swami Purohit, retired to Majorca away from the war clouds gathering over Europe in the thirties with the intent of making \\"a translation that would read as though the original had been written in common English\\" (p. 8).  Here's an exchange between the boy Nachiketas and Death from the Katha Upanishad that gives a sense of just how well Yeats and Purohit succeeded:<br /><br />Nachiketas said: \\"Some say that when man dies he continues to exist, others that he does not.  Explain, and that shall be my third gift.\\"<br /><br />Death said: \\"This question has been discussed by the gods, it is deep and difficult.  Choose another gift, Nachiketas!  Do not be hard.  Do not compel me to explain.\\"<br /><br />It is from the Upanishads that the Bhagavad Gita finds its inspiration.  One can see immediately in this short exchange the seed from which the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna grew.  Indeed it is from the Upanishads that the central doctrines of Hinduism are derived, and the philosophy of yoga, and even that of Buddhism.  As such the Upanishads, despite their repetition and extraneous material, constitute one of the great spiritual works of humankind.  What Yeats and Purohit have done here, in contradistinction to other translations that I have read, is to make the work intelligible, accessible and a pleasure to read.  To do this, it is true they have trimmed; and they have drifted in parts from a strictly literal translation, preferring instead to emphasize the spirit and the essence of the Upanishads.  Consequently, for the scholar this is not the best translation.  But for those who want the feel and the heart of the Upanishads without the ritualistic circumlocutions or much of the repetition, this is an idea translation.  Through the poetic use of words, incorporating the magic of sound and rhythm in judicious repetition, Yeats and Purohit are able to preserve the oral formulaic expression of the Upanishads, and bring the sense of their power to the modern English speaker.  This is an outstanding achievement.  Here is the refrain that ends this beautiful translation:<br /><br />\\"This is perfect.  That is perfect.  Perfect comes from perfect.  Take perfect from perfect; the remainder is perfect.  May peace and peace and peace be everywhere.\\"<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\".

Physicist and mathematician Brian Greene's ambitious project here is to make intelligible to the lay reader just what string theory is all about.  He begins by explaining the ideas of relativity and quantum mechanics and why a new theory is needed.  This part of the book, 131 pages worth, is intelligible and makes for an engaging read while providing the necessary background for the reader to appreciate the bulk of the book, which is about string theory.  Greene explains that when general relativity is applied to the very large, it works fine, and when quantum mechanics is applied to the very small, it also works wonderfully well.  However, &quot;where things are very massive AND very small...we require both&quot; theories (p. 117).  Unfortunately, &quot;when we try to combine quantum mechanics and general relativity&quot; we get &quot;nonsensical answers,&quot; sometimes resulting in a &quot;quantum-mechanical probability&quot; of not zero to one, but of &quot;infinity&quot; (p. 118).  It has long been the rule in physics that when infinities pop up in the equations that means there's something wrong somewhere.<br />I wasn't able to understand a lot of the material on string theory, but one of things I did understand was that string theory, by doing away with the particle point of zero dimension (where there would be infinite mass, say at the singularity that spawned the big bang) and giving strings a finite size, the annoying infinities are dissipated.  However I am troubled by Richard Feynman's observation (quoted by Greene on page 213) that there is more than &quot;one way to get rid of the infinities.  The fact that a theory gets rid of infinities is to me not a sufficient reason to believe its uniqueness.&quot;<br />I am further troubled by those seven extra invisible and undetectable dimensions that string theory requires.  What is more troubling, infinities or curled up dimensions that we can neither visualize nor confirm by any kind of experiment?  I am even bothered by the very idea that there might be a &quot;Theory of Everything.&quot;  Is this not a pipe dream, a Quixotic quest of unimaginable hubris?  Don't get me wrong.  I am all for the effort and the dream and what we might learn from it; but I am also not surprised that Congress stopped funding for the collider.  After all, as Greene notes himself on page 215, &quot;using today's technology we would need an accelerator the size of the GALAXY to see individual strings.&quot;<br />And speaking of &quot;seeing&quot; strings, Greene writes on page 224 that &quot;strings that are more energetic can grow substantially larger [than the Planck length].&quot;  He speculates, in looking for some way to confirm string theory that &quot;a string of this sort might sweep across the night sky&quot; and leave &quot;an unmistakable and measurable imprint on data collected by astronomers.&quot;  However I was a little taken back when further down the page he quotes Edward Witten as saying, &quot;Although somewhat fanciful...nothing would settle the issue quite as dramatically as seeing a string in a telescope.&quot;  Wow.  Since a string is a one-dimensional entity, I don't see how it can ever be seen with a telescope or seen at all.  Wouldn't a one-dimensional object of whatever size be invisible?<br />I was also made a little uneasy by Greene's &quot;reassurance&quot; on page 383 that &quot;every step of the way, string theorists have sought and will continue to seek experimentally observable consequences of the theory.&quot;  Is somebody accusing string theorists of NOT seeking experimental proof?  On the next page Greene writes, recalling the dream of a T.O.E., &quot;Explaining everything...is one of the greatest challenges science has ever faced.&quot;<br />Not to disparage the point, but is that not actually an understatement?<br />To be blunt, it is going on nearly twenty years since the advent of string theory and we have not an iota of confirmation that it is anything other than a beautiful mathematical cum physics exercise.  Will young people studying physics today be turned off by the prospect of going through their entire careers without proving anything?  Will physics suffer the same fate that philosophy has suffered, namely that of becoming less and less significant in our universities and colleges when once it was one of the most important departments?  Is there a danger of physics losing the great prestige that it has enjoyed thanks to the monumental work of the architects of relativity and quantum mechanics because the only physics being done is without much hope of experimental confirmation?  Could our young physicists, lead by the now graying lions of string theory be led away from &quot;the happy thought&quot; (p. 375) kind of epiphany that Einstein enjoyed because they are involved in a beautiful idea that is not likely to ever meet an ugly fact?  Will the continued emphasis on string theory in physics lend support to the postmodernist argument that science is a social construction?<br />I am just playing the devil's advocate.  I have no idea whether my questions are even relevant.  However, if nothing else, it would seem that a public relations problem may be creeping up on the citadel of &quot;stringy physics&quot; (Greene's phrase, page 236).<br />Bottom line: this is formidable read, not for channel surfers.  Although Professor Greene keeps all the math in the footnotes, and writes in an engaging and readable style, it is not clear to me just how string theory is going to supplant quantum mechanics and general relativity.  In other words, I came away from the book not with the message that Greene designed for his readers, namely that string theory gives every indication of unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity, but with the very disconcerting feeling that we may be on the wrong track, or that even if we are on the right track, we may never know it.hing other than a beautiful mathematical cum physics exercise.

Maybe Dylan did a cover?]<br />These lyrics from a few years back pretty much sum up the medical position on fibromyalgia.  Selfridge, who is a medical doctor, and Franklynn, who is a professional writer, don't make it any clearer, but they have the considerable merit (especially from the point of view of the fibromyalgia sufferer) of having suffered from the disease themselves.  Selfridge advertises herself as &#34;90 percent cured&#34; (p. 23) while Franklynn &#34;feels at least 90 percent improved&#34; (p. 26).<br />Although Selfridge rightly disparages the term &#34;psychosomatic&#34; (p. 40), it is clear that she believes that the proximate cause of fibromyalgia is the effect negative emotions have on the body, particularly the emotions of anger and rage.  She believes that the &#34;mind, brain, and body conspire to generate...real physical symptoms&#34; (p. 60).  Here's the way the authors lay it out on pages 58-60: &#34;For sensitive people&#34; having grown up &#34;amidst tensions too overwhelming&#34; for their &#34;sensitive nervous system[s],&#34; having been shoved &#34;relentlessly toward the impossible goal of being perfect[,]...a significant loss--of a loved one, a job, status, or income--or a significant emotional shakeup, such as a car accident&#34; can be the event that &#34;may stimulate the production of chemicals that create fibromyalgia symptoms.&#34;  In short (p. 61), &#34;Fibromyalgia sufferers are more sensitive to stress than the general population.&#34;  Are they right?  Nobody knows for sure.  Fibromyalgia, like some other chronic diseases that plague our society--the many kinds of arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome, etc.--may be the result of some as yet unidentified factor of modern life.  Most likely they are the result of a combination of factors, creating a mind-body syndrome of illness.  Until such time as medical science figures it out, we have to go on living.  Can we live without pain?  (I use the editorial &#34;we&#34; not because I personally suffer from fibromyalgia, but because someone I love does, and I identify strongly with her suffering.)  The authors say we can, and they lay out a five week program.  Does it work?<br />I would say that it indeed will work in many cases, not only for sufferers of fibromyalgia, but for sufferers of many other chronic diseases of unclear etiology, perhaps some of those mentioned above.  The reason is simple: their prescription includes things as meditation, regular exercise (&#34;becoming a couch potato can aggravate fibromyalgia&#34; p. 232), a positive attitude toward yourself and your place in the world and so on--things we all should be doing as matter of course.  I would add that a belief in a power beyond the body and beyond the &#34;ego-I&#34; created by the bioculture would help.  Note that, most significantly for fibromyalgia sufferers, it is the management of anger that the authors prescribe.  Anger comes from frustration.  We are not getting what we want, which is to be loved and appreciated.  We want and need to be admired for our good qualities and given some slack for our not-so-good qualities.  If it is true, as the authors state, that &#34;Close to 90 percent of known fibromyalgia sufferers are women&#34; (p. 20), we might very well ask why?  An answer could be that women especially suffer from a poor self image because of the media propaganda of our society that has devalued those women who are not slim, young, rich, famous, and beautiful.  The secret is not to change the society, which is impossible.  It is to change our attitude toward society's delusions.  As in yoga, it is a process of renunciation: we need to renounce (and really believe it) society's mistaken judgment.  We also need to understand &#34;you can't always get what you want&#34; and recognize the negative effect unfulfilled desire can have on ourselves.  When I was young and relatively handsome, the girls used to listen to every word I said.  Now that I am old and gray, they don't find me so intelligent anymore.  What happened to me?  Nothing.  (I may even have gotten smarter.)  What is the cure?  Not to care.  To understand who and where I am, and to be content with that--indeed to revel in it.  The authors include a short chapter on Resources with places to write, Web sites, and books to read including two by Deepak Chopra and three by John E. Sarno, whose The Mindbody Prescription (1998) was obviously part of the inspiration for this book.<br />Incidentally, the reason that the authors and most authorities now reject the term &#34;psychosomatic&#34; is that it has picked up the unfortunate and incorrect sense of &#34;a mental illness&#34; or &#34;an illness caused by mental problems.&#34;  This is not what the word means; the usage is corrupt; alas, nothing can be done about that.

We can see this immediately by her choice of subtitle, \\"Krishna's Counsel in Time of War,\\" which works against the real significance of what Krishna is saying and misses the profound message of the Gita entirely.  If the Gita were only advice about how to act during war, it could hardly have even a minuscule part of the world-wide and timeless significance that it has.  Regardless of how literally one may want to read the Gita, it is an unmistakable truth that Krishna's counsel is not about war, per se, but about how to live life, and how to face death.<br /><br />We can also see in her introduction and in the \\"key words\\" section following the text that her understanding of the Gita is mostly academic.  She has not practiced (at least not to any great extent) any of the yogas central to the Gita.  It cannot be emphasized enough that a true understanding of the Bhagavad Gita requires not only study but practice in one or more of the four yogas presented by Krishna, namely bhakti yoga, karma yoga, jnana yoga or raja yoga.<br /><br />To illustrate some of the problems in the text, let's look at the beginning of Chapter Five as an example.  Miller calls this, \\"The Fifth Teaching: Renunciation of Action,\\" which is not exactly right since what is renounced are the fruits of action, not action itself, which according to the Gita, is impossible to renounce.  We always act; even in inaction we are acting.  Just \\"Renunciation\\" would be a better title for the chapter.  Miller uses the word \\"Simpletons\\" in the fourth verse as the converse of \\"the learned\\"; but this is just poor diction.  The intent of the Sanskrit is \\"unlearned\\" or \\"immature.\\"  Swami Nikhilananda, in his translation (1944; 6th printing, 1979), even uses the word \\"children.\\"  The natural word is \\"fools\\" which Miller avoids for no clear reason.<br /><br />In the next verse, Miller has: \\"Men of discipline reach the same place/that philosophers attain;/he really sees who sees philosophy/and discipline to be one.\\"  She certainly has the spirit of the meaning correct, but \\"Men of discipline\\" is not only needlessly vague, it is misleading since discipline alone does not work at all, which is one of Krishna's main points.  While hers is a literal translation of the Sanskrit \\"yogair,\\" a more meaningful translation would be \\"Men of yoga.\\"  R. C. Zaehner, who translated the Gita for the Oxford University Press (1969), uses \\"men of practice\\" although that too is not entirely agreeable.  Eknath Easwaran (1985; 2000), who really knows yoga, has Krishna simply say, \\"The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are the same; those who fail to see this are blind.\\"  Easwaran can deviate from a strict literal translation because he really understands the purport of the Gita.  Swami Prabhupada, whose translation serves the further didactic purpose of promoting \\"Krishna consciousness,\\" is also a man who has a deep understanding of the Gita.  He puts it this way: \\"One who knows that the position reached by means of renunciation can also be attained by devotional service, and who therefore sees that sankhya and yoga are on the same level, sees things as they are.\\"<br /><br />Another disagreeable choice made by Miller is the epithet, \\"Lord of Discipline\\" that she has Arjuna use in addressing Krishna in 10.17.  This unhappy phrasing comes about because of Miller's reluctance to use the proper and natural word \\"yoga.\\"  Easwaran has \\"supreme master of yoga,\\" while Nikhilananda has simply, \\"O, Yogi...O, Lord.\\"  Prabhupada has \\"You...O Blessed Lord,\\" and Zaehner tries to explain with \\"athlete of the spirit...You, Blessed Lord.\\"  Stephen Mitchell's recent translation (2000) has the eminently sensible, \\"Lord of Yoga.\\"<br /><br />I think Miller was overly influenced by the very literal and also largely academic translation by Franklin Edgerton from 1944, a translation admired in academic circles since it was the one included in the prestigious Harvard Oriental Series, but a translation neither poetic nor especially insightful.  It is difficult to make strictly literal translations true to the spirit of the Gita because the Gita is poetic and is profound in a way not immediately apparent.  Miller worked hard at a literal rendition of the text, but she also sought to make it contemporary for a particular (young) American generation.  Ainslee Embree, Professor of History at Columbia University, is quoted on the cover as saying, \\"Miller's is the translation for her generation.\\"  Unfortunately, it is not clear that Embree meant that entirely as a compliment!<br /><br />Having said all this, Miller's is a sincere effort, and captures most of what the Gita is about.  No reasonable translation of this great spiritual work is in vain.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"restigious Harvard Oriental Series, but a translation neither poetic nor especially insightful.

This can be seen from reading Eknath Easwaran's wise and penetrating Preface written especially for this, the Vintage Spiritual Classics Edition, edited by John F. Thornton and Susan B. Varenne for Vintage Books.<br /><br />Easwaran shows that the differing paths to self-realization and liberation that the Gita presents are a comprehensive whole.  \\"The thread through Krishna's teaching, the essence of the Gita, can be given in one word: renunciation.  This is the common factor in the four yogas\\" (p. xxxviii).  Easwaran goes on to explain that what is being renounced is not material, although on first blush it seems that way.  What is renounced are the fruits of action.  Renunciation is not only the essence of karma yoga, but the essence of the bhakti, jnana and raja yogas that Krishna presents as well.  The key is an amazing spiritual and psychological insight into human nature: we are miserable when we are concerned with the results of what we do, but we are freed when we devote the fruits of our work to God.  What is renounced is also the delusion of a material self that acts, the famous slayer and the slain.  Unlike some other, rather foolish, translations that try to find some artificial substitute for the word \\"yoga,\\" an endeavor entirely alien to the Gita, Easwaran embraces the understanding.  He writes, \\"the Gita is Brahmavidyayam yogashastra, a textbook on the supreme science of yoga\\" (p. xxxvi)<br /><br />It is also clear from what Easwaran writes in the Preface that he understands meditation and the path of moksha gained when one is beyond the pair of opposites that dominate our material existence.  Easwaran knows because he himself is a long time practitioner of meditation, which is one of the ways of liberation (raja yoga).  So many writers on spirituality and on the practice of yoga really do not know meditation, but Easwaran clearly does.  Easwaran also understands that the insights of the Gita can be found in other mystical traditions, including those of Meister Eckhart, St. Catherine of Genoa, Ruysbroeck, St. Augustine, St. Francis of Assisi, and others.<br /><br />Easwaran also makes the important point that the Gita is not the sole property of any one point of view.  \\"The Gita does not present a system of philosophy.  It offers something to every seeker after God, of whatever temperament, by whatever path\\" (p. xxxv).<br /><br />Easwaran writes, \\"to understand the Gita, it is important to look beneath the surface of its injunctions and see the mental state involved.  Philanthropic activity can benefit others and still carry a large measure of ego involvement. Such work is good, but it is not yoga.  It may benefit others, but it will not necessarily benefit the doer\\"  (p. xxxix).  This represents a profound insight into the nature of karma yoga, an understanding that comes only after years of study and practice.<br /><br />Finally Easwaran knows something others don't know (even though this is central to Krishna's teaching), that the Gita, through the practice of yoga, frees one from the fear of death.  When one \\"realizes that he is not a physical creature but the Atman, the Self, and thus not separate from God...he knows that, although his body will die, he will not die...To such a person, the Gita says, death is no more traumatic than taking off an old coat.\\"  (pp. xxiv-xxv).<br /><br />There are ten pages of notes that follow the translation in which the shades of meaning of various concepts like dharma, karma, yoga, sannyasa, etc., and some other ideas are discussed.

Rather than employ artificialities like \\"discipline\\" or \\"duty\\" or \\"the Supreme God,\\" Nikhilananda retains in his translation many Sanskrit words like yoga, dharma, Brahman, etc. that have no real one-to-one English equivalent.  One of the virtues of not attempting to translate every term is a more natural expression that preserves some of the immediacy of the original.  This is a boon for those who have some experience with the terms, and a detriment to those who do not.  In doing so of course he violates one of the prime dicta of translation, namely that a translation should stand on its own without recourse to augmentation by other works.<br /><br />Nonetheless the book itself does stand on its own because Nikhilananda has provided along with the text a commentary taken primarily from Sankaracharya's famous and instructive gloss from the ninth century.  (In some cases, it is true, the reader might wish that a commentary on Sankara's commentary be included!)<br /><br />A point well made in the Foreword by William Ernest Hocking is that too many of the newer translations (and this applies today as it did in 1944) tend to avoid \\"a happy expression...to seek the different solely for the sake of differing.\\"  Nikhilananda is not afraid to use the tried and true and readily employs the \\"happy expression\\" that has worked so well in previous translations.  His is a modest translation.  One can see that his purpose is not so much to be the poet himself as it is to make the work accessible to English speakers.  In his introduction, Nikhilananda interprets the Gita from the standpoint of Vedanta philosophy, which is to be distinguished from yogic philosophy and to some extent from the Hare Krishna movement.  The Gita, as Nikhilananda expresses it in his Introduction, along with the earlier Upanishads and the Brahma sutras, \\"form the bed-rock of Vedanta philosophy.\\"  He follows his Introduction with a chapter entitled, \\"The Story of the Mahabharata,\\" the grand Indian epic in which the Gita is nestled.  Then there is Sankara's brief Introduction followed by a traditional \\"Meditation.\\"  After the text there is a Glossary of Sanskrit words and an Index.<br /><br />This book, originally published by the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center in New York in 1944, is in keeping with the high quality of Swami Nikhilananda's engaging translation of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna and the books on yoga by Swami Vivekananda also published by the Center.  I would recommend that the serious English-speaking student of the Gita have this book, now in its Sixth Printing, alongside a more recent translation of the Gita--perhaps Stephen Mitchell's poetic Gita of 2000 or Kees Boole's Gita of 1979, which includes on left-facing pages a verse by verse transliteration of the Sanskrit--as an aid to study.<br /><br />I have only one small complaint with Nikhilananda's book: the chapter and verse numbers should be placed at the top of each page for easy reference by the reader!<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"s his Introduction with a chapter entitled, \\"The Story of the Mahabharata,\\" the grand Indian epic in which the Gita is nestled.

1891616:US	49786731	R1D88BDVWQD5X5	0520037413	962486986	Bhagavadgita: A New Translation (English and Sanskrit Edition)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Valuable work sadly out of print	No translation of the Bhagavad Gita into English will please everyone.  The reason is simple: readers have different purposes in reading the Gita.  For the devout Hindu and yogi, a translation that stays as close to the original Sanskrit is no doubt to be preferred.  Yet even between Hindu and yogi there can be a difference of opinion.  The Hindu, especially if he or she is of a conservative bent, may prefer a translation that chooses English words that support a literal interpretation of this great spiritual work, while a yogi, especially if he or she is follower of Patanjali, might prefer a translation that emphasizes practice and study.  A general reader might prefer a translation that makes the text readily accessible without having to delve too deeply into Vedic philosophy.  A student of literature might prefer the most elegant and poetic translation.  And so it goes.  A poetic translation must of necessity sacrifice some literal meaning, while a strictly literal translation may make for difficult reading.  There is a dictum to which I subscribe, and it is repeated here by Professor Bolle on page 238, to the effect that when translating literature and in particular poetry, something is always lost in translation.  Consequently, by this rule, if by no other, no single translation of the Gita will serve.  Therefore we have many translations, and as English grows and our attitudes toward the world change, ever so subtly, there will arise a need for new translations.<br /><br />Professor Bolle's belief that \\"A translation should speak for itself\\" (p. 220)  means that one should be able to read the text and make sense of it without recourse to other works.  As a practical matter this means that a work that arose in a time and place far different from here and now, and within a culture with assumptions, traditions and beliefs very different from our own, must perforce be somewhat altered from the original in order that we may understand it without help.  Another of Bolle's beliefs is that if possible every Sanskrit word should be translated into English.  Thus he avoids such words as yoga, brahman, karma, etc.<br /><br />Bolle also believes that \\"a good translation creates the illusion that the text...could have been composed in the modern tongue of the reader\\" (p. 221).  Very literal translations, such as the one Franklin Edgerton did for the Harvard Oriental Series many years ago, necessarily give up this illusion.  Which is better, a translation agreeable with \\"the modern tongue,\\" or one that is as close to a word for word translation as possible?  As above, it really depends on your reasons for reading the text.  For this reason, and for others, I believe that all translations of the Gita are good, and rate this book, as I have others, as a five-star effort.  However, beware that there are some translations of the Gita that are not very good and would not in my mind rate even one star.  Bolle gives an example on page 236 of an attempt by one Arthur W. Ryder from 1929 who rhymed every other line, e.g., \\"To work? or not to work?  Such are/The questions that perplex/Even the poets.  Therefore I/Will solve the doubts that vex,/Imparting knowledge apt to save/Your soul from sinful flecks...\\"  (p. 236; Gita 4.16 ff.).  Such an (interesting) effect is certainly not in keeping with the dignity and serious purpose of the Gita!<br /><br />Bolle's is a very readable and accessible version in which the Sanskrit appears on the left facing page and the English on the right, verse by verse.  The text of the Gita is presented first in this book without any introduction in keeping with Bolle's dictum that \\"a translation should speak for itself.\\"  The text is followed by Part Two, \\"On Translating the Gita,\\" which is an elegant and fascinating essay on not only the considerations and challenges the translator faces in rendering the Gita into English, but on translating in general.  There is a short bibliography and then a Sanskrit Concordanceand an English Guide to the concordance.  This is a superior book that ought to be brought back into print.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"and an English Guide to the concordance.

The design by Barbara Sturman in which the text is presented in a handsome wine/purple font set in wide margins with the chapter titles in a contemporary font of soft vermillion suggests reverence for the Gita while hinting of a twenty-first century Western appreciation.  There is a ribbon sown into the binder for keeping your place.<br /><br />Second, the emphasis is on the text of the Gita itself garlanded by Mitchell's brief introduction and his \\"About the Translation\\" and a most appropriate and valuable appendix, \\"The Message of the Gita\\" by Mohandas K. Gandhi from his Collected Works.<br /><br />Third, there is the translation itself, which is poetic and easily accessible to the contemporary reader without diluting the sacred essence of this great work of spirituality.  Mitchell, who has had extensive experience rendering poetic and spiritual works into English, including a much-admired translation of the Tao Te Ching, worked hard at fusing \\"the dignity of formal verse\\" into a \\"sound like natural speech\\" (p. 32).  Rather than go through torturous artificialities in trying to fit all of the text into metric lines, Mitchell has chosen to present some of the Gita in prose.  Thus the opening chapter, which he calls \\"Arjuna's Despair,\\" in which the scene is set and the participants identified, is gracefully told in prose, as is the introduction of the second chapter until Krishna speaks.  The effect is beautiful, since it highlights the importance of what Krishna is about to say in a speech that really begins the poem and the teaching.  (Shakespeare used this technique.)<br /><br />Mitchell has solved the problem of the word \\"yoga,\\" a long time bugaboo for English translators of the Gita, by sometimes using \\"yoga\\" and sometimes using \\"discipline.\\"  I certainty appreciate his discretion, having been annoyed for years by those translators who use only \\"discipline,\\" a word that in many instances misleads the reader and muddies the text with exactly the wrong meaning and connotation.  Restricting himself to the word \\"discipline\\" alone, as Mitchell explains, \\"would be an impoverishment.\\"  He adds, \\"how could one expect the reader to keep a straight face at the image of Krishna as the &lt;Lord of Discipline>?\\" (p. 33).  Krishna is indeed the Lord of Yoga.<br /><br />Mitchell does not attempt to translate some other terms, like \\"guna,\\" because, \\"Attempts to find English equivalents...have been uniformly unsuccessful and confuse more than they clarify\\" (p. 33).  Anyone versed in yoga knows that the gunas--sattva, rajas, and tamas--represent something close to an entire philosophy and cannot be understood without some study.  The usual rendering as \\"qualities\\" or \\"strands\\" is tolerable, but, as Mitchell indicates, impoverished, and sometimes leads to a misrepresentation of the text.  (See especially 13.21 and compare it with other translations and to the gloss of Sankara, which can be found in the translation by Swami Nikhilanada (1979) published by the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, and elsewhere.)  However not all scholars agree with this.  Kees Bolle in his translation (1979), published by the University of California Press, insists that \\"words like &lt;yoga>, &lt;moksa>, and  must be translated\\" (p. 226).  His concluding essay, \\"On Translating the Bhagavadgita\\" is a sharp, candid, and entertaining discussion of some of the problems that translators face.<br /><br />Where Mitchell runs afoul of some readers is in his worldly attitude toward the Gita as revealed in the introduction, where he uses a story by Borges and a reminiscence by Robert J. Oppenheimer to make a couple of points.  He also assumes a somewhat Taoist position.  To those not conversant with the Tao Te Ching, Mitchell's statement on page 30, \\"The healthiest way to begin reading and absorbing a text like the Bhagavad Gita is to understand that ultimately it has nothing to teach,\\" is definitely off-putting.  To me Mitchell's position is not a detriment and indeed  the only proper stance for a translator is secular.  The Gita is a sacred work to Hindus and yogis and others, but to people who practice other religions and who have been raised in other traditions, the Gita, while a great poetic and spiritual work, has to take its place alongside the Bible, the Tao Te Ching, the Koran and other religious works.  To others, the Gita is, as it was to T.S. Eliot, simply a great philosophical poem.  (Eliot considered it second to Dante's the Divine Comedy.)<br /><br />Mitchell may also startle some uncritical readers of the Gita with his argument in a footnote on pages 200-202 that the last six chapters are not of the same quality as chapters 1-12.  He sees a difference in attitude and finds the last six chapters \\"much inferior...both poetically and spiritually.\\"  I tend to agree, but all venerable religious works are uneven and contain different voices.  It is also true that the Gita is repetitious to some extent (although that is not necessarily to its disadvantage as a didactic scripture), and even seemingly contradictory.  I believe this is an unavoidable consequence of being complex and of having been passed down through many generations both before and after it was written down.<br /><br />To those who might find Mitchell not completely qualified to bring yet another translation of the Gita into the English-speaking world because, as he admits on page 30, his \\"knowledge of Sanskrit is rudimentary,\\" I can only say, his is a fine tradition.  I am thinking of the poet W. B. Yeats, who also without much Sanskrit, but with the help of Shree Purohit Swami, wrote a beautiful translation of The Ten Principal Upanishads (1937), and of Christopher Isherwood, also without much Sanskrit, but with the help of Swami Prabhavananda, published a graceful rendition of the Gita (1944).<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a beautiful and valuable book that would enhance anyone's library, and I recommend it highly.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"ition is not a detriment and indeed  the only proper stance for a translator is secular.

Bodanis begins with Einstein in the Bern Patent Office in 1905, and then goes back in time to examine each of the elements in Einstein's equation in turn, starting with energy, followed by the equals sign, then mass, and then the speed of light (where I learned that the &quot;c&quot; is for &quot;celeritas,&quot; from the Latin for &quot;swiftness&quot; and not for centimeters--silly me, I always thought &quot;c&quot; represented the speed of light in centimeters!) and finally, squared.<br />There are a number of stories woven into the narrative beginning with the story of Michael Faraday, who demonstrated the link between electricity and magnetism, and his mentor Humphrey Davy who tried to steal the priority from him.  Other stories include that of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier whose fanatical insistence on exacting measurements led the world to the realization of the conservation of energy, a man who received his thanks by being beheaded during the French Revolution.  And there is that of Ole Roemer, who with the help of Jupiter's satellite Io, was able to calculate the speed of light (despite denials from an embarrassed Jean-Dominique Cassini, who believed that light propagated instantaneously). There is the tale of Emilie du Chatelet, beloved of Voltaire, who persuaded everyone that Leibniz was right, that energy equals mass times velocity squared, not simply mass times velocity as Newton had it.  Bodanis recalls how she became with child at age forty and feared for her life because the &quot;Doctors of the time had no awareness that they should wash their hands or instruments.&quot;  She gave birth but died of an infection a week later.<br />The biography reaches its climax in the Manhattan Project.  Bodanis gives a short but compelling story about how J. Robert Oppenheimer guided the US project to success, and a corresponding story about how the German effort under the direction of Werner Heisenberg failed.  Along the way we get glimpses of other scientists involved in nuclear energy and radioactivity, including Ernest Rutherford, Enrico Fermi, James Chadwick, Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, Arthur Stanley Eddington and others.  Fred Hoyle makes an appearance as does Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.  Bodanis paints some of the scientists in a most unflattering light, especially Hahn and Heisenberg, while glorifying others, notably Meitner, Chandra and Fermi.  His sketch of Oppenheimer is balanced and vivid.<br />Bodanis has the gift of making everything interesting, especially the personalities, but also the science itself.  His description of the atomic bombs that were dropped on the Japanese cities and how they worked makes for compelling reading.  In the Chapter &quot;America's Turn&quot; I learned that not everybody in the Allied Command agreed with Truman's decision to use the bomb: &quot;Even Eisenhower, who'd had no qualms about killing thousands of opponents when it was necessary to safeguard his troops, was strongly hostile to it...&quot; (p. 161).<br />Some of the most interesting writing is in the footnotes, beginning on page 237.  Here I found a most elegant digression on the Uncertainty Principle (pp. 273-74).  And on page 280, Bodanis makes a vivid distinction between the naked properties of U238 (fifty pounds together are warm to the touch) and U235 (fifty pounds together leave a crater).  And on page 275 he recalls the use of female slaves by the Germans during WWII: &quot;...the I. G. Farben combine purchased 150 women from the Oswiecim [Auschwitz] concentration camp, after complaining about a price of 200 marks (then $80.00) each, and killed all of them in experiments with a soporific drug.&quot;<br />A number of black and white prints complement and enhance the text; an appendix, &quot;Follow-up of Other Key Participants&quot; shines more light on the scientists; and there is a useful 18-page &quot;Guide to Further Reading&quot; following the notes.

1906792:US	49786731	RTSMSHGPZ01EI	015100398X	358137661	The Hole in the Universe: How Scientists Peered over the Edge of Emptiness and Found Everything	Books	4	46	50	N	N	Nothing exposed for what it is: Something!	This is a book about \\"nothing\\" inspired by recent discoveries in physics, similar to the one written by Brit physicist John D. Barrow, The Book of Nothing: Vacuums, Voids, and the Latest Ideas about the Origins of the Universe (2000).  While Barrow devoted several chapters to the history of the concept of zero and the idea of nothing, Cole, while covering much of the same territory, emphasizes recent discoveries about the vacuum and ideas from string and loop theory while her extensive use of quotations gives her book a more journalist feel.  Otherwise the books are strikingly similar, even to the typographic use of subheads in capital letters followed by epigram-like quotes from various authors that break up the text.  It's almost as if the same person did the layout for both books!  Both authors sometimes even use the same examples, e.g., John Cage's \\"musical composition\\" entitled, 4' 33\\" (four minutes and 33 seconds of pure silence).  Noteworthy in Cole's book is the interesting material on silence beginning on page 211 and then some examples from the psychology of perception on pages 214-231 with an excursion into the concept of nothing from Zen Buddhism.<br /><br />Cole is a science journalist who writes for the Los Angeles Times and is the author of The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty (1998) and First You Build a Cloud: And Other Reflections on Physics as a Way of Life (1999).  I enjoyed both books and reviewed the latter favorably for Amazon.com readers, and so it was with pleasant anticipation the I began reading The Hole in the Universe, hoping that I would learn more about the bizarre properties of the vacuum than I was to glean from Barrow's excellent book.  What I learned was just how difficult the subject really is, and how far removed it is from our common sense notions about the world.<br /><br />I would rate this book higher but sometimes Cole's ready metaphors and analogies run into each other, further obscuring an already dusky subject matter, and there are some slips.  She writes on page 251, \\"It's easy to imagine ten dimensions of space because you can just add one on top of the other.\\"  (Not for me, at any rate, it isn't.)  And there's a bad take on the anthropic principle on page 242.  Cole writes. \\"...in a sense, our very perception determines the kind of universe we populate.\\"  It's really the other way around: we are created from the stuff of the universe and that stuff determines our perception.  It's not even clear that \\"We perceive the only universe we can perceive\\" (also from page 242), because the universe could be a little different and we could still perceive it.  Finally, Cole, in discussing the Higgs field, uses the simile, \\"the Higgs field to our universe is like water to a fish--the same everywhere and therefore utterly imperceptible.\\"  We can imagine that the fish \\"perceives\\" the water when it touches the sand at the bottom and when it leaps above the surface.<br /><br />These quibbles aside, this is an exciting and stimulating book.  Let me share some impressions:<br /><br />First, it is apparent that there is no such thing as nothing, or I should say, nothing is something!<br /><br />Second, the idea that time and space began with the big bang and that there was nothing as a matter of definition beyond the big bang can be discarded.  It now seems more likely that our universe is just one of a possible infinity of universes, popping probabilistically out of the vacuum that used to be nothing but is now a bubbling caldron of potential energy.<br /><br />Third, my favorite question, Why is there something rather than nothing? has an easy answer: There is something rather than nothing because there is no such thing as nothing.<br /><br />Fourth, the world of string theory with its eleven dimensions and it ultra tiny strings at the scale of 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, is entirely of the stuff we will never perceive or have any ability to comprehend beyond the report of the equations.<br /><br />Fifth, the old bugaboo about the universe having no beginning or being created from nothing is no longer such a quandary because, One, nothing is something; and Two, nothing has always been here.  In other words, the question is answered: the universe (or mega-universe or super-universe, or whatever) had no beginning and is eternal.  (God, the creator, is not going to like this, but I'm sure something can be worked out.)<br /><br />Sixth, perhaps, as Cole suggests in the final chapter, a good definition of \\"nothing\\" is perfect symmetry.<br /><br />Finally, I came away from reading this book with the clear sense that the universe exists indefinitely in every direction from the macro to the micro, from the distant past to the distance future.  In other words, we exist not as on a darkling plain as the poet Matthew Arnold had it, but in a bubble of space and time smack in the middle of a possible infinity of bubbles, our ability to see in any one \\"direction\\" limited by our senses and our instruments, but enhanced by our ability to reason and extrapolate from evidence, but ultimately stopped cold by our imaginations and the realization of how really tiny is our arena of discernment compared to the incredible vastness gaping away from us in any and all directions.  If this realization doesn't make us humble and awestruck, I don't know what will.<br /><br />Incidentally, both Cole and Barrow, while carousing merrily about all sorts of whimsical notions of nothing, failed to acknowledge the \\"god of nothing,\\" that is, the ineffable god of the Vedas about whom nothing can be said: \\"Neti, neti, neti\\"--not this, not this, and not this!<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\"eport of the equations.<br /><br />Fifth, the old bugaboo about the universe having no beginning or being created from nothing is no longer such a quandary because, One, nothing is something; and Two, nothing has always been here.

In other words, we exist not as on a darkling plain as the poet Matthew Arnold had it, but in a bubble of space and time smack in the middle of a possible infinity of bubbles, our ability to see in any one \\"direction\\" limited by our senses and our instruments, but enhanced by our ability to reason and extrapolate from evidence, but ultimately stopped cold by our imaginations and the realization of how really tiny is our arena of discernment compared to the incredible vastness gaping away from us in any and all directions.  If this realization doesn't make us humble and awestruck, I don't know what will.<br /><br />Incidentally, both Cole and Barrow, while carousing merrily about all sorts of whimsical notions of nothing, failed to acknowledge the \\"god of nothing,\\" that is, the ineffable god of the Vedas about whom nothing can be said: \\"Neti, neti, neti\\"--not this, not this, and not this!<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\"	2001-07-24

Dr. Groopman's inability to assume a socially correct humility may be annoying and distracting to some, but I found it amusing and almost endearing.  He wants so much to please and be that delight of mothers everywhere, &quot;my son, the doctor,&quot; that it is impossible for him to show himself in an unflattering light.  Even when he volunteers his mistakes, one has the sense that he is a larger person for having done so!<br />Well, I can think of worse styles, and anyway, what is important about this book is not the author's self-perception, but the light he sheds on the practice of medicine for the reader, and that light is considerable.  He has a fine gift for telling a story and he writes in a clear and vivid manner that is easy to read, and we are thoroughly engrossed .  Furthermore, the moral of most of the very interesting stories he presents here from his practice, is that the physician's first responsibility is to the patient, not to his ego, not to his career, not to the HMOs, and not even to his fellow physicians.<br />I was particularly impressed with Dr. Groopman's ability to criticize those physicians who let their egos and their pride come before their patients.  He wasn't afraid to show how doctors who do not put the welfare of their patients first can cause pain and suffering and even death.  Most doctors would never come close to being as critical of their peers as Groopman is here.  I don't know whether he has an inordinate amount of courage, or a particularly thick skin, but I do know that many doctors will not be pleased with what he has revealed in these pages about the competence of some physicians, and he will pay a price for that.<br />Also impressive was Dr. Groopman's unflinching willingness to share with the reader not just his clinical experience, but his personal experience as well.  In the first chapter, &quot;Our Firstborn Son,&quot; he and his wife, who is also a doctor, become worried parents who take their sick son to the emergency room of a hospital, feeling as vulnerable and helpless as any other parents would, especially when they become concerned that the doctor on call is misdiagnosing their son's illness.  In a later chapter he shares the story of his Grandfather Max who suffered from Alzheimer's disease in a way that made him uncontrollably violent.  Most significant, though, is the story he tells about himself in the prologue.  It is disarming in the sense that he too is guilty of pride and suffers most painfully for it.  Once a marathon runner, he ends up crippled for a year, and to this day has a chronic debility that limits his mobility, all because he thought he knew better than the doctors who were treating him.  It was a great and painful lesson for a young physician, the kind of lesson that molds us to better appreciate our limits and to empathize with the suffering of others, the kind of lesson that shapes a great physician.<br />So, I don't believe Dr. Groopman is ensconced in any ivory tower.  He is a physician that is intimately involved in the welfare of his patients (and in his research), a man who understands the suffering patients go through first hand, and is sympathetic and, most important, knowledgeable and skillful.  He is also a very good writer.  I would be delighted to be so lucky as to have Dr. Groopman as my personal physician.ter, &quot;Our Firstborn Son,&quot; he and his wife, who is also a doctor, become worried parents who take their sick son to the emergency room of a hospital, feeling as vulnerable and helpless as any other parents would, especially when they become concerned that the doctor on call is misdiagnosing their son's illness.

The terminology is a little formidable in spots, and there is perhaps more genetics being explained here than most general readers would want, but these are minor obstacles when one considers the reward: listening to an expert talk about what's happening in genetics today while considering the implications.  I was very impressed with Avise's level-headed and balanced assessment of the controversies.  This is a sophisticated book, deeply considered and carefully expressed.<br />The author is the distinguished Professor of Genetics at the University of Georgia and an evolutionary biologist who really knows his stuff.  &quot;The genetic gods&quot; in the title is a metaphor of course--he even refers jokingly to &quot;protein angels&quot; on page 208--his point being that we are to some very real extent at the whims of our genes, just as the Greeks once thought they were at the whims of the gods on Mount Olympus.  However don't imagine that Avise is presenting a genetic-centered reductionist approach in this book.  He wants to emphasize that the genes are subtly, and sometimes not so subtly,  influencing our lives, but that is far from the whole story.  Avise suggests that the proper way to look at the culture verses genes debate is to think of culture as an &quot;epigenetic phenomenon...itself a product of biological evolution,&quot; and that &quot;genes and culture coevolve&quot; (pp. 158-159).  The environment shapes us, but we in turn condition the environment.  As Avise expresses it, &quot;the individual's mind to a considerable extent creates itself through the environments it conditions&quot; (p. 159).  In our attempt to understand how the mind works and to account for human behavior, Avise's states that a &quot;myopically reductionist approach that neglects multiple levels of biological, personal, and social causation&quot; is inadequate, as are &quot;uncritical holistic approaches alone&quot; (p. 165).<br />This just makes sense and it also makes moot the sometimes heated &quot;culture verses genetics&quot; debate, which is similar to the old &quot;nature verses nurture&quot; false dichotomy.  Quite simply, how can we separate the effects and influence of the environment and culture from that of the genes, and vice versa?<br />Professor Avise does not shy away from a position on whether we should intervene genetically when something is amiss.  While some people believe that &quot;developing embryos are governed by intelligent and caring supernatural forces,&quot; Avise insists that &quot;they are governed by natural gene-environment interactions that unfortunately can&quot; go horribly awry as in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or in Down's syndrome (p. 199).  In such cases, he asks, &quot;Should we then take the reins?&quot;  His careful answer on the next page is yes, but with the understanding that &quot;the interests of the individuals most closely involved...should take legal precedence over those of more distant parties.&quot;<br />Avise believes that ethical questions about genetic engineering should be considered by all members of society, not just scientists or theologians or lawyers (p. 202).  He believes in a case-by-case appraisal (p. 201).  &quot;The only &lt;wrong&gt; approach,&quot; he avers, &quot;is that in which the moral authority of a god is asserted.&quot;  He wryly observes, that since there is such a diversity of opinion, &quot;any supernatural deity either has been strangely silent on such issues or else has conveyed vastly different messages to different listeners.&quot;<br />This book requires an effort on the part of the reader, there is no doubt about that.  This is no breezy Time Magazine treatment.  But I think what we can learn from Professor Avise on a topic of such overriding human interest is well worth the effort.human interest is well worth the effort.	2001-07-21
1913940:US	49786731	R29UQQ474YKROC	1587430118	945020759	Darwin's God: Evolution and the Problem of Evil	Books	2	30	64	N	N	Specious arguments against evolution	Cornelius Hunter's thesis is that Darwinism and the theory of evolution in general rest on metaphysical &quot;presuppositions&quot; that are themselves unscientific, and that therefore Darwinism is really theology in disguise.  To support his case Hunter repeatedly makes the argument that Darwin and various evolutionists are saying in effect, &quot;God would never have made the world this way; therefore there was no divine creation.&quot;<br />Although some evolutionists, usually through carelessness of expression or contextual ambiguity, have made statements similar to that--Hunter quotes Stephen Jay Gould as writing something similar on page 48--when they have, they are mistaken, just as Hunter is mistaken in supposing that such an argument underpins Darwinism.<br />Evolution has a lot more going for it than a specious argument.  Hunter is aware of this and in the course of the book tries to cast doubt on the overwhelming tide of evidence for evolution from the fossil record through molecular biology.  Here's a typical example from page 38: &quot;We have no idea how the genetic code originated; therefore we can hardly appeal to its existence as evidence for evolution.&quot;  But that doesn't follow.  I may not be able to account for the origination of the rock that went through my window, nonetheless I can appeal to it as the proximate cause of the broken glass.  And on pages 31-32 we find, &quot;At the core of evolutionary theory is Darwin's law stating that in most instances it is the fittest that reproduce.  But due to the complexities of nature and its life forms, we usually cannot measure fitness aside from counting offspring.  Those organisms that leave more offspring are usually more fit, but we are not sure precisely why.&quot;  Here Hunter reveals that he doesn't understand that evolutionary fitness is defined strictly in terms of reproductive success, period.  It has nothing to do with &quot;complexities of nature,&quot; and there is no more precise way to measure fitness.<br />Hunter also argues at length that Darwin was led in part to his theory of evolution through a desire to &quot;reconcile the ways of God to man&quot; (Milton) and especially to account for the existence of evil in this world.  Again this is specious.  Darwin may have been led, in part, to his theory of evolution because of his religious beliefs, but that has no bearing on the validity or effectiveness of the theory of evolution.  Indeed, whatever Darwin's motivation was, it is irrelevant to the validity of evolution.<br />However the main fault of this book is simply a misrepresentation of just what it is that has made evolution the enormously persuasive theory that it is.  Hunter writes on page 162, &quot;But in fact the theory of evolution relies on the belief that God never would have created the world as we find it.&quot;  But this is emphatically NOT what evolutionists are saying.  It's not that God would never have created the world this way (or any other way, for that matter) but that the intricacies of the fossil and molecular record are better explained by evolution than by an appeal to a metaphysics.  God might have divinely created everything in seven days and made it look like billions of years.  That supposition can never be disproved.  It is also the case that the moon could be made of green cheese and the experience of NASA and our scientific instruments are being fooled by the Green Cheese God.  If I say that &quot;God wouldn't work that way&quot; (as Hunter accuses evolutionists of saying), I would indeed be committing myself to knowledge I can't possibly have, and if I say this is proof that the moon is made of rock and mineral, etc., I have made a simple logical error.  But I would not say that, and neither do evolutionists say (if they are careful with their words) that evolution is proven because God would not work in such and such a way.  What IS being said is that the report of our senses is better evidence than an arbitrary appeal to metaphysics, which is exactly the way science cannot work.  The Green Cheese God may indeed exist and he may be fooling us to test our faith in him, but to paraphrase Damon Runyon, that ain't the way to bet.trary appeal to metaphysics, which is exactly the way science cannot work.  The Green Cheese God may indeed exist and he may be fooling us to test our faith in him, but to paraphrase Damon Runyon, that ain't the way to bet.	2001-07-18

The main argument presented by Nesse and Williams is that disease must be understood from the perspective of evolutionary biology.<br /><br />The authors begin by asking, \\"Why, in a body of such exquisite design, are there a thousand flaws and frailties that make us vulnerable to disease?\\"  Through evidence and insights from evolutionary biology, the authors carefully give a detailed answer to this question, which might be summed up thus: The mechanism of evolution fits our bodies for reproduction, not for optimum health.  Furthermore the mechanism is imperfect and subject to mutation.  Additionally we are in competition with other organisms, e.g, viruses, bacteria, etc., that work toward their fitness, sometimes at our expense (the parasite-prey \\"arms race\\").  Noteworthy is the idea that natural selection cares little for the maintenance of the organism after the age of reproduction, and that sexual reproduction actually fosters mechanisms that increase the fitness of youth while neglecting the aged, leading to the phenomena of senescence and death.<br /><br />Seeing disease from the viewpoint of evolution, the authors argue, helps us to understand disease and the mechanisms involved, which in turn can help us to fight disease.  Allergy, for example, is a disease characterized by an over active immune system.  Copious amounts of histamine are produced to fight off a few molecules of pollen.  Why?  The authors make the point that our immune systems operate on the principle that better an overreaction to something harmless than an under reaction to a real threat.  It's like jumping at the sight of a piece of rope lying on the ground.  It's not a snake, but better this little harmless error than being too slow to get back from the real thing.<br /><br />Some other interesting ideas: Fever has a purpose.  It raises body temperature enough to interfere with the chemistry of some pathogens, thereby killing them.  If we take medicines that reduce fever, are we prolonging our illness?  In some cases, the authors answer, yes.  If we take medicines that suppress coughs and sneezing can that also prolong our illness?  Again the answer is in some cases, yes.  The point is that in treating the symptoms of disease we need to make a distinction between which are defensive mechanism of our bodies and which are not.  Some pathogens, for example, make us sneeze or cause diarrhea in order to better spread themselves to the next victim.  The rabies virus makes a dog bite other animals in order to spread itself.  But our bodies cause us to cough and sneeze primarily to expel pathogens.<br /><br />The authors see some of our health problems as the result of genetic \\"quirks,\\" or evolutionary hangovers.  Dyslexia is an example.  In the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation back in the Stone Age, dyslexia was no problem because there were no books to read.  Indeed, it might be that the dyslexic approach to some perception problems, is better than the \\"normal\\" one, allowing a quicker, better understanding of the objects being viewed.  Other genetic quirks include our predisposition to eat too much fat when available because in the EEA there was precious little fat to be had so it made sense to eat as much as possible when it was available.  Something similar can be said of alcohol.  Before agriculture, and especially before the process of distillation, a predisposition to alcoholism was no danger because there was very little alcohol to be had.  These \\"quirks\\" are examples of disease caused by \\"novel environments,\\" much of the modern world being a novel environment to our Stone Age bodies.<br /><br />Nesse and Williams show that the modern environment, which requires a lot of close work from all of us, especially the reading of books, is the cause of the epidemic of myopia that modern humans experience.  I would like to add that it is possible that myopia under some conditions could be adaptive.  In the rainforest it would probably be better to see well close at hand than far away (the opposite of what would be valuable on the savannah).  Also those people who concentrated on things small and up close might well identify and process food sources overlooked by others.<br /><br />While this is an excellent book, gracefully written and full of valuable information and insight, it is now a little dated (copyright 1994), and some of the ideas need reworking in light of recent discoveries.  For example, while the authors discuss the ill effects of too much fat and sugar in our diets, they say nothing about the carbohydrate intolerance that leads to obesity.  This too can be seen as an evolutionary quirk since there were no cultivated fields of amber grain in the prehistory, and the grains that were available were small and required a lot of hand processing so that it was very difficult to overindulge.  Consequently there was no need for natural selection to evolve a protection against eating too much.  Also their discussion of heart disease and how it is the result of genetic factors and faulty diet fails to mention the idea that heart disease might be caused by a bacteria.  (See for example, Plague Time: How Stealth Infections Cause Cancers, Heart Disease, and other Deadly Ailments (2000) by Paul W. Ewald.)<br /><br />All things considered, though, this is a classic of evolutionary literature, nicely presented to a nonspecialist, but educated public.

Part One is &quot;An Introduction to Buddhism&quot; and Part Two, &quot;An Introduction to Meditation.&quot;  The question &quot;What is Meditation?&quot; is addressed on page 56, and the following answer given: &quot;Meditation is the process of learning to work skillfully with the mind in a way that will lead by successive stages to tranquillity, insight, spontaneous purification and the total liberation from all negative states.&quot;  As such, this very general definition will do just fine, although an understanding of what &quot;total liberation from all negative states&quot; might mean is something that comes only after a long practice.  Additionally, as revealed in the next paragraph and on the following pages, there are &quot;many different systems and methods of meditation,&quot; and the one &quot;dealt with here&quot; is called &quot;Insight meditation.&quot;  Incidentally, the last two words are the title of a book by Joseph Goldstein, who was one of author Rob Nairn's teachers.<br />Buddhist generally insist on adding &quot;insight&quot; to meditation because the process of Buddhism itself is predicated on insight into the human predicament leading to action toward liberation.  What Buddhism says in a nutshell is that there is suffering, that there is a way out of the suffering, and this is what it is.  So taught the Buddha nearly twenty-six hundred years ago.  This book emphasizes the compassionate nature of Buddhism while giving a quick outline of the general principles of the religion, followed by an outline of the Buddha's teaching.  In the section on meditation there are twenty or so pages to guide the reader into how it is done.  As someone who has practiced meditation for many years, I can tell you that this method will work, but the important thing to understand about meditation is that it is a practice, an acquired skill that takes a while to learn.  Once learned it can be let go of easily in the hustle and bustle of daily living, but once mastered and completely entered into, it becomes an essential part of our lives and transforms us.<br />While this book does not completely fulfill the promise of the title (meditation varies for every individual and indeed over time varies for each of us), nonetheless it is valuable as a clear, concise introduction to one of the great world religions.that it is a practice, an acquired skill that takes a while to learn.

Only this time instead of going after the pop icons of do-gooder land (as in My Goodness: A Cynic's Short-lived Search for Sainthood (2000)) or the much beloved idols of Celebrityland, especially the left-wing variety (as in  If You're Talking to Me, Your Career Must Be in Trouble: Movies, Mayhem and Malice (1994)), here Joe takes on the entire Baby Boomer generation, finding us vilely two-faced, contemptuously mediocre, insipidly uninspired, conspicuously consumptive, banally boring, and just downright dorky, with of course not the slightest insight into our own nature.  As always his eye is sharp and his rapier even sharper, and as usual he goes after the usual suspects: anything he thinks is phony, and anybody who takes him- or herself too seriously, i.e., Sting, Jane Fonda, Ben & Jerry, The Bhagavad Gita, etc.  (Joe, dude, those horses are dead!  You killed 'em last time!  Yes, but they keep coming back to life like kudzu.)<br />In the first chapter Joe sets forth the crimes of his generation: e.g., \\"The unseemly search for the Fountain of Youth,\\" \\"The concept of selective virtue,\\" \\"Hypocrisy as a manageable lifestyle,\\" etc.  In the second he details the \\"High Misdemeanors,\\" such as \\"Ostentatious displays of multicultural sensitivity,\\" \\"That whole Eastern thing,\\" \\"Totally unacceptable hair\\" (\\"There is a point at which middle-aged men with Art Garfunkelian hair cease to be foolish-looking and actually start frightening the people around them.\\"), etc.  Joe's ear for the pop culture is supersensitive and his ability to absorb and make fun of same is phenomenal.  Three of the chapters are named after rock lyrics, \\"What a Fool Believes,\\" \\"Play that Funky Music, White Boy,\\" and \\"Good Lovin' Gone Bad,\\" appropriated, of course, for their sardonic value.  In fact, there are perhaps a hundred snippets of rock and roll lyric embedded in the text, revealing, by the way, that he originally had another book in mind--but so what?

Nothing is real in the sense that it is no longer the nothing that it once was.  It is actually \\"something.\\"  On the next page, to further illustrate the point, Barrow quotes the lyric from Freddie Mercury (of Queen), \\"Nothing really matters.\\"  It does indeed!<br /><br />The impetus for this, Barrow's latest book on cosmology, seems to be the growing realization that the vacuum of space (\\"nothing\\") is not entirely empty, and in fact cannot in principle ever be empty.  As Barrow explains in Chapter 7, \\"The Box that Can Never Be Empty,\\" it would be a violation of the Uncertainty Principle because, \\"If we could say that there were no particles in a box, that it was completely empty of all mass and energy,\\" we would have \\"perfect information about motion at every point and about the energy of the system at a given instant of time\\" (p. 204).  This rather simple, but shocking revelation, has consequences that are shaking the very foundation of our understanding of the cosmos.  Quite simply it appears that there is no such thing as nothing.<br /><br />Barrow lays the ground work for this revelation by first exploring the nature of nothing as seen by the ancients, noting in particular the Greek abhorrence of the very idea that the vacuum could exist (\\"horror vacui\\").  In Chapter One, \\"Zero - The Whole Story,\\" (which follows Chapter Nought) he recalls the history of zero and how it finally found acceptance.  So great was the Greek horror of nothing that they did not have a zero in their number system.  Many people found the idea of nothing and of zero frightening and impious.  However, as Barrow shows, eventually zero triumphed over its adversaries because of its usefulness.  In the next chapter, \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" Barrow recalls the medieval debates about the vacuum, whether it exists, whether it existed before the creation of the world, and whether it was possible to create a vacuum.  He recounts attempts to create a vacuum in Chapter Three, \\"Constructing Nothing,\\" and then discusses the once and future ether that Einstein had so completely demolished.  (It's back!  But it's called the vacuum and it seems to have more properties than the old ether ever had.)  In Chapter Five, \\"Whatever Happened to Zero?\\"  Barrow explores some non-Euclidian geometries and shows how numbers are created out of the empty set in set theory, a neat ironic analogy to how universes are perhaps created out of the vacuum.<br /><br />Beginning in Chapter Six, \\"Empty Universes,\\" Barrow concentrates on cosmology.  I have to warn you that, despite Professor Barrow's elegant and graceful style and an abundance of charts, sidebars, lively quotes, and illustrations, this is not an easy read.  The subject at the level Barrow wants to discuss it, is quite frankly very difficult.  I have followed cosmology as a hobby for many years, but I am not a physicist or a mathematician.  Those who are will probably have an easier time of it.  Nonetheless, I learned a lot from this book and if I had wanted to \\"study\\" the text, could have learned a lot more.  One thing I did not learn, something I have yet to find in any book on cosmology, is an answer to the question, What is the source of the energy that drives the expansion of the universe?  Or put another way, what caused the singularity to \\"explode\\"?  (Any reader know the answer?)<br /><br />Barrow shows that one of the things that recent cosmology has done to the Big Bang universe that was said to contain all of space and time (leaving no possibility for \\"nothing\\" or \\"anything\\" to exist \\"outside\\" of it since there was no outside) is to allow it to be part of a larger, possibly infinite universe.  The idea that our universe may be but one of an infinite number of universes all popping probabilistically out of thevacuum is mind boggling beyond any ability to describe it.  In reference to the possible eternal expansion of our particular universe, Barrow notes on page 300 that \\"When there is an infinite time to wait then anything that can happen, eventually will happen.\\"  Applying this deduction to that possible infinity of universes, one finds a companion to the \\"many worlds\\" interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a new universe is created with every quantum event, a companion that asserts that in an infinite universe every possible event will take place, and every thought unthought will eventually be thought, that indeed there are unicorns somewhere and politicians who don't lie, and a place where bread always lands butter side up.<br /><br />Faced with this whimsy, I suspect that Barrow would quickly point out that that is why in physics when infinities come up in the equations, it is a sure sign that something is wrong.  Nevertheless, the cosmos as revealed by modern astronomy, astrophysics, relativity, quantum mechanics, and the ideas from string theory, is a story of breathtaking and mind boggling sweep and grandeur, often totally unintuitive and beyond our wildest imaginings.  As picturesque, inventive and psychologically satisfying as the tales of the ancients about the cosmos are (e.g., \\" It's turtles all the way down!\\") they pale beside the conception of the universe as seen by modern science.

No way around it,&quot; he laments under his breath.  When mom tells him to wait for his sisters for school, he dead pans to himself, &quot;Jeesh, have a cow, why doncha?&quot;<br />One is beginning to wonder at this point if Tom Hanley, novelist, is for real, or is he just putting us on?  Is this satire, or is this guy unconscious?  We next get a full day at Saint Luke middle school with Sister Redempta, terminal boredom, girls &quot;starting to grow, you know...Breasts!&quot; and Tom making like Walter Mitty with the heroic fantasies, this time reeling in a 2,000 pound, plus marlin with an 8-lb. test line.  And then we have Chapter 4, &quot;The Oval Office.&quot;  It's the Cuban missile crisis and we're in the war room with JFK and his Boston accent and there's the Joint Chiefs and MacNamara and Schlesinger (no doubt taking copious notes) and they're all making like characters from Dr. Strangelove.  LBJ hurries in, tucking in his shirt, wondering &quot;what the sam-hill&quot; is &quot;going on.&quot;  Marilyn Monroe (!) makes a discreet exit from close proximity to JFK, turning to breathe out &quot;a throaty, Yes sir, Mr. President sir&quot; as the assembled &quot;loins of the most powerful men in the free world stirred as one.&quot;<br />By now I've figured out what's going on. Hanley is having one hellsapoppin' good time recounting a fantasy boy's life as a gee whiz fun satirical novel (with perhaps a grownup fantasy of Steven Spielberg taking a six-figure option on it, which might happen: Spielberg loves kids and he'd like nothing more than to remake the Kubrick/Terry Southern classic in a more Spielbergian style).  But I have a feeling that some of this may have gone over the head of a few readers, particularly when one considers that the author bills himself on the cover as &quot;an artist, writer, surfer, pilot, and a regular guy,&quot; a Boy Scout Tenderfoot and a Leo &quot;--but not one of those, you know, loud and pushy ones.&quot;  This guy could actually BELIEVE this stuff he's writing, one imagines.  He sure as hell ain't no fancy-smarmy pseudo intellectual from Harvard Yard.<br />The prose glitters with authentic detail and a kind of all fools wisecracking (&quot;holy cats, ching-gow, correct-a-mundo, no problemo, danged&quot; this and &quot;danged&quot; that, and even &quot;darnit,&quot; etc., etc. and nearly ad infinitum).  Particularly funny was the take off by the kids on the neologism, &quot;eat me!&quot; on pages 56 and 57.  Hanley returns the early sixties, BH (Before Hippies), which are really the fifties, as though well-remembered or well-researched, and makes the words run across the page in a readable and agreeable manner.  (By the way, great job of proofreading by somebody.)<br />While this is not any nouveau artistic accomplishment, this is a fun read that really would make a swell comedy for the silver screen even though things do get a little fantastic as the plot unravels and even though an ex-US President (Lyndon Baines Johnson) does take some terrible satirical licks en route (ha, ha) and even though General Curtis E. LeMay is quoted as saying stuff like, &quot;What in blazes do you mean?&quot;and even though there's not a single f-word to be found anywhere nor any dope, drugs, booze or--heck--even any rock and roll.

They'll sleep in the streets and eat out of the back door of the Ding How Chinese restaurant.  They'll face enough frustration to try the patience of Job and enough rejection to make them scream hot tears.<br />You've got to suffer to be a real writer of tales, and you've got to identify and empathize with people estranged from the good things in life, and you've got to get it all down on the hard drive in a manner both economical and poetic.  And you have to polish and squeeze those words until there is nothing extraneous, and make the finished product look as spontaneous and natural as a first draft.  It helps to have a way with words and a gift for spinning a yarn, a keen ear and eye and a BS detector to envy the one Hemingway fancied he carried around.  Having all this going for you--and Wilson does--you might, just might get a story published in a lit mag once or twice a year, and maybe once in blue moon, somebody at Esquire or The Atlantic Monthly or The New Yorker might write you a line saying two or three positive words about your work before the inevitable, &quot;...but not quite right for us.&quot;<br />The first story, &quot;A Wire Man&quot; is about a man who still flinches at the sight of his father, a self-made, pip-squeak patriarch, a taciturn, hard as steel, entrepreneur full of prejudice.  So, the wire man, divorced by his wife and separated from his son, whom he sees on alternate weekends, sets out on his own to establish a business to prove his worth to himself and the man with a strap, but runs into overload, overwork and the snapping of hungry creditors at his heels.  It is a story well-wrought, a little too precious in spots, a story with the good and bad guys perhaps too clearly delineated., and it panders some to the lit mag mentality that demands that the ill, the infirm, the old, the rural or the urban underclass be celebrated, but displays a firm sense of story and a fine resolution.<br />The second story, the title story, is terrific.  It is a tale of a man who yearns for love but finds only sex until he spirals down into the love of the lost.  It is told with energy, verve, passion, and some cunning, highlighted by a fine turn and a resolution that surprises but is just right.  Wilson lets himself go here in &quot;Hunger&quot; and he flies, but his hand is always on the throttle, a pinkie on the wheel, everything balanced and under control, or nearly so--which of course is just right.  The hunger is terrific and the prose lean and vivid as first love.  A man might write only one such story in his lifetime, but having done so, he is redeemed.  Incidentally there is a kind of pleasant and curious critical reflection on page 35 about the previous story, a kind of novelistic streaming together that I think may have been unconscious, the artist weaving his signature.<br />The next story, &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; is about a man's grandfather who is fading away, the founder of a bra-manufacturing company, a man who knows something the grandson needs to learn, and must before the man dies.  It is a beautiful story, philosophically and emotionally satisfying, told in a lyrical style as with a movie camera.<br />The story, &quot;I'm Invisible.  I'm safe.  I'm magic.,&quot; about a violinist is perhaps the most deeply felt.  I know it is the one that moved me the most.  It offers insight into how a violinist might think, what he might make of the world of contact sport and rock and roll.  It is a sad story about a man who practiced too much, who lived too little, a man who knew not himself, not his son, not his wife.  It is beautifully rendered, the exposition coming like layers of strata built up over time.<br />I'll stop here and observe that this is a fine collection, and that Wilson has a delicate sense of character, a firm grip on story, and an ability to surprise us and make us feel that everything fits. His style is graceful and poetic without being mannered or self-indulgent.  By the way, &quot;Hunger&quot; was the title of a novel by the great Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun published early in the twentieth century.  And of course Kafka wrote a story called, &quot;The Hunger Artist.&quot;  Hunger of the spirit and the psyche is an emotion well-known to writers.

1942624:US	49786731	R3D6FE9PHMJUMW	0970421400	230844280	The Information Inferno	Books	2	3	4	N	N	The book as flash and sound byte	I have been slow to review this book because my initial reaction was that I would not be able to write a positive review.  After further consideration, it occurs to me that perhaps I can write a helpful one.<br />To begin with, the intensive use of color and artwork that dominates every page is disconcerting and distracting.  It is particularly disagreeable when the artwork actually obscures the text, as it does on a number of pages.  When the reader has to squint and turn the page away from the light source to read the words, the reader tends to lose interest.  The glossy pages reflect light strongly and can produce eyestrain.  Secondly, the text, while offering important insights into the information overload that is part of our lives, is written in a disjointed manner so that there is no smooth flow of either idea or argument.  This alone is not necessarily a defect.  Certainly, one can see that Whodini was trying to covey the sense of disjointedness and alienation that the information age is having on us with the artwork and the sharp, bitten-off bytes of text that are laid over the artwork.  (Actually sometimes the artwork is partially laid over them!)  Thirdly, the cacophony of colored fonts changing with just about every page and even on the same page, gives one the sense of a high school lit journal, badly done.  If one looks at the presentation of books from the top book publishers, one sees that the idea is to make the font as non obtrusive as possible, just as an effective communicator does nothing to distract from the presentation of his ideas.  There is a harmony of typeset and only one font is used for text, always a serif font like Times Roman so that the eyes move smoothly from word to word.  Serif fonts tend to hold the eyes to the line of text.  Reading long lines of text in a sans serif font like that used in headlines makes for more difficult reading.  Fourthly, we use our eyes when reading in a very economical way, which is what allows the reader to read a lot of text without eyestrain.  We cannot be jerking the eyeballs around or continually changing our focus.  Do that for a while and your eyes get tired.  (Mine will actually ache.)  For the experienced reader, reading is preeminently a simulating and a relaxing experience.  Finally, the glossy pages of the book are so thick with material that the book is relatively speaking (for the number of pages) rather heavy, like the heft of thick, photo-filled magazines.<br />What about the idea itself, that is, can text, color and artwork be combined in such a way as to enhance the reading experience?  During the sixties this was tried and the attempt basically abandoned.  I note that Ram Dass's latest book  Still Here: Embracing Aging, Changing, and Dying (2000) (his best selling Be Here Now (1970) had a lot of sound-byte type artwork printed on paper bag-colored pages) is printed on tinted paper with small yantra-like adornments while the ink of the text is a muted light wine/purple color.  This made for a very attractive book, and one easily read.  I think the secret is that the artwork cannot distract from the text.  It must enhance it.  I am sure that Whodini understands this principle, and that the jarring and sometimes gothic and even grotesque artwork in his book was deliberately chosen because he believed it would enhance his text.  In some ways it definitely does.<br />There is a trend in publishing, now some decades old, in which the flow of text is frequently interrupted by sidebars and boxed text.  One sees this primarily in self-help type books.  The &quot;Idiot's...&quot; and &quot;The Dummies...&quot; guide books are the most visible examples, although there are many others, including most books on how to use software and many books on diet and health.  This trend is an attempt to reach a reading public that has been nurtured on television and newspapers, tabloids and magazines, and is not comfortable with reading long paragraphs of text, something that perhaps they associate with the nonrecreational reading required in school.<br />Which brings us to the practical problem.  The real book-reading public, the people who buy books on a regular basis for reasons other than self-help, is entrenched in its ways.  We love our books.  We love the feel of a book in the hand as we relax in an easy chair, taken away from the workaday world.  Reading as such is for many literally a meditation.  To be roused up emotionally is okay, but to be jarred with sharp, contrasting colors, shapes and images is not what the average reader wants.  Sometimes perhaps, but for the most part reading is to listen quietly to the words of another as they appear on a printed page.  Anything other than this must enhance and facilitate the experience, or at least, not detract from it.<br />Consequently, I don't think Whodini's idea as represented in this book is going to catch on any time soon.  I admire the attempt and applaud the creative effort, but I think this book would have worked better with straight text enhanced with some artwork.  Better yet, I think he might have made a documentary for television.hing that perhaps they associate with the nonrecreational reading required in school.  <br />Which brings us to the practical problem.

Clearly he sees the brain as a dynamic organism that creates its reality through a combination of sensory input and a constantly readied state of arousal that continually interprets the world and guesses about what to expect next, and then amends accordingly, again and again.  Thus his point of view for examining how the brain works is that of a &quot;moment of consciousness.&quot;<br />I particularly enjoyed the chapter on how complexity theory is being applied to brain research where McCrone makes the observation (p. 60) that &quot;The idea of a bounded object [say, us] is really just a convenient fiction.&quot;  McCrone recognizes that our brains and our minds are part and parcel of the world and cannot be understood alone.  The brain is a dynamic entity, not only constantly changing, but constantly interacting with both the environment within and the environment without.  Thus McCrone observes that &quot;Given the real world is a continuous place, and so exact starting points can never be measured, this means that it is impossible--as a matter of principle--to predict the behavior of a feedback-dependent system [like the brain]&quot; (pp. 64-65).  Ergo, the fall of a strict reductionism in the study of the brain, and the realization that the brain must be understood in light of not only its composition, its components, and its developmental history, but its dynamic nature.<br />I got less out of the chapters that reported on the current research, partially because of the fragmentary nature of the research, and partly because I am uncomfortable reading about experiments on the brains of monkeys, etc.  McCrone recognizes how &quot;animal experimentation&quot; has &quot;tainted the field,&quot; and he addresses these concerns to some extent.  (See particularly page 112.)  Fortunately the development of new high tech scanning devices is allowing researchers to study the brain without cutting it open or by relying on (in human subjects) neurological injuries to give them a glimpse of what is going on inside.  I was fascinated with McCrone's report that the way tennis players are able to react to a 140 mph serve is that they anticipate where the serve is going in part by reading the body language of the server before the ball is actually hit (and they don't even know they're doing it)!  In fact it is part of the brain's talent to predict.  As it readies itself for the next moment, the brain makes a prediction of what that moment will be like.  McCrone calls it &quot;riding a wave of predictions&quot; (p. 147).<br />McCrone makes it clear that it is as much in the process of development that we become who we are as it is in the genetic code.  He writes, &quot;there is just not enough room on a DNA molecule&quot; for all the information that the brain needs.  The brain, in a very real sense organizes itself as it grows in concert with the world.  If you watch a baby, you can see that the baby is working very, very hard to make sense of its world.<br />In the penultimate chapter, &quot;The Ape that Spoke,&quot; McCrone argues that the acquisition of language was critical to the development of consciousness.  He states that &quot;Animals are locked into the present tense,&quot; living &quot;entirely in the here and now,&quot; and that &quot;there is no reason to think that a monkey ever sits around mulling over the story of its life.&quot;  For those of us who have had close intimate relationships with animals, this is not so clear.  Personally, I think animals such as cats and dogs do have some sense of self, and that they do have some experience of the past, and can anticipate the future to some degree.  We really don't know about their level of self-awareness.  We can bereasonably sure it is less than ours of course, but I think there is a tendency in some quarters to underestimate what animals know.  I also don't agree with McCrone's notion that &quot;The invention of articulate, grammar-driven speech was also the invention of articulate, logic-driven thought&quot; (p. 288).  There was plenty of &quot;logic-driven thought&quot; before there was grammar; indeed animals often think logically, if their behavior is any indication.  (And there is no reason to think it isn't, to echo McCrone's words above.)  I think that because some of us are such highly verbal people, we tend not to notice that we think and figure out things logically at a level deeper than that of language.  Human language is often a translation of a more basic language.  Additionally, I think it is important to make a distinction between &quot;consciousness&quot; meaning &quot;awareness&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; meaning &quot;self-identity.&quot;  Whenever the word &quot;consciousness&quot; is used, I cringe a little because I know it will mean different things to different people and there is the very real danger of talking past one another.  Although McCrone does attempt to define consciousness as he goes along, he is to my mind not entirely successful.  For example, on page 265 he writes, &quot;So, again, what is consciousness?  In some sense, it must be the outcome a moment's processing.&quot;  Perhaps--but what does THAT mean?<br />We could argue other points; however, the main thing is this is a good book that gives the reader a vivid sense of what is going on in mind science these days, a field of knowledge that is growing very rapidly, and may some time soon experience a breakthrough of stunning proportions; or we may be entering a transition phase, near &quot;the edge of chaos&quot; from which may come some startling new conception of how the mind works and who we are..  We can be reasonably sure it is less than ours of course, but I think there is a tendency in some quarters to underestimate what animals know.  I also don't agree with McCrone's notion that &quot;The invention of articulate, grammar-driven speech was also the invention of articulate, logic-driven thought&quot; (p. 288).

1950444:US	49786731	R5TT31O2NDKXU	1573220493	81768402	STILL HERE: Embracing Aging, Changing, and Dying	Books	5	149	153	N	N	Inspirational, uplifting	Indeed Ram Dass is still here in this moment after a crippling stroke to guide us toward an understanding of our place among our fellows in the world as we grow old.  Once he was Richard Alpert, Harvard professor, and then, after turning on and dropping out in the sixties, became Ram Dass, author of the best-selling Be Here Now (1971), the axiom of the title from the ancients of the East thereby becoming a mantra for a generation of flower children.<br /><br />In this inspiring and eminently readable book, Ram Dass celebrates aging as a time of self-discovery and of selfless service to others.  What could be more appropriate for a man who has lived so passionately, who has traveled so widely and learned so much than to share his experience and wisdom with others?  And Ram Dass does it well, without sanctimonious posturing or self-serving claptrap, in a prose style that is familiar, warm and sharing, and at times brilliant.  Especially beautiful are the passages on pages 141-144 in which he recalls his Jewish home and then a visit to India in 1970.  Of course he does remind us of the many friends and note worthies he has met along the way; and, true, he is not adverse to indulging himself a little with reflections about how HE has been of service to the aged, the infirm, and the dying.  But this is only right.  There is, as we are freed from many of the constraints of society and its shallow proprieties, no place for a false modesty, and if one has done well, one should be pleased with oneself, and like Walt Whitman, celebrate oneself.  As a young man, Ram Dass went against the shared \\"wisdom\\" of the society that had so well nurtured him and sought his own way, and he found it.  He is to be admired and listened to.<br /><br />His way now is not that of renunciation, as one might expect from the Hindu influence on his life, but a more social orientation.  He practices karma yoga, from the Bhagavad Gita in which one finds salvation and freedom through the non-attached performance of one's duties--one's dharma--without expectation, without seeking reward or the fruit of labor.<br /><br />Ram Dass believes he suffered the stroke through the \\"fierce grace\\" of his guru because of this continued \\"attachment to the Ego\\" (pp. 200-201).  By learning a deeper level of suffering first hand he drew closer to God.  As his guru once said, \\"See?  That's the way it works.  Suffering does bring you closer to God.\\"  He was unable to totally renounce the delusions of this world, the social and political fruits that he loved so much, being such an intensely social person, and so the attachment remained.  Now confined to a wheelchair he spends more time \\"hanging out\\" with his guru (p. 202), the deceased Maharajji, whom he reveres as a god, which is the way of the guru-devotee relationship.  His faith was tested by the stroke, but he came away with his faith intact.  He writes in closing the book, \\"I know now that my faith is unshakeable.  That assurance is the highest gift I have received from the stroke...\\"<br /><br />I think the most important thing this book does is to inspire us to treat our advancing years with wisdom and dignity, with a sense of self worth and to discard the empty notions found in the noxious and insidious suggestion that growing old is some kind of disease or reason for shame.  Instead one embraces the natural changes that are taking place and sees them as a new challenge, full of unique surprises and experiences, and yes, pain and sorrow and loss.  It takes a strong and focused person to grow old gracefully.  (Growing old is not for the faint of heart!)  And finally there is an understanding that death is part of life, its fulfillment to be sure.  As Ram Dass writes on page 156, \\"by allowing the mystery of death...to inform our everyday life, we begin to see things anew.\\"  The key word is \\"inform.\\"  Death informs our life and makes it whole.  Like Browning's Rabbi Ben Ezra, we might also say, \\"Grow old along with me!/The best is yet to be\\"; and in believing that and living it, and knowing that death itself is a great adventure, we are freed.<br /><br />Ram Dass shares his experience through little stories about inspirational people he has met and how they guided him to an appreciation of what it means to change and grow old.  His gentle and uplifting style, emphasizing the spiritual aspects of life, make reading this book a warm and fulfilling experience.  Incidentally, the typographical style of the book, with its tinted pages with muted yantra symbols and the light wine/purple color of the letters makes for a very pretty book, pleasingly reminiscent of the wildly decorated, paper bag-colored pages of his best seller from long ago.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\"t is yet to be\\"; and in believing that and living it, and knowing that death itself is a great adventure, we are freed.<br /><br />Ram Dass shares his experience through little stories about inspirational people he has met and how they guided him to an appreciation of what it means to change and grow old.

It is from this point of view that he presents some of the ideas and controversies of current evolutionary theory along with some of the excitement of recent discoveries and understandings in a popular and nontechnical manner.  His readable text is aimed precisely at the educated nonspecialist, but without a hint of any dumbing down.<br />In the title chapter we learn that elephants pump the warm blood from the interior of their bodies to the array of tubes in their ears to dissipate excess body heat.  From this consideration Lavers is led to a discussion of whether dinosaurs were warm blooded or not.  The evidence he presents makes it clear to this observer that they were, but his cautious conclusion is that the case hasn't been proven quite yet.  Lavers hints that the dinosaurs may have to be put in another category, perhaps somewhere between warm blooded and cold, or maybe even somewhere beyond.  How about: &quot;I'm hot-blooded, check it and see&quot; (to reprise a rock lyric).<br />Lavers goes to considerable depth to demonstrate how much we can learn by combining evidence from the fossil record with what we know about the metabolism of animals and how their bodies work.  Dinosaur anatomy, for example, strongly suggests a closer kinship with today's avian world than with the reptilian.  Furthermore, the large size of many dinosaurs is inconsistent with cold-bloodedness.  Reptiles can't get as big as a Brontosaurus because (for one thing) they would not be able to regulate their temperature.  Lavers points out that all the really big animals on earth today, with the exception of the giant tortoises, Komodo dragons and some snakes--and they aren't really that big--are warm-blooded.  He cites the arguments of Robert Bakker and others to conclude that T. Rex, for example, wouldn't have the metabolic power to run down prey if it were cold-blooded.<br />I found Lavers's discussion of the difference between non-oxygen-based metabolic reactions capable of &quot;supercharged&quot; bursts of short-lived energy typical of reptiles, and the sustainable aerobic reactions typical of mammals like dogs and humans very interesting.  The quick bursts are those of the sprinter who is wasted after at most a few hundred yards, while the aerobic engine sustains the pace of the long distance runner.  Also interesting is the material in the chapter &quot;Life on the Edge&quot; about how birds and mammals maintain their body temperatures in the climate extremes of the deserts and the polar regions of the earth.  Lavers notes that in very cold places there are no reptiles.<br />In some of this I am reminded of the famous and splendid essay by J. B. S. Haldane, &quot;On Being the Right Size,&quot; published many decades ago.  Lavers presents the same kind of reasoned argument based on physiology and anatomy to demonstrate why animals are built the way they are and why it would be difficult for them to be constructed otherwise.  One comes away from the reading with a sense of having learned something important and exciting, a sense of having acquired understanding, not merely a collection of facts.e between non-oxygen-based metabolic reactions capable of &quot;supercharged&quot; bursts of short-lived energy typical of reptiles, and the sustainable aerobic reactions typical of mammals like dogs and humans very interesting.

1974602:US	49786731	R31E64UD78HVCB	0674634411	104223568	On Human Nature	Books	5	303	316	N	N	Without euphemism	On reading this again after a couple of decades, I am struck with how brilliantly it is written. The subtlety and incisiveness of Wilson's prose is startling at times, and the sheer depth of his insight into human nature something close to breath-taking.  I am also surprised at how well this holds up after twenty-three years.  There is very little in Wilson's many acute observations that would need changing.  Also, it is interesting to see, in retrospect, that it is this book and not his monumental, Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975), that continues to serve as an exemplar for later texts.  For example, Paul Ehrlich's recent book on evolution was entitled On Human Natures (2000), the plural in the title demonstrating that it was written at least in part as a reaction to Wilson.  I also note that some other works including Matt Ridley's The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature.(1993), Robert Wright's The Moral Animal: Evolutionary Psychology and Everyday Life (1994), and most recently, Bobbi S. Low's Why Sex Matters: A Darwinian Look at Human Behavior (2000), are organized intellectually in such a manner as to directly update chapters in Wilson's book.<br /><br />On Human Nature was written as a continuation of Sociobiology, greatly expanding the final chapter, \\"Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology.\\"  In doing so, Wilson has met with reaction from some quarters similar to the reaction the Victorians gave Darwin.  Wilson's sociobiology was seen as a new rationale for the evils of eugenics and he was ostracized in the social science and humanities departments of colleges and universities throughout the United States and elsewhere.  Rereading this book, I can see why.  Wilson's primary \\"sin\\" is the unmitigated directness of his expression and his refusal to use the shield and obfuscation of politically correct language.  Thus he writes on page 203, \\"In the pages of The New York Review of Books, Commentary, The New Republic, Daedalus, National Review, Saturday Review, and other literary journals[,] articles dominate that read as if most of basic science had halted during the nineteenth century.\\"  On page 207, he avers, \\"Luddites and anti-intellectuals do not master the differential equations of thermodynamics or the biochemical cures of illness.  They stay in thatched huts and die young.\\"<br /><br />In the first instance, he has offended the intellectual establishment by pointing out their lack of education, and in the second his incisive expression sounds a bit elitist.  But Wilson is not an elitist, nor is he the evil eugenic bad boy that some would have us believe.  He is in fact a humanist and one of the world's most renowned scientists, a man who knows more about biology and evolution than most of his critics put together.<br /><br />I want to quote a little from the book to demonstrate the incisive style and the penetrating nature of Wilson's ideas, and in so doing, perhaps hint at just what it is that his critics find objectionable.  In the chapter on altruism, he writes, \\"The genius of human sociality is in fact the ease with which alliances are formed, broken, and reconstituted, always with strong emotional appeals to rules believed to be absolute\\" (p. 163).  Or similarly on the next page, \\"It is exquisitely human to make spiritual commitments that are absolute to the very moment they are broken.\\"  Or, \\"The genes hold culture on a leash.  The leash is very long, but inevitably values will be constrained in accordance with their effects on the human gene pool\\" (p. 167).  He ends the chapter with the stark, Dawkinsian conclusion that \\"Morality has no other demonstrable ultimate function\\" than to keep intact the genetic material.<br /><br />In the chapter on aggression, he posits, \\"The evolution of warfare was an autocatalytic reaction that could not be halted by any people, because to attempt to reverse the process unilaterally was to fall victim\\" (p. 116).  On the next page, he quotes Abba Eban on the occasion of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, \\"men use reason as a last resort.\\"<br /><br />In the chapter on religion, he argues that the ability of the individual to conform to the group dynamics of religion is in itself adaptive.  As he avers on page 184, \\"When the gods are served, the Darwinian fitness of the members of the tribe is the ultimate if unrecognized beneficiary.\\"<br /><br />It is easy to see why some people might be offended at such a frank and penetrating expression.  But one of the amazing things about Wilson is that he can be bluntly objective about humanity without being cynical.  I have always found his works to be surprisingly optimistic.  He has the ability to see human beings as animals, but as animals with their eyes on the stars.  In the final chapter entitled, \\"Hope,\\" Wilson presents his belief that our world will be improved as scientific materialism becomes the dominate mythology.  Note well this point: Wilson considers scientific materialism, like religion and the macabre dance of Marxist-Leninism, to be a mythology.  His point is that there is no final or transcending truth that we humans may discover; there is no body of knowledge or suite of disciplines that will lead us to absolute knowledge.  There are only better ways of ordering the environment and of understanding our predicament.  He believes that toward that end scientific materialism will be a clear improvement over the religious and political mythologies that now dominate our cultures.<br /><br />No one interested in evolutionary psychology can afford to miss this book, even though it is twenty-three years old.  It is a classic.  Anyone interested in human nature (yes, one may profitably generalize about human nature, as long as one understands what a generalization is, and appreciates its limitations) should read this book, one of the most significant ever written on a subject of unparalleled importance.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"n of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, \\"men use reason as a last resort.\\"<br /><br />In the chapter on religion, he argues that the ability of the individual to conform to the group dynamics of religion is in itself adaptive.

1979837:US	49786731	RKTHGC8I8NIIR	0345409469	137607328	The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Engaging and wise	The title is both a profound description of the human world before (and without) science, and an apt metaphor for what science really means to us.  In particular, Sagan refers in Chapter 7 to the world of Europe during the time of Pope Innocent VIII (was ever a personage more ironically named?) in which &quot;perhaps hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions&quot; of people were tortured and burned at the stake and/or dismembered or otherwise killed for being witches or for consorting with demons and other imagined agents of Satan (p. 122).  Sagan wants to remind us very lucky citizens of the twenty-first century just what it was like in the middle ages when the nature of truth was decided by the coercive power of authority and not by observation and evidence.  Where would we be without science? is the question of the book, and Sagan's title is the startling answer.  We would still be in the dark ages.<br />But what is this magical &quot;science&quot; that makes all the difference in the world?  It is common sense codified and repeatedly tested.  Instead of accepting the existence of demons or aliens or Satanic conspiracies based on reports from people, the person of common sense asks to SEE the demons.  She wants proof of their existence, and he wants that proof verified by others.  Sagan has what he calls a &quot;baloney detection kit&quot; (pp. 210-211) in which he has science confront new ideas.  This kit includes &quot;independent confirmation&quot; of the &quot;facts&quot;; the idea that &quot;arguments from authority carry little weight&quot;; the possibility of falsification; and the use of Occam's Razor.  Virtually everybody reading this review knows what Sagan means by these terms.  The astonishing fact, and one of the key points of his book, is that the overwhelming majority of people in this country and throughout the world do not.  The even more astonishing fact is that even some people with college educations are not clear about the need for evidence and independent confirmation of evidence before one can say that something is true, and knowing even then that this truth is only a tentative conclusion, forever subject to being overthrown by new evidence, evidence that might arrive tomorrow.<br />Many people are dissatisfied with this and want absolute certainty.  But what Sagan is at pains to say is that such &quot;certainty&quot; is never forthcoming in this world.  Such certainty is the province of religion.  An integral part of the human condition is to realize and accept the fact that we cannot have absolute certainty, that the best we can have is a candle in the dark, and that candle is science.  Without it we have an arbitrary truth, a truth of, by, and for authority.  And that kind of &quot;truth&quot; can hurt you if you happen not to be on the side of authority, or happen to fall out of grace with the powers that be.<br />The question arises, why is the method and the logic of science a mystery to so many people?  Sagan's answer is, it isn't taught in school.  This book is an attempt to right this wrong.  He would like to see the scientific method as part of our grade school curriculum, and see it continued on into college.  I would add that science is not intuitive.  It is not politically correct.  It is politically neutral and sometimes it is amazingly anti-intuitive.  People who make their living primarily with their political and intuitive (i.e., social) skills tend to be the ones most threatened and most ignorant of science.<br />Another question is, why do so many people still believe in demons and devils, aliens and astrology, Loch Ness monsters and dragons in the garage (a title of one of Sagan's chapters) when the overwhelming weight of evidence is against them?  Simple: we humans have a need to believe.  This need can either be satisfied with religion, or fairy tales from, e.g., the National Enquirer, or by the wonders of science.  Sagan would like to see the wonders of science get more play bothon the tube and in our classrooms.  He, like the current Pope, believes that science and religion can co-exist.  Of course this comes as no revelation to me, since I believe that properly understood, the stuff of religion must always be taken as symbolic and as a guide to how to live.  The literal interpretation of religious ideas and the insistence on absolute truths always leads to trouble, contradictions and eventually to an untenable position which must be defended with brutal force.  Sad to say.<br />Sagan examines many of the delusions of our times, e.g., alien abductions, the face on Mars, UFOs, creationism, astrology, telepathy, channeling, psychic healing, New Age fuzziness, etc.  In Chapter 9, entitled &quot;Therapy,&quot; Sagan deals with satanic ritual abuse charges, &quot;recovered&quot; memories of sexual abuse, the remembrance of previous lives, even memories of future lives (!) thought to be &quot;uncovered&quot; by some therapists.<br />This book is a celebration of science and an examination of the world of pseudoscience, why it exists and what can be done about lessening its negative effect on our lives.  Sagan celebrates the wonders of science and the discoveries of science while warning us against the dangers inherent in pseudoscience.  As a man who is as comfortable writing for Parade Magazine as he is addressing the National Academy of Sciences, you can be sure he is both easy to read and worth reading.  Too bad he is no longer with us.  His gentle and tolerant nature combined with his wisdom and his childlike excitement for life is already sorely missed.on the tube and in our classrooms.

1990407:US	49786731	R1EOUN0CGOTA5F	0679421912	814152407	Of Two Minds: The Growing Disorder in American Psychiatry	Books	4	19	24	N	N	An anthropologist studies the tribe	What do anthropologists do these days as the number of unstudied tribes in the wild has dwindled to something like zero?  They practice urban anthropology as they study various &quot;cultures&quot; within the larger society.  Here ethnographer, T. M. Luhrmann of the University of California, San Diego, takes a long look at the psychiatric profession and finds it split into two mind sets as it tumbles toward disorder.  On the left side we have the traditionalists who believe in the efficacy of psychodynamic psychotherapy (mainly Freudian psychoanalysis), and on the right, &quot;psychiatric science,&quot; the biomedical approach, characterized by the use of various psychopharmacological agents such as Prozac, lithium, clozapine, etc.  This bicameralization of psychiatry, Luhrmann argues, is in part the direct result of the rise of the managed care industry which is threatening to put psychodynamic psychotherapy (the &quot;talk&quot; cure) out of business because the insurance companies increasingly won't pay for lengthy psychoanalysis.  She sees the &quot;psychopharm&quot; cure, even though it is of limited effectiveness (with unknown long-term side effects) as taking over.  Thus we have the &quot;disorder&quot; in psychiatry.  Her conclusion is that psychotherapy and psychopharmacology together are the most effective method of treating mental illness.<br />In the course of her work, Luhrmann visited various mental health facilities where she observed their practices while she interviewed the doctors, the nurses, the staff and the patients.  She constructed composites of some of the personalities, gave them fictitious names, and quoted them.  Her style is lucid, and balanced almost to a fault.  For example, on page 269 where she is discussing patient advocacy groups, she refers to a magazine called Dendron which seeks alternatives to what it calls &quot;forced psychiatric drugging.&quot;  In the next paragraph she presents the alternative point of view of The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill which believes that &quot;mental illness is not the result of poor socialization and inadequate parenting but rather a medical condition in need of medical attention.&quot;  On page 278 she writes, &quot;...in the years of psychoanalytic dominance, the vulgarized psychoanalytic model was used to humiliate and insult the parents whose children suffered.&quot;  On page 286 she counters, &quot;The real dilemma...faced by our society...is whether we will allow the seductions of the vulgarized biomedical model to overcome our own responsible commitment to a complex view of human life.&quot;  Thus one can see that Luhrmann has become of two minds herself!<br />She is not, however, an entirely an unbiased observer.  As she points out in the Introduction, she got the idea for this study because she joined &quot;an anthropology department known for its long tradition of psychological anthropology,&quot; a discipline that &quot;grew out a tradition of using psychoanalytic ideas to make sense of cultural practices.&quot;  (The Freudian paradigm making sense of New Guinea tribesmen?  I think I'll just pass on THAT.)  Luhrmann's father is a psychiatrist, and although she maintains that her background &quot;was more cognitive&quot; her experience in writing this book included attending lectures designed to teach &quot;a clinical perspective on Freud and psychoanalysis&quot; (p. 3).  Consequently it is understandable that she supports the Freudian psychoanalytical approach.  Even so, Luhrmann does not shy away from quoting authorities to the effect that psychoanalytic theory is without a firm scientific basis.<br />However I don't think she goes far enough.  What really needs to be said is that the old Freudian psychoanalytic model in which the patient is psychoanalyzed for several years is no longer tenable.  It's not just that the insurance companies won't pay for it.  There have been many studies from Eysenck in 1952 to the present demonstrating the dubious effectiveness of psychotherapy, particularly in treating the heavyweights like schizophrenia and psychosis.  Luhrmann cites studies both for and against this conclusion.  She recalls the old &quot;mantra&quot; (p. 208) that &quot;both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology have the same crude success rate: a third of the time they work well; a third of the time, they have some impact; a third of the time they don't work at all.&quot;  She also makes the point that no one form of psychotherapy is superior to another, that it is the caring and the time spent with the therapist that helps, not the mode of therapy.  This last point is really the crux of the matter.  Luhrmann writes on page 202: &quot;If the moral authority of the scientist derives from the knowledge he acquires, the moral authority of the analyst derives from the love he gives.&quot;  On page 201 she quotes Elvin Semrad: &quot;The most important thing, the thing that makes the difference, the thing that we as psychiatrists are dealing in, is love and humanity.&quot;  It is NOT the Freudian mumble-jumble that helps patients (to the extent that they are helped), but it is the loving concern and care of the therapist.<br />If this is so, it raises the question, why do therapists need to go to medical school, need to study the now largely discredited Freudian mythology, need to spend years in psychoanalysis to be no more effective than a counselor from the local church?  The answer is they don't.  And this is part of the reason for the split and the crisis in psychiatry.  What needs to be gotten rid of, and I don't think Luhrmann really sees this, is the Freudian baggage.  Psychodynamic psychiatry really needs a framework and model more nearly consistent with the advances in knowledge about human beings that have occurred since the days of Freud.  Those old ideas of &quot;penis envy&quot; and Oedipus complex, etc., as significant factors in mental illness must be scrapped.  The revelations and the paradigms from cognitive psychology and evolutionary psychology need to replace the Freudian construct.the dubious effectiveness of psychotherapy, particularly in treating the heavyweights like schizophrenia and psychosis.

Thus she could be for Anita Hill and against Monica Lewinsky.  She is also the kind of person who is exquisitely sensitive to political power and its exercise, a person who knows both the importance and the limitations of political correctness.  Thus she can defend Bill Clinton and find fault with Al Gore.  She is also a terrific writer who can be vivid, candid, self-expressive and revealing, and very sharp with what she finds unacceptable.  Thus she can lecture women on the necessity to speak up when they feel harassed or overlooked for promotion while recognizing that the &quot;nuts and sluts defense&quot; to rape (her coinage) sometimes has validity.  She is not the kind of person you can pigeon hole.  Thus she can write a book about Sex and Power that really is about sex and power, with herself as participant from her experience at the Harvard Law School and within the Democratic party at the highest level, a friend of both Hillary and Bill Clinton, to being a victim of an ice pick rapist.  She can brag about her legs (p. 207) and admit that she calls her interns &quot;sweetie,&quot; touches them and has them run for coffee (p. 191) while making the most cogent arguments about the reality of sexual harassment in the workplace and how it harms both women and men.  She can be as political as the wiliest pol as she references a goody portion of the pantheon of feminist writers from Christina Hoff Sommers to Catharine A. MacKinnon, usually without letting us know where she might agree or disagree with them.<br />She begins with the observation that despite great strides made by women toward complete equality in our society there is still a tremendous disparity in the number of men and women in the top positions in corporate America, in the law, and in academia.  Estrich makes this clear beyond any shadow of a doubt as she cites the numbers.  The question is why.  The implication is that sex discrimination is still rampant at the top and the old boy's network and conspiracy just as intrenched as ever.  However, a more careful interpretation of the very statistics and observations that Estrich uses suggests that it is not sex discrimination alone that accounts for the lack of women at the top of Fortune 500 companies, but something else.<br />Call it smarts; not the lack of intelligence, but the possession of it.<br />The plain fact of the matter is that women have wisely chosen to put themselves and their families first, the pursuit of power and superfluous wealth a distant second.  Estrich has not.  That is her choice, and she wears it well, but it is not for everyone, or even for more than some of us.<br />Estrich understands this.  She has managed a splendid career, but she hasn't given up motherhood to do it.  She has a family, a son and a daughter. She argues that women have to be extraordinary to receive the same pay and rise to the same level as men.  She laments that some women don't want to rise to the top, and she chides her sisters who have risen for not helping other women climb the corporate ladder, wisely pointing out that women together weld more power than a woman alone.  She presents an agenda for &quot;Changing the Face of Corporate America&quot; (Chapter 7) by overcoming &quot;Motherhood as Destiny&quot; (Chapter 5) and easing the old boys off their &quot;Comfort Factor&quot; (Chapter 6).<br />What I think she may not completely understand is that women in general gain no reproductive advantage by being in positions of power.  Men do.  In fact the pursuit of power by men is largely motivated by a semi-conscious desire to maximize their reproductive power.  In today's world this may not work as well as it once did, but the desire is still there within the male psyche, to some extent an evolutionary hangover.  Even today with the extra money a man might make he can afforda second marriage and a second family, whereas a man of more modest means cannot.  He can afford a mistress.  In previously times, of course, he could, if he accumulated enough power and resources, acquire a whole harem.  A woman, however, can gain a reproductive advantage only by conceiving and giving birth to and raising more children.  Therein lies part of the reason that many women are not buying into the &quot;success at any cost&quot; mentality that corporations demand of their top executives.<br />In the latter part of the book, Estrich focuses on sex and political power, per se.  She acknowledges &quot;the route to power when all others are closed,&quot; when a woman may, like the &quot;great dames,&quot; use her sexuality (p. 206).  But she warns, &quot;sexuality takes you only so far. You don't run the world when you're on your knees&quot; (p. 207).<br />She ends the book with a clarion call to feminism and a tribute to what feminism did for her.  She laments the fact that many women today are choosing to be selfish and pursue their personal interests and needs before the &quot;mission,&quot; as she calls it on page 265.<br />Estrich writes with great fluidity and power.  She has the ability to express herself so that one understands every word.  She cites statistics and spins stories in a way that makes her points vivid and the implications and impacts clear and accessible with little effort on the part of the reader.  She is a great spokesperson for women's rights and feminist issues and she is someone to look up to and admire.a second marriage and a second family, whereas a man of more modest means cannot.

A woman, however, can gain a reproductive advantage only by conceiving and giving birth to and raising more children.  Therein lies part of the reason that many women are not buying into the &quot;success at any cost&quot; mentality that corporations demand of their top executives. <br />In the latter part of the book, Estrich focuses on sex and political power, per se.  She acknowledges &quot;the route to power when all others are closed,&quot; when a woman may, like the &quot;great dames,&quot; use her sexuality (p. 206).  But she warns, &quot;sexuality takes you only so far. You don't run the world when you're on your knees&quot; (p. 207).<br />She ends the book with a clarion call to feminism and a tribute to what feminism did for her.  She laments the fact that many women today are choosing to be selfish and pursue their personal interests and needs before the &quot;mission,&quot; as she calls it on page 265.<br />Estrich writes with great fluidity and power.  She has the ability to express herself so that one understands every word.  She cites statistics and spins stories in a way that makes her points vivid and the implications and impacts clear and accessible with little effort on the part of the reader.  She is a great spokesperson for women's rights and feminist issues and she is someone to look up to and admire.	2001-05-06

Once again the venerable champion of common sense assumes his role as the sorcerer's apprentice trying to sweep back the tide of pseudoscience.  And once again he provides insight into just how overwhelming that task really is.<br />There are 28 essays in this collection, all but one from Gardner's column in the Skeptical Inquirer.  They range over such matters as UFOs, religion, social science, astronomy, evolution versus creationism, etc. There is a chapter on &quot;Alan Sokal's Hilarious Hoax.&quot; ( I too thought it was pretty hilarious.  See my review of The Sokal Hoax: The Sham that Shook the Academy (2000).)  There is one on cannibalism in which I found Gardner's skepticism understandable, especially as he points out that it is always the other culture that makes the accusation; however his essay finally suggests that the debate may be more over the extent than in any doubt about its occurrence.  The Adam and Eve question is of course a joke, but the kind of joke that has been taken seriously by some for hundreds of years.  For me it's similar to the question about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.  More germane is the chapter, &quot;Freud's Flawed Theory of Dreams&quot; followed by &quot;Post-Freudian Dream Theory&quot; in which it is demonstrated once again that Freud was, shall we say, mistaken.<br />The chapter on Carlos Castaneda is illuminating in what it reveals about the gullibility of some anthropologists, while the essay on the ill-fated Heaven's Gate &quot;Bo and Peep&quot; cult is sad.  Gardner has some fun with Jean Houston, channeling master and New Age guru to Hillary Rodman Clinton.  Apparently Houston's spin on channeling is that it is a kind of trance experience that allows one to come into contact with Jung's &quot;collective unconscious&quot; (p. 125).  Notable is Gardner's accusation that Temple University &quot;has become a center for the promulgation of some of the wildest aspects of pseudoscience&quot; (p. 221).  (Can Harvard be next?)  I was amused to find that the &quot;urine therapy&quot; that Gardner takes apart really is predicated upon the use of human urine.  I had seen the name before but naively thought it was &quot;Your-reen therapy&quot; after somebody's surname!  The final chapter, &quot;Science and the Unknowable&quot; is a fine essay on the philosophy of science.<br />One of the very best reasons for reading Gardner is to appreciate how clear his expression is, and how readable he makes just about any subject (including the philosophy of science!).  He has a gift for making the abstract concrete and the obtuse transparent.  May his tribe increase.romulgation of some of the wildest aspects of pseudoscience&quot; (p. 221).  (Can Harvard be next?)

That they were hoisted with their own petar, as it were, was particularly pleasing to those of us who cannot abide pseudobabblese and academic gibberish, ingredients that have unfortunately become a staple of New Age and postmodern expression.  One hopes that the Sokal affair has opened the eyes of academia to the extent that intellectuals will now appreciate the importance of writing in a clear and communicative manner without fear that others can thereby discern the quality of their ideas.<br /><br />Here the editors of Lingua Franca have put together the definitive collection of articles on the entire succ&egrave;s de scandale including the text of physicist Alan Sokal's article itself, Sokal's revelation article in Lingua Franca, and the reply of the Social Text editors, Bruce Robbins and Andrew Ross, whose publication of Sokal's parody of social constructionist thought and expression brought about their academic embarrassment.  These are followed by selected letters to the editors in response to the affair.  I particularly enjoyed the insightful letters by Franco Moretti of Columbia University and Lee Smolin of Penn State.  Next are reactions from the press, both domestic and foreign, including stories by Stanley Fish, George Will, Bruce Latour, and seventeen others, including another piece by Alan Sokal from Le Monde (Paris).  Then we are treated to some longer essays, some with responses and counter responses, including some excellent work by Steven Weinberg and Barbara Epstein.  The final chapter entitled \\"Colloquies\\" provides some post bellum reflections by Andrew Ross, Sokal and others.  All of this is very entertaining.<br /><br />In addition to being entertained by this entirely engaging and balanced account I was given a kind of postgraduate course in social constructionist and postmodern thought and its critics.  I came away feeling that however one may feel about Sokal's hoax itself, one positive result has been to stimulate thought and discussion on postmodernism and bring those ideas to a wider public than had previously existed.  Whether that is good for postmodernism is problematic.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"ss, Sokal and others.

2013052:US	49786731	R3CX8P1R79U14C	0195120353	659365800	Lifelines: Biology Beyond Determinism	Books	3	29	40	N	N	Argues against reductionism in biology	We are not objects.  We cannot be defined by our genes.  It is only through an understanding of our developmental history in interaction with our environment that we can hope to know who we are.<br /><br />Thus Steven Rose, molecular brain biologist and staunch foe of reductionist biology, has called upon the metaphor \\"lifelines\\" to describe our \\"trajectory\\" through time and space.  We are processes.  Furthermore, we are not passive processes, tossed hither and yon through life by a blind watchmaker and the dictates of our selfish genes, but active participants, helping to shape our destinies as we go along.  We are to some significant degree \\"self-created.\\"  Rose writes: \\"The central property of life is the capacity and necessity to build, maintain and preserve itself, a process known as autopoiesis\\" (p. 18).  On page 6, he opines, \\"We are...the products of the constant dialectic between the biological and the social.\\"<br /><br />Rose also points out that our ability to perform experiments in the real world is limited; how even the most dedicated and thorough scientist in the field can only hope to observe a sampling of the behavior of the animals he or she is watching; how the variables in the real world are so very, very many; and how our attempts to control them can actually result in a falsification of the environment we want to observe.  He argues convincingly that the hard sciences, especially physics, have yielded to reduction simply because they are not anywhere near as complex as biology.<br /><br />Consequently I was very impressed with this book for the first 174 pages or so.  Then came the chapters on evolution.  Suddenly Rose unaccountably loses his objectivity and his reasoned tone and starts inventing straw men, one he calls \\"sociobiology\\" and puts these macho words in its mouth: \\"Males and their sperm compete, females and their ova quiescently await their fate\\" (p. 198).<br /><br />Oops, have I picked up the wrong book?  Could this be some rad fem polemic intent on winning some political point?  This claim that sociobiologists think that females \\"await their fate\\" is particularly startling since on the previous page Rose writes that \\"Darwin's view was that, by and large, it is the female of the species that does the choosing.\\"  Rose then mocks the idea that there might be universal standards of beauty (that would be politically incorrect, no doubt).  But the truth is, that while people can and do differ in details, a young, healthy, well-proportioned (\\"symmetrical,\\" if you will) woman is recognized as attractive in any culture that I have ever heard of.  On the next page (199) he makes fun of the idea that human females may choose males with resources (\\"the Porsche and the Rolex\\") adding that \\"wealth is no measure of genetic fitness...nor is there much evidence that its possession results in a greater number of offspring.\\"<br /><br />Rose knows this is fatuous.  It is universally recognized that females across cultures prefer men of means.  Why would a reasonable woman, given a choice, choose a poor, ineffective, unsuccessful man, to one who has the ability to help her provide for her children?  Rose allows that sexual selection \\"may be--probably is--an important mechanism...but...we should not let its enthusiasts blind us to the more obvious explanations for the complexity of human sexual arrangements.\\"  Those \\"enthusiasts\\" are, one presumes, misguided sociobiologists.  (Perhaps Rose would like to be regarded as a biology \\"enthusiast.\\")  And just what are those \\"more obvious explanations\\"?  Rose does not say.<br /><br />He goes on to altruism but doesn't mention the handicap principle from Zahavi, Amotz and Avishag. The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle (1997), which I recommend that he read.  This principle accounts for some acts of altruism by showing that such acts are the advertising of one's ability to others, in particular members of the opposite sex, and are therefore adaptive.  Hecloses the section with a story about \\"two human sociobiologists\\" who thought that they had demonstrated that parents who both voted Conservative were more likely to send their child to a private school.  Oh boy, and I might find two biologists who voted Liberal who were therefore more likely to send their child to a non-denominational school.  As Rose's esteemed colleague, Steven Jay Gould likes to say, \\"So what?\\"<br /><br />Rose begins the next chapter by asserting that \\"ultra-Darwinism\\" has \\"a metaphysical foundation\\" that includes the premise that \\"the purpose...of life is reproduction.\\"  I don't know who these \\"ultra-Darwinians\\" are but most experts on evolution tend toward the idea that \\"purpose\\" is an anthropological idea inconsistent with evolutionary theory.<br /><br />So why is this book reasonable and fair three quarters of the way through and then suddenly we come upon prejudicial attacks against nonexistent bogeymen?  It's the same old problem: a personal agenda.  No matter how expert one may be, if the subject strays to the area of one's prejudices there is the chance that one may suddenly become as fair and objective as a radio talk show host.<br /><br />What Rose wants to save us from is determinism, particularly genetic determinism.  He thinks that determinism in biology or psychology may lead to the justification of some discredited ideas from eugenics.  I don't agree.  I think we can safely bury eugenics and such delusions as I.Q. and racial significance.  The ghosts of the past are scary and we should be on watch, but we don't have to discredit the insights and accomplishments of sociobiology and/or evolutionary psychology by falsely associating them with those old, tired delusions.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"closes the section with a story about \\"two human sociobiologists\\" who thought that they had demonstrated that parents who both voted Conservative were more likely to send their child to a private school.

Of course we have to realize that he is talking about reading literature, not science, not history, not politics, not pop psychology, and certainly not the latest best seller!  Furthermore I'm sure his editor and publisher, looking to the marketplace, insisted on the spin, since this is first and foremost a work of literary criticism, and only tangentially a &quot;how to.&quot;<br />Herein Professor Bloom, esteemed literary critic and internationally acclaimed scholar, discourses on mostly English and European literature bringing his usual infectious enthusiasm to the task at hand so that one is inspired to take up again Hamlet or The Charterhouse of Parma or to finish Proust.  I have read literary criticism for many years, partially because when I was young I thought reading it would help make me a better writer; but as the years have gone by, more and more I read it as an inspiration to further reading and rereading.  Bloom is a particularly good reading companion because of his great erudition and his love of literature, but also because he is a very fine writer himself, and one can learn from his prose.<br />His muse for the art and practice of reading is Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom he greatly admires, along with Bacon and Emerson.  His &quot;why&quot; of reading, presented on page 22, comes from a (too studied, in my opinion) fusion of their reasons: &quot;find what comes near to you that can be put to the use of weighing and considering, and that addresses you as though you share the one nature, free of time's tyranny.&quot;  For all serious readers, time indeed is a tyranny because there really are so many books and so little time.<br />Bloom organizes his book into five chapters: &quot;Short Stories,&quot; &quot;Poems,&quot; &quot;Novels, Part I,&quot; &quot;Plays,&quot; and Novels, Part II.&quot;  The novels of Part I are European novels, including Don Quixote, Emma, Crime and Punishment, etc.  Those of Part II are American, e.g., Moby-Dick, As I Lay Dying, Song of Solomon and four others.  The short stories include works by Turgenev, Chekhov, Maupassant , Hemingway, Flannery O'Connor, Nabokov, etc.  The poems discussed are all by our greatest poets, including Shakespeare, Keats, Shelley, Browning, Whitman, Dickinson, etc.  There is a fine piece on Coleridge's &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Marnier.&quot;  The three plays discussed are the Bard's Hamlet, Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, and Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest.<br />Bloom makes it clear that his most admired writer is Shakespeare, on whose work he is an expert, and Hamlet his favorite play, a prejudice I share.  Part of the fun of this book, however is in Bloom's asides on writers perhaps of the second rank, and his insights into the current status of literature.  On display throughout is an incisive and authoritative writing style that one can only admire and enjoy, but not duplicate.  Here's an example of what I mean from page 249:<br />&quot;We will have no more Nathanael Wests; literary parody expired with him, though it had a brief afterglow in his brother-in-law, S. J. Perelman.  Flare-ups of the mode in the late Terry Southern and in the metamorphic Gore Vidal have subsided.  There were Hemingway's self-parodies, in his later years, and Norman Mailer's still later parodies, both of Hemingway and himself.  All these formidable talents have been subsumed by American media realities; who can match television news and talking heads, and even the daily New York Times, in self-parody?  Reality in American is more grotesque and hilarious than any parodist could hope to trump.  There is something curiously wistful now about Miss Lonelyhearts, a judgment upon my part that would have infuriated Nathanael West.  Still, he was not a satirist, secretly hoping to improve us, but a demonic parodist, providing some music to celebrate our march down into hell.&quot;oviding some music to celebrate our march down into hell.&quot;	2001-04-27
2039463:US	49786731	R1K15GU0032HP2	0393049841	277194283	Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Fine memoir with insight into the business	Many successful careers are the result of surprising and totally unpredictable turns of events, particularly turns of a psychological kind.  Jason Epstein originally went into the book business to associate with authors and to learn from them first hand as a continuing education, with the distant idea of becoming a writer himself.  To his surprise he turned out to be something of a visionary and a sharp, effective publisher, whose romantic, yet business-like nature fitted the New York publishing world like a well-tailored suit.  He had discovered, as he puts it on page 59, &quot;that literature, like all religions, is also a business, though not a very good business.&quot;<br />Epstein sought to make it better, and in succeeding represents that rare species, the romantic as a successful book publisher.  The emphasis should be on the word &quot;successful,&quot; of course, but I'll emphasize the romantic because in the book business they (at least in my modest experience) they are now as rare as dodos, and for similar reasons.  Epstein's delicious and gracefully written little memoir recalls his fifty years in publishing with the kind of understated, buttoned-down, perceptive style that one associates with the New York world of books before the rise of the conglomerates and the block buster mentality.  There are chewy reminiscents of Edmund Wilson and Vladimir Nabokov, of Faulkner with brown bags under his arms, of Donald Klopfer and Bennet Cerf who &quot;accidentally&quot; became a millionaire because of his love of quality books, and many other illuminati, curious creatures from a more genteel time when literature mattered, and the bottom line was secondary.<br />But, as the title insists, Epstein is looking forward as well as backward, supplementing the story with forecasts and guesses about the future.  He believes that the Internet, &quot;the electronic literary marketplace,&quot; is going to revolutionize the business in ways we cannot guess, and the scope of the changes will be comparable to those brought about by the invention of movable type.  He sees machines capable of printing a single copy of a book downloaded from the Internet on the corner of his Manhattan street or &quot;at the headwaters of the Nile&quot; or &quot;in the foothills of the Himalayas&quot; or even in our homes (p. xii).  He compares Amazon.com's margin problems to his experience with The Reader's Catalog and the direct-mail selling of books.  Because of his past success in anticipating trends and because of his innovative skill, people in the business will read this book with mercenary as well as nostalgic interest.<br />Besides editing some of the great writers of our time (the book jacket contains praise and appreciation from Toni Morrison, Norman Mailer, Michael Korda and E. L. Doctorow) Epstein was the first to see the potential for quality paperbacks with his launching of Anchor Books in 1952.  He also started the very influential The New York Review of Books in1963 opportunely during a strike that shut down The New York Times and its Book Review.  Epstein was also instrumental with in bringing about the Library of America, a story he recounts in the chapter entitled &quot;Groves of Academe.&quot;<br />Others have remarked on the clear and even elegant style of this memoir; and it is certainly pleasant to praise an editor for his writing ability.  I would like to join the chorus and add that I recognize a lesson he is implicitly teaching, namely that of brevity and economy of expression, but with a kind of leisurely urbanity that is unafraid of the complex sentence.  One can also see that every sentence was polished, resulting in that seeming serendipity known to every editor as the easy reading that comes from hard work.  Note however the missing word &quot;year&quot; near the end of page 60, and the unclear sentence spanning pages 97 and 98.  (I take a writer's delight in, as it were, &quot;editing&quot; an editor!)<br />It might be noted that one of the pleasures of writing a memoir is to thank (and to make look good) one's friends and the people one admires (which Epstein does very well), while slyly, almost inadvertently, assassinating the character of others.  Epstein indulges himself sparingly, but gives it to Vladimir Nabokov right between the eyes.  His recall of the celebrated author of Lolita aping an American tourist at a Manhattan restaurant while cheering on Nixon and our tragic involvement in Vietnam is unsettling.  His sketch of Bennet Cerf is warm and admiring without any insincerity, and his recall of half a dozen other editors and publishers seems objective and even kindly.  Epstein comes across as a man pleased with himself and the world and what he has done with his life.that one of the pleasures of writing a memoir is to thank (and to make look good) one's friends and the people one admires (which Epstein does very well), while slyly, almost inadvertently, assassinating the character of others.

2045230:US	49786731	R27IUY1DUXV22M	1582430586	76720439	Life Is a Miracle: An Essay Against Modern Superstition	Books	3	96	123	N	N	A passionate sermon on science as a modern superstition	I think most of us share essayist Wendell Berry's frustration with the dehumanization of our lives that is a by product of the massive industrialization of the planet.  Life is cheapened and the sense of the miraculous lost as we chase blindly after more and more products that glitter, and as we destroy more and more of our fellow creatures and their habitats in order to feed our insatiable appetites.  But to blame science as Berry does is mistaken.  Science is just a tool, and scientists, like farmers, are just tool users.  The real culprit is ourselves and our politicians, our multinational corporations, our governments and our indifference.  To single out E.O. Wilson, entomologist and the somewhat county philosopher and founder of sociobiology, as the whipping boy, as Berry does here, is unfair.  There are better targets.<br />Still, much of what Berry is concerned about concerns us all, and I like his noble and emphatic style.  I just wish he would concentrate on the real villains, the &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; that Eisenhower warned us about, which now includes, according to Berry (and I do in part agree), our universities and the medical establishment.  But Berry repeatedly sprays at the wrong targets in an indiscriminate manner.  He calls pollution &quot;the most ubiquitous result of modern chemistry&quot; (p. 20).  We're all against pollution, but it is not the most ubiquitous result nor is it caused by science.  It is caused by industry.  The most ubiquitous result of modern chemistry is the increase in the number of people on this planet (chemistry has helped us grow more food).  Our pollution of the planet is a side effect caused by the failure of our institutions to confront the problem.<br />Some of this book is a one-sided debate with Wilson about what belongs to religion and/or the arts and what belongs to science.  Berry thinks that Wilson and modern science have overstepped.  He believes that it is &quot;a wise instinct...that some things are and ought to be forbidden to us,&quot; quoting Wes Jackson on page 76.  That we ought &quot;to say out of the nuclei&quot; is much easier said than done.  The genie will not go back into the bottle.  Human beings cannot be &quot;forbidden&quot; by scripture or otherwise from exploring what they find interesting.  It may be our undoing, but it is also our glory.  Berry is understandably concerned that agribusiness and the corporation will pave over his farm and rob him and his family of their sense of place and heritage and all that is important to him.  I hope they don't.  But I should point out that farmers once took the place and heritage of hunter and gatherers 10,000 years ago, turning their pristine Eden into great tracts of grain and cows and horses and pigs and dogs, rats and mice and flies, thereby irrevocably altering and destroying the landscape.  The diversity of Berry's farm is nothing like the diversity that existed before agriculture.  Would he like to go back to that?<br />Berry's assertion, &quot;...if you think creatures are machines, you have no religion&quot; (p. 51), recalls the state of mind that says, if you don't believe in my God, you have no religion.  Furthermore, Berry has now truncated Wilson's &quot;biological machines&quot; (which is only a metaphor and Berry knows this) to &quot;machines,&quot; the better to ridicule anybody who would use such a metaphor.  On p. 54 he avers that there is a &quot;widespread belief that creatures are machines&quot;; but since most people believe in a personal God, in angels, etc., I think he is wrong.  There ARE people who see creatures as machines.  They are dictators, some corporate CEOs and some politicians, and perhaps the people at Zacky Farms.<br />Also at issue is determinism.  Berry quotes Wilson (p. 26) as making the point that we have the &quot;illusion of free will&quot; and that it is &quot;biologically adaptive,&quot; a point that Berry does not understand (although he tried).  To appreciate what Wilson is saying, perhaps it would help Berry to free himself from his Christian bearings for a moment and consider this central tenet of Buddhism: life is suffering.  Given that, being able to fool oneself certainly could be adaptive.  I mention this because much of Berry's misunderstanding of Wilson is due to his limited world view.  He is proud of being local and not wanting to know everything, but the price he pays is that he will misunderstand others who have had different experiences and who see the world in a different, no less viable, way.<br />I think Berry is definitely right about the &quot;two cultures&quot; (C.P. Snow, 1959): &quot;To believe that the arts can be interpreted so as to make them consilient with biology or physics is about equivalent to the belief that literary classics can survive as comic books or movies&quot; (p. 117).  Wilson's &quot;Consilience,&quot; as noble as the idea may be, is probably not going to happen any time soon, and may be, as Berry has it, impossible (p. 95).  Berry argues convincingly that the arts are qualitatively different than science and would no longer be the arts if they used the same methods as science.<br />Finally I have to say that Berry's  perception that &quot;the conflict between creatures and machines...under industrialism has resulted...in an almost continuous sequence of victories of machines over creatures&quot; (p. 54) seems to me to be a postmodern Luddite delusion.  &quot;Industrialism&quot; (something closer to the real enemy, not Wilson or science) hasn't been continuously victorious at all.  The standard of living in most of the world has improved, and where it hasn't, overpopulation and corruption are the better to blame.  This is not to say that industrialization is not a danger and has not already greatly harmed our planet.  It is and it has.  But we (not Wilson, not science) are to blame for the malevolent effects of industrialization and it is we who must do something about them.ppreciate what Wilson is saying, perhaps it would help Berry to free himself from his Christian bearings for a moment and consider this central tenet of Buddhism: life is suffering.

Berry argues convincingly that the arts are qualitatively different than science and would no longer be the arts if they used the same methods as science.<br />Finally I have to say that Berry's  perception that &quot;the conflict between creatures and machines...under industrialism has resulted...in an almost continuous sequence of victories of machines over creatures&quot; (p. 54) seems to me to be a postmodern Luddite delusion.  &quot;Industrialism&quot; (something closer to the real enemy, not Wilson or science) hasn't been continuously victorious at all.  The standard of living in most of the world has improved, and where it hasn't, overpopulation and corruption are the better to blame.  This is not to say that industrialization is not a danger and has not already greatly harmed our planet.  It is and it has.  But we (not Wilson, not science) are to blame for the malevolent effects of industrialization and it is we who must do something about them.	2001-04-04

The authors begin by branding evolutionary psychology &quot;henceforward EP&quot; as &quot;a particularly Anglo-American phenomenon,&quot; and reference this claim with a footnote on page 16 stating that &quot;Other European countries, notably France, have been less overwhelmed by Darwinian evolutionary theory.&quot; One wonders at the point of this.  How does it play in China or Japan?  On the other hand, maybe they're after evolutionary theory itself and not just EP!  One also wonders what the acceptance of &quot;Darwinian evolutionary theory&quot; by some countries and not by others (even if that was somehow demonstrated) has to do with a critique of evolutionary psychology.  If France has not been &quot;overwhelmed by evolutionary theory&quot; perhaps the worst for France.  And who says Anglo-Americans have been overwhelmed by Darwinian evolutionary theory?  Most Americans, at any rate, still believe in angels!<br />This sort of slippery, non sequitur-filled prose is, alas, typical of much of what follows.  Here's another quick example, in a footnote on page 16.  They authors reference a poll from the journal Science showing &quot;that a great majority of life scientists are now non-believers.&quot;  Incredibly, they follow this immediately with the nonlogical: &quot;Physicists are less hostile to religion...&quot; seemingly innocent of the fact that being a non-believer does NOT necessarily imply hostility to religion!  Still on page two the authors write, &quot;It [evolutionary psychology] claims to explain all aspects of human behavior...on the basis of ...features&quot; formed &quot;during the infancy of our species some 100,000-600,000 years ago.&quot;  ALL?  Who said &quot;all&quot;?  There is no footnote.  Evolutionary psychologists emphatically do NOT claim to explain all aspects of human behavior.  EP is a guide to human tendencies based on insights provided by the process of evolution, nothing more, and, importantly, nothing less.<br />By the way, this fictional character that attempts to explain all aspects of human behavior with EP, is straw man number one.  There are, alas, many more to come in this book.  As other reviewers have pointed out the style here is to set up easy targets that have little or nothing to do with evolutionary psychology, and then throw rocks at them.  They are afraid of something and that something is the truth.<br />I'll skip past the rest of the Introduction penned by Hilary Rose and Steven Rose and go on to the articles edited.  The first, by sociologist Dorothy Nelkin, doesn't even attempt to address the validity of evolutionary psychology at all.  What it attempts to do, and it does that poorly enough, is to claim that the proponents of EP are using &quot;missionary fervor&quot; (p. 23) and a &quot;quasi-religious narrative&quot; (p. 30) &quot;seeking to convert others to their beliefs&quot; (p. 23), an accusation that is practically laughable, but even if true would amount as a criticism of EP to nothing more than another  non sequitur.  Nelkin uses as support for her (totally irrelevant) argument the religious fervor displayed by sociobiologist E.O. Wilson in his book, Consilience (1998).  She also brings physicists Leon Lederman, Steven Weinberg, and Stephen Hawking into it because of their apparent religious fervor in expressing the wonders of physics.  (By the way, both Nelkin and the author of the next essay bring the physicist's dream of a &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; into the discussion as an analogue of EP; but again that is a straw man: evolutionary psychology does not pretend to be a theory of everything, psychological or otherwise.)  One wonders why the physicists are brought into the fray.  Perhaps it is because they are &quot;hard&quot; scientists (those meanies) and not sociologists.  Anyway, I guess Nelkin thought it wouldbe cute to accuse evolutionary psychology of being too religious.<br />The second essay by Charles Jencks would appear to be mostly an ad hominem attack on E.O. Wilson, albeit gently and cleverly done. Actually it is a rather well-reasoned satirical critique of EP, lambasting its limitations in a comedic rhetorical style sure to delight &quot;non-believers,&quot; using an observation of Wilson during a conference on postmodernism in Boston in 1998 as a narrative device.  Jencks is an architect and Mr. Postmodern who is also to my mind a very fine creative writer.  But I would remind him that ALL psychologies are limited, and so to criticize evolutionary psychology for being limited in what it can tell us about ourselves, isn't much of a criticism, unless one can also argue that cognitive, or behaviorism, or psychoanalytic, or some other psychology is superior.  I happen to think, as I have said before, that the psychologies found in the great world religions are superior to any of the academic psychologies.  Only evolutionary psychology is able to offer something with the same kind of antediluvian power.  Jencks does not mention other psychologies.  He does claim that Wilson, at the end of his lecture, went from the &quot;is&quot; of evolutionary psychology (which is really how to understand and appreciate EP) to the &quot;ought&quot; of a moral imperative, the classic error incidentally made by many who criticize EP.  Problem is, Jencks doesn't reveal what Wilson said that convinced him that Wilson had gone too far (maybe I missed it).  I do know from having read several of Wilson's books that he knows better than to fall into that trap.  I wish I could say the same for the Roses.<br />This is by way of signing off: I am about to exceed Amazon.com's 1,000-word limit.  Some of the other reviews below comment very intelligently on some of the other essays.  I particularly recommend the reviews by Todd I. Stark and A.P. Jackson.be cute to accuse evolutionary psychology of being too religious.<br />The second essay by Charles Jencks would appear to be mostly an ad hominem attack on E.O.

2052350:US	49786731	R2HUWKHONCUCQK	155963779X	783017384	Human Natures: Genes, Cultures, and the Human Prospect	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of the best books on human evolution	This ambitious work, the magnum opus of Paul Ehrlich, Bing Professor of Population Studies and of Biological Sciences at Stanford University, and the popular author of the best selling The Population Bomb (1968) and many other works, is quite a challenge for any reviewer.  Perhaps I should begin with the footnotes.  There are too many of them.  On page 32, for example, Ehrlich writes &quot;...twelve populations of a gut bacterium have now been tracked...&quot; footnoting the word &quot;bacterium.&quot;  When one turns to the back of the book, one finds simply, &quot;Escherichia coli.&quot;  Perhaps it would be better to have written &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; in the first place!  And something needs to be done about letting us know which footnotes are extensions of the text (afterthoughts, clarifications, etc., that we might want to go chasing after) and which are merely references.  Of course this is a problem with all extensive works of scholarship.  I suggest two sets of notes: one for references and one for clarifications, indicated perhaps by numbers for one and alphabetic letters for the other.  There are 100 pages of footnotes here (1,909 footnotes!) and 76 pages of works referenced.  The index--a particularly good one, by the way--covers 18 double-columned pages.<br />Footnotes aside, this is a book that in a sense summarizes a long and much laureled career written by a man whose work and accomplishments we can all appreciate regardless of whether we agree with his sometimes all too politically correct conclusions.  Human Natures, despite Ehrlich's careful avoidable of such terminology, is about evolutionary psychology; that is, about how our understanding of evolution and our place as evolved and evolving beings affects how we view ourselves and our prospects.  His &quot;human natures&quot; are derived from a survey of a vast literature including the work of anthropologists, ethnologists, sociologists, biologists, sociobiologists, psychologists, evolutionary psychologists, ecologists, demographers, geneticists, behavioral geneticists, historians, etc., etc.  (This splintering and proliferation of disciplines as we enter the third millennium of the current era makes one long for consilience!)  Most of these disciplines and many others have as their unifying principle the process of evolution. Ehrlich writes in the Preface (p. xi) &quot;I want to show how a greater familiarity with evolution might contribute to our resolving...the human predicament.&quot;  Ehrlich is referring to cultural evolution as well as biological.  His primary thesis, that we are not of one &quot;human nature&quot; but of various &quot;human natures,&quot; is implicit throughout.  Made explicit on page 227, is his belief that since the beginning of agriculture 10,000 years ago we human beings have been, and continue to be, more subject to the forces of cultural evolution than we are to biological evolution.  He writes, &quot;cultural evolution...at this stage of our development begins to swamp the more gradual processes of biological evolution.&quot;  It's clear that he wants to emphasize cultural evolution because we can do something about it, whereas to change our biological nature would involve human genetic engineering, a process that Ehrlich is understandably loathe to endorse (see especially page 66).<br />Ehrlich argues strongly for the plasticity of human behavior.  He doesn't like generalizations about  innate behavior.  This can be seen particularly in his analysis of the causes of war in the Chapter 11.  He insists with some exasperation that &quot;It is senseless from any viewpoint for people to keep acting as if it were either possible or pertinent to determine whether human beings are innately aggressive or innately pacific&quot; (p. 264).  Ehrlich wants to encourage the idea that education can lead to more desirable behaviors.  If our behavior is innate, then perhaps we can't be blamed for it, and furthermore (and worse) we can'tdo anything about it in terms of education, etc.  It is this fatalism that Ehrlich is preaching against.<br />In short, Ehrlich takes what might be considered a caring, &quot;liberal,&quot; politically correct view of human nature as opposed to some others who see us merely acting out our genetically and culturally derived destinies.  His position is comforting, but strange to say I really see little or no difference between his PC version of &quot;human natures&quot; and, e.g., Edward O. Wilson's much maligned amoral view.  I think a lot of the differences are really matters of terminology and emphasis.<br />I want to add a couple of clarifications.  Apparently Ehrlich is unaware of the full significance of &quot;the handicap principle&quot;advanced by Amotz and Avishag Zahavi in their book of the same name (1997) which in part explains altruism beyond kinship and reciprocity, namely that altruism is sometimes an advertisement to potential mates of one's fitness.  Also in the chapter entitled &quot;Why Men Rule&quot; Ehrlich points to men being bigger as one of the reasons they rule, and to their being freer (because they have less of a reproductive burden) as another.  But as Bobbi Low has pointed out in her Why Sex Matters (2000) men rule because there is no reproductive advantage to be gained by women in taking the reigns of power. Whereas men have been able to gain greater sexual access to females by becoming rulers and thereby increase their reproductive fitness (Bill Clinton, notwithstanding), women gain little to nothing in securing access to more males.<br />Also there is the matter of the synchronization of menstrual cycles by women living together discussed on page 182.  Ehrlich says the evolutionary significance is unknown.  Actually it's fairly clear: in a harem situation if the females become fertile all at the same time, this provides an opportunity to more broadly mix the gene pool because the harem master can't possibly do it all himself, and so other males may get an opportunity.  This embarrassment of riches for the harem master reminds me of the walnut tree producing so many seeds in a boon year that the squirrels can't possible eat them all.<br />This is a great book engagingly written by a man at the pinnacle of his career, a man I admire and respect.rse) we can't do anything about it in terms of education, etc.  It is this fatalism that Ehrlich is preaching against.<br />In short, Ehrlich takes what might be considered a caring, &quot;liberal,&quot; politically correct view of human nature as opposed to some others who see us merely acting out our genetically and culturally derived destinies.

There's a distinct nineteenth century feel to this wide-ranging collection of mostly American verse, as though perhaps one might encounter the book by the bedside of Huck Finn's benefactor, the Widow Douglas.  Ah, but it's really not that old.  First published in 1936 and dedicated to the memory of Adolph S. Ochs, long-time publisher of the New York Times, by editor Hazel Felleman, this is a collection for Everyman.  The fact that it's still in print is tribute to Felleman's good sense of what people like.  No known species of poetry is shunned.  Verse, ditty and doggerel stand side by side with Shelley and Keats (but no Shakespeare!).  There are rousing Sousa stanzas and homey hymn-like lines respecting home and hearth, flag and country, and tributes to the dog.  There are also epigrams and epithets and limericks and songs sung blue.  Felleman arranges the contents by subject matter, beginning with \\"Love and Friendship\\" followed by \\"Inspiration\\" through \\"Patriotism and War,\\" \\"Memory and Grief,\\" etc., ending with \\"Nature,\\" \\"Animals,\\" and \\"Various Themes.\\"  There's a slew of poems by \\"Unknown,\\" some of them doing a mighty justice to anonymity, e.g., \\"Get a Transfer\\" (\\"If you are on the Gloomy Line/ Get a transfer/If you're inclined to fret and pine/Get a transfer...\\")  There are \\"answers\\" to popular poems, and burlesques and parodies aplenty.  Here you'll find, if you've been looking (and even if you haven't), \\"Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines\\" and \\"Animal Fair\\" (\\"The birds and the bees were there!\\"), and Joyce Kilmer's much, much maligned \\"Trees\\" (\\"...only God can make a tree\\"), but also Tennyson's \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" and Poe's \\"The Raven,\\" and  Keats's \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\" and William Wordsworth's \\"Daffodils.\\"<br /><br />Did I mention there's no Shakespeare?  One wonders why.  Also no William Blake.  However there is a poem entitled \\"A Woman's Answer to the Vampire\\" by Felicia Blake after Kipling's  \\"The Vampire\\" (\\"A fool there was and he made his prayer/(Even as you and I!)/To a rag and bone and hank of hair...,\\"etc., answered with \\"A fool there was, and she lowered her pride,/(Even as you and I)/To a bunch of conceit in a masculine hide\\").  Naturally there is no T. S. Eliot, but there is an Ebenezer Elliott who wrote, \\"When Wilt Thou Save the People?\\" (\\"O, God of mercy, when?\\"), and strangely no Ogden Nash, who might seem at home here--but perhaps there was a copyright problem.  His \\"answer\\" to Joyce Kilmer goes, \\"I think that I shall never see/A billboard lovely as a tree./Indeed, unless the billboards fall/I'll never see a tree at all.\\"<br /><br />Lest you think I am slyly making fun of this book, let me tell you, I love Kipling's \\"If,\\" and if it weren't for that unfortunate last line, I think it would be close to a great poem.  I also love poems like Longfellow's \\"Paul Revere's Ride,\\" (included) and Henry Clay Work's \\"The Ship that Never Returned,\\" which inspired a take off tune by the Kingston Trio in the fifties, \\"Did he ever return?/No he never returned/His fate is still unlearned/He rides beneath the streets of Boston/He's the man who never returned.\\"  I also love stuff like Robert Herrick's \\"To the Virgins\\" and Alan Seeger's romantic, \\"I Have a Rendezvous with Death.\\"  And where else can you find a poem by Abraham Lincoln?  Or a religious ditty innocently titled, \\"No Sects in Heaven\\" (Huh?)  Or one called \\"To a Fat Lady Seen from the Train (\\"O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,/Missing so much and so much?\\")  And I positively delight in Robert W. Service (three printed here, including \\"The Spell of the Yukon,\\" but alas no \\"The Cremation of Sam McGee,\\" although there's a nice take off by Edward E. Paramore, Jr. called, \\"The Ballad of Yukon Jake\\").  There is even a poem reputed to have been dictated to a spiritual medium by the dead Edgar Alan Poe called \\"Streets of Baltimore\\" rendered in the rhythms of  \\"The Raven.\\"  (Sorry about that.)  \\"Quoth the raven: Nevermore!\\" becoming (gulp)\\"thro' the streets of Baltimore!\\"<br /><br />Furthermore I love \\"Poems that Tell a Story\\"!  Although Browning's \\"My Last Duchess\\" didn't make the cut, there is here the truly delightful \\"The Enchanted Shirt\\" by John Hay, a tale about a king who needed to sleep a night in the shirt of a happy man.  And of course there's \\"Casey at the Bat\\" followed by \\"Casey's Revenge\\" and \\"Casey--Twenty Years Later.\\"  (Some purists might point out that with first base open, the correct strategy was to give Casey an intentional pass; but I ask you, where's the fun in that?)<br /><br />I could go on, but I think the picture's getting clear.  This collection really is a revelation of the American psyche as seen by a newspaper person seventy years ago.  (Felleman was for fifteen years the editor of the Queries and Answers page of The New York Times Book Review.)  As such this should be required reading for historians and sociologists alike.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Like a Tsunami Headed for Hilo: Selected Poems\\"\\"thro' the streets of Baltimore!\\"<br /><br />Furthermore I love \\"Poems that Tell a Story\\"!

(Forget the Godiva chocolates or the Heitz Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon: this will last!)  Whether one is a wannabe rap master from Watts or a distinguished professor of English lit at the Sorbonne, there will be something here to please, I promise.<br /><br />It should be emphasized that this is a collection of strictly English language poetry, which means, for example, that none of verses from Edward Fitzgerald's very English translation of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam appears even though some of those verses are among the most popular and the most anthologized.  It should also be noted that this is not a contemporary collection (copyright date, 1992) so there's no Gary Soto or Rita Dove or Louise Gl&uuml;ck or even Margaret Atwood.  It should also be pointed out that if you're looking into Keats's, e.g., \\"Ode to a Nightingale,\\" for the first time, perhaps this is not the best place to find it since none of the poems are explicated.  Editor William Harmon does give a brief note as an introduction to each poet, and concludes each poem with a brief comment.<br /><br />The collection is popular of course and spans English poetry from Chaucer to Sylvia Plath but there's nary a ditty to be found.  Although T. S. Eliot's \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" is here (hurrah!), there's nothing from his Book of Practical Cats (alas) and no Kipling's \\"If\\"!  This is really high class stuff, quite simply the best.  All the giants are here, Shakespeare, Donne, Pope, Burns, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, Ezra Pound, Andrew Marvell, Frost, Yeats, Dickinson, etc., etc.  Some moderns are represented, Allen Ginsberg, Gwendolyn Brooks, Robert Lowell, Richard Wilbur, Philip Larkin, etc., although notably absent is Lawrence Ferlinghetti.<br /><br />Harmon's method of selection was to peruse anthologies and include those poems most often making an appearance.  Of course it's obvious that some editorial decisions were made.  I have little doubt that Kipling's \\"If\\" really is among the 500 most anthologized poems, although it doesn't appear here, and ditto for Robert Service and his very popular, \\"The Cremation of Sam McGee.\\"  But perhaps this is just as well since those poems really are easily found elsewhere.  The admirable point that Harmon is making with this collection is that one can include in a popular book the great poems of the language even though some of them are \\"difficult.\\"  In this category there's Robert Browning's \\"My Last Duchess,\\" Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach,\\" W. H. Auden's \\"Mus&eacute;e des Beaux Arts,\\" T. S. Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\" and others.  Harmon also does not shy away from poems often left out of anthologies because of length.  Coleridge's \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" is here in toto and so is Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\" and Oscar Wilde's \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol.\\"<br /><br />Of course not everything is here, and one can indeed find fault.  There can be differences of opinion, and it is very true that a collection based on other collections will indeed leave out some great poems and poets.  Amy Lowell does not appear, meaning that her \\"Patterns,\\" one of the great poems in the language, is not here.  John Crowe Ransom's \\"Blue Girls,\\" one of my personal favorites is apparently not much anthologized; at least it doesn't appear here.  And I was surprised at only two selections from e. e. cummings (and neither one was \\"plato told him\\"!).<br /><br />But this is to nitpick.  This is a great collection and more than that it is beautifully edited.  The poems are presented chronologically, beginning with the anonymous \\"Cuckoo Song.\\"  There is an index of titles and first lines, which is the way it should be.  (Some editors fail to include titles in such an index, but we think of both when trying to recall...)  There is an index of poets, and finally the 500 poems are listed in order of popularity.  William Blake's \\"The Tiger\\" is number one.(For some reason Harmon modernized Blake's spelling of \\"Tyger.\\")  Robert Frost's \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" is the most anthologized poem by an American.  Even Harmon's short introduction, which he titles \\"This is it!\\" is well worth reading.  Therein one discovers that Shakespeare is the poet with the most poems included (29), followed by Donne (19), Blake (18) and Dickinson and Yeats (14).<br /><br />Here (as a public service) I was going to explicate Donne's charming but tricky (and a wee bit sexist) \\"Go and Catch a Falling Star\\" (an apt choice because Harmon has \\"I\\" instead of the poet's intended \\"If,\\" a typo at the beginning of line nine) but I'm running out of space, and besides poets hate to be explicated.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Like a Tsunami Headed for Hilo: Selected Poems\\"e reason Harmon modernized Blake's spelling of \\"Tyger.\\")  Robert Frost's \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" is the most anthologized poem by an American.

2073677:US	49786731	R1IH7QL72IH9U8	0198504446	53590753	The Nine Numbers of the Cosmos	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Cosmology updated	There's a beguiling simplicity to this attractive primer on cosmology.  Professor Rowan-Robinson uses mostly plain English in describing what is currently known, and he keeps it short.  But make no mistake about it: this is a complex and technical book on a difficult subject.  It requires study.  I have read it twice, and could profit from additional readings, but, as I like to say, life is short, and I'll have to be satisfied with what I have thus far garnered.<br />One of my pet peeves about books on cosmology is the constant rehashing of ancient conceptions of how and why the universe came into being, along with mistaken ideas from the early days of astronomy, anything, it sometimes seems, to pad out the requisite three hundred pages or so.  Consequently I was pleased not to encounter any tales of turtles holding up the world or any retracing of the Ptolemaic model before the author gets to the current state of affairs (although he does give some brief history as he goes along).<br />The nine numbers serve as an organizing device through which a picture of modern cosmology is revealed, or as the author puts it in the Prologue, \\"a peg on which to hang different aspects of our knowledge.\\"  Incidentally, the Prologue, \\"Que sais-je,\\" is particularly well written and candid and valuable for what it reveals about what Rowan-Robinson's knowledge.  The first number is the amount of baryonic matter in the universe, as revealed in Chapter 1 entitled, \\"We exist.\\"  Chapter 2 is \\"We are not in a special place,\\" revealed by the considerable extent to which the universe is isotropic and homogeneous.  The third number is the Hubble constant, the fourth, the age of the universe, the fifth, the temperature of the background radiation, etc.  I'll leave it to the reader to discover the other numbers.  What I want to focus on are Professor Rowan-Robinson's speculations on extraterrestrial life from Chapter 1.<br />He begins by expressing his \\"difficulty...with the idea that advanced technological civilizations like ourselves are common in our Galaxy\\" (p. 16).  I think he has expressed it exactly right here with the words \\"like ourselves,\\" which I want to emphasize.  However on the next page he goes on to present the familiar argument (from Fermi) that a civilization much in advance of ours would have found us by now.  He cautions that he doesn't accept the view that \\"they keep themselves hidden so as not to interfere with our development.\\"  Hence the tired conclusion that THEY probably do NOT exist.<br />The main problem with this argument is that it projects human psychology and desire onto beings of an advanced civilization.  They might very well have their reasons for leaving us alone. Additionally, it's not clear that the problem of interstellar travel is as easily solved as some might think, and I'm thinking here of the emotional and psychological difficulties as well as the technical ones.  Rowan-Robinson writes that he doesn't accept \\"any really fundamental limits on colonizing the Galaxy\\" (p. 17).  Even if he is right, would such beings have the desire to colonize?  I suspect that their psychology might differ, perhaps startlingly, from our own, and that they may prefer to stay at home.<br />Rowan-Robinson also considers the case of an advanced civilization, unable to colonize other planets, facing the death of its star.  He believes they \\"would surely put some effort into demonstrating that they had existed.  There would be the astronomical equivalent of the pyramids, some kind of beacon signaling forever\\" ( p. 17).  To me, such a vain glorious enterprise is more characteristic of human psychology than anything else, especially that of our pre-technological civilizations.  I would add that in advancing it, Rowan-Robinson is guilty of anthropomorphizing the aliens!  Surely, one would think, after a billion years or so of development, there would be some advance on this sort of psychology.  Perhaps Professor Rowan-Robinson would appreciate being reminded of the lesson of Shelley's poem, \\"Ozymandias,\\" that \\"king of kings\\" whose \\"shattered visage lies\\" amid the drifting sands.<br />  Rowan-Robinson concludes the book with a prediction for the year 2100 (repeated from page 64) that the Planck era (10 to the minus 43 seconds after the Big Bang) will remain \\"shrouded in mystery.\\"  He adds, \\"It would not surprise me if this were still a mystery in the year 3000.\\"  There are some helpful diagrams and tables, some black and white photos, a brief glossary, and a name, and a subject index.iate being reminded of the lesson of Shelley's poem, \\"Ozymandias,\\" that \\"king of kings\\" whose \\"shattered visage lies\\" amid the drifting sands.<br />          Rowan-Robinson concludes the book with a prediction for the year 2100 (repeated from page 64) that the Planck era (10 to the minus 43 seconds after the Big Bang) will remain \\"shrouded in mystery.\\"  He adds, \\"It would not surprise me if this were still a mystery in the year 3000.\\"  There are some helpful diagrams and tables, some black and white photos, a brief glossary, and a name, and a subject index.	2001-03-10

Weaver even gives phonetic guidance on how to pronounce the names of the vegetables, which include peppers, beans, potatoes, lentils, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, eggplants, etc.  Part of the book is a celebration of those names and an appreciation of their history.  While reading this I made a mental note to get to my local Whole Foods or Begonia Farms store more often and try something new and exotic!<br />In another sense this is an advanced book for gardeners and culinary experts, not because the book is technical, but because for most people most of the vegetables presented will not be found at the local supermarket, nor will their seeds be found at the local garden and seed store.  Additionally it is not always clear to this amateur how these exotic varieties differ from their more prosaic fellows at the local A&amp;P.  Weaver helps by attempting to describe the taste (hard to do!) and advises on things like texture, color and spiciness (e.g., wear gloves when cooking Aji Lem&oacute;n peppers, and don't breath the fumes!).  He includes some recipes and advice on complementary foods to go along with the featured veggies.  He gives some recipes, sometimes from the culture of origin.  For gardeners there are five pages of seed catalogue stores and their web addresses. For botanists he includes the botanical names and the plant's family name.  No fungi, by the way.  There are varieties from \\"every continent, except the frozen one,\\" e.g., \\"Shungiku Edible Chrysanthemum,\\" from Japan, \\"Pepino Dulce Melon\\" from South America, \\"Jaune du Poitou Leek,\\" from France, even the \\"Petaluma Gold Rush Bean,\\" from my native California.  Among the exotic names I found some terminology new to me.  Some vegetables are referred to as \\"heirloom\\" varieties and/or \\"cultivars.\\" Weaver uses the term \\"landrace,\\" which I couldn't find in any of my dictionaries, defined on page two as a noncommercial or \\"backyard\\" variety in cultivation for a long time.  Weaver has himself cultivated all the varieties presented here on his farm in Pennsylvania where he grows three thousand or so vegetables on a rotating basis.  His knowledge about vegetables and his love for them is very impressive.  His appreciation of the culinary arts is evident.  This is a pretty little book from Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill that would make a nice present for someone you know who loves cooking or gardening.ctionaries, defined on page two as a noncommercial or \\"backyard\\" variety in cultivation for a long time.

2079065:US	49786731	R3HLXI05DV4I6H	0471394556	840474352	The 13th Element: The Sordid Tale of Murder, Fire, and Phosphorus	Books	4	40	41	N	N	A melancholy history of a fascinating element	This was first published in Great Britain with the title The Shocking History of Phosphorus.  Even with such a provocative title one might wonder how a book devoted to a single chemical element could find commercial success.  The fact that the book has now been published in the United States and Canada suggests that author John Emsley knows what he is doing.  He reduces the dry chemistry to a minimum and accentuates the sordid details, making this an interesting read.<br />Emsley begins with alchemy in the seventeenth century and how phosphorus was first manufactured from copious pots of urine, and how the small amounts obtained were used in demonstrations before royalty.  By the by we gain some historical insight into the lives of the European alchemists and their methods.  Emsley then delves into the medical use of phosphorus, proscribed for ailments as diverse as TB and melancholia, for which it worthless.  Indeed it was worthless for all prescriptions.  (Maybe this is how homoepathy began: a vanishingly dilute prescription of phosphorus would be an improvement on the standard dosage!)  Phosphorus was even seen as an aphrodisiac.<br />The production of phosphorus really took off in the early nineteenth century with invention of the phosphorus match, aptly named \\"the lucifer.\\"  I thought this was the most interesting part of the book, bringing to mind a world before we had matches and fires had to kept going or started with flint and tender, or perhaps borrowed from your neighbor.  Emsley writes that by the end of the nineteenth century \\"three trillion phosphorus matches were being struck every year\\" (p. 65).  He emphasizes the word \\"trillion.\\"  Next Emsley tells the sad, ugly tale of how the matches were manufactured by children and women sixty hours a week in sweat shop conditions at subsistence wages (if that), and how many of the workers contacted phossy jaw, a disease caused by phosphorus that rots the teeth and jaw and can lead to deformity or death.  Then comes the story of Annie Besant and the Salvation Army whose efforts greatly improved the conditions of the workers.<br />Ah, but the worst is to come.  As World War I approached we clever people discovered that poisoned gas and incendiary bombs could be made from phosphorus, and so a new horror was ushered in.  Finally though, in the latter chapters we see how phosphorus is used in fertilizers and dishwashing detergents.  Emsley discusses some of the problems associated with their use.  He also goes into how and why our bodies need phosphorus and its role in nutrition.  The \\"phosporus cycle\\" is discussed and the rather bizarre phenomenon of \\"spontaneous human combustion\\" is looked into.<br />Bottom line: this is eye-opening read about an element that has had a major impact on human history for both good and evil, a history that is continuing.  (Incidentally, phosphorus was the thirteenth element discovered, element fifteen of the periodic table, thus the somewhat misleading title.)comes the story of Annie Besant and the Salvation Army whose efforts greatly improved the conditions of the workers.<br />Ah, but the worst is to come.

2084795:US	49786731	R39873ZEG2JRY9	0375503889	134489419	Dumb Money: Adventures of a Day Trader	Books	5	18	21	N	N	Entertaining, informative, scrumptious	This is a quick read, as breezy as the sports page and as agreeable as a six-figure income before you're thirty.  But beware.  Underneath the adrenaline rush lie material angst and emotional depression.  After reading this you may take a certain delight in writing yet another line of boring code or in picking up that phone and punching in the numbers as you puff yourself up for a cheery hello. You might even walk outside and admire the scenery, realizing that perhaps day trading is its own peculiar hell, the kind of thing the gods do to you when they grant your dearest wish.<br />On the other hand this book might psyche you up to take the plunge or recharge you enough to catch the open tomorrow morning.  If so--if you hear the siren call of the market or feel that passion for action--then this is a good book to read for what you can learn about how some day traders buy and sell.  (They will be part of your competition.)  There's a lot of insight here into what works and what doesn't work, or I should caution, what worked and what didn't work.  It's clear that what day traders like Anuff do is follow the trend while working very hard to find a way to (glory be!) ANTICIPATE the trend.  The incidental information on the significance of spreads, of just who you are playing against (add brokers and market makers to day traders) and how this passion may take over your life is perhaps the best of the book.  Noteworthy is Anuff's description of the three-monitor layout and the software he used and the sites he visited while ensconced in his Frisco apartment glued to CNBC, whistling their theme song.<br />Essentially &quot;dumb money&quot; is nonprofessional money.  What Anuff learned in his experience as a day trader is that the market makers and the brokers and other professionals still have a big advantage.  Although the playing field has leveled considerably in recent years, you still have the spread against you and your information is stale and second hand.  Anuff says nothing about insider trading, but it doesn't take a genius to realize that it happens all the time.  Note, if you will, prior to an earnings announcement, which direction the stock in question takes.  Nine times out of ten the direction will anticipate the tenor of the announcement.  If it sells off, you can be nearly certain that the news is not so good.  If it inches up, you can bet that a rosy report will follow.  How can this be?  Could it be that insider knowledge leaked out ahead of time to selected individuals who traded accordingly, and that such action was in turn noted by market makers, brokers and others close to the scene who took advantage?  Yes, it's against the law, but so is speeding on the freeway.  Also not mentioned is the action ahead of a broker downgrade or upgrade.  By the time you hear about it, the stock has already popped or taken a haircut.  As poker players say, you're chasing.<br />Anyway, Anuff, founder of Suck.com and Gary Wolf take us on a blitz tour of the day trader's world.  They throw in a little painless history, share experiences, drop some Wall Street and Internet biz whiz names, spin some anecdotes, wax nostalgic and generally just lay wide open the human psyche of greed and fear so palpably that once or twice I had the urge to tell Anuff to go take a shower.  They do this so well and with so much color and verve delivered in an apt tone of irreverence, that I promise you'll take delight.<br />Some of the fun comes from chat room adventures at Silicon.com, Yahoo, etc., as the ragers tout, diss, pump and dump, and otherwise scream their lungs out trying to mislead a gullible public.  You'll learn why day traders always close out their positions before the bell (rather than climb walls).  You'll learn what you can do about the gap in the morning, which is close to nothing.  (You can try bleary-eyed to rescue your position in the before-market session, but most likely it's too late.)  You'll learn why after a breaking news storythe market sometimes goes one way, hesitates and then goes the other.  Anuff and Wolf explain on page 152 that some quick-fingered traders, anxious to beat the pack, initially misread the news.  You'll learn why technical analysis, with its &quot;resistence&quot; and &quot;support&quot; levels, works, despite the fact that any fundamentalist can prove it's a voodoo science.  The authors explain it on pages 147-149 as a &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot; that people believe.  They don't explain why fundamental analysis seldom works, even though it's real science, but I will.  One, a fundamental analysis of a company's true value vis-a-vis the marketplace is usually too complex to get right; and two, a significant percentage of buyers and sellers trade on emotion, ensuring that psychological factors predominate in the short run.  Yes, Virginia, in the long run fundamentals will out.  But you know what John Maynard Keynes said about the long run.<br />Here's my favorite bit of colorful writing from page 154.  The authors are talking about a stock flying up in the after hours: &quot;All the previous day's losses had been erased, and tomorrow the shorts--if there were any left--would be squeezed until their little piggy eyes popped out of their heads.&quot;<br />Best joke: In a greedy moment Anuff has decided to hold a position overnight.  &quot;There are seventeen and a half hours between one day's close and the next day's open, and that is a long, long time to be on your knees, hands clenched tightly, looking up at your twenty-four-foot ceiling, praying that if there is a God, he isn't just.&quot;the market sometimes goes one way, hesitates and then goes the other.

2086593:US	49786731	R2NMLJFV58LNL3	0312169493	54904691	The Night Is Large: Collected Essays, 1938-1995	Books	5	38	38	N	N	A renaissance man in the third millennium	I thoroughly enjoyed this, the definitive collection of Gardner's essays, and recommend it highly.  My recommendation, however pales beside those that appear on the book jacket, including praise from Noam Chomsky, Carl Sagan, Stephen Jay Gould, Raymond Smullyan, Arthur C. Clarke, and Stefan Kanfer.  Little more need be said about the value of this splendid book; but I would like to offer some observations.<br /><br />The first chapter, a review of four books on symmetry is easily the most informative and insightful ten pages I have ever read on the subject.  Gardner's rare talent for making things clear is shown to such advantage here that I would recommend it as a must read for anyone wanting a career in science writing.  It's almost magic, the way he evaporates the fog.<br /><br />The next nine chapters are on the physical sciences including chapters on relativity, quantum mechanics, time, superstrings, cosmology, etc., all good reads.  The next five are on the social sciences, and it is here that I was introduced to a side of Gardner that I had not found in the other three collections of his that I have read.  Chapter 11, \\"Why I Am Not a Smithian,\\" is on economics and is primarily a dissection of the supply-siders who held forth during the Reagan years.  It makes for lively reading even though, curiously it turns into a tribute to Norman Thomas as \\"the only notable American\\" to vigorously oppose the Japanese internment camps during WW II.  In the next essay, \\"The Laffer Curve,\\" Gardner continues his assault on the \\"voodoo economics\\" of the Reagan years as he presents his own satirical \\"neo-Laffer curve.\\"  Gardner is a sharp eyed and sharp-penned social critic, and, as he demonstrates in Chapter 21, \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\\" a pretty good movie critic as well.  (Although here I think he underrated the magic of Spielberg's movie in order to better concentrate on zapping the usual Spielberg schmaltz and pseudoscience.)  Politically speaking, Gardner reveals himself as a \\"social democrat.\\"<br /><br />The chapter on \\"Newcomb's Paradox,\\" which Gardner interprets as \\"related to the question of whether humans possess a genuine power to make free, unpredictable choices,\\" has the effect of revealing Gardner's personality.  You'll have to read it to see what I mean, but the choices he makes are psychological choices and reveal him as a man who is not afraid to stand by his beliefs.  Herein and in the next chapter we encounter the question of whether we can have free will in the view of an omniscient God.  Gardner's solution (with C. S. Lewis and others) is to put God outside time and avoid the contradictions.  Incidentally, Gardner makes the very salient point that any language that allows sets to be members of themselves or evaluates the truth or falsity of its statements will run into contradictions (p. 419).<br /><br />It is here in the chapters on philosophy and religion that Gardner is at his most intriguing.  He is a theist and a believer in free will, although he admits that \\"distinguishing free will from determinism\\" is something we are incapable of doing (p. 427).  He equates free will with self-awareness and consciousness, and declares (p. 444) \\"I am not a vitalist who thinks there is...a soul distinct from the brain.\\"  Yet on page 438 he writes, \\"I cannot conceive of myself as existing without...a brain that has free will.\\"  Although none of this is contradictory, we can see that there is something Gardner believes in that is akin to Bishop Berkeley's idealism and beyond the rock of realism that Samuel Johnson gave a kick to in an attempt to refute Berkeley.  I agree with Gardner that we are not about to find an answer to the conundrum of free will, although I think it's important to add that as a practical matter the illusion of free will is, for us, as good as the \\"real\\" thing.  Readers may be surprised to learn that Gardner also identifies himself as a \\"fideist,\\" a word I had to look up.  It refers to someonewho believes in God as a matter of faith.<br /><br />I would like to say (since Gardner doesn't) that consciousness as self-awareness should be made distinct from consciousness as self-identity.  The former is a question of relative complexity, e.g., chimp consciousness versus flatworm consciousness.  The latter is an illusion with great psychological power foisted on us by the evolutionary mechanism primarily to make us fear death.  It is adaptive for long-lived creatures such as ourselves, but is otherwise empty.  When the Buddhists (and the Vedas and yogic psychology) say the ego is an illusion, this is what they are talking about, this delusional self-identity that we sometimes refer to as consciousness.<br /><br />There are number of funny jokes and asides herein.  One of my favorites identifies Ayn Rand (philosophically speaking of course) as \\"the ugly offspring of Milton Friedman and Madalyn Murray O'Hare\\" (p. 484).<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"who believes in God as a matter of faith.<br /><br />I would like to say (since Gardner doesn't) that consciousness as self-awareness should be made distinct from consciousness as self-identity.

2096492:US	49786731	R1BS52DLQ5EXNZ	0684842076	272331046	The Best Alternative Medicine	Books	4	36	42	N	N	Must be read carefully	Like most people I am aware of the scientific limitations of some complementary and alternative medical practices and approaches (CAMs).  I am also aware that there are some ailments that are most effectively treated by conventional methods.  As Dr. Pelletier points out, &quot;conventional medicine excels in the treatment of acute trauma, childbirth emergencies, treating broken bones, performing corrective surgery, and treating acute, life-threatening illnesses&quot; (p. 183).  Nonetheless I am a staunch supporter of alternative approaches taken selectively, in particular those based on a long history of practice, such as acupuncture, Chinese medicine and some aspects of Ayurvedic medicine.  I am also aware that the theory behind these practices is sometimes flawed in a scientific sense, and that the reason for the effectiveness of some of the treatments is not fully understood.  Additionally, it is sometimes impossible to separate the effectiveness of a therapy from the placebo effect.  The fact is, however, the art and science of medicine is still in its adolescence at best, and we have a lot to learn.  I think in particular the American Medical Association and its members have a lot to learn.  The main thing they should understand is that a strictly scientific approach to the healing arts is of limited effectiveness because an essential part of the healing process is treating the whole person, physically, mentally, and emotionally.  This is particularly true of the chronic diseases that plague modern societies.<br />However I cannot give a ringing endorsement to this book, mainly because it is primarily a carefully constructed, painstakingly written, legally considered endorsement of the alternative medical industry.  As such it is a book taking a political position, clearly motivated by a desire to convince the insurance industry of the wisdom of allowing its clients to chose CAMs instead of, or in addition to, conventional treatments.  Again and again Dr. Pelletier tells the reader that this or that alternative approach is more cost effective than the conventional approach (e.g., see p. 149).  While I wish Dr. Pelletier success in getting the HMOs to fork out cash for CAMs, I would prefer a book that concentrates on helping the lay person evaluate the effectiveness of the various approaches.  Dr. Pelletier has too many people to please for him to be candid about the relative merits of the various methods.  Again and again we are told that the evidence is &quot;suggestive&quot; or &quot;intriguing&quot; (p. 147) or that some recent findings are &quot;so new that they...have not yet been published and subjected to peer review&quot; (p. 203).  If one does not read carefully, one might get the impression, for example, that homeopathic medicine is the equal of say, Chinese medicine.  Homeopathic medicine is based on a rather limited tradition and a highly suspect theory, while its principle technique is to give patients astronomically-diluted solutions of curative agents that are not necessarily curative.  The explanation for how such a medicine works is that the water in the solution somehow &quot;remembers&quot; the form of the curative agent!  However I must add that it is to the infinite credit of homeopathy that it follows the first and most important rule of medicine--a rule that conventional medicine does not always adhere to--which is, to do no harm.  Having seen the horrendous harm that chemotherapy and radiation treatment can do, I say, thank you, dilute solutions!  Chinese medicine, in contradistinction, is based on the use of thousands of medicines and practices honed over thousands of years of practice.  This is an enormous difference not emphasized in the text.<br />The real reason these alternative practices work (when they do work) is that the body heals itself, but it heals itself best when the patient has confidence in the therapy and is treated with respect, kindness, consideration and intelligence.  The conventional medical establishment still hasn't gotten this very important message.  The AMA has spent many decades decrying the &quot;false&quot; medical practices of, for example, chiropractic, but hasn't seen that a bigger problem lies with itself and the medical practices of far too many of its members, practices that neglect and ignore the whole-body, mind and emotional needs of patients while astronomically increasing the cost of their treatments.  What has happened is CAMs have rushed in to fill the real needs of patients, and if their approach is not as scientifically &quot;valid&quot; as that of mainstream medicine, in many cases it doesn't matter, since the body itself is really the healer.  What often matters most is how the patient feels during treatment.<br />The &quot;best&quot; alternatives that Dr. Pelletier presents include, in addition to those mentioned above, &quot;MindBody,&quot; &quot;Western Herbal Medicine,&quot; &quot;Naturopathy,&quot; and &quot;Spirituality.&quot;  He has a chapter devoted to each with an introduction to the particular approach, a brief history, and a statement of principles.  He follows this with a &quot;What Works&quot; section, a &quot;What Doesn't Work,&quot; and a &quot;What's in the Works&quot; section.&quot;  Again the text must be read carefully.  For example, on page 199 he writes, &quot;Homeopathy's underlying theoretical principles appear to contravene the principles of modern scientific medicine...However...the principle of like cures like was the basis for the development of vaccines and allergy desensitization treatments.  This analogy, though, is not really accurate...,&quot; etc., leaving the reader in a position of clear uncertainty!<br />What is not uncertain is that some conventional doctors are becoming better educated and are reaching out into the fields of alternative medicine for ideas on how to improve their practice.  But not all.  Some are still the willing dupes of medical insurance companies; indeed there are mainstream doctors whose primary source of income is derived from making diagnoses that please HMOs and protect them from patients with chronic illnesses.  The growth of alternative approaches may have the effect of forcing the practitioners of conventional medicine to become more responsive to the public welfare.  At least one hopes so.

As usual the old guy displays a most engaging and exciting style while countenancing no fuzzy thinking and especially no BS.  He begins with parapsychologist Joseph Rhine of Duke University, who, half a century ago, tried to establish extrasensory perception.  One recalls that Rhine used cards with five different symbols that one person would concentrate on while another at a distance would attempt to guess.  Dr. Rhine used a statistical analysis of hits and misses to demonstrate that extrasensory perception had taken place.  Last I heard, some decades ago, Rhine's methods and stats were considered highly suspect, and he and his work have gradually faded into oblivion.  Now Martin Gardner adds a further criticism: Rhine failed to expose cheating in experiments that he knew about.  Rhine thought that no good purpose would be served by exposing the maleficence and those practicing it.  Gardner argues in this essay, \\"The Obligation to Disclose Fraud\\" that the contrary is a better rule, if for no other reason than not to disclose fraud is to mislead later researchers.<br /><br />The second essay, \\"Occam's Razor and the Nutshell Earth,\\" deals with the strange, but apparently non-refutable idea that the earth is hollow and we live on the inside.  It seems that it is mathematically possible to describe such a universe. Gardner asks on page 19, \\"Why then does science reject it?\\"  The answer lies in Occam's Razor, one of the truly beautiful ideas in science, which states that given alternative explanations of phenomena, we must choose the one that is simplest.  In this regard I must mention again my (fanciful!) idea that it is not space-time that is expanding, but matter that is contracting.  I wonder if it is possible to chose which is really correct, or if such a choice has any meaning--or if, as Gardner's text might suggest, Occam's Razor might be applied.<br /><br />Other essays deal with such delectable subjects as President Reagan and First Lady Nancy's reliance on astrologers for the timing of certain presidential events; the scientific basis of homeopathy, or actually, the lack thereof; geneticist (and author of the much anthologized essay, \\"On Being the Right Size\\") J. B. S. Haldane's embarrassing support of Stalin and the crackpot genetics of Lysenko; some stuff on Linus Pauling and the very weird Wilhelm Reich, etc.  My favorite essays were on Frank Tipler's fantastic Omega Point \\"theology,\\" which doesn't sit well with Gardner, and the essay \\"Relativism in Science\\" (Chapter 10), remarkable for the fairness that Gardner extends by reproducing astronomer Bruce Gregory's very effective rebuttal to Gardner's criticism of his book, Inventing Reality: Physics as a Language (1989).<br /><br />But where I find myself in rare disagreement with Gardner is in his treatment of James E. Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis in the chapter entitled, \\"Gaiaism.\\"  His technical objection is stated on page 48, namely that Lovelock broadens the meaning of \\"alive\\" to the point where it is \\"what philosophers like to call a category mistake\\"; however Gardner's tone suggests that what really bothers him is the use of the Gaia hypothesis to further New Age pseudoscience, a concern I can certainly identify with.  However, I think that Lovelock's hypothesis raises an interesting point that might be examined more closely, namely that our definition of life is needlessly restrictive.  We humans, who exist at a certain narrow span and level of awareness have definitions of what is alive and what isn't that are heavily dependent upon our limited experience.  Of course we have nothing else to go on, but a little imagination might suggest that life could take some very diverse forms.  The stars, for example, might be \\"alive\\" in ways that we cannot appreciate.  After all, they are born, grow, evolve, and die.  And their life span dwarfs ours.  They even reproduce themselves in the spewing of their elements into space (or in their nurturing of us!).  To me it makes as much sense, maybe more, to say that the stars are \\"alive\\" than to say that viruses are alive.  And there might even be something \\"beyond\\" being \\"alive,\\" something marvelous that happens to matter and energy that we cannot yet imagine.  Furthermore, our definitions of life, e.g., something that has a metabolism, that grows and reproduces, or, a more modern definition, \\"something that undergoes Darwinian evolution,\\" break down at the extremes, and we can easily imagine entities outside our definitions that we may want to say are alive.  Lovelock chose to include the entire earth within the definition of being alive.  I don't think it's so far fetched.<br /><br />This superior collection of essays reveals Gardner's extraordinary breath of learning and the lively frolic of his very fine intelligence.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"e.

Lee's imaginings range from the plausible to the fanciful to the fantastic.  The one thing all these imaginings have in common, however,  is that they cannot be supported in any scientific way, nor is it possible to formulate some kind of statement about them that might have predictive value.  To his credit, Lee does not try.  He postulates and then moves on from there.  For example, he states that our australopithecine ancestors wore red flowers in their hair to attract mates.  This is entirely plausible; certainly it cannot be disproven, and indeed some day may well be established in a scientific sense.  Lee goes on from there to state that these advertisements of sexual receptivity were necessary to replace the signal provided by the red swellings of estrus that our ancestors had lost (thus &quot;red&quot; flowers).  Whether our ancestors, like some modern primates, ever had red swellings or an estrus period is of course debatable.  Lee also thinks that our early ancestors at one time separated into exclusive male and female living groups, the females following the migrations of the extinct three-toed horses while forming a symbiotic relationship with them, grooming them in exchange for finding water holes and the shortest route between food patches (p. 122).  Curiously, Lee does not think that the australopithecine females preyed on the horses for their flesh.  (Perhaps Lee believes that the australopithecine females were exclusively vegetarians.)<br />Lee also engages in some interesting etymology.  He states (p. 17) that &quot;all of the spoken languages across the world have originated from the same source.&quot;  He gives the example of the Korean and Chinese words &quot;Han&quot; referring to a people or tribe and the English and German words &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;Hand.&quot;  He sees them as cognates.  He also gives the example of vagina secretions as the source of the word &quot;secret&quot; (p. 33).  My dictionary gives another etymology, but actually I like Lee's idea!  However he follows this with &quot;...a secretary is reasoned to be a person who deals with such secrets.  In this sense, what a modern-day secretary [he's thinking of a secretary of state as well as the more modest variety] deals with routinely are changed forms of the odor and taste of the vaginal secretion of an ovulating female.&quot;  On page 34 he adds, &quot;The odor of an ovulating female was something like an order to follow...By analogy, a modern-day secretary is an ovulating female.  She has secrets in her hands.  She is in control of important information...For this reason, the concept of order (a command) has derived directly from that of odor.&quot;<br />Maybe Lee is right (!), but I would like to point out that language evolves at a rate that is noticeable in hundreds of years, while primate evolution takes place at rate that is discernable (at best) in tens of thousands of years.  This is a huge difference.  The language spoken by the tribe that came out of Africa a hundred thousand years ago (if indeed that is what happened) is not only unknown and unknowable, but would not have any etymological relationship to modern languages.<br />On page 111, Lee writes that &quot;the role of rain in human evolution should be understood properly because it played a pivotal role. [Paragraph break] As the year came to be divided into dry and wet seasons...male and female members of the last common ancestor stock were forced to live separately during the dry season.  That was the beginning of the hominids.&quot;  He adds that until the &quot;recent past&quot; male and females lived apart except for the &quot;annual mating season&quot; signaled by the coming of the rains.  When the rainy season disappeared as the climate got drier, Lee continues, &quot;hominids experienced difficulties in locating their mates&quot; (p. 112).  &quot;...[M]ale hominids felt increasingly frustrated and helpless and had no choice but to pray for their wishes.&quot;<br />Thus Lee has both the thesis and the title for his opus, which might be less ambiguously worded, &quot;Man as the One Who Prays&quot;; but probably Lee intended the ambiguity, although from my point of view, a truer statement might be, &quot;Man as the One Who Preys.&quot;  But then, that's another story.<br />Anyway, I think Lee has a fine imagination and has clearly worked hard to present his ideas to the public.  His considerable knowledge of primate evolution is in evidence, and the sources he references are excellent.  Nonetheless this is mostly a work of imagination.  Perhaps Lee should write a novel of the prehistory in the tradition of William Golding's The Inheritors.  He concludes his book with the intriguing words, &quot;We humans are the products of prayers, and so is our culture.&quot;nids experienced difficulties in locating their mates&quot; (p. 112).   &quot;...[M]ale hominids felt increasingly frustrated and helpless and had no choice but to pray for their wishes.&quot;<br />Thus Lee has both the thesis and the title for his opus, which might be less ambiguously worded, &quot;Man as the One Who Prays&quot;; but probably Lee intended the ambiguity, although from my point of view, a truer statement might be, &quot;Man as the One Who Preys.&quot;  But then, that's another story.  <br />Anyway, I think Lee has a fine imagination and has clearly worked hard to present his ideas to the public.

I wouldn't have the nerve, fearing not so much that I would bore my readers, but that I would reveal the poverty of my mind for all the world to see.  Two hundred and fifty pages, perhaps 75,000 words of, by and about myself!  Now that's a little scary.<br />So it was with some misgivings that I picked up this handsome book by John Jerome, professional writer, editor and (I could quickly see) prose stylist extraordinary.  Well, I'm glad I did.  He did a lot of research on aging and it shows.  That knowledge, along with his observations on the experience of aging, is what makes this book so interesting.  We geezers like to compare notes, and with Jerome we have someone who likes to share.  I'm sure by now he wishes that he HAD taken out all the &quot;embarrassing stuff,&quot; but we, John, are glad you left it in!<br />Jerome gives us a little of what he likes to do, satisfying work, canoeing, gin and tonic in the evenings.  He recalls his neck surgery and a canoeing trip, why he cuts the grape vines and why he chased the beaver from his pond.  He makes me jealous as hell with his idyllic New England lifestyle and his beautifully rendered prose.  He makes sharp observations (One of the benefits of aging: &quot;...no one's looking.  You're invisible when you're old&quot; p. 237; &quot;Most men bore each other stiff&quot; p. 242), and tosses out witty asides (&quot;I am in favor of sensation for the aging...Let us celebrate our nerve endings while we can&quot; p. 238) like there's nothing to this writing gig.  That's one of the beautiful things about being a writer: you can still make those words dance when you're sixty-five.  (The Beatles lyric from a few decades back, &quot;Will you still need me/Will you still heed me...when I'm sixty-four?&quot; is jumping through my head.  Stop it!)  Or at least John Jerome can make those words dance.  His self-deprecating, yet self-affirming style reads as easy as shucked oysters going down.  I'll whisper this since I'm sure it's a heresy, but I find him a lot more interesting than that Thoreau guy he keeps quoting.<br />He waits until the latter chapters to talk about suicide and sex.  For me he could have waited a little longer with the sex.  As he notes, referencing writer Tim Cahill, &quot;Nobody, ever, is interested in your bowel movement&quot; p. 102.  Amen, I say and add the sex life of old men.  But Jerome knows this.  I think he felt, after having scolded Thoreau for leaving sex out of his journals, that he ought to fess up.  He sees suicide as &quot;An option, that's all.  If and when.&quot;  (Although he reports on having tried it when he was ten.)  And then there is this profound insight on page 250: &quot;Kevorkian, I now realize, serves a level of despair much deeper than I can quite conceive.&quot;<br />The book ends with these memorable words (as Jerome joyously contemplates a task that needs doing yet again): &quot;After all, as Camus pointed out, Sisyphus was essentially a happy man.&quot;<br />Thanks, John, for sharing, and for expressing it all so well.-affirming style reads as easy as shucked oysters going down.

Owls are probably &quot;wiser&quot; than sparrows, but certainly not in the same IQ league as ravens and crows.  And, although I didn't suppose that bats were completely blind (Shedd assures us that &quot;most actually see quite well&quot;), I knew they didn't depend on their eyes to catch prey.  There is a lot of other &quot;obvious&quot; and generally well-known information here, but there is also a wealth of knowledge about thirty or so of the familiar animals of North America that I didn't know or even suspect.  I didn't realize, for example, that there are &quot;frequency modulation&quot; (FM) bats as well as ones that use a &quot;constant frequency&quot; (CF), and a third group (CF-FM types) that use both methods of echolocation to zero in on prey.  For another example, while I knew that grizzlies are bigger than black bears, I didn't know that Alaskan brown bears are the biggest bears of all, and are not just another name for grizzlies.<br />What makes this a superior book on the wildlife of North America is the wealth of experience that Shedd brings to the subject and his imminently readable style, combining lots of concrete fact with well-told anecdote.  He does an especially good job of clearly defining each species.  The chapter on bears is as vivid and memorable as a PBS special.  The easy reading (and this is always the case) belies what I know was the very hard work that went into the construction of every sentence.  Typical of Shedd's illustrative style (in the floral mode) is this description from page 68: &quot;...a bat's flight is as unpredictable and indecipherable as the movements of a prestidigitator's hands.&quot;<br />Additionally there are a number of beautiful full-page black and white illustrations of the animals by Trudy Nicholson that delight the eye.  She has the knack of not only accurate detail, as Shedd notes in the Acknowledgments, but of infusing the animals with a sense of an appropriate and pleasing emotional aspect.<br />Politically speaking, and every wildlife book in this day and age has its political position,  this book steers a middle course.  Shedd, himself a hunter and a conservationist, eschews both the tree-hugging sentimentality of the left and the purely commercial mentality of the right.<br />Attractive and popular, Owls Aren't Wise and Bats Aren't Blind, would make an ideal present for anyone interested in wildlife, from grandchildren to grandparents.s with a sense of an appropriate and pleasing emotional aspect.<br />Politically speaking, and every wildlife book in this day and age has its political position,  this book steers a middle course.

The emphasis here is on what microbes can do presented in a relatively nontechnical fashion so that the material is accessible to an educated readership and not just to bio meds.  The material is organized in eight chapters from &quot;The microbiology of soil and of nutrient cycling&quot; through &quot;Food microbiology&quot; (an especially easy and interesting chapter) to &quot;Chemotherapy and antibiotic resistance.&quot;  The longest and most densely-packed chapter is &quot;7 Microbial infections.&quot;  The sub-headings in the chapters are in the form of questions, such as &quot;5.5.1 How do microbes cause food spoilage?&quot; or &quot;7.8 What causes infections of skin, bone and soft tissues?&quot;  This format seems to encourage communication from the authors to the general reader and improves the readability of the text.  There is a glossary of bold-faced terms and an index.<br />I picked this up because I felt a need for a more fundamental and broad introduction to microbiology than I would get from a popular volume, yet I didn't want to read a textbook.  Microbiology in Action turns out to be a perfect fit to what I need.  There is of course a United Kingdom flavor to the language and some of the examples since the authors are from the University of Leeds and the book is published by the Cambridge University Press, but that is entirely tolerable.<br />What makes this an excellent book is the wealth of information it contains.  I learned about how microbes are used in mining and in the oil industry, how microbes ferment and preserve food, how recombinant DNA technology allows us to use microbes to produce pharmaceutical products such as insulin, interferons, hormones and antibiotics.  I was delighted with some of the peripheral information.  I learned, for example, how some people managed to have ice cream in the summer time before the age of refrigeration.  Some big estates built icehouses to store perishable foodstuffs. &quot;These are large structures, often built underground for extra insulation.  Ice from local rivers and the estate lake was collected during the winter months and stored in the icehouse.  Because of the size of the ice stock and the insulation of the structure, the ice gathered one year would last through the summer and into the next winter.  This provided ice for summer desserts&quot; (p. 90).  I also learned that there are typically about one hundred million to one billion bacteria per gram dry weight of soil (p. 5) and that the number of cells of, in, and on the human body is around ten to the fourteenth, 90% of which are not of human origin (p. 119).<br />It is now common knowledge that we are products of the microbial world and could not exist without it.  Microbes conditioned, and are conditioning, the planet so that so-called higher forms of life might exist.  Still the vast majority of life on this planet is microbial, and that is a compelling reason for us to be more informed about microbes.

These diseases include the two big killers, cancer and heart disease, and possibly Alzheimer's.  His thesis is a heresy to a significant part of the medical establishment, and if correct, a revolution in the making.  The conventional wisdom believes that cancer and heart disease are caused by a combination of factors including hereditary predisposition (bad genes), environmental catalysts (pollution), bad life style choices (fatty diet, alcohol, cigarettes), stress, etc.  But what Ewald is saying is that there is a bacterium or a virus that causes these chronic diseases.<br />One of the powerful ideas behind Ewald's belief is the growing realization from evolutionary medicine that a major human disease cannot possibly be caused by bad genes since natural selection would have weeded them out long ago (pp. 55-56).  Diseases caused by bad genes can only occur in a small percentage of a given population.  The only exception would be a &quot;bad gene&quot; that has a compensating adaptive characteristic, such as the gene for sickle cells which confers immunity to malaria.  Consequently, &quot;the best bet is that they [chronic diseases] have infectious causes&quot; (p. 56).<br />The practical evidence, evidence that has been consistently explained away or ignored, is the actual presence of disease agents in the tissues.  Thus cervical cancer is now known to be caused by a papillomavirus that hides in the tumors and as such is a sexually transmitted disease.  Peptic ulcers are now known to be caused by a bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, and not worry or stress or booze, although these may be contributing factors.  Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria are increasingly being implicated in heart disease.  In Chapter Eight, Ewald makes the case for C. pneumoniae being the cause not only of atherosclerosis but Alzheimer's disease as well!  Again, if correct, this is a revolution.  The interesting (and terrible) thing about the peptic ulcer story is that it was known as long ago as the forties that peptic ulcers could be successfully treated with antibiotics, but that knowledge somehow became lost (!) until the early nineties (p. 99).<br />There is more: Ewald reports that Japanese researchers found the Borna disease virus &quot;in one third of their patients diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome&quot; and that this same virus &quot;has been implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder&quot; (p. 162).  I would not be surprised to learn that other chronic diseases of unclear etiology such as fibromyalgia, certain kinds of arthritis, and even unexplained chronic pain are caused or at least initiated by infectious agents, probably viruses.  (Actually I wouldn't be surprised to learn that a new kind of infectious agent, something smaller and stealthier than a virus is the cause of some human diseases.  But then I used to write science fiction.)<br />One of Ewald's main arguments is that we can lessen the virulence of pathogens by the way we interact with them. An insight from evolutionary medicine is that a pathogen cannot afford to kill its host before it can spread from that host.  However, if it can spread from the dead corpse of its host, then it can be as virulent as it likes.  In places in the world where there are no screens and mosquitoes have easy access to their victims, the malaria protozoan tends to weaken its victims so much they can't even swat mosquitoes (protecting its vector!).  However in areas where the buildings are made mosquito proof, the protozoan dare not be so virulent since the mosquitoes can only get to the hosts that are still able to be up and out of doors.  Similarly, sexually transmitted diseases are more benign in populations that tend to be monogamous or to change partners infrequently.  In populations that practice promiscuous sex frequently, the pathogen can afford to be very nasty becauseit will get transmitted often.  But if the host is not going to be having sex with anyone new or soon, the germ must be nice and bide its time without knocking its host out of action.  This principle also applies to cholera.  If people have access to clean water the cholera bacterium must be relatively benign because it is going to take a long time to get passed on.  But if the water supply is befouled with human feces, then the bacterium can be massively virulent, and in fact is rewarded for being so as its progeny come pouring out of the dying bodies of its victims and into the water supply.<br />One of the highlights of the book is Chapter Four, &quot;The Magnificent Defense&quot; in which Ewald describes the immune system and how it works in language that is vivid and easy to comprehend.  In a startlingly apt analogy he compares the immune system to our brain.  Both are incredibly complex systems constructed through the laborious trial and error mechanism of evolution.  And both are &quot;decision-making systems&quot; (p. 67).  I like this analogy and predict that researchers who have knowledge of both systems will make the scientific breakthroughs of the future.  I would add that knowledge of the elaborate, brain-like social systems of bees, ants, and termites would also be valuable.<br />Ewald concludes the book with some guidance on how we might better co-exist with pathogens.  One of the ideas is simple: stay home and don't go to work with a cold or flu.  Staying home will keep the pathogen relatively benign (p. 210).  He insists that we need more education about evolution in our schools, and even in college.  I couldn't agree more.  In the United States people that approve text books tend to be so terrified of know-nothing &quot;creationist&quot; types that high school biology texts typically mention evolution only as a side note, when in fact it is, as Ewald has it on page 237, &quot;the fundamental unifying principle of biology.&quot;e it will get transmitted often.

Since there is not enough space here to discuss the entire book, I will concentrate on a brief discussion of the first, &quot;Gene and Organism.&quot;<br />In this lecture Professor Lewontin outlines the role that genes, environment and chance (&quot;random noise&quot;) play in the development of an organism.  As he phrases it on page 20: &quot;the organism is not specified by its genes, but is a unique outcome of an ontogenetic process that is contingent on the sequence of environments in which it occurs.&quot;  This means that you could take the same genetic code and have it unfurl in Hyde Park and get an organism different from one you would get having it unfurl on, say, the Boston commons.  Lewontin shows how cuttings from the same plant cultured at different altitudes developed differentially, and in a manner that could not be predicted.  The reason they could not be predicted is that there is a significant amount of random variation (&quot;developmental noise&quot;) that occurs as the plant grows.  Lewontin gives the further example of a multiplying bacterium on page 37.  The bacterium divides in 63 minutes.  In another 63 minutes the daughter cells should divide again, giving four bacteria, but actually there is some random variation in how long it takes them to divide, so that one daughter divides in say 55 minutes, the other in an hour and five minutes.  And this continues so that the bacteria culture does not increase in pulses, but continuously in random increments.  This difference in timing in multi-cellar organisms may result in morphological differences since a catalytic enzyme may arrive too late to, say, grow a side bristle on a fruit fly (an example that Lewontin gives).  Lewontin applies this understanding to the development of our brains on page 38.  First there are random connections set.  &quot;Those connections that are reinforced from external inputs during neural development are stabilized, while the others decay and disappear.&quot;  This process, Lewontin advises us, can lead to differences in cognitive function that are neither strictly genetic nor strictly environmental.  They are influenced by random (unpredictable) factors.<br />This understanding is the reason that Lewontin is less than thrilled with the Human Genome Project.  He believes, as he makes clear in another book, It Ain't Necessary So: The Dream of the Human Genome and Other Illusions (2000), that we will be disappointed by what can be accomplished simply from sequencing the genetic code, his point being that even though we know the code,  the environmental and random factors cannot be known in any precise or predictive sense.  It is true that the genome for a chimp will always code for a chimp and never for a rabbit, but whether that chimp is good at math or has unusually aggressive tendencies is something we cannot know from an understanding of the genetic code alone.  Chance and environmental factors in development can result in a passive chimp even though its parents are aggressive.<br />Applying this idea to evolution in general, we can see that individual variation is not strictly a result of environmental differences but also of chance differences.  Consequently, what we are is not shaped strictly by adaptive pressure (natural selection) but is to some extent the result of purely random processes.  At one time in my life I studied chance and random events, and one of the most important things I learned is that the term &quot;random&quot; is not clearly defined, except in the sense that something that is random is unpredictable, which is a &quot;you can't prove a negative&quot; sort of definition.  I also learned that there is considerable doubt as to whether a truly randomizing device actually exists.  All real world devices, such as roulette wheels and computer random number algorithms can be shown to have some tiny bias, or to break down at the extremes.  (Don't trust the random number generator on your computer when you are generating a very large number of trials: it will begin to repeat, and your Monte Carlo simulation will be flawed.)  So what Lewontin calls &quot;random events&quot; are actually events that we simply do not know enough about to describe accurately.  It may be that with greater ability we will eventually be able to describe or control these events.  However, it may also be that at some level such events are the direct result of the probabilistic nature of a quantum event, and therefore in principle unpredictable.  I suspect that Lewontin believes something like this.<br />In the second lecture Lewontin makes the point that to a significant degree organisms create their environment, and it is wrong to think of a place (such as the surface of the moon) without organisms as an environment.  His dictum is &quot;...[T]here are no environments without organisms&quot; (p. 67).  In the third lecture Lewontin discusses some of the problems associated with genetic causation and its analysis.  There is a fourth chapter in which Lewontin attempts to provide some direction for future studies in biology.<br />I did not understand his assertion on page 81 that &quot;Only a quasi-religious commitment to the belief that everything in the world has a purpose would lead us to provide a functional explanation for fingerprint ridges or eyebrows or the patches of hair on men's chests.&quot;  The hair, I imagine is the result of sexual selection, but surely the fingerprint ridges allow us a better grip, and our eyebrows shade the sunlight as well as providing some small cushioning for our eye sockets.m number algorithms can be shown to have some tiny bias, or to break down at the extremes.

(1997) by Reuben Hersh.  In the latter, Gardner strongly disagrees with Hersh's thesis, insisting that mathematics does indeed exist outside the human mind, and that, for example, two plus two equals four anywhere in the galaxy.  (Notice my reluctance to write &quot;anywhere in the universe.&quot;)  Perhaps the most incisive essay is Gardner's debunking of the phony psychic surgeons, which he does in a style that would please both Carl Sagan and James Randi, and does indeed please this reviewer.  Notable in the review of Reflections in a Looking Glass (1998) by Morton Cohen about Lewis Carroll are two photos taken by the author of Alice in Wonderland, one of them of the real-life Alice herself.  Also included are introductions to new releases of three books by H.G. Wells.<br />I was particularly entertained by Gardner's deflation of William F. Buckley Jr. in his review of Buckley's Nearer, My God (1997).  It seems that Buckley believes whole heartedly in such fundamental Catholic doctrines as incarnation, virgin birth, atonement, the resurrection of Jesus, papal infallibility, hell, and hell fire.  Literally.  Gardner wonders if Buckley thinks that Eve was fabricated &quot;from one of Adam's ribs, or does he accept the evolution of human bodies?&quot; (p. 343).  Buckley replies to Gardner's review but does not respond to the question about evolution.  Gardner concludes that, in spite of his admirable faith, &quot;Buckley is guilty of what has been called the sin of willful ignorance.&quot;<br />I also liked Gardner's devaluation of the so-called science of memetics in his review of psychologist Susan Jane Blackmore's recent book, The Meme Machine.  Gardner sees the &quot;memes-eye view&quot; as &quot;little more than a peculiar terminology for saying the obvious&quot; (p. 214),  and he agrees with Stephen Jay Gould, who called memes &quot;meaningless metaphors&quot; (p. 215).<br />I have only one question of Mr. Gardner: how can you justify the time spent on reading works from the likes of Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye or about such charlatans as the Seventh Day Adventist fraud, Margaret Rowen?  I suspect Gardner would reply that he is doing a public service by flailing against the ever-present tide of pseudoscience and fake religiosity.  He undoubtedly feels as Carl Sagan did, that &quot;the rising flood of superstition and pseudoscience is too damaging to society to be ignored&quot; (p. 125).

Professors Ward and Brownlee from the University of Washington, the former a geologist, the latter an astronomer, argue very strongly that such an object will not be what we would call an animal or a metazoan.  Certainly the word &quot;intelligent&quot; will not apply to the first extraterrestrial.  Their thesis is that our earth is indeed rare, the product of innumerable rare events and unusual conditions, so much so that we should expect to find similar circumstances elsewhere only very rarely.  Acknowledging the recent discoveries of extremophiles, single-celled organisms that can live in very harsh environments, the authors aver that microbial life, on the other hand, should be plentiful.  They believe, nonetheless,  that the leap from microbes to complex life forms is a very rare event indeed.<br />Their argument is based on all the things that can go wrong.  They cite a formidable litany of hindrances including the need for a planet to be the right size at the right distance from a star of the right size and composition, to the need for plate tectonics (for biotic diversity and the recycling of materials) and a large moon (to stabilize the planet's tilt and temperature), to a Jupiter to sweep the system relatively free of deadly planet-crossing bodies, and especially to a very long time period in which to evolve, etc.<br />Their argument is tantalizing and difficult to fault.  We have only one example of the rise of complex life, and it seems reasonable to conclude that the factors that allowed this life to evolve are necessary.  But I am troubled.  If I look at the factors that led to my birth, my birth as exactly me, the whole process seems rather miraculous.  If my parents had never met, if my mother had had a headache that night, if, in fact, she or my father had behaved in any way differently from exactly how they did behave during the time up and including my conception, another little sperm might have fertilized the egg and I would not exist.  Or, take a hand at bridge.  If you are dealt 13 spades, you can be pretty sure that something fishy is going on since the odds against getting exactly 13 spades are astronomical.  However, the odds against being dealt any other exact hand at bridge are also astronomical, in fact the odds are identical.  But some combination of cards must be dealt!  So the fact that the development of complex life on this planet seems miraculous in the sense that everything had to be just right for it to develop may be a misconception.  I think it's akin to the anthropic principle.  If our solar system were different perhaps some other creatures would be here rhapsodizing over just how miraculous all the coincidences were that produced them!<br />The authors, of course, are talking about carbon-based &quot;life as we know it.&quot;  Since it is massively difficult to speculate on life as we don't know it, especially when considering that 90% of the universe, the so-called mysterious dark matter, is still totally beyond our ken, they are wise to qualify the argument.  I would add that life may take on forms and modes that we wouldn't recognize as being &quot;alive.&quot;  It may be, for example, that the stars are &quot;alive.&quot;  We know that they are born, they grow, reproduce and die.  They spew their seeds, the heavy elements out into space where they attract other elements and form new stars.  Such life would be &quot;life as we wouldn't recognize it.&quot;  There is also the possibility that life may take on forms and modes totally beyond our comprehension, giving us &quot;life as we can't possibly know it.&quot;  An example would be my friends &quot;the energy beings&quot; who live, reproduce and disappear in a small fraction of a nanosecond, too quick for us ever to be aware of them.<br />Yes, one may, I hope, speculate.  Certainly that is what the authors are doing here.  Regardless of how carefully they conform to what is currently known in a scientific sense, and regardless of how carefully those speculations are expressed, they are postulating from a sampling of one.  But the authors know this.  On page 282 they write, &quot;The great danger to our thesis...is that it is a product of our lack of imagination.  We assume in this book that animal life will be somehow Earth-like.  We take perhaps the jingoistic stance that...lessons from Earth are not only guides but also rules.&quot;  Nonetheless they say that &quot;evidence and inference&quot; lead them to believe that the earth is very rare indeed.<br />There is some redundant repetition from chapter to chapter, which can happen with two authors, and there are the usual &quot;spell-checker&quot; typos, i.e., &quot;out&quot; for &quot;our,&quot; etc., that occasionally mar the text, but no more than usual.  On page 267, however, they estimate that there are between 200 and 300 million stars in our galaxy.  Of course the number is more like 100 billion.  They probably meant that there are 200 to 300 million &quot;sun-like&quot; stars in our galaxy.  These quibbles aside, I think that the significant value of this book is that, in the process of arguing for their rare earth, Ward and Brownlee are able to share with us their formidable understanding of the latest findings in a number of sciences, especially geology, biology and astronomy, and apply that knowledge to astrobiology.  The material on tectonics and mass extinctions is especially interesting.

The prevalence of parasites in the earth's ecosystems is perhaps the worst of the dirty little secrets of life.  According to science journalist Carl Zimmer, the majority of animal species are parasitic (p. 187).  Bambi and Mickey Mouse had 'em, the sparrows outside your window are riddled with them, and you and I have them.  What you'll read about here is how creatures insinuate themselves into other creatures and take control of them; how, for example, a wasp inserts its eggs into a caterpillar and how the larva eat the caterpillar's flesh, and other equally ghastly processes.  The result is a view of life without rose colored glasses or any cute Disney characters.<br />I had a dream one night before going to the dentist.  I dreamed that there were scores of little white noodles like spaghetti coming out of my gums and tongue when I pressed them.  Initially I thought this was a dream of the grooming instinct.  But after reading Carl Zimmer's creepy but utterly fascinating book, I believe this primeval dream may have been a dream of parasites.<br />In a sense this is the scariest book I have ever read.  I had to put it aside twice because the horror depicted on its pages was affecting my usually buoyant state of mind.  Make no mistake about it, however objectively we may try to view our fellow creatures, it is impossible (at least for me) to see parasites as anything other than ugly and despicable.  (I'm working on it, however.)<br />But Zimmer has an important purpose in writing this book aside from scaring us.  He makes it clear that we cannot understand how an ecology works without understanding the role parasites play in that ecology.  For example on page 111 we have wolves choosing to attack a moose that is slow and wheezing, a moose riddled with tapeworms, tapeworms seeking their final host, the wolf!  The wolves are led to choose the infected moose perhaps by a scent in the moose's breath, created by the tapeworms.  &quot;The thinning of the herd is an illusion, not the service of the predator but the side effect of a tapeworm traveling through its life.&quot;<br />In Chapter 3, &quot;The Thirty Years' War,&quot; Zimmer shows how the immune system fights against parasites.  It is an excellent exposition on how the immune system works, and one of the highlights of the book.  In the chapter &quot;Evolution from Within,&quot; we see parasites as a driving force in evolution.  The idea that sexuality began as a way to fight disease, the so-called &quot;Red Queen&quot; hypothesis is presented.  Zimmer shows how being different instead of a clone of the mother (asexual reproduction) can lead to characteristics that foil parasites.  There are sixteen pages of glossy photos of parasites, several showing the grotesque heads of tapeworms in intimate detail.  There are photos of a crustacean parasite that invades a fish's mouth, eats its tongue and then takes the place of the tongue.<br />A question that might be asked is, what is a parasite?  Certainly in biology a parasite is different than a symbiont, which is distinguished from a predator, etc.  Zimmer gives Richard Dawkins's definition that &quot;Parasitism is any arrangement in which one set of DNA is replicated with the help of--and at the expense of--another set of DNA&quot; (p. 126).  By this definition perhaps humans are parasites on Planet Gaia.  Zimmer suggests as much on page 245 adding that &quot;There's no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the parasitic way of life.&quot;  He explains that expert parasites do no more harm than is necessary.  &quot;If Gaia had an immune system, it might be disease and famine&quot; to keep &quot;an exploding species from taking over the world.  But we have dodged these safeguards with medicines and toilets and other safeguards...&quot;<br />Zimmer ends the book on a rather cheery note: parasites as the canary in the coal mine.  He argues that parasites are not only an indication of ecological health (plenty of parasites suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243).  He also gives some idea of how parasites might benefit us more directly, such as a fungus that invades insects as &quot;the source of cyclosporin, an important antibiotic&quot; or the use of blood-clotting molecules produced by hookworms as blood thinners in surgery (p. 238).  Although there have been failures in the use of parasites to control insect populations, and Zimmer recounts two or three, there is also the story of how a parasitic wasp imported from South America saved the African cassava crop from mealybugs (pp. 220-228).<br />As others have noted, reading this book will forever change the way you view the natural world, and might make you cancel that trip to the tropics.tes suggests a healthy ecosystem; a drop in their numbers suggests trouble, perhaps from pollution), but are vital to the ecology by keeping animal populations in check (pp. 241-243).

The essays are presented with new footnotes and cross references followed by an Exchange and/or an Epilogue in which the material is updated and some contrary points of view presented and addressed.  The expression is erudite, polished and complex, the tone authoritative and at times slyly satirical and not more than a microbe's breath away from the pompous.<br />The first essay, &quot;The Inferiority Complex&quot; is a review of Stephen Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man (1981) which deals with the IQ conundrum.  Lewontin's main point here, in agreement with Gould, is that &quot;there may be genes for the shape of our heads, [but] there cannot be any for the shape of our ideas&quot; (p. 9).  I'm not sure I agree with that rousing call to the uniqueness of human kind, but I am confident that no one has yet refuted such a point of view.  Not entirely as a surprise Gould (in a jacket blurb) acknowledges Lewontin as &quot;the smartest man I have ever met.&quot;<br />Gould is not the only one to sing praises to Lewontin's intellect and understanding.  Noam Chomsky chimes in with an acknowledgment of &quot;the impressive quality and significance&quot; of Lewontin's essays, while a book I just finished reading, Steve Jones's excellent Darwin's Ghost (1999) is dedicated to Lewontin, who showed him &quot;what evolution can and cannot explain.&quot;  Perhaps that is Lewontin's main strength, as a anchor on the ship of biological presumption that would sail us to a questionable nirvana of the pre-determined.  I can say from my own experience that the very learned professor reminds me of someone I would call &quot;the Edmund Wilson of book critics biological.&quot;  He is also the very distinguished Alexander Agassiz Research Professor at Harvard and the author of several books on genetics and related subjects, most characteristically perhaps, Not in Our Genes (1984) with Steven P. R. Rose and Leon J. Kamin.<br />Why then am I not entirely thrilled with this beautifully wrought collection of unquestionably significant and stimulating essays?  I think it's that I disagree with his point of view and emphasis, and feel that the sequencing of the human genome really is a significant step toward our understanding of who and what we are, and I don't care who, or who did not, get rich in advancing it..  I also think that the practical applications from such information may prove valuable in ways we cannot begin to predict.  I am a fool for knowledge if only for knowledge's sake, and I wonder why Lewontin has expended so much energy knocking the project.  His real criticism of the effort, despite his use of the derogatory words, &quot;dream&quot; and &quot;illusion&quot; and even &quot;fetish&quot; (p. 135) is presented on page 177: &quot;The promise of great advances in medicine, not to speak of our knowledge of what it is to be human, is yet to be realized from sequencing the human genome.&quot;<br />Who could disagree with that?  He also writes on page 151, &quot;Causal stories are lacking...nor is it clear, when actual cases are considered, how therapies will flow from a knowledge of DNA sequences.&quot;  Again, who could disagree?  However this is political-speak.  It says nothing that can be seized upon and found derogatory, yet hints at failure and disappointment.  Characteristically, Lewontin writes nothing that one can find direct fault with, yet by indirection and association he belittles the effort.  I would note that the word &quot;fetish&quot; is not used directly as a coloration of the project, but as an indirect association.  People have said that The New York Review of Books is really The New York Review of Each Others Books, and therefore constitutes a close-knit club with a shared political point of view.  I will withhold such a judgment since I have only a passing familiaritywith that very prestigious publication.<br />Putting all that aside, I found myself, while reading the third chapter, &quot;Darwin, Mendel, and the Mind,&quot; wondering if Lewontin was really conscious of his own thought processes when on page 103 he relates that he &quot;passed among three very different mental states all under the control of the willful I.&quot;  Ah, if only that &quot;willful I&quot; really was in control and had the power to consciously regulate our mental states.  Lewontin seems unaware that it takes many years of devoted practice to still the &quot;monkey mind&quot; and allow one an observation of one's mental processes.  He asks rhetorically (still on p. 103), the question he calls  the &quot;central problem...for neurobiology,&quot; namely, &quot;What is &quot;I&quot;?  This is indeed a profound question, asked at least as early as the Upanishads.  The modern answer, which Lowentin must know, but does not present, is that the I is an illusion that we cannot help but believe.  He goes on to argue with Daniel Dennett against the idea of consciousness as a &quot;metaphorical delusion&quot; (p. 105) without realizing that there is a crucial difference between a &quot;delusion,&quot; metaphorical or otherwise, and an illusion.  If he looks more closely he might find that consciousness is a trick of the evolutionary process, the main purpose of which is to make us fear death by forcing us to identify intensely with our particular phenotype.  Our subjective appreciation of consciousness is a wondrous byproduct of that identification.ty with that very prestigious publication.<br />Putting all that aside, I found myself, while reading the third chapter, &quot;Darwin, Mendel, and the Mind,&quot; wondering if Lewontin was really conscious of his own thought processes when on page 103 he relates that he &quot;passed among three very different mental states all under the control of the willful I.&quot;  Ah, if only that &quot;willful I&quot; really was in control and had the power to consciously regulate our mental states.

It would be hard to argue with that since the chapter by chapter plan of Jones's book closely follows Darwin's and many of the examples of evolution at work are elaborations on Darwinian themes.  As Jones tells us in the Historical Sketch that begins his book, what Darwin was at pains to accomplish in The Origin of Species (1859) was to make &quot;a bold statement of the idea of evolution&quot; while at the same time produce &quot;a work of persuasion as to how it took place.&quot;<br />Darwin knew that the persuasion would be the hard part.  Now a hundred and forty-two years later, many people are still not persuaded, perhaps the vast majority of people.  In his introduction Jones notes that, according to an opinion poll taken in 1991, a hundred million Americans believe that &quot;God created man pretty much in his present form at one time during the last ten thousand years.&quot;  So Jones too has his work cut out for him.  Although his lively prose is perhaps more accessible to a modern reader than Darwin's Victorian cadences, he, like Darwin, will reach only a very small minority of the human race.  That's a shame since Jones's arguments and evidence for the veritable fact of evolution are overwhelmingly powerful and impossible to deny.  They are also fascinating to read.  Some examples:<br />So powerful is the process of evolution that zoos, human institutions that attempt to preserve threatened species, cannot.  Instead the animals evolve within the constraints of their new environment and become (eventually) altered versions of their wild ancestors (p. 36).<br />On the differentiation of sex cells into sperm and egg, Jones writes, &quot;Long ago...sex cells were all the same size and fused to make an embryo...  Then self-interest made an appearance and one partner moved to making smaller but more abundant cells.  He (for such was, from that moment, his gender) might have hungry young, but there were more of them&quot; (pp. 81-82)<br />On the &quot;Cambrian Explosion&quot;: &quot;...a failure of the geological record rather than of the Darwinian machine.  Its radical new groups reflect not a set of exceptional events, but something more banal: the first appearance of animals with parts capable of preservation&quot; (p. 207)<br />Professor Jones does not limit himself strictly to observations on evolution.  His erudition includes references and allusions to literature, classic and modern, notably Shakespearean, where the grave digger from Hamlet makes an appearance in order to further our knowledge of the decomposition of buried bodies.  Jones is particularly strong on using knowledge from other disciplines to illustrate the process of evolution.  He notes, for example, that a new Hawaiian island, &quot;to be named Loihi&quot; is &quot;under construction&quot; and due to &quot;break the surface in thirty thousand years&quot; (p. 262)  On page 287, we learn that there is a fresh water lake beneath the Antarctic ice that scientists want to drill into &quot;in the hope of finding yet another universe of life.&quot;  On page 231 we are reminded that four hundred million years ago our year was four hundred days long, the evidence coming from the growth rings of corals.<br />Part of the illuminating power of this book is in the effective use of metaphor and analogy.  Thus a new island rising out of the ocean is compared to a new born child, waiting to be invaded by flora and fauna, grasses and/or bacteria, as the case may be.  Or, on page 307, junk DNA is compared to &quot;the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in the pronunciation.&quot;  Twice Jones refers to species becoming nonsexual as &quot;abandoning their males,&quot; an expression that sheds starklight on the nature of sexuality.  Sometimes Jones decorates his text with sly, humorous asides, as on page 237 where he is discussing grape varieties he notes that &quot;Britain has an Anything but Chardonnay club.&quot;  Or on page 294 where he makes the observation that our brain has become &quot;so elaborate as--so far--to be unable to understand itself.&quot;<br />The only weakness of this book--and perhaps it is not a weakness at all--is the conversational tone that contrasts somewhat with Darwin's laboriously cast sentences as he oh, so carefully advanced his argument.  Jones knows that the argument is long past the point of being overwhelming. What is really needed is a greater acquaintance with the argument by a larger public.  Jones's lively tome, packed with fascinating information, is a small, but welcome step in that direction.ark light on the nature of sexuality.

(Perhaps they had a falling out.)  The result is a somewhat breezy, understandably limited, People-like introduction to their work, personalities and lifestyle.  There is an introduction and a concluding chapter.<br />What we can learn from this book is that science as it is practiced today is a highly social and political enterprise where those who would make it big must learn to toot their horn.  Indeed, what these seven scientists have in common, aside from their great energy, is a gift for public relations.  Some, like Susan Greenfield and Gretchen Daily, have a brash, aggressive style more often seen in the world of business than in the world of science.  Venter, the founder of Celera, a company with a lot of venture capital behind it as it sequences the human genome, has meshed the two worlds so completely that he is as much an entrepreneur as he is a scientist.  We see here too that success in science today requires an inter- and multi-disciplinary approach as envisioned by E.O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, a book twice cited by Anton.  We can also see that a successful scientist has to be an effective communicator, almost an administrator, in this age of surplus information.<br />Anton's style is occasionally vivid, sometimes careless and all too quickly done.  It appears that he had some sort of deadline to meet along with length restrictions.  In some cases he may not have followed up properly.  I was annoyed at some points with partial information.  For example, on page 84 he is telling the story of Polly Matzinger's accidental involvement with a Private or Sergeant Duffy, a police officer who borrows her car to do some police work.  But Anton never makes it clear what happened to Duffy or whether he was a detective or not.  Or, on page 85 where Matzinger, in her cocktail waitressing days, tells UC animal behaviorist Robert Schwab that she &quot;never understood why a raccoon did not impersonate a skunk to scare off predators.&quot;  I didn't get that one.  (How?)  And Anton doesn't explain.  Also, on page 136 Anton recalls a bet between Paul Ehrlich of The Population Bomb fame and economist Julian Simon, Simon betting that the prices of five commodities would not rise over a ten year period.  Simon wins the bet, but Anton does not tell us what the commodities were!<br />I was also displeased by some of the carelessness.  Ernest Rutherford is &quot;Earnest&quot; Rutherford in the index and on page 150.  Paul Ehrlich becomes Paul &quot;Erlich&quot; on page 137.  On page 144 the bacterium tuberculosis is described as a virus!  And on page 145 Anton is summing up Gretchen Daily's work in Costa Rica: &quot;They were getting good results, finding that even a small amount of preserved forest...will preserve significantly greater species diversity that would have been expected.  The possibility of maximizing tradeoffs was there, if only one knew where to look.&quot;  After I got past the typo &quot;that&quot; for &quot;than&quot; I still did not know what &quot;tradeoffs&quot; Anton was talking about.  Tradeoffs between what and what?  I suspect some text was cut and the remaining wording not adjusted.<br />On the plus side, Anton has the ability to bring his characters to life with concrete details about their habits and their struggles, Geoff Marcy seeing a therapist for depression, Susan Greenfield giving up smoking as a marriage agreement, Polly Matzinger as a Playboy bunny who amassed $500 in parking tickets while sporting a bumper sticker reading &quot;Commit Random Acts of Kindness.&quot;  He can also be effective with figures of speech, as on page 134 where he is talking about &quot;the vagaries of global warming&quot;: &quot;If done improperly, the simplest climate forecasts spaghettied into infinite complexity.&quot;  Or on page 132 where he is making the point that most microbes don't culture well or easily, so that most &quot;biological work concentrated on the few weeds, like Escherichia coli, that could be studied in pure culture.&quot;  Occasionally, Anton is able to catch the essence of an idea in a short expression, as on page 173 where he sums up one of Gretchen Daily's ideas: &quot;the predators of insects will count for you the number of insects in an ecosystem.&quot;<br />I wonder if Anton had planned a larger book, perhaps one with photographs of the scientists in the field or in their lab, but for some reason a book that had to be abandoned.  At any rate this book could have been outstanding had it been better edited and copyread, had it included photographs of the scientists (one picture here would indeed be worth a thousand words) and had Anton included short bibliographies of the published work of his seven scientists.  As is, I think this might be valuable for those people thinking of starting a career in science, or for those just beginning their careers.  Anton makes it clear that the talents required to rise to the top are often extraneous to the day-to-day work of the scientist, and that would be a good thing for someone just starting out to know.rting a bumper sticker reading &quot;Commit Random Acts of Kindness.&quot;  He can also be effective with figures of speech, as on page 134 where he is talking about &quot;the vagaries of global warming&quot;: &quot;If done improperly, the simplest climate forecasts spaghettied into infinite complexity.&quot;  Or on page 132 where he is making the point that most microbes don't culture well or easily, so that most &quot;biological work concentrated on the few weeds, like Escherichia coli, that could be studied in pure culture.&quot;  Occasionally, Anton is able to catch the essence of an idea in a short expression, as on page 173 where he sums up one of Gretchen Daily's ideas: &quot;the predators of insects will count for you the number of insects in an ecosystem.&quot;<br />I wonder if Anton had planned a larger book, perhaps one with photographs of the scientists in the field or in their lab, but for some reason a book that had to be abandoned.

True it is 412 pages long, but the back matter begins with the footnotes on page 258.  There follows a glossary, a 57-page bibliography, an author index and a subject index.  Also, even though this is clearly an academic tome written by a professional ecologist who is not about to compromise her standing in the scientific community for a shot at popular success, Professor Low nonetheless employs a readable and common sense approach with a minimum of unnecessary jargon.  Furthermore, what she has to say is exciting and relevant to our lives, and we can see that she cares as much about communicating to the reader as she does about pleasing colleagues.  Reading Why Sex Matters is consequently one very engaging experience.<br /><br />Low, who is a professor of ecology at the University of Michigan, assumes the point of view of an evolutionary biologist as she asks the question, how are men and women different and why?  She is particularly focused on how the sexes differentially use resources to further reproduction, and asks which behaviors are ephemeral, due to present conditions, and which are more enduring, having proven adaptive over longer periods of time and in differing environments.  She faces squarely the unsettling feeling that some people get when they contemplate humans purely as biological entities--or \\"critters,\\" to use her expression.  As she tells us in the preface, there are three themes guiding her work: One, \\"resources are useful in...survival and reproduction\\"; two, \\"the sexes...differ in how they...use resources\\"; and three, \\"each sex accomplishes these ends\\" by reacting to the environment differently.  The result of this structured approach is a clear introductory course in sexuality from an evolutionary point of view, and a fascinating read.<br /><br />Because Low employs resources from a wide variety of disciplines, including sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, behavioral genetics, ecology, anthropology, sociology, biology, history, etc., not to mention pop culture and world literature, her work is highly persuasive in a scientific sense.  And because she studiously avoids squabbling among the disciplines, her work is psychologically compelling.  There is material on cultural transmissions as well as natural selection.  Demographers are given currency along with evolutionary biologists.  One gets the sense that she has read just about everything and has thoroughly evaluated what she has read.  Particular interesting to me is her discussion of the tangled origins of sexuality and the (non-obvious) nature of altruism.  The chapters on warfare, \\"Sex, Resources, and Early Warfare,\\" and \\"The Ecology of Warfare\\" are worth the price of the book alone. There we see that women warriors are rare because men can gain reproductive advantage through warfare but women cannot (p. 216).  Low suggests that war may be an example of \\"runaway sexual selection\\" and its practitioners may have become \\"unhooked\\" from the old reproductive rewards, but that the proximate rewards remain.  Low soberly faces the prospect of future warfare when small groups of people may acquire monstrous weapons, noting that \\"given a short-term gain...versus an unspecifiable risk of nuclear warfare...in the future, we do not predict restraint.\\"<br /><br />It should be clear that Low is a professional academician and not a journalist, as some popular writers on evolution are (Matt Ridley and  Robert Wright, to name two of the best), and as such careful about her assertions.  She doesn't espouse pet theories that may be overturned tomorrow; but she isn't afraid to voice her opinion.  To give you a sense of her careful style, note the stunning qualification in the parenthetical in this statement from page 217 (and the sly irony): \\"Human war can become more complex and varied than intergroup aggression in other species, largely as a result of the development of technology (which itself is probably a product of intelligence).\\"  Probably, indeed!<br /><br />In the chapter on \\"Politics and Reproduction\\" we learn that men seek political power for reproductive gain (p. 211) but in the modern nation state may have to settle for proximate gains (which may be an irony not lost on Bill Clinton).  Women, however, can gain little or no reproductive advantage directly for themselves, which may be the reason there are relatively few women in the top positions of political power in most human societies.<br /><br />Some of this I admit is tough going.  The material on \\"The Group Selection Muddle\\" in Chapter Nine is still muddled in my mind, and I couldn't figure out the point of the Summary of Selection Theories (Table 9.1 on pages 156-157).  But evolution and the disciplines that address human behavior are complex, in some ways, deceptively so.<br /><br />Professor Low is wise, temperate, thorough and more objective than seems possible in such a vibrant and contentious academic field.  I suspect that this book started out as an undergraduate text, but somewhere along the line those reading the manuscript realized that it was so interesting and valuable that it could be published as a trade book aimed at a general readership.  If you have time to read only one book on human nature, read this one.  You will learn more than you would from half a dozen \\"popular\\" expositions, and you will have a sense of having learned something important and valuable.  I wish I knew what is in this book when I was one and twenty.  I would have conducted my life with a lot more grace and effectiveness.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"chnology (which itself is probably a product of intelligence).\\"  Probably, indeed!<br /><br />In the chapter on \\"Politics and Reproduction\\" we learn that men seek political power for reproductive gain (p. 211) but in the modern nation state may have to settle for proximate gains (which may be an irony not lost on Bill Clinton).

Karlen is a psychoanalyst by trade and a historian of microbiology by inclination.  He fell in love with the world of the very small when as a boy he was given a microscope.  Karlen is also a fine prose stylist with a sharp sense of the ecological.  In fact this book is really a kind of treatise on ecology, with a concentration on the environment of a bacterium.  Borrelia burgdorferi is spread by ticks that bite small animals such as mice and squirrels and larger animals such as deer and sometimes humans.  What Karlen accomplishes in this modest little book is to make vivid just what a &quot;germ&quot; is for a general readership.  If you are in a fog about microbes and would like a painless, lively introduction, then this book may serve you very well.<br />I always imagined that bacteria split about every twenty minutes.  Here I learned that some bacteria do split every twenty minutes or so, but others take hours and some even longer.  I was also fuzzy about just how it is that microbes cause disease.  Do they &quot;eat&quot; human flesh or destroy our cells with toxins or hog our nutrients for themselves?  Turns out that some do one thing and some do another.  Karlen emphasizes that sometimes what they do is cause symptoms: fever, muscle aches, fatigue, inflamation, etc., which are actually the result of our immune system's aggressive response to the presence of something foreign.  Sometimes this can get so out of hand that our immune system continues to attack our own cells even after the microbe is gone, as is suspected in rheumatoid arthritis and possibly fibromyalgia (p. 160).  And sometimes microbes commandeer some part of our system in order to better spread themselves around by making us sneeze or cough (cold viruses) or by giving us diarrhea (cholera).<br />There is a lot of other information in this little book, including such diverse facts as tumble weeds being native to southern Russia and not the western United States as I had always thought, or that the people of Lyme, Connecticut didn't appreciate having a disease named after their town.  It is also interesting to know that microbes can &quot;hide&quot; in our bodies for years and then break out during times of overload or stress.<br />Karlen digresses nicely in spots, giving his opinion on the Gaia concept (he likes the &quot;original, narrower version&quot; p. 63), and how he feels about the deer population in the U.S. (he thinks there are too many).  This last is directly relevant since it is on the deer that the ticks that are the vectors for Lyme disease mate and are able to reproduce.  He recalls some history (the cholera epidemics in London in the nineteenth century, Spanish flu in America, etc.) and literature (Defoe's Journal of the Plague Year; the anonymous The Autobiography of a Flea), and in a footnote (p. 29) cites a story by Isaac Babel about syphilis (a bacterium related to Borrelia burgdorferi) entitled &quot;Guy de Maupassant.&quot;  A story by Isaac Babel about Guy de Maupassant is like a movie by Stephen Spielberg about Stanley Kubrick!<br />In summation, this is microbiology as literature, ecology as belles lettres seen in part from the perspective of a germ.g native to southern Russia and not the western United States as I had always thought, or that the people of Lyme, Connecticut didn't appreciate having a disease named after their town.

It is not nearly enough to say that someone is black, or brown or white since there are many shades of black, brown and white, and as far as skin goes not one of them is really black, brown or white.  Also there is a difference in the smoothness and texture of skin that is seldom addressed, but very keenly felt.  I am amazed that I can tell the relative age of someone even in a still photo by the feel of their skin that my eyes can discern.  Is there anything so appealing as the graphite smooth skin of youth?  And how we notice it!  And how we long to reclaim it!  Which, in a sense, is what Lapp&eacute; means by &quot;Our Cultural Obsession with Skin.&quot;  We are attracted to and repulsed by the skin of others.  Big pores may offend us.  An oily sheen may put us off.  Freckles we may like or not.  Skin advertises our age and the state of our health.  Try as we might we cannot hide because our skin is there for all to see..  And the skin doesn't lie, although how hard we try to get it to!<br />This is an informative and interesting but hardly inclusive little book, especially strong on how we try to improve the appearance of our skin.  One of Lapp&eacute;'s major points is that there isn't all that much we can do.  Most of what the pharmaceutical industry sells us doesn't work.  He offers insights into how the skin functions, to what extent it is a barrier and a sieve.  He includes material on &quot;the silicone story,&quot; and skin diseases, but is a little heavy on his role and interest in testifying against some chemical companies--but certainly I think we can approve of that.<br />Although I enjoyed reading this, I would like to see a book on skin that goes more deeply into the cross-cultural and political aspects of skin, how the color and texture, how the oiliness and the blemishes of the skin affect different people.  Also a more detailed history about attitudes toward skin differences would be very interesting, including practices such as scaring, tattooing and how the grooming instinct is played out on the skin.<br />In short this is readable and interesting, but only touches the surface.

Understandably, the contrarian-minded author of The End of Science (1996), finds fault with all of them.  What he doesn't do is set up any sort of pecking order of effectiveness among them.  Thus the reader is left to conclude that those who advocate lobotomies and electroshock treatment, for example, are no further off base than those who advocate the use of Prozac or other SSRIs.  Horgan actually suggests that all mind science approaches might be helpful (as in &quot;All have won and all deserve prizes&quot;-the &quot;dodo hypothesis&quot; from Alice in Wonderland that he seems to be making fun of in Chapter Three, but then adopts).  He himself would try (for depression) &quot;psychotherapy first, and the antidepressants.  If they didn't work...I might give the shock therapy expert...a call.&quot;<br />John, I recommend placebo therapy first.  And whatever you do don't go near those electrodes without the signed approval of your wife and kids, your employer, your lawyer, your publisher, and a good father confessor.  Call your grandmother.  If they all agree it's okay, call me.  Also, you might reread your own book which includes the inescapable conclusion that none of these therapies is much better than the mere passage of time, something known, by the way, as you report, for many decades.<br />Another part of the book is about the issues in mind-science, especially the question of consciousness, an enigma Horgan doesn't expect to be solved anytime soon, if ever.  I would like to say that the question of consciousness, like the question of God, is at first a problem of definition.  The disputants are often talking about different things.  To one, consciousness is akin to &quot;awareness.&quot;  To another it's something like &quot;ego-identity.&quot;  To a third it's something like &quot;spiritual awareness.&quot;  Just as the God of the Vedas, about which nothing can be said, is very different from the God of conservative Christianity, who has a bad temper and seeks to punish sinners, so too is the idea of consciousness as simply a degree of awareness a far cry from consciousness as self-identity.  After the disputants agree on their definitions I would ask (and I think this is Horgan's feeling), how can an ant comprehend itself in its entirety? or Can a pillar of salt measure the ocean of Brahman?<br />Horgan also considers the question of machine consciousness or the consciousness of artificial intelligence.  Here one can easily see the functionality of solipsism.  If I have any doubt about someone else being conscious (of course I have no doubt about myself--I think) how much easier it is to doubt that a machine may be conscious.  If I can't ever prove that anyone other than myself is conscious (and I can't), how am I going to prove that a machine is?<br />So I think Horgan's essential skepticism is largely justified.  When, in some distant millennium, we finally do understand ourselves, we will no longer be what we are today.  However, along the way, I think it should be noticed, for example, that evolutionary psychology has a much firmer scientific basis than say psychoanalysis.  And it might be pointed out that one has to be pretty desperate to try &quot;electro-convulsive therapy,&quot; which is what electroshock therapy is currently being called.  That Horgan was able to describe the horrors of lobotomy and the currently popular surgical procedure, &quot;cingulotomy&quot; without once noting that such &quot;treatments&quot; are anything more than &quot;controversial&quot; (page 129) suggests a loss of perspective.  On page 134 he allows that he is concerned &quot;that drugs [Prozac, etc.], and to a lesser extent, shock therapy have been oversold.&quot;  He adds that &quot;the administration of psychiatric drugs to children has gotten out of hand.&quot;<br />&quot;Oversold&quot;?  &quot;Out of hand&quot;?  Horgan doesn't say whether a cingulotomy, in which a &quot;marble-sized bundle of nerves&quot; that links the frontal lobe (instead of the whole frontal lobe) is severed, is an &quot;out of hand&quot; treatment or even whether he would, as a last resort, choose such a treatment for himself should the other three fail.<br />On target however is the way he addresses the notion that physics is &quot;the most fundamental--and thus most important--scientific research.&quot; (p 259)  He calls on physicist Philip Anderson to point out that &quot;Reality has a hierarchical structure...with each level independent, to some degree, of the levels above and below.&quot;  Anderson adds, &quot;At each stage, entirely new laws, concepts, and generalizations are necessary, requiring inspiration and creativity to just as great a degree as in the previous one.&quot;  That the so-called soft sciences such as psychology are actually more complex than the so-called hard sciences is one of Horgan's implicit points, and one of the reasons he believes mind-science hasn't really accomplished much as yet, or indeed ever will.

He responded, \\"I am the king,\\" a line he stole from a mattress retailer out of L.A.  He repeats that line to himself aloud every once in a while because he likes the way it sounds.  \\"I am the king.\\"  There is a certain quick tempo to the \\"am\\" as though he is realizing as he says it that he is indeed the king.<br /><br />Queenan is actually an entertainment biz critic who came up the hard way, a man who has mastered the fine art of the gratuitous put down and the non sequitur character assassination.  He is a kind of like a low rent George Sanders from All About Eve (1950)--a film I know he saw as a kid because I can see his unconscious self still striving to emulate the Sanders character because, after all, the guy's girl of the evening was Marilyn Monroe.  Ah, how the unrealized dreams of our youth do so guide our wayward path!  Although he tries to keep hidden which babes he really likes in the movies, usually insulting one and all, especially the young and fetching ones (slyly kissing it up to his nonexistent female readership), it can be seen that he goes for those blond bombshells, but apparently doesn't want somebody, perhaps his wife, to know.<br /><br />Our hero, for all that, does have a certain brassy felicity with words that commands attention, the same way a loud highschool band outside your bedroom window might.  And the indefatigable choir boy from the mean streets of Philly really has seen more movies, especially bad ones, than I could ever sit through, and so has picked up a little bit of the art of cinema, enough anyway to qualify as a couch potato afficionado.  Reading his rude lectures to semi-admired directors and his haranguing of actors he doesn't approve of (that appears to be ALL actors with the exception of David Bowie (yes!)and perhaps John Gielgud on a good day, and certainly NOT, e.g., Olivier, whom he refers to as \\"Lord Larry\\"), reminds me of a beer league basketballer critiquing the state college coach's substitution patterns.  You have to sort carefully through all the snide remarks and deprecating asides to sift out a kernel of evidence that Queenan actually liked something he saw.  My lord, what a life, to spend a significant part of your waking hours watching films you hate.  But apparently somebody has to do it.  Occasionally in a campy aside on a very bad film, Queenan will pretend to like something.  He's like the tough kid who can't allow that he likes anything other than blood and guts for fear of losing face and looking like a wuss.<br /><br />Anyway, this collection of his work (\\"essays\\" is what he calls them) from mostly Movieline Magazine and Rolling Stone in the early nineties will afford one a few chuckles and some real delight if he is lambasting one of your bêtes noires.  Otherwise you might find that our boy grates rather annoyingly on the nerves.

2208824:US	49786731	R2U0KNI8KHIKSA	0684804557	592146963	Stone Age Present: How Evolution Has Shaped Modern Life -- From Sex, Violence and Language to Emotions, Morals and Communities	Books	4	15	19	N	N	Good, but keeps the rose-colored glasses on	The point implied in the title is a good one: we are stone age animals living in an electronic jungle.  The Environment of Evolutionary Adaption, which was the savannas of Africa, disappeared for most of us long ago; but genetically and phenotypically speaking we have changed very little.  Thus the first four words of the title are beguiling; the rest after the colon, I suspect, was something formulated by a committee of book biz editors trying to spice up the presentation.<br />This is evolutionary psychology written by a journalist, readable with some worthwhile insights.  It should be compared to Richard Wright's The Moral Animal (1994) and Matt Ridley's The Red Queen (1993) from the same time period.  This is a comparison that could be extended to other books on evolutionary psychology, including anthropologist Marvin Harris's Our Kind (1989): sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson's earlier, On Human Nature (1978); Robert Jay Russell's The Lemur's Legacy (1993); Richard Wrangham's  Demonic Males (1996), etc.  Incidentally Amazon has all these books and others, so you might want to do a little comparison shopping.  What one notices is that Allman's book is, relatively speaking, a feel-good, sanitized narrative.  Our stone age ancestors did not kill a cow and cut up its carcass and distribute it to others in order to enhance their power and prestige and to gain reproductive favors, as most &quot;observers&quot; would have it; but, according to Allman, to share &quot;with friends and neighbors&quot; and &quot;courting lovers.&quot;  It is amazing what a difference terminology can make.  Allman almost allows us to embrace evolutionary psychology and its rather unflattering insights and keep the rose-colored glasses on.  The tone is positive and reasoned.  The book is also as politically correct, although not as annoyingly PC, as Wrangham's Demonic Males.<br />I should mention that one of the major themes in this book and in recent evolutionary psychology  is that our brains grew big and smart to deal with the our complex social lives.  This is the current wisdom.  Well, as Satchel Paige said, &quot;The social ramble ain't restful,&quot; and as I've always said, socializing is a lot of work.  Yes, I think this really does explain how our brains got to be so big.  We needed to be really smart to outsmart the other guy.  We needed to be smart to juggle all those intrigues, social, political and sexual.  I like the way this insight fits with the female's abhorrence of nerds: the fact of the matter is, not being social is also not being smart!  So there, nerds!<br />Like Harris, Allman does not see civilization or the rise of agriculture as necessarily a good thing for the average Joe.  And he is firm in discounting the idea that human beings represent &quot;progress&quot; on the evolutionary scale.  Interestingly, Allman reports extensively from Robert Axelrod's work on cooperation in an attempt to make us look like good guys.  Axelrod is the guy who devised the computer models testing the prisoner's dilemma and held the competition that revealed the now well-known and celebrated &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; strategy that won it (initially cooperate and then act toward the other as that other has acted toward you: tit for tat).  Tit for tat also appeared in Wright's The Moral Animal and in Ridley's The Origins of Virtue and elsewhere.  I think Axelrod might have had a press agent.  At any rate, tit for tat is now seen as needing a random and forgiving variation in order to defeat various other strategies, including ruthlessly non-cooperative ones.<br />This is a pretty book, originally from Simon &amp; Schuster, very well edited and copyread (thank you!).ns grew big and smart to deal with the our complex social lives.

2212237:US	49786731	R1K84BK49LL8PF	0553380141	180155384	Beyond the Influence: Understanding and Defeating Alcoholism	Books	5	105	119	N	N	Updates a classic of informative literature	Beyond the Influence is an update and an elaboration of Katherine Ketcham and James R. Milam's Under the Influence (1981).  Whereas the first book was an emergency crash course in alcoholism, this is the full curriculum.<br />The main point the authors make is that alcoholism is a disease that anyone who has the susceptible internal chemistry can get, be he saint or sinner, tower of strength or shriveling weakling.  It doesn't make any difference.  Your personality or moral fiber are irrelevant.  We tend to think that alcoholics are somehow immoral or possessed of a character flaw.  But, as Ketcham, et al., demonstrate here, there is only one flaw that leads to alcoholism, and that flaw is one of internal chemistry and not of character.  Furthermore, despite some pollyannaish delusion to the contrary, there is only one cure and this book makes it clear exactly what that cure is.<br />The updated material presented here (in the main, a greater appreciation of the power of Alcoholics Anonymous, a more in-depth discussion of the relevant chemistry, an elaboration of the spiritual aspects of recovery, an incisive attack on &quot;The Booze Merchants,&quot; a clearer inventory of how alcoholics can be diagnosed before the onset of the latter stages of the disease, and a delineation of how recovery can be achieved) make this a very superior book and for the most part a worthy update.  However these additions also make Beyond the Influence less accessible than UTI, which was more direct, and was smaller and weighed less.  This last may seem a minor point, but I could pocket the old book while the new one needs to go into my backpack.<br />Politically speaking, the authors call for greater taxes on liquor; they insist on alcohol being labeled a drug; and they allow that psychotherapy can be (providing that the counselors are educated about the true nature of alcoholism) useful in helping alcoholics recover.  They do not directly call for an end to liquor advertising but given the tone of their words, I have little doubt that they would like to see that come about, and I think it might some day.  The liquor industry, driven by its need to increase consumption, is increasingly aiming its ads at young people, children even, with its frogs and lizards and other cute spokespersons, and so will someday find itself in the same position that tobacco companies find themselves in today.  At least one hopes so.  I should add that the authors are not prohibitionists, recognizing that prohibition does not work.<br />Readers looking for a distinction between hard (distilled) liquor which is typically forty to fifty percent alcohol by volume and beer and wine (six and twelve percent) will not find it here.  The authors insist that booze is booze, and no useful distinction can be made.  I agree that for alcoholics that is exactly the case; and in fact I always worry about a person who can drink Thunderbird with the same appreciation as say a Beaulieu Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon.  The truth is however, that beer and wine, regardless of how they are used by alcoholics and so-called &quot;problem drinkers,&quot; are in a different class than distilled or fortified liquors because beer and wine are naturally appearing products of fermentation while whiskey, rye, vodka, etc., are the result of human engineering and did not exist in the environment until the rise of modern science.  As such they are dangerous not only to alcoholics, but to others as well.  As the authors point out, some ethnic groups are more susceptible (&quot;sensitive&quot;) to alcohol than others.  One of the probable reasons for this is that susceptible peoples have not had a long cultural history of alcohol use, at least not for as long as say the Italians and Greeks, and therefore their inherited chemistry has not had enough time to adjust.<br />As far as insisting on alcohol being labeled a drug goes, I think that to win such a battle would tend to lose the war since then alcohol would be conjoined with heroin, codeine, cocaine, etc., and a useful distinction would be lost.  After all, the percentage of people susceptible to opiate and cocaine addiction is much greater than the ten to fifteen percent that the authors estimate are susceptible to alcohol addiction.  Beyond that, the general public will reject the label, and its advocates will lose influence thereby bolstering the position of the liquor industry.  Personally I don't believe that beer or table wines should to be called drugs.  Wine especially is seen as a food by southern European peoples, and is an important part of a larger cuisine.  I think that a careful look at consumption practices will show that drinking to get drunk or to get high can and should be distinguished from drinking as a complement to a meal.  (Except for alcoholics!)  At any rate, whatever labels are attached, alcohol itself is a food, containing by weight fifty percent more calories than carbohydrates with about seventy-five percent of the caloric value of fat.  These are &quot;empty calories&quot; of course, as found in white flour and white sugar.<br />Anyone who drinks alcohol ought to read this book  If everybody did, literately thousands of lives would be saved, and untold millions of hours of misery avoided.  If you have any doubt about whether you or someone you love is or could be an alcoholic, you owe it to yourself and your loved ones to READ THIS BOOK.  If you are as certain as the morning sun that you are NOT an alcoholic and never could be one, then you should especially READ THIS BOOK.

I love the genre because nobody could make up this stuff.  Truth, at least in human affairs, really is stranger than fiction.  I seldom find \\"mysteries\\" or crime novels as interesting as a true tale, however incompletely expressed, because I usually sense the contrivances in the work of the novelist.  But in the best true crime, there is always a sense of coming face to face with the sordid realities of human nature, regardless of how banal and stupid, and from such an experience there comes the sense of knowing a little more about humanity.<br /><br />Here we have a Florida state trooper who likes to stop the girlies on the freeway and show them his shiny belt buckle and his well tailored uniform.  Problem is he actually hates women and only gets off when he does them violence.  His long-suffering wife finally, finally after many beatings and some really scary weird stuff, tells him to get out.  He can't cope with that because although he hates women, he needs their approval.  I wonder: did mommie love him best or not at all?  He hates himself for desiring women, but he needs their love to feel confident.  So he stalks his wife in the most pathetic and all-consuming way, sneaking into the house late at night and sleeping in the attic, bugging her phone, etc.  Meanwhile he loves to play macho cop on the freeway.  One day he pulls over a blond woman who reminds him of his wife and does a psycho-sexual sickie murder on her, calling her by his wife's name as he rapes and kills her.<br /><br />Rule, whose weakness is a need to wear her support for the law enforcement community on her sleeve, feels a little compromised in this one.  She is at pains to assure us that this psycho cop is one rare law enforcement anomaly, and that she sure hates to write this one since it makes all cops look bad, but she has to.  She has to because she needs to be of service to her readership, and there is indeed a cautionary tale here we all might recognize.  Simply put, never let push come to shove, especially if it's your supposedly loving spouse that's doing the pushing.  Get out immediately because it will only get worse.  Unfortunately, in this case the long-suffering wife only really gets the message to get away from the sickie when she finds out he is CHEATING on her.  I mean, let's react to what's important!  The beatings were bad, of course, and the total control wasn't good, but the final straw was THE OTHER WOMAN!<br /><br />It could be said that if you desire and conceive a psychopath's children, you might, just might, be contributing to the continuance of psychopaths.  The poor kids are always so innocent, and nobody, especially not moi, would suggest that we punish the sons for the sins of the fathers, having committed a few sins myself; but ladies, get a clue: if his macho ways turn you on so, maybe you should share some blame.  I know it's boring, but try a nerd once in a while.  Or at least try a little family planning.  Rule keeps saying (here and in some of her other books)  \\"but she loved him,\\" or \\"she was in love.\\"  But any self-indulgence has its limit.  If we can excuse her because she was in love, maybe we ought to excuse him because he also couldn't help himself.  Personally, I...don't...think...so.<br /><br />Incidentally, according to the point of view of evolutionary psychology, we create the opposite sex through our sexual choices, just as surely as the practices of agriculture have created the cows and the grains that have been sexually chosen for thousands of years.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is not only one of Ann Rule's best, it is also one that lingers in the mind because of the vivid portrait she paints of a violent sexual control freak.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"is Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"	2000-11-10

Unfortunately I was too busy salivating at the prospects of quadruple-figure appreciation when I bought Priceline.com at $104 to read it when it came out last year.  Now reading it makes for a nice penitence as I contemplate the error of my financial ways while filling out forms for a second mortgage on the ranch.<br />Just joking.  Actually this is a readable and entertaining account from Roman times to the modern hedge fund mania.  The usual financial delusions are covered, the tulip mania, the South Sea bubble, the crashes of 1929 and 1987, etc.  Chancellor does especially nice surgical work on the Japanese bubble economy of the eighties.  The operative mechanism is at first GREED, an emotion that blinds investors, just as jealousy blinds the cuckolded or love the lover, into seeing delusion instead of reality, and persuades them to pay high prices for something of little or no value.  Then, when it is seen that the emperor has no clothes, that dot.com megamegabucks has no earnings and isn't likely to have any--ever--the value of the trifle paid so dearly for, begins to fall.  Now the emotion of FEAR takes hold.  This also blinds the investor.  The crash begins, the bubble bursts, and overly-margined plutocrats jump despondently out of the windows of high-storied buildings...<br />Or shoot up brokerage houses with live bullets.  Notice however that when Internet stocks went very far south of the Cape of Good Hope this last year, no bubble burst; rather the sector experienced the slow deflation characteristic of a tire going flat.  This was mainly because the margin requirements at brokerage houses are now fifty percent instead of the ten percent that prevailed during the Roaring Twenties.  Chancellor makes note of this and other differences that make bursting bubbles less painful perhaps, but no more unlikely since the fundamental human emotions underlying the mechanism that produces speculation has not changed.t changed.	2000-11-05
2220947:US	49786731	R30423T2ORUHHS	1565122259	771083932	Educating Esmé: Diary of a Teacher's First Year	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Slight but redeeming	Codell's breezy memoir excites passion because it occasions the on-going debate between those who believe in a button-down style of teaching and those who espouse a more free and easy manner.  Interestingly enough it is Codell, as a white elementary school teacher at a predominately black school in Chicago, who occupies the liberal turf.  The narrative is amateurish and self-serving but warm and winning.  The blurb contains some praise by writer/educator Herbert Kohl and novelist Bel Kaufman (Up the Down Staircase).<br />Much of what plays here is the contrast and the tension that develops between Codell and her black male school principal.  He is either a nitwit or the victim of that special kind of revenge practiced by authors, namely that of character assassination.  Codell's methods are often creative, sometimes too much so, especially when she goes into the bathroom with one of her little charges and gets down right intimate with him to make a point.<br />Professional teachers will be divided here on whether Codell is an effective teacher or not.  Certainly her enthusiasm is welcome.  However, why this book was published and not one of any number of other teacher memoirs is not clear, but I think it had something to do with the fact that Codell had a radio show in Chicago and that gave her the built-in publicity that publishers like before they invest in an iffy project.  Or perhaps somebody knew that it would be controversial, that teachers and public alike would be sharply divided about the character of the outspoken, self-styled Madame Esm&eacute;.  At any rate, if you're thinking of going into teaching little kids you might want to read this to see if you really want to guide OPC's (Other People's Children), a sometimes exhilarating, often frustrating, but ultimately rewarding and entirely laudable profession.	2000-11-05

This is the kind of grammar/usage book that one can sink his fangs into with pure appetite and eat until bloated.  Personally I devoured the whole thing in a setting and a half.  Judge Barbara, like TV's Judge Judy, can come down on the foolish and the guilty with the sort of gusto that makes one want to stand up and clap hands.  For example on page 135 she lectures one of her misguided correspondents: &quot;I have hundreds of years of tradition and literature behind me...  And behind you are...children?&quot; Alternatively, she can dismiss the pretentious or deluded with a smooth satirical word or two, as on page 53 where we find a correspondent unhappy with the meaning of the phrase &quot;French bath.&quot;  &quot;The phrase...always meant to me covering body odor with perfume...[but] the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang reads, &lt;An erotic act consisting of extensive licking of the partner's body.&gt; [Paragraph break] I would like my version to become more accepted.&quot;  Wallraff responds, &quot;I didn't know what to say to that.  Finally I wrote back: [Paragraph break] Bonne chance!&quot;<br />Her Fowler-like humor aside, what's great about Judge Barbara is that while authoritative and incisive and usually right--or at least in agreement with my prejudices--she is sometimes woefully &quot;wrong, Wrong, WRONG!&quot; (to quote one of her letter writers).  For example her idea that informal English, as distinguished from standard English, ought to be labeled &quot;house English&quot; since that is the way we speak around the house, is curiously amiss.  (Better yet how about &quot;house arrest&quot; for the good Judge for such an uncouth &quot;improvement&quot;?)  Or the fact that she doesn't &quot;get&quot; in her discussion of &quot;I could care less&quot; on pages 61-62 that the seemingly illogical phrase is in fact IRONIC.  (Sorry for the loud caps, but Amazon.com's editor isn't capable of italics, which is a shame, particularly in the present instance.)<br />All of this keeps us interested.  Wallraff is neither a pedant nor a permissive.  She wants to &quot;do what we can to ensure that...[the language] changes as slowly as possible&quot; (p. 10).  And she wants to do it with humor, as on page 102 where she notes that the sentence, &quot;Time flies when you're having fun,&quot; could be a command!  Wonderfully she does not explain this; but for those in a hurry here's a hint: use a stop watch.  However she is NOT like the French word police who, due to their irrational fear of creeping &quot;franglais,&quot; will go to great lengths to protect their language from neologisms and foreign intrusions.  Wallraff, for example, does something her mentors, Fowler, Strunk and White,  Bernstein, et al., never could do.  She consults the Internet for instances of usage!  On page 72 she reports about browsing Web sites to see how people are formulating the term, &quot;Health Care,&quot; with or without a hyphen, one word or two?<br />Now a confession: I'm a semi-careful writer, more interested in being incisive than in being pristinely correct.

I used to confuse &quot;which&quot; and &quot;that&quot; but have recently seen the grammatical light (pp. 112-117).  My pet peeves include pretentious and PC jargon such as the overuse of &quot;paradigm&quot; when &quot;construct,&quot; &quot;body of knowledge&quot; or simply &quot;idea&quot; is meant; or the &quot;woman as victim&quot; use of &quot;empowering&quot; as, after a feminist fringe group meeting in which men are trashed about, it is heard, &quot;That was so empowering!&quot;<br />To my ears, however, the singular, most annoying usage faux pas is the ungrammatical &quot;between you and I.&quot;  I would like to observe as an addendum to a reader's discussion on pages 133-134 that &quot;between you and I&quot; is often misused NOT by educated people but by people who unconsciously feel that &quot;I&quot; is somehow grander than &quot;me,&quot; especially when THEY are speaking.

In this carefully and exhaustively argued and generally convincing critique of the post modern movement she employs a STARTLING TECHNIQUE to embarrass the feminist fringe: SHE QUOTES THEM.  Wow.  She begins in the Preface with the now infamous claim by Gloria Steinem (from her Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem) and Naomi Wolf (The Beauty Myth) that in the United States &quot;about 150,000 females die of anorexia each year.&quot;  Hmm.  Sounds scary.  But it turns out that the number is less than one hundred.<br />This sort of distortion and falsification and just plain stupidity is typical of the totalitarian-minded feminist fringe (see Warren Farrell's The Myth of Male Power: Why Men Are the Disposable Sex (1993) for more documentation).  Where this is particularly egregious and harmful is in academia where gender feminists hold sway over not only their cowed and impressionable students but over a bullied and complacent faculty and administration.  Sommers devotes a substantial portion of this book to detailing just how gender feminists have employed Stalinist techniques in order to twist the curriculum their way, to rewrite and distort history, and to secure greater employment for those of a similar stripe.  Very revealing and sadly amusing is her report from some of the feminist conferences she has attended.  The way they shout out against the truth and shout down anyone who expresses a contrary view really is something out of a storm trooper rally.  Shame on a lot of people who should know better.<br />But feminism hasn't really been stolen.  The substantial gains toward a complete social, economic and political equality are very real and very much with us.  For this we can thank the real feminists, whom Sommers calls &quot;equity feminists&quot; for their courage, strength, hard work and level-headed intelligence.  For the fringe elements, the privileged and pampered janie-come-latelies like Susan Faludi, Andrea Dworkin and the particularly obscene Catharine MacKinnon, all I can say is they couldn't even caddy for women like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and later, Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer, women who really cared about women's rights and were effective in helping to secure them. What the fringe feminists have succeeded in doing with their pathological hatred of men is embarrass themselves and give comfort to the misogynists among us.  Sad indeed.  That whirring sound you hear is the women of the nineteenth century suffragette movement rolling over in their graves; and the sorrowful laments in the background are the cries of the really disadvantaged and victimized women world-wide in places like India and Iraq, Bangladesh and the former Soviet Union who would dearly love to deal with the discriminations American fringe feminists are whining about (even the real ones).  I wonder if the likes of Faludi, Dworkin and MacKinnon would be willing to work for women's rights and against patriarchy in, say, Afghanistan or Iran...<br />Sommers herself is a sharp-eyed feminist of the old school, a woman who knows that distortions and brown-shirt tactics cannot do women or humans any good.  Her book is an attempt to set the ship aright, a loud and somewhat stringent call for better leadership and a more diversified (and sophisticated, I might add) crew of people willing to work hard and effectively for gender equality.  The spoiled little rich girl bully feminism exemplified by those targeted in this book doesn't speak for the vast majority of women struggling to find themselves as human beings, and to free themselves from the shackles and the delusions of sexism.trength, hard work and level-headed intelligence.

She attributes this drive to her ancestors who spent much of their time searching the forests and savannas for food.  From this personal observation, keenly felt, Allport branches out to thoughts about food and eating, from the habits of the deer and squirrels near her home to the proclivities of the chimpanzees of Africa.  Primary among her concerns is how these behaviors relate to human food consumption, and how the search for food and what we eat has shaped our social structure and psychology.<br />This is a very interesting read, graceful written and full of intriguing bits of information.  Did you know, for example, that virtually all common spices, oregano, thyme, cinnamon, rosemary, etc. have &quot;powerful antibacterial and antifungal effects&quot; (p. 118)?  Or that there is a beeswax-eating bird used by the Hadza people of Tanzania that leads them to bee hives?  The bird loves beeswax but is unable to open a hive, but is rewarded when people do.  This &quot;honey guide&quot; is thought to be human kind's &quot;oldest surviving partner in predation, much older than the dog or the falcon&quot; (p. 148).  Or that corn treated with an alkali (tortillas are made with lime) frees the otherwise unavailable essential amino acid tryptophan from the corn so that those who depend heavily upon corn in their diet will not develop pellagra, an often-fatal dietary disease?  This is just one example of an eating technique developed through trial and error and happenstance that allows a people to live on an otherwise incomplete diet--a &quot;cuisine&quot; altered only at considerable risk.<br />Allport also goes from observation to speculate on such things as the origins of tool use, the sexual differentiation of hunting and gathering, and the use of food for social and sexual advantage.  Generally she follows the well-documented and successful path of evolutionary biology and psychology, noting along the way where earlier ideas have proven wrong or incomplete (Raymond Dart's mistaken belief that Australopithecus was largely a meat-eater (p. 157) is a case in point.)  She is insightful and presents her arguments well so that we tend to agree with what she says.  Her idea that tool use began with females and then later spread to males, as presented in Chapter Twelve &quot;The Nature of Food,&quot; is persuasive.  Particularly interesting to me is the material on the nature of omnivores and how food choices dictate physiology and vice versa.  For example, primates with their big brains that require large amounts of energy rich foods cannot subsist on leaves and other foods requiring long intestinal tracts and a slow-motion life style.  Or, reverse that and observe that creatures that have the ability to find and consume energy rich foods can grow big, energy-demanding brains, while those who eat leaves and other foods that require a lot of digestion can't afford to grow a big brain.<br />Also interesting is the chapter on food and cooking aptly entitled, &quot;The Only Cooks on the Planet.&quot;  Cooking and other processing techniques such as leeching and preserving freed up many foods for our consumption not available to other creatures.  In this connection, Allport makes the astute observation that the technique of cultivation, that of agriculturally engineering energy-rich and less toxic foods, made these plants edible to other animals creating a new ecology of vermin (p. 124).  On the other hand the technique of cooking makes foods available only to humans.<br />One of the more startling observations made by Allport, who really has a keen eye for connections, is this on page 60.  She is discussing the differentiation of sex cells, the female stationary and energy-rich, the male mobile and without nutritive value.  She quotes biologist Robert Trivers as saying, &quot;An undifferentiated system of sex cells seems highly unstable.&quot;  She concludes, &quot;So as soon as selection favored those that invested their sex cells with nutritious substances, it also favored those that cheated the system and became adept at numbers and mobility instead.  As soon as selection favored eggs, it also favored sperm.  And there you have it: the origin of the sexes.&quot;<br />This is startling because biologists are still in a quandary about how sex began.  The main and latest idea has been that sexuality developed as a result of the arms race between the organism and its microbial predators (see Margulis, Lynn and Dorion Sagan.  Mystery Dance: On the Evolution of Human Sexuality (1991) or Matt Ridley's The Red Queen (1993) for examples of this argument).  Here however Allport suggests that one of those predators may have been another cell bent not on consumption, per se, but on reproduction!  And so they formed a symbiosis...<br />I am pleased to note that although Allport doesn't mince words when it comes to pointing out male maleficence--apt and hard-hitting is her discussion of how in many cultures males manufacture food taboos that limit the foods females can eat, saving the biggest and best portions for themselves--she plays fair throughout, and at no time gets bogged down in the sexism that preoccupies some writers.  On page 190, for example, she states quite directly that females shape male behavior by their reproductive choices, thereby implying that females are also responsible for the male violence that we post-moderns so wisely abhor.<br />Allport appropriately ends the book with a plea that we not turn the planet into &quot;a giant McDonald's dispensing Happy Meals&quot; to &quot;Homo Sapiens alone,&quot; and that we not overuse the world's resources.  Amen to that, and kudos to Susan Allport for writing such an interesting and wisdom-filled book.ot;So as soon as selection favored those that invested their sex cells with nutritious substances, it also favored those that cheated the system and became adept at numbers and mobility instead.

Jealousy exists, like love and sex, to help propagate an individual's genes.  It is a mechanism of the species to help insure for males paternity, and for females that their offspring receive the benefit of male protection, support and guidance.  Jealousy is not &quot;necessary&quot; (as the subtitle disinformationally suggests) in the same sense that sex per se is necessary; nor is it an emotion, like love, that we might want to retain, had we our druthers.  Jealousy is the emotional downside of the sexual/reproductive strategies employed by humans.  It is &quot;necessary&quot; in the same sense (although not to the same degree) that pain is necessary.  Furthermore, in the environment we now find ourselves, as opposed to the prehistoric savannahs in which the mechanism of jealousy proved adaptive, it is unnecessary, and something we might want to understand and come to grips with in an attempt to lessen its hold on us.<br />But what this book is really about is infidelity, how and why it occurs, and what can be done to forestall it.  In this context, jealousy (not envy which is directed at somebody who has something we want) is seen as an adaptive mechanism to protect the individual against a straying partner, either through heightened awareness or through inducing threats of reprisal, or through actual punishment of the infidel.  Buss, a psychologist and author of the college text, Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind, uses case histories from our culture and others and the results of personality inventories laced with humor to illustrate how the experience of jealousy leads to &quot;mate guarding&quot; and &quot;mate retention tactics&quot; that help the individual secure his or her position in the &quot;mating market.&quot;  As such jealousy is seen as a &quot;signal&quot; to both one's self (awakening one to the imminent danger of infidelity) and to one's partner (as a warning that one is on to the other's tricks).  Consequently, Buss defines jealousy (p. 196) as &quot;an adaptive signal of an impending threat to a primary love relationship.&quot;  Included in this view is the understanding that infidelity, painful as it is, is a normal human behavior practiced by &quot;as many as half of all married individuals.&quot;<br />The style here is easy and accessible to a wide range of readers.  The material is light-hearted (inasmuch as such a serious subject can be) but without any pasting-over of the dangers of jealousy.  Underpinning the exposition is a thorough knowledge of human sexuality as derived from biology and evolutionary psychology.  Buss not only knows what he is talking about, but imparts the information in a manner that, chapter by chapter, leads the reader to a deep and satisfying understanding of infidelity and the mechanism of jealousy.<br />Along the way we learn some unsettling facts.  For example, marital happiness has no effect on the instance of male infidelity.  &quot;In fact, 56 percent of the men who were having affairs judged their marriage to be very happy&quot; (p. 146).  Or that women pursue a sexual strategy including a &quot;desire to stray&quot; that &quot;exists today solely because that's what benefitted ancestral women&quot; (p. 159).  We also learn which type of personality is likely to stray (pp. 148-151) and that the more attractive partners (&quot;those...higher in mate value&quot;) are more likely to cheat (p. 143).  Also interesting is the semi-obvious observation that women can attract a higher-ranked male on a one-night stand than as a husband (and so might), and that men will stoop to lower-ranked females for pure sex than those they choose for wives.<br />Buss devotes the last two chapters to coping mechanisms.  He concludes with the fine observation that &quot;knowledge...of our dangerous passions...will, in some small measure, give us the emotional wisdom to deal with them.&quot;  This observation is what evolutionary psychology is all about, and why it is the emergent psychology of the twenty-first century.<br />Best joke (p. 185): At a therapist's gathering with a straying husband, his wife and the other woman, the wife informs the affairee that she is still sleeping with her husband, and that he has lied to both of them.  &quot;The affairee felt betrayed and stalked out, saying...that all men betray their wives, but only a real asshole would betray his girlfriend.&quot;  Buss adds, &quot;Therapy was unsuccessful in this case.&quot;ergent psychology of the twenty-first century.<br />Best joke (p. 185): At a therapist's gathering with a straying husband, his wife and the other woman, the wife informs the affairee that she is still sleeping with her husband, and that he has lied to both of them.  &quot;The affairee felt betrayed and stalked out, saying...that all men betray their wives, but only a real asshole would betray his girlfriend.&quot;  Buss adds, &quot;Therapy was unsuccessful in this case.&quot;	2000-10-23

He begins with the fact that our culture programs men to die to protect the interests of women (literally in wars and in high-risk jobs, and in dying younger than women) and ends with the fact that the rules of sexual politics allow women to pursue their interests unimpeded while men risk ending up in jail for sexual harassment or rape for pursuing theirs.  He shows that a double standard of expectation exists throughout the society, a double standard that consistently protects women and puts men in harm's way.  He demonstrates that this situation exists because women have cleverly hoodwinked men into doing their bidding while all the while crying that they are the ones being discriminated against.<br /><br />Quite frankly, in reading this, one is led to believe that men are \\"the disposable sex\\" because women really are superior.<br /><br />But wait.  There is hope. What men really need to do is discard the macho notion they makes them put women on pedestals as innocent creatures who desperately need  protection.  Talk about being sold a bill of goods!  Men need to realize that in the modern social and political environment they have no advantage over women.  On the contrary.  Their superior size and aggressiveness amounts to less than nothing.  Because women are socially and politically more sophisticated than men, men are actually at a disadvantage and need to put more energy into protecting their right to life, liberty, health, love and happiness than women do.  Men haven't, and that's why we have a smaller portion of the real goodies of life, goodies we have exchanged for a macho scroll or the tin badge of being The Protector and the One Who Takes the Risks.  We need to realize that in order to survive in a post-war world, we need to work a lot harder than we have been working.  We need to understand that male superiority really is an illusion, a kind of sly of hand women have put over on men to keep us subjugated.  What this book is saying is that women have the real power and men are just self-deluded figureheads.<br /><br />Thus spake Warren Farrell.  Well, his book is a fine example to the contrary, proving (I hope) that men are not about to take all this lying down.  Lot's daughters got us drunk and raped us?  I don't think so.<br /><br />I've always assumed that the sexes are equal. The real truth, though, is that the sexes may not be equal at all.  It really depends on the environment.  If women really are superior to men in terms of social and political skills, skills that are now, with the imminent death of the war system, very much in the ascendency, then men are in trouble.  We need to use our brains instead of our brawn.  In particular we need to realize that women are masters of manipulation because during the long millennia of the tribal wars, when physical strength held sway, they had to be to get their way.  The savannah is long gone, and in the glass and concrete jungle that is our home, subtle manipulation counts for a lot more than physical force.<br /><br />I missed this book when it came out in 1993.  From the title, The Myth of Male Power, I thought it was another feminist put down of men, and I didn't feel like reading another one.

This is a classic of informative literature, partly a fine bit of muckraking journalism, partly a public service report on the scientific findings, and partly a &quot;how to&quot; program to address the epidemic.  Although written almost twenty years ago, this little paperback still packs a punch against an enemy that is still all too much with us.  Milan and Ketcham employ a straight-forward, fact-filled, uncluttered prose style to make it clear to any but the brain dead that alcoholism is a physiological disease and NOT a psychological problem based on a character flaw and/or lack of will power.  Read this and you will no longer put down the alcoholic as some kind of moral degenerate, but will recognize that if your body chemistry were a little altered, you do might well be a victim.<br />I can say this because both my mother and father were alcoholics, and I know the only thing that kept me from joining them was the fact that I couldn't stand the headaches and nausea that came with &quot;overindulgence.&quot;  I apparently inherited the physiologic trait common to, e.g., Italian, Jewish and Asian peoples (there's a chart on p. 45 showing susceptibility by ethnicity) protecting me from alcoholism.  It wasn't due to any superior morality or advanced character development on my part that I avoided the horror of alcoholism.  It's more like having black skin that protects against skin cancer.  Is black skin morally superior to white skin?  Or, are sickle blood cells evidence of an elevated will to resist malaria?  I don't think so.  Thanks to this book I can see that I was lucky: I am not an alcoholic because my internal chemistry is not disrupted by alcohol as it is with alcoholics.  That's it.  Pure and simple.<br />Unfortunately many people, including--as this book points out--doctors, psychiatrists, members of the clergy, government officials and others in a position to help or hinder, still think of alcoholism in moralist and psychological terms.  As Milan and Ketcham make clear this ignorant and prejudiced attitude not only doesn't help the alcoholic and his long-suffering family, it hinders treatment.  The authors are vehement on this point.  On page 195, for example, they write (citing Joseph Pursch): &quot;...physician ignorance about alcoholism and prejudice toward alcoholics are the major obstacles to effective treatment.&quot;  Strong words indeed, but not surprising.  Most doctors were too busy in medical school to get an education, and too busy with patients (and I must say, climbing up the hill of worldly success) afterwards to catch up.  This includes psychiatrists.  As the authors point out these &quot;professionals&quot; routinely prescribed tranquilizers and other drugs pharmacologically similar to alcohol to alcoholics, drugs to which alcoholics have a cross-tolerance, a situation that not only led to a double addiction, but was, in some cases, life-threatening.<br />Professionals who offer counseling and psychotherapy to alcoholics are also taken to task by the authors: &quot;Psychotherapy diverts attention from the physical causes of the disease, compounds the alcoholic's guilt and shame, and aggravates rather than alleviates his problems&quot; (p. 14).  &quot;A[lcoholics] A[nonymous] members are all too aware of the condescension and judgmental attitudes about alcoholism which pervade the conventional health agencies.  They have been drugged with tranquilizers and sedatives, have spent expensive and fruitless years in psychotherapy, and have endured indifferent and even hostile professional attitudes toward them and their disease&quot; (p. 132).<br />So-called moral leaders of public opinion are also rightly chastised for their ignorance and lofty (and phony) moral tone.  Ex-California Congressman Robert K. Dornan, who is quoted as seeing alcoholism as &quot;an absence of self-discipline,&quot; and columnist Jack Anderson, who sees alcoholism as &quot;a personal problem&quot; are examples cited on page 7, although if the authors had wanted to, they could have filled volumes with such inanities.  Government agencies are also in the thick of the stupidity.  Particularly interesting (and telling) is this bit of sly of hand reported on pages 187-188: In the government-funded Rand Report of 1976 the term &quot;recovery&quot; was replaced with the broader term &quot;remission&quot; so that it would appear that some alcoholics were in &quot;remission&quot; although they were still swilling down something less than three ounces of pure alcohol per day.  (Three ounces of alcohol is about what you'd get in 21 ounces of table wine or more than four cans of beer!)  This allowed &quot;treatment centers which embraced this definition of remission to claim up to 80 percent success rates--even though most of the alcoholics so labeled were still drinking.&quot;<br />Even Alcoholics Anonymous which the authors acknowledge several times as the best recovery program in existence, could use some updating based on the reality of the disease nature of alcoholism.  Step four, for example, of the12-step program (&quot;Made a searching and fearless moral inventory&quot;) could be modified to refer to the alcoholic's conduct AFTER detoxification and the recovery process.  That way a clear distinction is made between behavior caused by alcoholism and behavior over which the alcoholic now has control.<br />One question: Now that the new millennium is upon us, have things gotten any better?  Have the medical and counseling professions gotten the word on the true nature of alcoholism, and is the disease being treated as a disease?

Particularly interesting (and telling) is this bit of sly of hand reported on pages 187-188: In the government-funded Rand Report of 1976 the term &quot;recovery&quot; was replaced with the broader term &quot;remission&quot; so that it would appear that some alcoholics were in &quot;remission&quot; although they were still swilling down something less than three ounces of pure alcohol per day.  (Three ounces of alcohol is about what you'd get in 21 ounces of table wine or more than four cans of beer!)  This allowed &quot;treatment centers which embraced this definition of remission to claim up to 80 percent success rates--even though most of the alcoholics so labeled were still drinking.&quot;<br />Even Alcoholics Anonymous which the authors acknowledge several times as the best recovery program in existence, could use some updating based on the reality of the disease nature of alcoholism.  Step four, for example, of the12-step program (&quot;Made a searching and fearless moral inventory&quot;) could be modified to refer to the alcoholic's conduct AFTER detoxification and the recovery process.  That way a clear distinction is made between behavior caused by alcoholism and behavior over which the alcoholic now has control.<br />One question: Now that the new millennium is upon us, have things gotten any better?  Have the medical and counseling professions gotten the word on the true nature of alcoholism, and is the disease being treated as a disease?  Not being in the field, I don't know; but I suspect that Katherine Ketcham's new book (which I am going to read next) Beyond the Influence: Understanding and Defeating Alcoholism (2000) will provide the answer.	2000-10-04

(As Casey Stengel said, &quot;You could look it up&quot;:  Putman's eventually published the book when I was still in my twenties with the title &quot;A Perfectly Natural Act.&quot;)  My anti-hero certainly thought he was invisible.  Whether he really was or not is an open question.  J.J. Luna's nonfiction hero (himself, and the reader if you follow his advice) is invisible in the sense that he has greatly obscured the connection between his physical self and the world's record-keeping devices.  Although such &quot;invisibility&quot; has nothing like the power of the fantasy with which I used to guide myself to sleep at night (instead of counting sheep I would imagine myself invisible), it can be of tremendous practical value in this age of Big Brother.<br />Why would anyone legitimately want to hide themselves? you ask.  Luna, a one-time fuzzy presence in Franco's Spain, gives some excellent reasons: somebody (not just Uncle Sam) might take it upon themselves to go after your assets.  An ex-lover or ex-spouse might want revenge.  You might get sued (a &quot;legal mugging&quot;) or you might just want to avoid the usual harassment from telemarketers and other pests.  Or you might just have some questionable assets that you want to keep hidden.  Luna makes the point (tongue in cheek, I would say) that he does not advise breaking the law, and that this book is not intended to help law-breakers.  (However if they choose to take advantage of his advice...well, his book is only a tool.)<br />Luna himself has made a living selling and consulting on &quot;privacy.&quot;  Reading between the lines, I would say specifically that he made a lot of money forming what generically might be called &quot;dummy corporations&quot; and selling them.  I admire (I think) such creative self-employment.<br />Luna describes four &quot;levels&quot; of privacy, each with a bigger price tag.  At Level One you'll have &quot;more privacy than 98 percent of the general population.&quot;  At Level Four &quot;you are duplicating the federal Witness Security Program.&quot;  Incidentally, if you're planning on hiding yourself from the world in preparation for the commission of some sort of &quot;revenge&quot; crime yourself, you might want to notice Luna's caveat on page 6, a sort of gumshoe dictum: &quot;if someone with unlimited funds is after you, you will eventually be found.&quot;<br />His first and most important rule is (p. 244 and elsewhere) &quot;Do not...ever...allow your real name to be coupled with your home address.&quot;  To accomplish this Luna shows you how to set up a &quot;ghost address,&quot; preferably in another state.  He also advises you to never give out your social security number, and relates how you can usually accomplish that.  He says you should use your passport rather than your driver's license when you absolutely must identify yourself because it contains less information (no home address, no SSN).  Do not use your real name for any of your utilities.  Have your cell phone in a different name than your home phone. Cell phones are useful in that they have no set location.  For example if you have to call 911, your true address doesn't show.  Naturally you don't use the checks from your bank.  Your checks will have no name on them and no address.  In fact your signature should illegible.  (Luna claims on page 80 that &quot;among European businessmen, illegible is the order of the day.&quot;) And of course (p. 84) you &quot;Get off voter rolls and never return.&quot;<br />This is an interest read with a lot of good (if sometimes expensive) techniques for improving your privacy.  Also, there are sprinkled throughout the texts little tidbits of worthwhile advice.  For example here's how to defeat the redial feature on your telephone: When you finish the call, hang up andthen pick up the receiver and punch in a single digit.  Then hang up.  &quot;If anyone checks the &amp;#8219;last number called' all they will find is that single digit&quot; (p. 114).  Luna sent money orders to sites on the Web offering fake ID (p. 85).  &quot;Sometimes I received a grossly inferior product.  Other times I received nothing at all.&quot;  He quotes a newsletter to the effect that there are no fake ID sites on the Web offering &quot;anything even vaguely worth buying.&quot;  That info alone (for some) might be worth the price of this book and more.<br />I would like to make the ironic observation that what Luna reveals about himself in terms of his vocation, habits, likes and dislikes, prejudices, past travels and general world view makes it now impossible for him to stay hidden (should anybody be interested in finding him).  However, the man is at least in his seventies, so I suppose it really doesn't matter that much anymore.  On second thought, realizing that this Luna is a very tricky dude, it may be that the seemingly veracious personal info in the text is just misleading!<br />On third thought, it could just be that Luna's long life of anonymity has inspired him to seek out a little fame before he disappears completely.

Having watched my mother and my wife die of cancer, and knowing that I too will likely go by the same route, the subject is part of me.  And being a writer who always longed to write his masterpiece, I feel such an identification with John Diamond who here does indeed write his masterpiece, an unlikely tale from the heart, mind and soul without a trance of cant or any phoniness.  I hope he knows how good this book is.  It is-believe it or not-a comedic master work, the funniest book I have read in quite a while.  He uses humor tempered with rationalism instead of pathos to confront the horror of being torn apart by cancer (and its treatment).  I can see Shakespeare reading this and sitting up straight with the realization that not only can this man make those words dance, he can engage our heart.<br />John Diamond is a print and broadcast journalist, a well-known Londoner whom I had never heard of before I picked up this book.  Obviously he is a very funny and keenly insightful man who sees things that others miss, a magical wordsmith who did his best work when others might rightly have restricted themselves to wallowing in self pity.  He contracts cancer of the tongue and throat at probably the most joyous time in his life with a successful career in full swing and a brilliant second marriage not ten years old.  He has two little children under four years of age and he himself is still in his early forties.  And then he learns that he has cancer.  Within a few months time he loses his ability to eat and to speak and to even breath properly.<br />One of the terrible ironies of this book is the fact that Diamond wrote newspaper columns on the fraudulence of the alternative medicine industry, and put his faith entirely in the hands of the medical establishment.  There is something of the spirit of English rationalism and the belief in science that allowed him nonetheless to see his treatment as something positive.  Because he was relatively young and had a keen desire to stay alive he was motivated to take the treatment.  As he says, he really had no choice.  He had a responsibility to his wife and his children and his parents to do whatever was necessary to stay alive.  And so he went under the surgeon's knife, he subjected himself to radiation and eventually to chemotherapy, all the while getting worse and worse.  As he himself writes on page 91: &quot;No wonder the alternative quacks get away with their fairy dust treatments: you die just as quickly as with the real thing but you feel better about it.&quot;  He had &quot;the real thing.&quot;<br />Nonetheless he can laugh and make us laugh with him.  The scene where he tears out the tubes and IVs sticking in him in an attempt to escape the hospital is hilarious.  On page 122 he's describing all the gadgets and tubes, etc. he's hooked up to: &quot;There was also a tube connected to a catheter shoved up my urethra and carrying away my urine.  (Here's a tip for the gents in the audience.  If anyone ever asks if he can poke a catheter up your urethra and leave it there for a few days, tell him no.  They will say it doesn't hurt and express surprise when, on pulling it out a few days later, they have to scrape you off the ceiling.  Avoid.)&quot;<br />Any man that can see the humor in such horrific circumstances, is a man worth listening to, and a man we can respect and admire.

Touchingly and beautifully rendered if you can stand it, the poor guy just lying there unable to even scratch an itch...<br />And yet, and yet, he wrote this book.  Of course it is heroic, and of course he does not invite pity or tell his tale to seem heroic.  Rather Bauby just wants us to know what it's like being in his position.  Since this is who he has become, this is his job, to inform us.  He's still working.  He's still got something to give to this world.<br />What we can gain from this is a realization that there are all sorts of levels of existence, and who are we to complain?<br />Beautifully translated from the French by Jeremy Leggatt.	2000-09-20
2279285:US	49786731	R1GJOBJ7QTID7B	0226476553	993479157	Complexity: Life at the Edge of Chaos	Books	5	45	51	N	N	A fine introduction and an interesting read	The science of complexity, a discipline unique to the computer age, was  born of chaos and a growing sense that there is something amenable to  scientific inquiry about complex systems that we are missing.  Before we  had the number crunching power of computers, complexity could not be  explored because the many variables resulted in astronomical  calculations.<br /><br />In this revision of his book originally published in 1992,  Roger Lewin explains what the science of complexity is all about through  interviews with some of its most important practitioners (and critics)  organized around some of the central ideas. As such this is both a fine  introduction to the subject and an interesting read.  Lewin includes 16  pages of photos of the scientists he interviewed captioned with a  significant quote from each.  He has added an afterword on the application  of complexity science to business, and an appendix about John Holland, whom  he dubs, \\"Mr. Emergence.\\"<br /><br />\\"Everything works toward an  ecology\\" is an old dictum of mine.  I have the sense that I came up  with that myself, but I probably read it somewhere years ago.  At any rate,  what is being said here is that complex systems work toward a state of  equilibrium near a transition phase, near \\"the edge of chaos.\\"  This equilibrium can be an ecology (Darwin's \\"tangled web\\");  indeed it can be the entire planet, as in the concept of Gaia in which  \\"the Earth's biological and physical systems are tightly coupled in a  giant homeostatic system\\" (quoting Stuart Kauffman on page 109).<br /><br />A  central idea is that \\"...large, interactive systems-dynamical  systems-naturally evolve toward a critical state\\" (physicist Per Bak,  quoted on page 61).  These systems include weather, financial markets,  piles of sand, and most significantly, ecologies, so that evolution itself  is seen as shaped by the dynamics of complexity.  Complexity is the  \\"interesting\\" middle ground between order and the purely random,  between the crystalized structure of ice and the Brownian motion of  molecules.  I had a curious sense of understanding when I compared these  three states with positions at chess.  First there is the even, static  position, perhaps with bishops of opposite color in which no progress can  be made, a drawn the inevitable result.  Second there is the wildly chaotic  position so complex that no one can completely calculate it, say the board  after black takes white's queen knight pawn in the \\"poisoned  pawn\\" variation of the Najdorf Sicilian.  In between are the  \\"interesting\\" positions in which one side might have a small  advantage or there might be a dynamic balance of advantages, space versus  material, for example, in which a startling combination might be  hidden.<br /><br />These states-\\"at the edge of chaos\\"-are seen here as  analogous to the phrase transition states of matter, from liquid to gas,  for example.  The idea is that there is a naturally occurring property of  the physical world that forces complex systems into stable, readiness  states near the edge of transition.  What is exciting is that these states,  because they are so \\"ripe\\" for change can be influenced or  manipulated into change with small resources.  Out of complexity comes  something that could not be predicted by an analysis of its individual  components, an emergent property of the system.  I would note that such a  natural phenomenon would be attractive to those who believe in punctuated  evolution (e.g., Steven Jay Gould) and to those who believe that social and  political change typically comes suddenly and with great force.<br /><br />Central  to what complexity science is saying is that reductionism-which is the  technique that has driven science to its present position of power and  influence-is limited.  \\"...[Y]ou have to look at the interactions as  well as the parts,\\" John Holland is quoted as saying on page 220.  In  other words, you have to take a holistic approach.  However, theuse of the  word \\"holistic,\\" a New Age shibboleth, is the just sort of thing  that makes traditional scientists wince.<br /><br />Consequently, complexity science  is not without its critics who argue that the fundamental mechanism of  complexity exists only in a mystical sense and is therefore anathema to  mainstream science.  Even its practitioners, such as University of Michigan  \\"complexologist\\" John Holland, admit they are still searching for  the fundamental mechanism of this new science.  He is quoted on page 214 as  saying, \\"Our present understanding is not much better than the child  saying that Jack Frost explains the wondrous colors of  autumn.\\"<br /><br />However most complexity scientists would say that the  mechanism isn't mystical at all.  It's just not understood yet.  I would  add that much of what we think we know about the world is based on  relationships and phenomenon that we assume we understand, but really we  don't.  For example physicists say that gravity curves spacetime, but they  don't say how it curves spacetime.  Presumably gravitons do the trick, but  they haven't been discovered yet!  So it could be said that gravity is  mystical.  I like to compare this lack of understanding to the task of  watching grass grow.  (This also works for evolution.)  Every day I look  but at no time do I ever see the grass growing, yet after a while I know it  has grown.  It seems that it always grows when I'm not looking!  By the  same token we see the results of complexity, but we do not yet see the  inner workings of the process.  We may never see the process, but through  complexity science we may yet understand it.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Hard Science and the Unknowable\\"use of the  word \\"holistic,\\" a New Age shibboleth, is the just sort of thing  that makes traditional scientists wince.<br /><br />Consequently, complexity science  is not without its critics who argue that the fundamental mechanism of  complexity exists only in a mystical sense and is therefore anathema to  mainstream science.

Perhaps in the future every human emotion will have its expert, just as  entomologists specialize in beetles or ants or  wasps or flies, etc.<br />At  any rate, Ciaramicoli's &quot;practical guide&quot; for self-improvement is  distinguished from other similar programs by the author's intense focus,  his caring concern, and especially his use of &quot;empathy&quot; as the  guiding principle.  Ciaramicoli broadens the usual definition of empathy  past the point of normal recognition.  &quot;All living things are wired  for empathy&quot; he asserts (p. 35), and he specifically includes  &quot;slime molds&quot; and in fact gives a rather intriguing explanation  of why he thinks slime molds have empathy on pages 24-25.  In reading this  sincere and caring book, I found it necessary to just accept his  terminology and not quibble about definitions or the fact that slime molds  are not &quot;wired&quot; even metaphorically, because essentially  Professor Ciaramicoli is correct in asserting the tremendous power of  empathy to help us understand ourselves and others.  I wonder, though, how  much would have been lost had the word &quot;empathy&quot; been replaced  with the word &quot;love.&quot;<br />Ciaramicoli, who is a clinical  psychologist and a member of the Harvard Medical School, gives examples  from his personal life and from his practice demonstrating (to his  satisfaction) the power of empathy to change people's lives for the better.  He works hard at making a distinction between, say, sympathy, which  &quot;seeks to console,&quot; and empathy, which &quot;works to  understand&quot; (p. 38).  On page 166 he quotes Gretel Ehrlich to the  effect that empathy is stronger than sympathy because it contains honesty  while sympathy may conceal.  Consequently he sees empathy as a double-edged  sword that in the hands of enemies or in the hands those who make a  practice of exploiting others, can work for malevolent purposes.  Clearly  &quot;empathy&quot; used in this sense can be replaced with a phrase like  &quot;a thorough understanding.&quot;  But whether empathy for, say, Saddam  Hussein or even for O.J. Simpson, would or could change them for the better  is, to my mind, debatable.<br />Ciaramicoli was led to write this book in part  because of the tragedy of his younger brother who died of an apparent  intentional, self-inflicted overdose of heroin.  He expresses a sense of  guilt about his brother's wasted life and writes that he believes, had he  and others been more empathetic, the tragedy could have been averted.  I am  not so sure.  Of course Ciaramicoli should realize that he is not his  brother's keeper, but more importantly he should know that heroin addicts  are not freed from their addiction and their self-destructive behavior  through empathy, and Ciaramicoli should not in any way blame himself.  Of  course if you are a successful older brother, who is everything the younger  brother could not be, it is hard not to feel some sort of guilt, something  akin to &quot;survivor guilt.&quot;  Ciaramicoli would do himself a favor  by studying the literature on heroin addiction and listening to the  experience of other families who have experienced similar addiction  tragedies.  I think such knowledge would help him overcome his profound  sense of guilt.  (A little work with evolutionary psychology on the nature  of dominance among siblings wouldn't hurt either!)<br />Although I don't agree  with some of the psychology expressed here,  I certainly agree with  Ciaramicoli's intent to help others.  He writes about responding to the  tears of children in &quot;comforting, reassuring ways&quot; instead of  with indifference.  No one can disagree with that.  However, if a child is  rewarded whenever it cries, it will tend to cry more, and when the child is  older, if its antisocial behavior is rewarded with &quot;empathy&quot; to  the exclusion of a clear expression that what the young person is doing is  wrong, the young person may be led into continued antisocial and ultimately  self-destructive behavior.  It has been said that &quot;to know all is to  forgive all,&quot; meaning if we knew all the circumstances that led to a  person's behavior we might well conclude, &quot;there, but for the grace of  God, go I.&quot;  That is empathy, for sure.  Nonetheless we, as a society,  must still punish the transgressor, lest others be lead astray.<br />I think  this is a book that may resonate with some people where other books have  not been helpful, just as the author's notion of &quot;empathy&quot; may  work where the usual guiding principle &quot;love&quot; has not.  I really  think it boils down to &quot;The Power of Love and Understanding,&quot; but  I suspect that book has already been written many times over.expression that what the young person is doing is  wrong, the young person may be led into continued antisocial and ultimately  self-destructive behavior.

Written from an evolutionary  point of view, Robin Baker's text is very readable and certain to make many  people uncomfortable.  It has had a remarkable effect on me.  I suddenly  realized how insignificant our consciousness is even in something like  reproduction.  So much goes on beneath our consciousness, and many things  within our consciousness are done for reasons we don't understand or are  mistaken about.  For example, according to Robin Baker, masturbation serves  a reproductive purpose!  I won't try to explain here, but he convinced me.  Also group sex may actually help a husband to get his wife to bear his  child!  Read it.  I kid you not.<br /><br />Women come off pretty much as  unconscious instruments of the process, men to a slightly lesser degree.  All this is as I have always thought, but I had no idea about the details,  and I mistakenly thought people, as conscious beings, had a greater effect  on reproduction than we actually do.  Incidentally at least ten percent of  our children are not fathered by the husband, and close to twenty percent  of conceptions are from sperm other than that of the husband (revelations  not unique to this book).  \\"Nowhere is there a woman true and  fair,\\" spake the poet.  The duplicity of sex is required according to  Baker because the woman needs to simultaneously mate with the champion  (which is what she is always trying to do) while at the same time keep a  man around to help take care of the offspring.  Implicit in the book is the  idea that people naturally cheat on their spouses as a strategy, a strategy  that has consequences, both positive and negative.  Sexually speaking, as  in everything else, we are instruments of the process more than we  think.<br /><br />This is an excellent, if somewhat creepy, book with the tales of  sex and infidelity and scheming by both sexes ringing entirely true.  But  strange to say I feel like a Victorian, wanting to have a nice cup of tea  and talk about something else.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"in everything else, we are instruments of the process more than we  think.<br /><br />This is an excellent, if somewhat creepy, book with the tales of  sex and infidelity and scheming by both sexes ringing entirely true.

Why?  Because the public  wanted a villain, somebody to hate, and what they got were some innocent  people wrongly accused.  With that kind of result the public lost interest.  The Jon Benet Ramsey case sold a lot better because the public had clear  targets for its hate, John and Patsy Ramsey.  Here, Ray Buckey was to be  the designated fall guy with his creepy glasses and his nerdish style, but  he wouldn't fall because he was clearly innocent of the sensational charges  against him.  So the public was stuck with no clear villain on whom to  vent.  The real villains, as graphically revealed in this book, were the  press, the prosecutors and the social workers, especially Kee MacFarlane,  who indoctrinated the children into describing perverted events that never  took place.<br />This was written from the trenches on a daily basis when the  overwhelming tide of public opinion was that of a lynch mob desperate to  hang Buckey and his family from the nearest tree.  The Eberles built a  strong case in blaming the media for poisoning the public's understanding  of the case, partially through incompetent reporters, and partially through  a media lust to sensationalize.  Part of what's interesting about this book  is how it presages the O.J. trial, especially in the incompetence seen in  the district attorney's office.  Ira Reiner was D.A. at the time with  Garcetti as a critical underling.  It is scandalous that they would find  the need to use a paid felonious informant to bolster their case against  Buckey.  He was a five-time loser, no less, who previously had falsely  testified  for the prosecution in exchange for favorable treatment.  Also  stupid was the prosecution's use of an incompetent and prejudicial child  abuse &quot;expert,&quot; Dr. Gordon, who said that he possessed &quot;the  largest collection of photographs of children's anuses in the state of  California.&quot; [p. 106]  The authors estimate that 97.5 percent of the  people in L.A. thought Buckey was guilty.  The sad truth is what he was  really guilty of was being a young man who liked to work with preschool  children.  Now THAT ain't natural was what a large number of people  thought.  I hope we're getting over that prejudice because what our  children need are role models and guides from both sexes.<br />The book is  peppered with courtroom asides from an unidentified lawyer.  Here's one of  the most pertinent from page 105, a exchange between a friend of the  Buckeys and the lawyer:<br />&quot;They're putting on witnesses who they know  are lying.  They concealed exonerating evidence.  Don't we have enough  criminal conduct by the prosecutors to put them behind  bars?&quot;<br />&quot;It doesn't work that way,&quot; the lawyer laughed.  &quot;The law is just for the little people.  When we break the rules we go  to jail.  When they break the rules they go to lunch.  And maybe get a  promotion if they do it right.&quot;<br />&quot;But what about the law?&quot;  the woman gasped.  &quot;What about the Constitution?&quot;<br />&quot;I'm  afraid that's just one of those nice, comforting fantasies like the tooth  fairy.  There are only two classes of people.  Those who hold power and  those who do not.  And in any dispute the guys who hold power will decide  which way it's going to go.

Nonetheless some of this is a little depressing since  it is about eating insects and human beings.  If you can get past that,  it's fascinating.<br />&quot;Warfare cannibalism&quot; is a concept  encountered here.  That's what the Aztecs practiced.  Harris explains it  all.  Modern states don't practice cannibalism because the power structure  benefits more from keeping the vanquished alive and producing for the  state.  Before the rise of the state,  the bands and village societies had  not the bureaucracy nor the technology to take advantage of the labor of  prisoners and slaves, so it was more cost effective to eat them.  And they  did.  Before reading Harris I used to think the Conquistadors were horrible  and I despised the Spanish state and all of Christendom; however now that I  know the nature of the savages of America, it's six of one and half a dozen  of the other.  Harris makes it clear that we don't eat horsemeat because  the horse is less effective at turning grass into meat than ruminants and  so horse meat would be more expensive than beef.  He shows how horses were  extremely valuable as instruments of war.  Calvary troops easily defeated  infantry.  He recalls the Asiatic pastorales who became the mongrel hoards  who learned to ride their little horses so effectively that they conquered  vast areas from China to Europe.  They would ride practically from birth,  more on a horse than off.  They kept several horses in a caravan and cut  the artery in the horse's neck on a ten-day or so rotation and drank the  blood.  They rode their horses until they dropped and then ate them, but  only then.<br />The Europeans learned from them to use the horse as an  instrument of war.  The European horses were breed much larger to hold a  man and a hundred pounds of armor, and to pull wagons and plows.  Horses  were only eaten after the horse was too old to work.  It became a clear  status symbol to own horses, and so eating horseflesh became something the  upper classes would never do, but something the lower classes were  sometimes reduced to.<br />Meat hunger and fat hunger have been facts of life  for humans for the millennia.  Our populations have always increased to the  point that meat and fat became hard to get for the poorer people, and in  many cases, impossible.  Reading Harris makes one believe that the single  most important detriment to human well-being is overpopulation.  Again and  again humans overwhelmed their resources.  Today we have so much here in  America while in India and places like that most people are hungry,  especially for meat and fat.  It is only the amazing explosion in  technology and the use of fossil fuels that has allowed the current  population growth.  Still we have too many people.<br />Insects are eaten by  most societies, but seldom as an important source of protein because the  supply is unstable.  Monkeys that jump from branch to branch eating a bite  of fruit and then throwing it down and grabbing another to eat just a bite  or two before discarding it are actually looking for insects.  They want  the apple with the worm in it!  Humans typically eat insects that  swarm or  are otherwise in large supply at once.  When the locusts come you might as  well eat them because they won't be leaving much plant food to eat.  But it  is in the tropical climes that most insects are eaten since jungles do not  provide a convenient large-animal, ruminant source of meat to satisfy  protein needs.  Locusts and grubs, termites and ants, especially the  fat-rich sexual forms, are the best insects to eat.  The giant water bug of  Southeast Asian is much prized.  Eating insects would provide essential  protein if we would do it, and we would, if it were necessary.  The chitin  of the skeletons cannot be digested,  but that is a minor problem.  Some  people roast and/or boil the insects and then pick off the legs before  ingesting.  Eating water bugs is apparently a little like eating a small  lobster.  They pick out the flesh with little sticks.<br />If you haven't read  Marvin Harris, you are missing one of the great writers from anthropology.gs before  ingesting.

The title  sets the quasi-satirical tone for the revelations to come.<br />Achenbach's  book, to my mind,  is an outstanding work of journalism, clearly in the  personally-involved tradition of people like Hunter S. Thompson, Gay  Talese, Tom Wolfe and Truman Capote, but more playfully done.  More than a  scientific quest, what Achenbach reports on here is a sociological  phenomenon of staggering proportions.  It's &quot;the alien question,&quot;  which is many things to many people: a new religion in the making, the  manifest destiny of an entire species, the most important scientific quest  of all time, or simply a  project that Congress won't fund.  It is also  &quot;a bottomless pit,&quot; as Achenbach describes it on page 355,  &quot;a drop-off into nothingness, just mist and vapor,&quot; something  that &quot;is likely to remain a matter of infinite possibilities and zero  certainties&quot; for years to come.<br />To write this book, Achenbach  visited and interviewed scores of people including the illuminati of space  science like the late Carl Sagan and Frank Drake and the head of NASA, Dan  Goldin, as well as assorted lesser lights like Henry Harris, a non-PhD  working for JPL, and Jill Tarter, who was the inspiration for Jody Foster's  character in the movie Contact.  But he also broke bread with an assortment  of fringe looneys from those who claim to be part alien to those who  committed suicide to catch up with the space ship companion to the comet  Hale-Bopp.  Achenbach's attitude throughout is serious, yet his style is  irreverent, even flippant at times.  He treats the Roswell aliens and the  Face on Mars with the same respect as the Copernican Principle and the  Drake equation.  He tells the story of the rock from Mars with the same  enthusiastic but polite reserve he employs when talking to a certain Jan  Bingham, a &quot;Starseed&quot; from Las Vegas, Nevada, who sometimes  travels interdimensionally.<br />He has a gift for the language and can sum  up an eye-popping situation in a memorable phrase that suddenly reveals a  different perspective.  Thus he writes on page 33, &quot;You can take  everything conclusively known about extraterrestrial life and fit it on the  period at the end of this sentence (with room left over for about seventeen  angels).&quot;  He quotes Bob Forward (inventor of the light-sail idea of  propulsion) who is describing the scoop on a ramjet that would have to be  infinitely strong to withstand collisions with particles, but would have no  mass, as saying,  &quot;Therefore...it would have to be constructed from a  special element: &amp;#8219;unobtainium'&quot; (p. 247).<br />This is  journalism at its best, on a par with PBS's Nova and Frontline, and a full  stride ahead of most of what we see on network TV, and of course light  years beyond the tabloids.  Achenbach asks all the serious questions as he  looks into every niche and cranny of the alien phenomenon.  He even asks my  favorite question on page 341, a question like a Zen koan, &quot;Why is  there something rather than nothing?&quot;  Asking this question with a  sufficient measure of wonder leads immediately to satori, while reading  this book with a sufficient measure of light-hearted openness will lead to  a whole lot of fun.<br />By the way, did you know that the first five letters  of Neil Armstrong's name spelled backwards is &quot;alien&quot;?

What Trefil demonstrates here is that we are indeed unique and always will  be regardless of how powerful and clever and \\"conscious\\" our  computers become.  He is NOT saying that we will be unsurpassed in intelligence or  that we possess souls and computers don't.  What Trefil is asserting is  something much more modest.  We are unique in the sense that there is  nothing exactly like us.  This is a \\"unique\\" akin to the  \\"special\\" in \\"special education.\\"  We are special.  It  doesn't matter how filled or unfilled the universe is with intelligent life  forms.  We are and will be uniquely ourselves.<br /><br />Trefil's main subsidiary  argument, that the difference between animal consciousness and human  consciousness is more than just a difference of degree, is more  interesting.  He asserts that the difference is so great that it  constitutes a difference of kind.  When things get sufficiently complex we  have the \\"emergent property\\" phenomenon.  As others have said,  more is different, and what emerges is something that cannot always be  predicted.<br /><br />I also think he makes a nice argument for the possibility that  we will not be able to build a computer more sophisticated  than our brain.  It could just be, he asserts, that something like Godel's theorem which  states that any mathematical system of sufficient complexity includes  statements that can't be proven or are contradictory, may be \\"waiting  for us in complex systems\\" (p. 219)  His point is there may be a  practical barrier beyond which our very finite minds cannot go.  I suspect  he is right, and this is something worth pondering.<br /><br />But there is a  problem with the intent of this book.  Notice first that the title refers  to the \\"unparalleled\\" intelligence of the human mind, not the  \\"unsurpassed.\\"  One could also say that the intelligence of e.g.,  a silverfish is \\"unparalleled.\\"  Trefil knows that our  intelligence is very likely to be surpassed.  This sly use of language is  similar to his main assertion that we are \\"unique.\\"  It's true,  but so what?<br /><br />Perhaps Trefil set out to show that human consciousness is  something that a computer could never achieve.  To this end he surveyed the  \\"landscape of opinion\\" on consciousness and found the following  categories: \\"Deniers,\\" those who deny that there is a  \\"problem of consciousness at all-that once you understand what the  neurons are doing, there's nothing else to explain\\" (pp. 182-183).  He  puts Daniel Dennett in this category.  Next there are the  \\"Mysterians,\\" those who feel that the problem of consciousness  will never be solved.  And finally there are the \\"Materialists,\\"  like Francis Crick, who in his book, The Astonishing Hypothesis (1994),  asserts that we are \\"in fact no more than the behavior of a vast  assembly of nerve cells and the associated molecules.\\"<br /><br />Trefil (who  is a physicist) claims to be a member of this latter group.  However I  think that he has a lot of the \\"mysterian\\" in him.  For example,  he writes on page 173 that when he was courting his future wife he suddenly  realized he loved her, and he realized he knew this with more certainty  than he had ever known anything in physics or mathematics.  He adds that an  algorithm running on a Turing machine is never going to know anything in  quite the same way.<br /><br />I agree, but the knowing he is talking about is  hardly just a knowing.  It is a near total brain/body experience, and since  he is an evolutionary, reproducing human being, it's a profound and  extremely important experience.  He isn't just \\"knowing.\\"  He is  feeling and then some.  Computers don't feel.  So of course they cannot  know something in quite the same way.<br /><br />There are other (small) problems  with Trefil's presentation, but I'll skip them and go straight to what I  think is the most glaring: an omission of a category for those who believe  that consciousness is simply an illusion, a device of the evolutionary  mechanism.  This category would include most evolutionary psychologists and  Tor Norretranders, who wrote The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down  to Size  (1991, 1998), a book I wish Trefil had read.  From this point of  view our consciousness is an emergent property of the evolutionary process,  a mechanism that forces us to identify with the particular phenotype that  we are and to work tirelessly for its advantage and to fear its  disadvantage, especially its death.  A computer, which has not gone through  the same sort of process would not have a similar consciousness.  On pages  184-185 Trefil encounters this point of view from the  \\"Illusionists\\" (as I'll dub them), but misses the significance of  what they said to him.  He writes that the neuroscientists with whom he was  talking were \\"apt to brush off questions about consciousness with a  wave of the hand and, &#8219;Oh, it's just an illusion,' then get back  to their work.\\"  Trefils claims these people are \\"deniers,\\"  not realizing that there is a world of difference between calling something  an illusion and saying it doesn't exist.  Illusions exist, and can be very  powerful.  Our consciousness is an illusion we can't help but  believe.<br /><br />I'd like to add that this idea of consciousness is an old one  that can be found in the works of Buddhism, jnana yoga and the Vedas, and  probably elsewhere.  Our consciousness is an amazing experience, so  overwhelming and so overpowering that it dominates all aspects of our  existence.  But it's just part of the illusion, the maya that separates us  from the underlying truth of our existence.  Our ego, our subjective sense  of self, is also an illusion.  Our individual consciousness is no different  than the other person's.

2310694:US	49786731	RYROSD7JEY0JT	0195128524	997233304	Here Be Dragons: The Scientific Quest for Extraterrestrial Life	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Sparkling	What I especially liked about Here Be Dragons was how every chapter was  interesting.  Beginning with &quot;Origins,&quot; about possible habitats  for life from scum ponds to interstellar dust clouds to deep sea ocean  vents in Chapter 2 to the evolution of solar systems in Chapter 4 to the  search for life beyond the sun, the SETI experience, the UFO phenomena (in  a chapter entitled &quot;Dreamland&quot;) to the possibility of non  carbon-based life in Chapter 9: &quot;Exotica: Life as We Don't Know  It,&quot; the text is lively.  (Chapter 3 is about &quot;The Incredible  Shrinking Martians&quot; who have, alas, lost their canals and  greenery.)<br />Koerner and LeVay achieve this engaging readability by  presenting contrasting viewpoints from state of the art scientists, often  in disagreement.  Thus we have paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Simon  Conway Morris disagreeing on how big a factor chance is in evolution, and  how that might affect the prospects for the development of extraterrestrial  intelligence.  Frank Drake and the late Carl Sagan, who are optimistic  about the possibility of contacting ETI, are paired off against people like  Jared Diamond, Ben Zuckerman, Ernst Mayr, and Martin Ryle, who are not.<br />Other books about science try to be interesting by presenting the  personalities of science, but what they miss is the conflicts.  Koerner and  LeVay do not.  They even begin the book with a visit to the Museum of  Creation and Earth History in Santee, California with its Six Days of  Creation exhibits (the Darwinian fish on their vehicle hopefully not  noticed).  They immediately contrast this with a visit to the nearby NASA  Specialized Center of Research and Training in Exobiology at La Jolla.  Additionally, they sprinkle the narrative with some interesting, sometimes  irreverent, observations.  For example on pages 162-163 they toss in a  witty jab at Stephen Gould, a brilliant man who sometimes takes himself a  little too seriously.  At issue is the famous (and beloved) Drake equation.  The authors write: &quot;&amp;#8219;It's not an equation,' Stephen Gould  tells us baldly, adding his trademark chuckle to let us know that he has  finally put the thing out of its misery.&quot;  At another point they tell  us that Frank Drake's license plate reads, &quot;N EQLS L,&quot; which is  Drake's emphatic way of asserting his belief that we are not  alone.<br />Truthfully, though, some of this was a little over my head, in  particular the material about planet-finding techniques, including the  photometric method, the radial-velocity method and interferometry.  I don't  think that's a shortcoming of the book, but rather a shortcoming on my  part.  However it didn't help that the color plates are misnumbered.  (Perhaps in the paperback edition that is fixed.)  Also difficult, but  interesting, was the material about Stuart Kauffman's &quot;autocatalytic  sets&quot; of replicating molecules as precursors of RNA and DNA.<br />I want  to say one thing about the anthropic principle addressed in Chapter 9.  We  have a sampling of one.  A sampling of one is better than no sampling at  all.  In fact the difference between no sampling at all and one sampling is  greater than the difference between samplings one and  two, and two and  three...etc.  It means something, believe it.  We're here.  That implies  that the universe had to be a certain way, which excludes a whole bunch of  presumably possible universes.  But if the universe were different perhaps  some other creatures would be (t)here rhapsodizing over just how miraculous  all their coincidences are.  To get all thrilled about how everything in  the universe had to be exactly so otherwise we wouldn't have arrived is  like getting all thrilled at bridge because you were dealt exactly the  cards you were dealt since the odds against getting exactly those thirteen  individual cards are astronomical.<br />I also like the tone of &quot;Here  Be Dragons&quot; (fromthe cartographers of old), which is midway between  dead earnestness and TGIF casual.  The prose is lively and witty and very  readable while being informative in an exciting way.

It is also valuable for those whose spouse or other loved  one has this frightening disease.<br />Poole follows the plan implied in the  title, showing how melanoma might be prevented, how it can be detected as  early as possible (which is absolutely essential in this disease, because  it is the spread, the metastasis, that kills), and how it can be treated.  She adds some resources including web sites, helpful organizations,  publications, and a glossary.  The photos showing what melanoma looks like  include shots of moles that may be spots where melanoma may begin.  The  prints are ugly and scary, but very helpful.  There is some technical  material, especially about the staging system for melanoma in Appendix A,  but for the most part the emphasis is on practical information and guidance  presented in a straight forward and readable manner.<br />I wish the  information in this book had been widely available twenty years ago so that  my mother who died from the disease might have understood what the spots on  her skin were and had them removed before they spread to her brain.  For  myself, I note that of the five most important factors in gauging who is  most likely to get melanoma (p. 21), I have all five.<br />The good news is,  although once it has metastasized melanoma is a very deadly disease, if it  is caught in time, the cure rate is very high, in some case approaching  100% (p. 39).<br />What's beautiful about this book is that the information it  contains will surely save lives.	2000-08-19

This is an example of what Tenner means by things biting  back.  My house has very good water pressure.  I can put a lot of water on  the lawn in a hurry.  Unfortunately, the pressure is so great that the  water hose cannot be set down on the lawn with the water on since it will  jump and squirm and shoot about until something anchors it.  The other  morning at five a.m. one of the hoses to the washer burst spraying gallons  of hot water against the wall and onto the floor.  I was experiencing  &quot;the revenge of unintended consequences.&quot;<br />There's a certain  &quot;Peter Principle&quot; logic to Tenner's thesis.  It seems that we  have the ability to devise technology wonders but the inability to  completely account for everything they can and will do.  The computer  brought us not only incredibly rapid calculations and a greatly enhanced  ability to write, as well as the Internet, but also carpal tunnel syndrome.  Who could have predicted that?  We thought we were heralding in the  paperless society when in fact the use of paper increased.  The expanding  speed and availability of global transportation has lead to the rapid  proliferation of disease and unwanted alien species.  We could and probably  did predict that.<br />Tenner covers a lot of ground in this very interesting  book, from medicine and natural disasters to plant and animal pests to  machinery and software to how better running shoes lead to more injuries.  In short what we have here is a warning: we are not as smart as we think we  are.  We are not as completely in control of our lives as we would like to  believe.  We are in danger of really screwing up the works at any time, so  we ought to be modest and, as Tenner suggests, practice a constant  vigilance because &quot;reality is indeed gaining on us.&quot;	2000-08-09

And so perhaps the very cosmopolitan and worldly Arthur C.  Clarke, celebrated author of 2001: A Space Odyssey and long time resident  of India's neighbor Sri Lanka thought it was time the people of the Ganges  got some due, and so he named the artificial world that is the center of  this splendid novel, Rama, after one of the manifestations of God in the  Hindu pantheon.  This is &quot;old school&quot; science fiction, written in  a not very fancy, but entirely agreeable style that emphasizes  communication first and curlicues not at all.  This is &quot;hard&quot; SF  with a firm scientific basis from which to take flights of fancy.  Political correctness, space age romance, galactic shoot outs, ghastly  horror, laser light swords, etc., and other stables of the contemporary  genre are pleasantly absent in favor of a carefully developed plot based on  plausible events.  One gets the feeling that something like this could  really happen.<br />Rama is a self-contained world that is both space ship and  planetoid.  It is a 50 by 20 kilometer cylinder that has entered the Solar  System and is headed for the Sun.  The time is 2130 and humankind has  colonies from Mercury to Titan and a governing body called the United  Planets.  The story of the novel is the exploration of Rama, which Clarke  does with clarity and a sense of wonder so that we are carried along,  enthralled.  There are charming Clarkean touches, the &quot;simps,&quot;  lovable human-engineered monkeys who clean and fetch for humans; world  leaders whose simple emotions remind us of our neighbors; aliens that are  cute rather than venomous; and bad guys that are not really all that evil.  There is a certain rational morality to Clarke's view of humankind that I  wish were more in evidence in our own lives.  In Rendezvous with Rama, the  lawyers argue over the number of objects orbiting Jupiter that should be  called satellites, not over how to extract as much money from their  adversaries as possible.  Those who would destroy and murder aliens, just  to be safe, are in the minority.  World leaders disagree but no one brands  the other as an hated enemy, etc.<br />Some observations: On page 31 Clarke  implies that a proper human population for the earth would be about one  billion.  Elsewhere he has gotten rid of automobiles.  I like both ideas,  imagining they lead to a more idyllic biosphere.  On page 35 he has 1,000  miles a minute as a reasonable speed for earth transportation.  On page 259  he mentions a US president named Perez...<br />As with other works of Clarke,  what really charms here is an infectious sense of wonder, something most of  us lost many years ago, a sense of delight in the possible, recalling the  magic of childhood and first love.  For that, Sir Arthur, thanks.argue over the number of objects orbiting Jupiter that should be  called satellites, not over how to extract as much money from their  adversaries as possible.

2334864:US	49786731	RSBDQREJIJP5R	0312253265	850288222	JonBenet : Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation	Books	5	41	47	N	N	A real inside look at what happened	This is the fourth book I've read on the Jon Ben&eacute;t case and easily the best one.<br /><br />Former Boulder police Det. Steve Thomas, who was one of the  chief investigators in the Ramsey case, does not mice words here and leaves  the reader with no doubt about who killed Jon Ben&eacute;t.  He also makes it  abundantly clear why the case never went to trial and why it is highly  unlikely that it ever will.<br /><br />Thomas acknowledges that the crime scene was  hopelessly compromised by the inexperienced boulder police, but more  important demonstrates that the case could not be tried because the top  attorneys in the Boulder District Attorney's office, and in particular DA  Alex Hunter, were afraid to face the Ramseys and their team of lawyer in  court.  Thomas cites statistics showing that the vast majority of criminal  cases in Boulder during the tenure of Alex Hunter had been plea bargained  and not taken to trial.  The effect of this kind of justice was to leave  the DA's office with an appalling lack of trial experience and a morbid  fear of going against \\"Team Ramsey.\\"  Hunter, a politician's politician,  clearly saw that his main job was to make sure no indictment against the  Ramsey's would ever see the light of day.  To this end, he and his  attorneys worked very hard to discourage the police, whose investigation  clearly showed that the Ramseys were guilty and should be indicted.  John  Ramsey took advantage of this situation by hiring lawyers who were friends  of lawyers in the district attorney's office who were supplied with  information about the ongoing investigation.  Thomas goes so far as to  quote people accusing the district attorney's office of obstruction of  justice.  Of course no such charges were ever filed.<br /><br />After reading this  vivid and uncompromised account, I no longer have any doubt about what  happened to Jon Ben&eacute;t.  Thomas presents his scenario on pages 285-289.  He  also explains why he thinks it was a murder and not an accident.  The real  question is, why did John Ramsey help Patsy cover it up?  Thomas's answer  (p. 289) is that Ramsey \\"chose to protect his wife.\\"  It was perhaps a snap  decision that once entered into could not be undone.  Thomas does not see  John Ramsey as having molested his daughter; instead he believes that the  prior vaginal trauma that Jon Ben&eacute;t allegedly suffered was at the hands of  her frantic mother handing out punishment for regressed toilet training.  We can see this possibility from Thomas's account of Patsy Ramsey being  questioned by retired Denver homicide detective Captain Tom Haney (pp.  325-327).  Patsy comes across as a very tough broad indeed, even a little  on the crude side.  Thomas concludes that beneath her mask, he saw \\"cold  rage.\\"  Perhaps John Ramsey was afraid of going against his wife.  Perhaps  she knew something very embarrassing that he wanted to keep  hidden.<br /><br />Because Thomas had intimate and extensive knowledge of the facts  of the case second to none, there are bits of evidence here that the other  books I have read do not contain.  The fact that the Ramseys video taped  the police at the empty Ramsey house in Boulder as they were acting out  scenarios is an example.  The plan with the Georgia police to wire tap the  Ramsey's Atlanta home is another.  The details of the textual analysis that  Vassar College linguist Don Foster did on the writings of Patsy Ramsey that  led him to assert that she wrote the ransom note is a third.  The  conclusion of the FBI's team from its Child Abduction and Serial Killer  Unit that the ransom note \\"was a cathartic act that allowed the offender to  `undo' the murder in one's own mind\\" (p. 217) is a fourth.  There are many  others.  Incidentally this is a better book than Schiller's Perfect Murder,  Perfect Town, not only because it presents facts and an intimate point of  view not found there, but because it is more focused and leaves out a lot  of unnecessary mediamaterial.<br /><br />I think the most important lesson we can  learn from the Ramsey case is that the rich really are different.  For one  thing, they can more easily get away with murder.  I am thinking also of  the Martha Moxley case in Connecticut, the Cullen Davis case in Texas, and  of course the O.J. Simpson case in Los Angeles.  What's the answer?  It's  the same thing that compromises our political system: money gives those  with it a tremendous political advantage over those of modest means.  I  wish I knew the answer.<br /><br />I like the way Thomas ends the book with a  tribute to Jon Ben&eacute;t whom he calls \\"a strong-willed little spirit\\" who  \\"would have chosen her own course in life, not one mapped by a mother  living vicariously through her daughter's beauty...an incredible little kid  who loved to be tickled.\\"  He adds: \\"Miss America was the least she could  have been.\\"<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"think the most important lesson we can  learn from the Ramsey case is that the rich really are different.

2336373:US	49786731	RKKJR0UV9RY9M	0198602308	618267340	Twentieth Century Words	Books	5	3	3	N	N	History as told through word coinages	Lexicographer John Ayto of the Oxford English Dictionary, that august authority on the English language, wrote this interesting book on  neologisms for the Oxford University Press.  As such there is a notable  Brit bias to the text featuring many words and phrases never current in the  States or anywhere outside of England.  One of my favorites is  \\"train-spotter\\" (1989) which incidentally explains the meaning of the title  of the British cult movie, Trainspotting (1996).  However the vast majority  of the entries-there are about four thousand of them-will be recognized by  most native speakers (and especially readers) of English.  There is an  excellent introduction to begin the book explaining how words come into the  language, how meanings change, and how one can read history through  etymology.  This is followed by the entries themselves arranged according  to the decade of the twentieth century in which they entered the language.  Ayto has written a short introduction to each decade, emphasizing the  scientific, political, artistic, etc. developments that led to the new  coinages.  Each entry is tagged with the date it first appeared in print as  recorded in the files of the OED.  As with a usage dictionary, the entry  includes examples of the use of the word or phrase, especially early  usages.<br />There are many surprises, at least for me.  For example,  \\"enthuse\\" as a verb is not listed because it actually came into use in the  19th Century.  \\"Ska,\\" referring to a kind of popular music of Jamaican  origin, first made its appearance in 1964.  I would have guessed the  eighties as the earliest.  \\"Atomic bomb\\" amazingly enough first appeared in  1914 (anticipating the Manhattan Project by about thirty years!) in  something from H.G. Wells, and in 1917 there was this bit of irony from S.  Strunsky, \\"When you can drop just one atomic bomb and wipe out Paris or  Berlin, war will have become monstrous and impossible.\\"<br />In some of the  entries we can see the early development of a word.  \\"Feminazi,\\" for  example entered the world of print in 1990 (I would have thought earlier).  Ayto quotes the Atlanta Journal and Constitution first using it like this,  \\"Let commie-liberal, femi-nazis and other bleeding hearts quibble over  that.\\"  Then Rush Limbaugh is quoted in 1992 as saying that the real agenda  of the feminazis \\"is to see that there are as many abortions as possible.\\"  By 1994, however the word had become almost benign as in this quote from Ms  Magazine: \\"I fight my way to my destination, finally arriving in bad mood,  militant black woman, cranky feminazi.\\"<br />There's a certain artificiality  to dividing the growth of the language by decade, but of course it is a  handy organizing device as long as one remembers that, for example, the so  called \\"sixties\\" really didn't begin until about 1964 when the U.S. got  involved in Vietnam, and didn't end until sometime in the early seventies.  The etymological history here supports that notion by revealing that  \\"miniskirt\\" first appeared in 1964, and that \\"freak\\" and \\"freak out,\\"  meaning to undergo an intense emotional experience, became words in print  in 1965.  If you're like me and like to curl up in bed with a good usage  dictionary (Bergan and Cornelia Evans's A Dictionary of Contemporary  American Usage (1957) for example), Twentieth Century Words will not only  be a special treat, but a little overwhelming as you realize just how much  lexical information you have in your hands.  Proscriptive grammarians and  those who think we ought to guard the English language the way the French  Academy protects French from the horrors of \\"franglais\\" should beware since  Ayto's user-based collection can offend sensibilities with its democratic  bias.  The \\"f-word,\\" for example, appears in various guises, and a lot of  not really established slang (\\"diss,\\" \\"tubular,\\" etc.) appearing alongside  established usages.<br />There is an index listing the words alphabetically,  which is very handy, and a table in the introduction giving examples of  some surprising pre-twentieth century coinages, e.g,, \\"contact lens,\\" \\"milk  shake,\\" \\"acid rain,\\" etc.  Some really recent words that didn't make the  book include \\"bobos\\" (from the popular book Bobos in Paradise by David  Brooks) and \\"hottie\\" (for an attractive member of the opposite sex).  Ayto  writes that there are an average of 900 words per year that come into the  language, about 90,000 for the twentieth century, so we have in this book  perhaps the most important five or six percent.which is very handy, and a table in the introduction giving examples of  some surprising pre-twentieth century coinages, e.g,, \\"contact lens,\\" \\"milk  shake,\\" \\"acid rain,\\" etc.  Some really recent words that didn't make the  book include \\"bobos\\" (from the popular book Bobos in Paradise by David  Brooks) and \\"hottie\\" (for an attractive member of the opposite sex).

She is a good old Southern gal, part poet, part naturalist, who chooses every word  with loving care.  She displays a rationalist's affection for the creatures  she writes about rather than that of a bleeding heart.<br />In addition to  those in the title, the \\"despicable species\\" include sandburs, squirrels,  starlings, dinoflagellates, deerflies, horseflies, fruit flies, and even  homo sapiens.  Lemkbe devotes a chapter to each following an introduction  entitled, \\"Living Together, Like It or Not,\\" which sets the tone of the  book.  This is a  personal experience that she relates, tempered with a  classicist's love of allusion and a precision about nomenclature that would  please the most exacting.  She has a no nonsense attitude about her fellow  creatures, especially the two-legged kind, whom she guides with little  lectures.  Rodney Barker, for example,  author of When the Waters Turned  to Blood (1997) gets taken to the wood shed not only for getting the  species wrong, but for pronouncing \\"dinoflagellate\\" with a short \\"i\\" (p.  68).<br />The text may be a little too precious in parts for some, and the  poetic style is not intended to be merely informative; on the other hand,  there is a dimension of beauty and a vividness achieved here that rewards  the reader's effort.  There's no index, but there is an eclectic reader's  guide, \\"For the Bookworm,\\" that includes some fine old names like Homer,  Audubon, Jonathan Swift, Eric Hoffer, John Updike, and some new, like Sue  Hubbell and Scott Weidensaul<br />On page 38 is a recipe for squirrel stew.	2000-08-04

The anonymous  author, now a modest financial advisor in a small town, manages to look  like a hero with a human heart while exposing the compromised nature of the  securities business.  If you have any illusions left about the goodness of  humanity, don't read this book.  You'll lose them.  Part confessional, part  cautionary tale, this first person narrative makes Wall Street brokers look  like the dregs of humanity.  If this sensational and rather novelistic tale  is to be believed (and it is) then even lawyers and used car salesman tell  fewer lies and steal less than Wall Street brokers.<br />License to Steal is  the latest in a genre that goes back to at least the robber-baron days of  the 19th century and probably to the earliest days of capitalism in  renaissance Italy.  One of my favorites is the very entertaining Where Are  the Customers' Yachts? (1940) by Fred Schwed Jr.  In that little book,  studded with New Yorker cartoons, an innocent asks a broker the title  question and is told, naive fool that he is, that the customers don't have  any yachts.  Only brokers and officers of the brokerage firm have yachts.  According to the authors, today's breed of white collar crook doesn't spend  his ill-gotten lucre on anything so romantic as a yacht, preferring German  motor cars, cocaine and Cuban cigars, floozies,  French champagne and  blackjack.  The degenerate get more degenerate it would appear.<br />I had a  broker myself, back in the days of my naivet&eacute;, and I recall she told me one  day that she was hoping the market would plunge a hundred points (that was  in the days when a hundred-point swing meant something).  I was momentarily  stunned since I was a client with some serious money in those stocks that  she was hoping would plunge.  But she had forgotten herself for the moment  and was talking to me as she would to one of her fellow brokers.  THEY  wanted a plunge so they could stir up some action and make some money on  commissions.  And therein lies what the authors of License to Steal call on  page 265 the \\"basic conflict of interest\\" in \\"the securities business,\\"  namely that what is good for the broker is to move \\"clients in and out of  positions to generate commissions\\" (and to take advantage of the spread),  while what is good for clients is just the opposite, to pay a minimum for  commissions and to get trimmed by the spread as seldom as possible.  This  conflict is still with us although, by trading over the Net without a  broker, the commissions are much cheaper and the danger of getting trimmed  by in-house spreads is lessen considerably.  Nonetheless, the industry as a  whole still has a vested interest in churning the accounts of investors.  We see this in the frequent upgrades and downgrades issued by brokerage  firms, recommendations that encourage a lot of buying and selling.  The  only way this conflict is going to be eliminated is for brokers to gain  only when their clients gain.  I wouldn't hold my breath for that reform  however, since it would have the effect of sending  the vast majority of  brokers back to telemarketing or to selling aluminum sliding.<br />If you like  License to Steal, and I think you will, since it is very hard to put down  with the lurid picture of piggy greed and human stupidity it paints, you  will also like F.I.A.S.C.O.: Blood in the Water on Wall Street (1997) by  Frank Partnoy.  Partnoy's book is about derivatives sales people who are as  morally degenerate as the characters in License to Steal.  The only  substantive difference in the books is that Partnoy's book is not anonymous  and neither are the firms he worked for.herself for the moment  and was talking to me as she would to one of her fellow brokers.

He thought that the general public was  in doubt about the probability of extraterrestrial life, and he wanted to  make one modest point, namely that because the universe is so incredibly  vast, it is almost a cinch that life exists elsewhere.  The problem with  this is, just about anybody with an interest in extraterrestrial life knows  that.  Aczel thought he was bringing us a bulletin, carefully framed and  double checked, and proven.  What he should have known is that not only is  his news is not news, but as Hamlet said to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,  \\"Your news is not true.\\"<br />Aczel is the author of  Fermat's Last Theorem, a  book that enjoyed a popular success that perhaps gave him the encouragement  he needed to think that he should write a book announcing to the world that  he had proven, mathematically, that life does indeed exist on other worlds.  Alas and alack, he really didn't prove anything.  Most people are more  convinced by common sense, given the billions of stars in our galaxy and  the billions of other galaxies, that life must exist elsewhere, than they  would ever be by such a mathematical \\"proof\\" as is contained herein.  Fact  is, one of the numbers Aczel plugs into his proof is not known, and is  merely an assumption on his part.  He declares without a shred of evidence  \\"that the probability of life occurring on any single planet that is  already within its star's habitable zone is extremely extremely remote: one  in a trillion\\" (p. 212).  Sorry, but that is not good enough.  As someone  else has pointed out on this site, the number could just as easily be one  in a trillion, trillion, trillion.  How about 1 in a googolplex of  googolplexes?  Size DOES matter.<br />Notice the full title of this book:  \\"Why There Must Be Intelligent Life in the Universe.\\"  Aczel's entire  argument includes the idea that life inevitably leads to intelligent life.  In Chapter Seven, \\"The Evolution of Intelligence,\\" he quotes studies  showing that the brain size of animals in general is growing, that the  dinosaurs had on average larger brains at the time of their demise than  they did earlier, and that mammals have gradually developed larger  brains.<br />This proves nothing of course, being (for one thing) a planetary  sampling of one.  Actually it proves that Aczel did not read the literature  because he would have known that there is a very real controversy about  whether intelligent life follows as a matter of course from life itself, or  whether intelligent life is a very rare development.  (See, for example,  Dared Diamond's argument in Extraterrestrials: Where Are They? (1995),  edited by Ben Zuckerman and Michael H. Hart.)<br />In the final analysis the  failure of this book is not in the writing and nor in the presentation nor  in the conclusion.  It's in the arrogance.  Just because one is an expert  in statistics, it doesn't follow that one can apply one's knowledge to an  entirely different field and get positive results.  Furthermore, as stated  above, if you are going to write a popular book, bringing the benefit of  your knowledge to a popular audience, you really ought to read the  literature.  That way you may know as much about the subject as your  prospective readership.re  argument includes the idea that life inevitably leads to intelligent life.

This article claimed an extraterrestrial cause for the extinction of the dinosaurs and  other species 65 million years ago.  Reaction from paleontologists and  others was immediate and largely negative.  They saw it as a splashy,  media-darling type of catastrophic explanation anathema to most working  scientists.  Author David Raup and his colleague Jack Sepkoski were however  among those paleontologists (Stephen Jay Gould was another) who liked the  idea.  Since there are a number of other mass extinctions in the fossil  record, they wondered if these events might be connected and how.  They  began a statistical analysis of the record, and in February, 1984 published  a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  demonstrating a 26-million-year periodicity.  This led to the question, why  would these extinctions be regular and what caused them?  The answer came  from astrophysicists who postulated (among other theories) a \\"Death Star\\"  companion to the sun, dubbed Nemesis.  This star would periodically come  close to the sun, disturbing the Oort Cloud of comets, sending some of them  to rain down on Earth, thus killing substantial amounts of life on  earth.<br />It's a great theory and I love it.  Unfortunately no one has ever  seen this Nemesis star, which is not due to return for another 13 million  years or so.  In fact no one has seen the Oort Cloud either, although I  understand most astrophysicists believe it is there.  And of course  paleontologists do not like catastrophic explanations for mass extinctions.  In fact they hate them for both theoretical and personal reasons.<br />Thus  we have the ingredients for an engaging and very human story about how  science works and how it doesn't work.  In this extremely readable book  Raup reveals how scientific ideas develop, how they are rejected and  accepted, and how some theories can neither be confirmed nor rejected, and  how the scientific community treats such ideas, and how the media is  involved.  The blurb on the book cover has a quote from James Trefil  comparing it as a memoir to The Double Helix, James Watson's personal story  of how he and Francis Crick got credit for discovering the structure of the  DNA molecule.  I agree that this book is as readable as that very involving  story, but Raup's book is more on the order of readable journalism, while  Watson's book was more like a novel.<br />What is intriguing in both books is  the sheer humanity displayed in both a positive and a negative sense.  Here  we see a kind of knee jerk, turf-protecting rejection of new ideas by the  established cadre of scientists, especially in paleontology.  In one sense  this is understandable.  If you work all your life to help build a certain  view of the way things are in your chosen field, and along comes an idea  that completely overturns your life's work, you are not going to be happy.  You will rail against it and try to show that it is false.  We see this in  all fields of science since all fields are staffed by humans.  I notice in  psychology, for example, that the old cognitive and psychoanalytical people  find it very difficult to accept the findings of evolutionary psychology,  some of which make Freud, for example, look very much mistaken.  In this  sense scientists are like the Victorians who fought against the ideas of  Darwin that threatened to overturn their view of the world (and  did!).<br />Part of what makes this book effective is the openness with which  Raup tells the story.  He is candid to the point of showing and admitting  his own faults and prejudices.  He shows how success in science is gauged,  not by dollars or fame, or even necessarily by what's discovered, but by  prestige among colleagues.  He writes on page 211 that \\"one's success as a  scientist can be measured more by the number of people he or she puts to  work on new problems than by the correctness of specific research  results.\\"<br />This book is a revision of the 1986 edition with a new  introduction and a new final chapter entitled \\"Update 1999.\\"  The Nemesis  Affair is not over with.  Raup lets us know that the crater has been found  for the K-T extinction of the dinosaurs, and that most scientists now  accept the Alvarez scenario for Cretaceous extinctions.  However neither a  dark star nor a tenth planet has been found, and so the acceptance of the  periodicity of mass extinctions is on hold.<br />To show how ideas in science  can lead to totally unexpected advances elsewhere, note that the work done  in understanding how the dinosaurs died after the impact of the K-T meteor  led to a realization of the possibility of \\"nuclear winter,\\" which in turn  was a factor in ending the cold war.  It is somewhat amazing to realize  that the work of Alvarez and his colleagues may have helped to prevent a  nuclear holocaust.  Some people think that money spent on SETI or on space  exploration is wasted.  I think that knowledge gained is always valuable,  and sometimes, spectacularly so.e puts to  work on new problems than by the correctness of specific research  results.\\"<br />This book is a revision of the 1986 edition with a new  introduction and a new final chapter entitled \\"Update 1999.\\"  The Nemesis  Affair is not over with.

Bobos are the issue of WASP and Kennedy Catholic, the Left Bank and the Right.  Ben Franklin making cozy with Gustav Flaubert.  A marriage of  Episcopalian and Jew.  A  prep school Adonis seducing a grad school feminist.  (Or perhaps that  should be the other way around.)  They are what happens to yuppies in the  Age of Information.  Bobos realize that the bottom line should be done in  calligraphy; that six-figures of yearly income ought to buy more than the  Wall Street Journal and cappuccino; that there is more to life than vintage  port and the society pages.<br />Although Bobos in Paradise is packaged as a  satire, and indeed a lot of fun is had with the meritocracy, it is actually  an adoration written by a self-admitted member of the new elite.  Since it  is difficult to satirize your own class, Brooks's satire occasionally lacks  bite.  But it certainly doesn't lack pizzazz, sparkle, and a kind of \\"Look,  Ma, I'm writing!\\" effervescence.  Bon mots and witty catch phrases  (\\"incidental money,\\" \\"biscotti-nibbling Bobos,\\" \\"New Age vaporheads,\\" etc.)  roll right off his tongue, or, I should say, spring adroitly from his  keyboard.  Thus on page 58 we learn that \\"Gone are the sixties-era things  that were fun and of interest to teenagers, like Free Love, and retained  are all the things that might be of interest to middle-aged hypochondriacs,  like whole grains.\\"<br />Sometimes we get a glimpse, however, that, although his eye is sharp and  his wit keen, Brooks's verbal hijinks lack a certain substance, leading to  a failure to convince.  Thus on page 90 he writes: \\"The top-of-the-line  fleece outergarments [worn by Bobos] are used for nothing more strenuous  than traversing the refrigerated aisle in the Safeway.\\"  One thing wrong  with this: the upper class doesn't shop at Safeway.<br />Or, on page 20, where  he's talking about wedding section photos from the New York Times in the  fifties, he observes, \\"and yet it's not really been so long-most of the  people on those yellowing pages are still alive, and a sizable portion of  the brides on those pages are young enough that they haven't yet been  dumped for trophy spouses.\\"  Which means, I guess, that Brooks thinks that  a man opts for a trophy wife at about the age of 70.  Or maybe, caught up  in the pleasing flow of his rhetoric, he doesn't notice when the meaning  has gone slightly awry.<br />The book is organized into chapters defining the  lifestyle of Bobos, the best of which is \\"Consumption,\\" that which Bobos do  best: conspicuously consume with a vengeance while remaining politically  correct.  The chapters are padded out a little with reviews of influential  books of social criticism, e.g., William Whyte's The Organization Man,  Theodore Roszak's The Making of a Counter-Culture or Paul Goodman's Growing  Up Absurd, a group the author and his book clearly aspire to join.<br />Also  excellent is the chapter, \\"Intellectual Life,\\" in which Brooks focuses on  think tank culture and demolishes it.  For Brooks, a think tank is where  underlings learn how to become intellectuals while going through a \\"buttboy  stage\\" as they scurry with their stuffed briefcases behind the \\"front  people\\" of the tanks, tired old icon intellectuals who \\"walk very fast to  demonstrate their vitality\\" (p. 155).  Brooks notes tellingly that if  anything happened to the apprentice intellectuals \\"think tank reports  across America would go out filled with typos for months.\\"<br />A chapter on  \\"Pleasure\\" suffers from Brooks's disinclination to reveal much about the  sexual habits of Bobos.  Other than to assert that Bobos like their sex  healthy, safe and with rules, and that they don't just have orgasms, they  \\"achieve them,\\" Brooks is fairly mum.  Whether Bobos do threesomes or  prefer third world types for sexual thrills is apparently not known.  Work  itself is the real pleasure.<br/>The chapter \\"Politics and Beyond\\"  demonstrates that Bobos are a reconciliation of liberal and conservative, a  mesh of the politics of the 60s and 80s.  They would seem to be moderates,  but by page 266 Brooks assures us happily that Bobos have clearly \\"become  conservatives.\\"<br />The chapter on \\"Spiritual Life\\" suffers from a kind of  free-floating free-good association that Brooks wants to indulge.  Bobos  don't put down any religion, and in fact like to try them all on for size,  picking and choosing from each what is best.  One gets the sense however  that Bobo heaven is a place where spirituality is expressed by buying,  displaying and using politically correct consumer goods and  services.<br />Make no mistake, though, this is the kind of book biz coup that  we'd all like to have written.  It's tasty pablum for those who would see  themselves as the ruling class, a massage of prejudices, mores and  self-centered delusions that would have amused Dwight MacDonald (author of  \\"Masscult and Midcult,\\" a seminal satiric essay from the fifties) or old H.  L. Mencken who liked to shock the \\"booboisie\\" with his polemics, as does  Brooks.  In fact Brooks's Bobos look a little like Mencken's  boobus  americanus after a TV makeover.<br />Yet there's something reassuring in  this fantasy of upper class life in American as the century and millennium  draw to a close.  Sure the power structure has been diluted by women and  some unavoidable eggheadism, but by gosh, when all is said and done, it's  still the same old guys who are running the show, upright people from such  places as Wayne, Pennsylvania and Burlington, Vermont, people  characterized, as their fathers were, by \\"restraint and sobriety.\\"  God's  in his heaven and all is right in Bobo Land.l pleasure.<br />The chapter \\"Politics and Beyond\\"  demonstrates that Bobos are a reconciliation of liberal and conservative, a  mesh of the politics of the 60s and 80s.

His daughter takes a radical feminist class at college and then begins therapy with a lesbian shrink who recovers memories of incest, etc. by dear old dad.  Mom, who is  divorcing him, believes the daughter.  Then the son comes up with a similar  tale!  After about a year and a half of hell, Van Til finds out that the  children are accusing Mom as well!  Mom now decides she no longer believes  her daughter.  She can't bring herself to condemn the industry since she is  part of it, but Van Til clearly sees who the villains are.<br />This is an  excellent book that really takes the SRA, RMT, and MPD people apart with a  non-hysteric presentation of the facts.  That's \\"Satanic Ritual Abuse,\\"  \\"Recovered Memory Therapy,\\" and \\"Multiple Personality Disorder\\"-all frauds,  by the way.  The other villains of this Great American Witch Hunt of the  80s and 90s are, one, the well-intended Child Abuse Prevention and  Treatment Act (CAPTA) of 1974 which required persons, teachers, clergy,  social workers, etc., to report evidence of child abuse, which was okay,  but it granted such persons blanket immunity from any kind of legal action  should they be wrong; and, two, the policies of the stupid medical  insurance companies who allied their payment practices with diagnoses made  from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders.  Since the inception of CAPTA the instance of  in-the-book \\"mental disorders\\" grown like kudzu.  What some therapists have  done is to make sure their client has insurance, find a disorder in the  manual that takes a long time to treat, and then milk that for all they can  get.  Because recovered memory therapies are almost always about childhood  sexual abuse, the therapist was further encouraged because the therapist  now had immunity (via CAPTA) from prosecution from those hurt by the false  charges developed through the so-called therapy.<br />Van Til does an  excellent job of accounting for the existence of the hysteria and the witch  hunt and explaining how it became so extensive despite the lack of any  evidence for the existence of SRA and alleged widespread sexual abuse of  children by daycare people.  He shows the parallels with the Salem witch  hunt of 1692 and the McCarthy witch hunt of the 1950s.  This witch hunt was  worse than either of those in many ways.  While innocent people were  actually executed by the Puritans, the number of damaged lives in the  daycare and recovered memory hysteria was much larger.  Hundreds of  individuals actually went to jail, and many are still in jail as I write  this, and untold thousands of lives were destroyed, both financially and  emotionally.  Van Til shows how the use of the invasive brainwashing  techniques by social workers and counselors actually constituted a  particularly horrible form of child abuse.  What was especially sad about  the methods of recovered memory therapy was the way they turned family  members against one another and ultimately destroyed what love and trust  existed.  Van Til compares the tactics of RMT therapists to those of cult  leaders who isolate and brainwash susceptible persons.  He is right.<br />By  the way, this attack on men is also to some extent an attack on the family  by the social service industry.  What the industry was saying is don't  believe or trust your parents.  Trust us.  Give your money to us.  We will  make you well because we know the way and the truth.  Your parents are  people that you need to be rid of.  We'll show you how.<br />I feel the utmost  empathy for Van Til, and congratulate him for having the courage to write  this important book.  Nothing can give him his life back, but I believe in  detailing his personal tragedy he has helped others, and hastened an end to  the sickness.does an  excellent job of accounting for the existence of the hysteria and the witch  hunt and explaining how it became so extensive despite the lack of any  evidence for the existence of SRA and alleged widespread sexual abuse of  children by daycare people.

2373072:US	49786731	R36FB14EMZTO3C	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A masterpiece on several levels	Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita is one of those rare books that is both a commercial and an artistic masterpiece.  Like Joyce's Ulysses it is a tour de force of language seldom encountered in English outside the works of Shakespeare.  It is a carefully crafted novel rich in irony and atmosphere, a novel of great psychological insight and poignancy, a novel to rival the masters of the nineteenth century and those of the twenty-first.  Some have called it \\"The Great American Novel,\\" that mythical tome of authorial genius that everybody was trying to write after the second world war, and the best novel about America ever penned.  Certainly Lolita can feel comfortable alongside The Scarlet Letter, Huck Finn, Moby Dick and a few others as a top drawer classic of American literature.<br />Of course what sets Lolita apart from other novels, at least at the time of its publication in the fifties, is its theme.  A grown man making love to a pre-adolescent girl was quite a shock for a prudish America weaned on Ozzie and Harriet and Dwight Eisenhower.  As such it was a courageous novel and a bit of a daring-do.  It was the novel of a man ravenous for the fame and fortune he thought his talent so richly deserved, and so he took a chance.<br />Originally Nabokov had intended to withhold his name from the title page while dispersing throughout the narrative cryptic evidences of his presence, should he later want to claim authorship; but somehow, even before the novel's first publication in France, he was persuaded to admit paternity.  Even so he remained uneasy about Lolita throughout most of his life, maintaining that other, less appreciated works of his were superior, especially Ada and Pnin, while insisting that Humbert Humbert, his nymphet-enchanted antihero, was no part of himself, merely a puppet on the master's string.  After the rush of fame had subsided and he was comfortably ensconced en chateau with his fortune, Nabokov even grew weary of the attention Lolita commanded from critics and public alike, attention he saw as detrimental to his scholarly work, his autobiography (the splendid Speak, Memory) and his other works of fiction.  I wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that more than once he spoke aloud the ancient warning and lamentation: \\"Beware of what you wish for.  You may get it.\\"<br />Still, one can survive such annoyances, and nowhere in Nabokov's life was he seen as more than slightly troubled by the very real belief that such a penetrating revelation of character (Humbert's) could only be achieved by having part of that character as one's own.  This he denied to his dying day-as well he might and should.  The \\"biographical fallacy\\" has a place in literary criticism, perhaps, but not here.  His denial, while politically correct, was unnecessary since girls are desirable, and one can feel that desire without being a lecher.  What is needed is the understanding, as with avocados and the rising of the sun, that there is a time appropriate to every purpose.<br />While reading Lolita for the first time, as with any rich piece of literature, you do yourself a favor and don't try to catch all the subtleties.  Just read it through.  Those familiar with Nabokov know full well that he plays games with the reader just as he does with his characters.  He likes to show off, and besides few of us are as erudite as the very learned professor himself.  You might want to take a note or two to record how you feel about Humbert and his little charge, and then compare those notes to how you feel after a second reading.  Like others, I found myself moved from the amusement and tolerance of a first reading to a fully sober appreciation, after a second reading, of what a \\"brute\\" (Lo's fair description) Humbert Humbert really is.  It is a curious coincidence perhaps, but this is exactly what happened with the cinematic interpretations of the novel.  The first, by Kubrick from the sixties, is a brilliant comedy that has us identifying with the tragedy of Hum's obsession, while the second, Adrian Lyne's more graphic recent production, makes it clear how violated and used and ultimately destroyed Lolita really was.<br />If you're writing a paper, buy the annotated Lolita with notes by Alfred Appel Jr.  Although the annotations add only a little to an enjoyment of the novel, and in some cases seem a bit of a pedantic stretch, they will satisfy a scholastic urge.

In an incisive and extremely confident style, Dr.  Atkins sets out what he believes are the components of a healthy diet for  those of us past, say, fifty.  First, \\"eat foods low in carbohydrates and  high in antioxidants\\" (p. 277).  These would be especially vegetables like  kale, carrots, spinach, broccoli, etc.  Second, eat natural fats and oils  from butter, meat, fish, eggs, nuts and olive oil, and avoid all \\"trans  fats\\" or highly processed fats in general.  In fact, avoid highly processed  foods of all kinds.  Third, supplement your diet with what he calls  \\"vitanutrients,\\" i.e., vitamins like A, B, C, E etc. and minerals like  zinc, calcium, etc., hormones like DHEA and melatonin, etc., and food  supplements like ginseng, ginkgo biloba, etc.<br />Atkins himself is a medical  doctor who practices alternative and complementary medicine.  He is an  enterprise himself with his many best-selling books and his Atkins Center  for Complementary Medicine.  When I first heard about him and his all  protein and vegetable diet some years ago, I figured he was the charlatan  author of yet another fad diet, and I ignored his books.  This one is the  first I've actually read, and I must say immediately that he is certainly  not a charlatan.  He is obviously a man who knows as much about diet as  anyone could hope to know.  Whether he is entirely correct in his ideas is  not something I am incapable of assessing; but I am willing to bet he is  mostly right.  He has had an enormous experience treating patients, and it  is encouraging to note that as a medical doctor he tends to write  relatively few prescriptions.  He even warns of the harm that can come from  the use of commonly prescribed medicines and their side effects.<br />The most  important claim he makes about ageing is that it is primarily caused by  free radicals and that a diet high in antioxidants can reduce the number of  free radicals in our bodies.<br />His central idea about diet is that it is  not fats that are the enemy of health for people in the industrialized  world (as we have so long been taught) but carbohydrates, especially highly  processed ones.  This is indeed a revolutionary idea, or at least it was  when it was first expressed some years ago.  Fat people are not fat because  they eat too much fat.  They are fat because they eat too many  carbohydrates.  When you think about it, especially from the point of view  of evolutionary biology it suddenly makes enormous sense.  What was it in  the prehistory that we humans never had enough of to overindulge on?  Not  meat, and for many cultures, not fat, but carbohydrates.  There were no  fields of amber grain waiting to be harvested and made into flour and  bread.  There were no rice patties or acres of potatoes.  Humans could fell  a mammoth or an elephant seal once in a while and load up on meat and fat  until they were sick of it, but there is no way they could have eaten  enough wild wheat or barley to get sick of it.  The sheer caloric expense  of harvesting low-yield natural grains by hand prohibited any overdosing.  It wasn't until the rise of agriculture about ten thousand years ago that  we ever had enough of a carbohydrate to call it a staple of diet.  Consequently, we are to some extent carbohydrate intolerant.  This is an  idea absent from popular books on nutrition twenty years ago, but a staple  of the wisdom today.<br />I like the way Atkins explains how we came to this  delusive state of dietary affairs in the first place, and how that delusion  is maintained.  The culprits are the mainstream medical establishment and  the U.S. government working hand in hand to further the interests of vast  agribusiness corporations who want to maintain a high public consumption of  trans fats and highly refined carbohydrates.  When you think about this, it  also makes sense.<br />I also like how specific Atkins is.  He names the foods  and the vitanutrients and gives the amounts.  He tells you how to work with  your doctor (who, alas, may not be up on all the latest information) to put  together a program for your specific needs.  If nothing else, by reading  this book you'll know how to ask some tough questions about diet and health  that your doctor will have to respond to.<br />Agreeable too is the sardonic  tone he takes with the medical establishment.  For example on page 194 we  find, \\"...Vitamin E enhances immunity.  This has been a well-known fact  among complementary practitioners for years, but perhaps now the  information will trickle down to mainstream medicine, where this sort of  knowledge is badly needed.\\"<br />However, although the text is as readable as  one would expect a popular book to be, especially with all the unavoidable  abbreviations and acronym-filled detail, there is more than a little  repetition.  Additionally, Atkins and his assisting writer, Sheila Buff,  have an annoying (to me) habit of beginning a chapter by telling the reader  what they're going to say, saying it, and then telling the reader what  they've said.  On the other hand, that might be good; and anyway, who am I  to second guess someone who has reached as many people with his books as  has Dr. Atkins?consumption of  trans fats and highly refined carbohydrates.

The main story is about Pat Dunn, convicted in 1993 of murdering his wife  for her money.  The evidence was slight and relied heavily on a heroin  addict's testimony, a career criminal who had gotten a deal to testify.  Humes makes a good case for Dunn's innocence.<br />Humes also devotes some  serious space to some notorious child molestation/satanic abuse cases  prosecuted in Kern County during the eighties and nineties.  It's the  Little Rascals and McMartin all over again, except worse and prior.  There's the usual brainwashing of the children by social workers to get  them to tell horrific tales, and a criminal justice system out to satisfy  the lust of the mob at any cost.  This is very readable and Humes pulls no  punches when it comes to going after the prosecutors.  It's an irony of our  criminal justice system that sometimes in places like this there's a public  so quick to convict that they end up sending innocent people to jail, while  in other places-I'm thinking of Houston, Texas and the case of Cullen Davis  (see Final Justice: The True Story of the Richest Man Ever Tried for Murder  (1993) by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith) and of Los Angeles with  you know who-we get juries that will not convict regardless of the  evidence.  Humes is doing the good people of Bakersfield a favor in this  book, although I doubt if most of them realize it, because if the system  gets too corrupt, the juries will eventually be like the jury that tried  O.J.: they'll put the system on trial instead of the defendant and deliver  a verdict against it.<br />This is top drawer true crime written by one the  best in the business.  In his ability to involve the reader with the story,  he's on a par with Ann Rule.  In his desire to expose injustice, Humes is  like \\"Sixty Minutes\\" turboed.	2000-07-06

In the usual lively and insightful  Ridley style, we learn how modern humans are more vulnerable than ever to  aerosol diseases (spread through breathing, e.g., colds and flu) and  sexually transmitted diseases, but less vulnerable to water spread diseases  (dysentery, cholera, etc.) because of improved sanitation, or vector spread  diseases (e.g., yellow fever, plague) because of vector control, drained  swamps, and fewer people living under rat-invested thatched roofs.  He also  explores our vulnerability to newly mutated microbes and the propagation of  disease in hospitals and other niches in the modern environment.  He  speculates on the next great plague and where it will come from and its  nature.  He talks about the AIDS epidemic and the Ebola scare and compares  them to past scourges.  He even mentions prion contagion.<br />Ridley is  neither overly optimistic nor needlessly pessimistic.  He warns on page  four that \\"there is no end to the struggle with disease.

This is a closely edited, legally observed, and unabashedly self-serving book.  (I'd love to  see what was edited out.)  Yet, between the lines we can catch a glimpse or  two about who the Ramseys really are and what they are about and what they  believe.<br /><br />This is a well written and very well edited exercise featuring a  centerfold of family portraits, including several modest shots of JonBen&eacute;t.  The Ramseys give a close rendering of the events of Christmas day, 1996,  and the next morning.  The story of Patsy's successful fight against cancer  is told in some detail, and the beauty pageant issue is addressed.  The  book ends with John Ramsey's profile of the murderer and a chapter of  advice on how to protect your children.  There is no index.<br /><br />Throughout,  the Ramseys tell their story in the first person in alternating sections.  First John speaks and then Patsy, and then John again, and so on.  What  they are intent on demonstrating is their innocence.  They try to  accomplish this by convincing the reader of their abiding love for JonBen&eacute;t  and for God, and their adherence to the Christian faith.  Both seem to have  a special relationship with God that allows them to hear his voice.  John  writes \\"there's a point where...you know and understand the truth of what  God has done through human history and you grasp his plan for the future  through his son, Jesus Christ\\" (p. 72).<br /><br />Patsy in particular has felt the  \\"divine intervention\\" in her life on many occasions, particularly in her  successful battle against cancer (p. 77), but also when her cable TV line  was accidentally cut, thereby preventing her from hearing the lies about  her on television (p. 230).  She has received messages from God (e.g., on  pages 82 & 243).  In fact in several spots Patsy seems to liken her  experience to that of Jesus.  As she was watching the \\"Geraldo Rivera Show\\"  on October 22, 1997, for example, she heard voices calling for the  crucifixion of herself and her husband (p. 229).  And as Christmas, 1997  approached, her faith, like that of Jesus, was sorely tested, and she found  herself \\"mad at God\\" and screamed, \\"I hate Christmas!\\"  But there came a  \\"stillness at the center of\\" her \\"being\\" and she \\"received a message from  God\\" telling her that she more than anyone needed Christmas, and her faith  was restored.<br /><br />Even in day to day activities, Patsy found herself calling  on God to guide her and he did.  For example, before picking up the phone  to insinuate herself into the Princess Di media discussion she was watching  on Larry King Live, Patsy told her mother, \\"I'm praying that God will give  me the right words.\\"  After being on hold for a while, \\"suddenly\\" she was  \\"talking on live television, launching...into an attack on Larry King...\\"  (p. 210).  She relates on the next page that she was so successful that  Larry King called to thank her and to ask her to appear on his  show.<br /><br />Almost as annoying as this \\"holier than thou\\" posturing was the  Ramsey's unrelenting attack on the media and the Boulder police as the  cause of all their troubles.  I thought it was significant that they blamed  the police leadership more than they blamed the officers who had so  compromised the crime scene (p. 178).  I also thought it telling that John  Ramsey in particular tried to tie the crime to \\"how transient\\" their  \\"University Hill neighborhood really was,\\" and to people who \\"pushed New  Age experiences\\" (p. 204).  In Lawrence Schiller's book, he is quoted as  saying that Bill McReynolds (\\"Santa Claus\\") should be a suspect partly  because \\"he doesn't have two nickels to rub together.\\"  This high-handed  and snide tone, I believe is as much responsible for the public's suspicion  of the Ramseys as anything else.<br /><br />Nonetheless, after reading three books  onthe subject, I am forced to say that I don't think there's enough  evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are responsible for  their daughter's death.  I think the Boulder District Attorney's office and  the Grand Jury are to be commended for not charging the Ramseys with a  crime they could not prove.  Whether this book will help their public image  is another matter.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"I am forced to say that I don't think there's enough  evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are responsible for  their daughter's death.

This is a book about three distinct, yet intimately interrelated stories, told as one.  First, there is the story of the murder of JonBen&eacute;t Ramsey; second, the story of the investigation of that murder and the antagonism  between the Boulder Police Department and the District Attorney's office;  and third, the media coverage of these events.<br /><br />I think Schiller does a  workman-like job on all three, but for readers primarily interested in the  story of the murder of JonBen&eacute;t, this book, at about 800 pages,  is a bit  too much.  For those interested in the politics and pecking order of the  judicial system as practiced in Boulder, Colorado, this is probably a  fascinating read from cover to cover.  The story of the media is also  interesting, but too narrowly focused on the tabloid coverage, especially  the material about Jeff Shaprio, then working for the Globe.  Stories from  the local (Colorado) media are quoted liberally throughout the text, but  the day-to-day inner workings of the local press is not detailed.  Some of  this material seems pasted in as though Schiller began to weary of his  subject.  The detail about the Colorado judicial system, often presented in  footnotes at the bottom of pages, was legalistic and not really  illuminating.  Additionally the text is marred by typos of the kind not  caught by spell checkers, including the wrong \\"their\\" near the bottom of  page 385, an extraneous article on line 11, page 501, and most  significantly, an \\"isn't\\" for an \\"is\\" on page 227.  (Actually the sentence  in that footnote doesn't make sense with either an \\"isn't\\" as written, or  an \\"is\\" as seems indicated.)<br /><br />On the plus side Schiller does an excellent  job of making some of the players come to life including the very tricky  Jeff Shapiro, the tabloid reporter who insinuated himself into the district  attorney's offices, made friends with the Boulder police, joined Ramsey's  church and even talked at length with John Ramsey on the phone (something  Schiller was not able to do).  The portrait of the sincere and tremendously  dedicated Det. Steve Thomas was also good, as was that of  retired  detective Lou Smit, who befriended the Ramseys.  Boulder County District  Attorney Alex Hunter comes across primarily as a politician.  I also  appreciated the floor plan of the Ramsey house in Appendix A and the  character list at the back of the book.  The name index was also valuable,  although I think there should have been a subject index as well.<br /><br />Because  I didn't know the details of the case before reading this book, for me, the  most important parts are pages 497-499, where the FBI profilers present  their extremely powerful arguments against the intruder theory, and pages  660-670 where there is a summation of the evidence gathered by the Boulder  police.<br /><br />Reading between the lines we can see that John Ramsey himself is  a slightly \\"superior,\\" somewhat cold and calculating man with some  prejudice against the relatively liberal culture of Boulder, Colorado and  against the poor (see page 690 where he argues that Bill McReynolds, who  played \\"Santa Claus,\\" should be a suspect partly because \\"he doesn't have  two nickels to rub together\\").  Nonetheless one imagines that John Ramsey  loved his daughter (and she loved him) so that it is untenable to think  that he could have deliberately murdered her.  Furthermore he has too much  control of himself to have accidentally struck and killed her.  On the  other hand Patsy Ramsey comes across as someone with particularly shallow  values predicated almost entirely on appearance who has a temper that she  could very well lose.  Her love for her daughter is less clear than her  husband's, although her need for JonBen&eacute;t to succeed and thereby reflect  favorably upon herself is very strong.  One imagines that she could punish  her daughter very severely but outside of public scrutiny.  One further  imagines she would seek to cover up anything that would make her look bad.  One very telling observation in the book (p. 13) is that the ransom note  was the \\"War and Peace of ransom notes.\\"  The Patsy Ramsey seen in this  book is a person who does everything in a flamboyant and overdone  manner.<br /><br />I don't think, however, that the evidence as presented here is  strong enough to draw a definite conclusion about who killed JonBen&eacute;t.  One  thing is clear:  John and Patsy Ramsey are either monstrously unlucky, or  they are monsters.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"at would make her look bad.

I read his celebrated Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches years ago with delight.  This volume, written in the mid seventies,  is also delightful.  It's a little dated in spots, of course, and Harris's  opinions are sometimes just opinions; and in some cases he is clearly out  of sync with the most recent discoveries, but all is forgiven because he is  just so interesting to read.<br /><br />Mainly Harris is marvelously satirical.  The  narrative sparkles with put downs of religiosity or any sort of  sanctimonious BS.  Harris pronounces from on high, however.  He seems to  believe that his speculations about how or why something happened are  almost certainly going to be supported by the evidence (when the field work  catches up with his theories!)  He was the author that showed me that the  prohibition against eating pork in the Middle East and beef in India was  based not so much on religious scruples but on economic self-interest  dressed up as prohibitions from the gods.  In this book Harris leads me to  believe that all human taboos even those against murder may be culturally  derived, rather than instinctively based.  The horror stories that he  focuses on here, especially about the Aztec cannibals, seem to prove that  if we want protein enough and can't get it, we will as a people set up a  religion that makes it sacred to kill whatever is available, including  prisoners of war, as the Aztecs did, to get that protein; after which, we  will rationalize our actions as injunctions from the gods.<br /><br />By the way,  cows are sacred in India because if you kill your cow and eat it during the  drought, you will have no cow to plow the land when the rains return and  you will never be able to plow the land again.  The cow (and ox of course)  are doubly valuable because they eat grasses and weeds and other vegetable  matter that we cannot digest.  Consequently cattle and other ruminants  increase our wealth by turning otherwise unavailable sun energy into  protein and calories, or into energy to pull wagons and plows, etc.  Other  animals, pigs and dogs, chickens and turkeys, who eat some of the same  things we do, are less valuable in this sense.<br /><br />If you've never read  Marvin Harris, do yourself a favor and buy this book.  It's fascinating and  reads as fast as a thriller.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\"her ruminants  increase our wealth by turning otherwise unavailable sun energy into  protein and calories, or into energy to pull wagons and plows, etc.  Other  animals, pigs and dogs, chickens and turkeys, who eat some of the same  things we do, are less valuable in this sense.<br /><br />If you've never read  Marvin Harris, do yourself a favor and buy this book.

There's a forward by Francis Drake of the  Drake equation fame.  The book examines the how and why of discovering  intelligent life elsewhere from a scientific POV.  Readable but little new.  Fermi's famous \\"Where are they?\\"  is addressed.  My position is that is  doubtful that intelligent life forms will find any reason to replicate  throughout the galaxy.  Reproduction is just part of the delusion say the  highest philosophers on this planet.  I suspect it might be the same  elsewhere.  Shostak seems to allow that life is probably plentiful, but  intelligent life less so.  Most saliently, he points out that the life span  of any civilization is probably limited, thereby greatly reducing the  probability of contact.<br />This is a good book, but Aliens: Can We Make  Contact with Extraterrestrial Intelligence? (1999) by Andrew J. H. Clark  and David H. Clark covers more ground and is more up to date.  With so many  advances being made today in technology and technique, we need frequent  updates to keep abreast of what is going on.  I hope Shostak favors us with  another book soon where he might speculate on the non-Hollywood forms  extraterrestrial life might realistically assume.  Could intelligent life  be as small as insects?  Or microbes?  How about non-biological life forms?  Energy beings?  It might be good if scientists sometimes, especially in  the later years of their careers, worried less about possible academic  criticism, and let their well-trained and knowledgeable minds run free, and  share their speculations with us.	2000-06-15

The material on smallpox and yellow fever  is fascinating.  Oldstone leaves it unclear whether mad cow disease is  caused by a miss-manufactured prion protein or by a virus: Others books,  including Richard Rhodes'  Deadly Feasts: Tracking the Secrets of a  Terrifying New Plague (1997), clearly cite the cause as being faulty prion  protein production in the brain.<br /><br />This is not for the squeamish.  I  confess that there were twenty or so pages on polio that I skipped, not  wanting to relive that sadness, although of course the defeat of polio is  one of the great triumphs in the history of medicine.  Incidentally, the  title owes something to the classic Rats, Lice and History, by Hans  Zinsser, first published in 1934, a book that has enjoyed a well-deserved  and remarkable commercial success not easily duplicated.	2000-06-10

This version of the story is written by her husband and the father of the two  boys.  He tries to be fair and objective in the first person narrative, but  he gets in his opinion on everybody involved including his in-laws and the  media.  He also reveals himself as a loving father, but a guy working two  women at the same time.  His wife Susan comes across as a kind of sexy but  sick psychopath.  According to David's story, she killed the boys so that  the well-to-do son of a local business owner might be enticed to marry her.  He had told her he didn't want a \\"ready made\\" family.  Kind of like the  lions killing the cubs to bring the lionesses into heat, only here the  lioness does it herself.  If she hadn't confessed, she probably would have  gotten away with it, because nobody, including her husband, could believe  she'd kill her two cute little boys.  There was a lot of sexist sympathy on  both sides of this case, but there's no getting around the fact that Susan  Smith is a monster.  The sad thing is the son of a business man guy  probably would never have married her anyway.  This is a quick and easy  read, but somehow unsatisfying I think because the real depth of the story  needs a larger point of view.	2000-06-08

It's not merely that an innocent person goes to jail, or even that the real criminal is free to commit more crimes (although such things are  horrible), but, more significantly, it is through such actions that our  faith in the law, which is the basis of society, is destroyed.  Whenever  those in the judicial system-prosecutors, police, investigators, judge or  jurors-compromise themselves by bending the law or fudging the evidence or  their perception of the truth to get a phony conviction (as is vividly  described on these pages) then we have moved a step closer to the  repressive and terrorist regimes of the likes of Hitler and Stalin, Saddam  Hussein and Idi Amin.  If the innocent have no more chance of happiness  than the guilty, then our faith in the system will erode and society will  collapse.  Messrs. Scheck, Neufeld, and Dwyer understand this profound  truth and that is one of the reasons they fought so hard to overturn  wrongful convictions and to report on them in this book.<br />Some of this is  strong stuff.  You'll read of crime labs so filthy and disorganized that  they are incapable of processing evidence, and of forensic \\"scientists\\" so  corrupt and incompetent that they present false or invented evidence in  court.  You'll read of police and prosecutors who ignore the truth in order  to convict the innocent and of judges who turn their backs on the rule of  law because of prejudice or political ambition or just to satisfy the blood  lust of a mob mentality.  Some of those wrongfully convicted have spent  decades in prison and have had their lives torn apart.<br />If we  believe, as some of the hardened, cynical police officers, prosecutors and  judges in this book (and elsewhere) do indeed believe, that it doesn't  matter if we compromise the truth a little to get a conviction because the  guy is probably guilty of something else anyway-if we believe THAT, we will  become that which we despise, and the jungle of bestiality will be upon  us.<br />The question therefore arises, why are there people in the judicial  system (the scandal in the Rampart Division of the LAPD comes freshly to  mind) who lie and plant phony evidence in order to get convictions?  Part  of it is the strain of the job and the environment in which law enforcement  people exist.  They become corrupted by their surroundings.  They become  cynical and take on the coloring of those around them.  They adopt the  methods of criminals.  They see horrible crimes everyday and in their  frustration to convict somebody, they lie and compromise themselves.  And  then, once they have compromised themselves, they spiral deeper and deeper  into lawlessness, feeling all the time that it is \\"us or them.\\"<br />What is  the solution?  Eternal vigilance, of course, and the authors are doing  their part in that.  But also, I think, we need to amend some of the rules.  Jailhouse snitches should never be allowed to testify in court.  We must  have strong independent oversight of the police, not in the sense that the  police will be afraid to do their jobs, but in the sense that nothing they  do is secret from society.  We must recognize that their job is a tough  one, but we must be ready to clean house when it is necessary (and it will  be necessary).  Those accused of a crime should have legal representation  as competent as that in the district attorney's office.  In fact I think  that all lawyers should have to spend some time both prosecuting and  defending the accused, and that money should play no part in who represents  whom.  High priced lawyers should be required to not only take on pro bono  cases (which many do as a matter of principle), but to prosecute some of  the time as well.  And district attorneys should be required to defend  cases as well as prosecuting them.  The adversarial system probably cannot  be avoided, but if the players are forced to assume from time totime  positions on both sides of the aisle, I think some of the inbred corruption  can be eliminated.<br />No system is ever going to be perfect.  When a  horrendous crime is committed, we want nothing more than to find who did it  and punish that person severely.  That is human nature.  But we must guard  against letting our blood lust so cloud our judgement that we end up  punishing the poor and the weak and people we don't like.<br />So hurrah for  this book and the light it sheds on how the new forensic tool of DNA  testing is helping us separate the guilty from the actually innocent.

Lemonick, a Time science writer, tries  to make the characters come alive, and they do to some extent, although  this is no novelistic work.  Lemonick emphasizes the equipment, telescopes,  etc. and the techniques used.  He does a good job.<br />The material on the  Mars rock brings us up to date, circa 1997 or thereabouts: they've proved  nothing, yet my guess is that we will find that microscopic life existed on  Mars three and a half billion years ago.  When this happens it will be a  big media event, yet it will mean  little to the average person.  When  INTELLIGENT life is found on other planets in another solar system, if that  ever happens, it will be a big time media event and will have an  EXTRAORDINARY impact on the culture of this world.  My guess, after reading  this and several other books on extraterrestrial life, is that life is  common, but intelligent life rare; consequently, considering the amazing  distances in interstellar space, I don't expect any kind of contact in my  lifetime.  In fact a half life for contact time (just a stab) might be a  thousand years or more, assuming that intelligent life exists in, say,  every hundred million star systems.  Question: will we last a thousand  years?<br />Lemonick celebrates the Drake equation (N=R* Fp Ne Fl Fi Fc L)  where N is the number of detectable civilizations, R* the rate at which  Sun-like stars form, Fp the fraction of stars that form planets, Ne the  number of planets per solar system hospitable to life, Fl the fraction of  planets where life emerges, Fi the fraction of life bearing planets where  intelligence evolves, Fc the fraction where the inhabitants develop  interstellar communication, and L the length of time such civilizations  continue to communicate.<br />Well, they might add \\"Fw,\\" the fraction that are  willing or care to communicate.<br />As far as just the bare existence of  extraterrestrial life is concerned, it might be that we would not even  recognize the life forms if they tapped us on the shoulder since they might  take a form that is pure energy or pure something else we know nothing  about.  It's not far fetched to say they might be invisible to our  eyes.<br />The material about Europa and the possibility of life under its  frozen surface in a great ocean is interesting.  Lemonick says (and we've  read this elsewhere) that it is now believed that life probably did not  originate in wading pools as has been long thought, but probably deep under  the ocean protected from the constant bombardment of comets and meteorites,  nourished not by the sun but by heat escaping from the inner earth.  This  seems highly plausible to me because of the recent discoveries of strange  life forms deep in our oceans where the animals live on bacteria nourished  by heat vents several miles deep.  I still like the panspermia idea from  Hoyle and others that life originated outside our solar system.  For some  reason Lemonick doesn't seem to put much stock in this.re  willing or care to communicate.<br />As far as just the bare existence of  extraterrestrial life is concerned, it might be that we would not even  recognize the life forms if they tapped us on the shoulder since they might  take a form that is pure energy or pure something else we know nothing  about.

In effect (since this is a  complete reworking of her 1984 book, Sympathetic Vibrations) Cole wrote  this book twice, the second time with the benefit of fifteen years of  experience under her belt.  It's clear that she wanted to accomplish two  things: one, provide access to the ideas of physics to a wide readership;  and two, convey the enthusiasm and awesome delight for physics found in the  work of the greats like Newton, Einstein, Gamow, Bohr, Feynman and the  Oppenheimer brothers.<br />She succeeds.  This is science writing for a  popular audience at its finest.  As such it is a perfect gift especially  for a young person interested in science, or for anyone who would like to  know more about the way physicists view our world.  It is a work of love  filled with luscious quotes from the great scientists and others who have  shaped our modern view of the universe.  In a sense it is a celebration of  the scientific view of life.<br />I have read Cole's The Universe and the  Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty (1998) which enjoyed a  well-deserved popular success, but I can tell you, this is an even better  book.

Also tough to swallow is the claim on pages 146-149  that a certain Gaston Naessens discovered \\"the world's smallest living  organism,\\" an organism \\"revealed to be virtually indestructible,\\" an  organism so hard that it is \\"impossible to cut with a diamond knife.\\"  Unfortunately, as in the cold fusion delusion a few years back, Naessens's  claim has gone unsubstantiated.<br />Far be it from me to spoil anyone's fun,  but when people start presenting phony cancer cures, as is done in this  book in the section dealing with \\"suppressed\\" medical therapies, I tend to  take it personally.  Cancer is hellish enough without having to spend your  last few precious hours (and dollars) wading through a forest of fake  cures.  The really terrible thing about this book is the fact that there is  a very real danger that the big drug companies and the AMA might very well  be overlooking and denigrating valid therapies, but we're not going to find  out about them from a book that claims, for example, that NASA is  suppressing telescopic evidence of canals and a flourishing plant life on  Mars (pp. 382-396).<br />The problem for the layman has always been how to  separate the truth from the paranoid delusions of conspiracy theorists or  the apocryphal experience of a few people.  This book, a cockeyed  collection of fantastic conspiracy theories, I am sorry to report, does not  help.	2000-05-31

Indeed, his mother has styled him as a Kennedy.  An Irish Catholic nurse born in Ireland, she has devoted her life to climbing up the social ladder of New York society and pushing her very  handsome son through the best prep schools, etc.  Only one problem.  Robert  Chambers is a pretty boy loser, a druggie and a sociopathic sickie.  He  bombs out of prep school after prep school, mainly because he is caught  stealing to support his cocaine habit.  He just parties.  That's about it.  Mommie, nonetheless believes her son will turn it around and amount to  something.  He is irresistible to the girls.  They see him as an alpha  male.  They think his unsavory character is sexy.  Along comes Jennifer  Levin, a not completely pretty, but sexy, lively girl, who just wants to  have fun.  She finds Robert and wants to have fun with him.  Unfortunately,  his idea of fun is to get wasted, and while wasted he chokes her to death,  and then realizing what he has done, tries to make it look like a rape in  Central Park.  Then while being questioned he has a brilliancy.  He claims  she raped him!  And in fighting back he accidentally strangled her to  death.<br />Well.  It's a sick scene.  All the Studio 54 party preppies and  wanna-bes think this is just the coolest scene.  They now feel so important  and they support Robert, one of their own.  Meanwhile Mom hustles up bail  and more to buy a high priced lawyer to defend her boy.  We get a  semi-competent judge, a not really talented ADA, and a &quot;star of the  show&quot; defense lawyer.  I'll leave it to the reader see how this sad  story about the decadence of the New York-preppie scene, circa 1988, turns  out.<br />Of course one might say that the real villain here is, if you will,  Mom.  She doesn't care what evil things her boy has done.  She doesn't care  that it is obvious he is a degenerate sickie, all she cares about is he is  her Hope.  She lies to herself.  She self-deceives and even though any  idiot can see that her son needs to be put away she continues to let him  party and do drugs and rob while she keeps working seventy hours a week to  support his debased life style.  Of course he doesn't work at all.  If she  had ever said &quot;NO!&quot; and put him on his own, the earlier the  better, say at twelve, he might have amounted to something.  But Mom had to  indulge her mother...lust.<br />Linda Wolf does an outstanding job of vividly  bringing this tale to life.

How we are similar, how different.  Chimpanzees are surprisingly violent and make gang raids on neighboring tribes and kill  (with their bare hands, by the way) if the raiding party has a big  advantage.  We and the chimps broke off from a common ancestor about five  million years ago.  We went out of the forest and onto the woodlands and  the savannas.  We learned to dig up and eat roots and of course bone marrow  from kills.  This is how we survived the loss of the forest and the  recurring dry seasons.<br /><br />We are a little less closely related to gorillas  and orangutans, but the point the authors are making is we are the fifth  ape, and it is valuable to study how the other apes behave so as to gain  insight into ourselves.  While the authors seem to lay the problem of human  violence squarely at the feet of males, it is allowed-albeit only briefly  and incidentally (p. 239-240)-that women choose these demonic males through  sexual selection, and ultimately the problem of male violence is a human  problem.<br /><br />What is especially interesting here is the thorough examination  not only of the violence practiced by apes, but of their differing sexual  practices: gorillas form harems with a single silver back male getting most  of the reproductive tries, while orangutans live alone and the males often  engage in rape.  In contrast the bonobos are so frequently and openly  sexual that genital rubbing is a way of greeting while the father of the  little ones could be any one of the males.<br /><br />This is evolutionary  psychology with a wary eye on political correctness.  I note that Edward O.  Wilson does not appear in the bibliography but Naomi Wolf and Andrea  Dworkin (for example) do.  In fact, this book is something of a blatant  attempt to make evolutionary psychology palpable to women.  The authors  even have a category they call \\"evolutionary feminism\\" represented by  \\"writers like Patricia Gowaty, Sarah Hrdy, Merdith Small, and Barbara  Smuts\\" united in their opposition to \\"the patriarchy\\" (p. 124).  This is  all to the good of course because a thorough going understanding of human  nature will lead us all to the inescapable conclusion that blaming one sex  for the human problem of violence really misses the profound truth of  sexual equality.  The authors even suggest (p. 125) that \\"If all women  followed Lysistrata's injunctions and refused their husbands, they could  indeed effect change.\\"<br /><br />Amen.

The text crackles with  an incisive wit that says, yes we're animals, but we can live with that.  The discussion is thorough, ranging from a rather intense focus on Charles  Darwin and his life through  the sexist and morality debate occasioned by  the publication of Edward O. Wilson's Sociobiology in 1975, to the rise of  the use of primate comparisons fueled by Jane Goodall's instant classic,  The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior (1986). Wright has some  rather serious fun with human sexual behavior as seen from the perspective  of evolutionary psychology, but he spends even more time worrying (to no  good effect, in my opinion) about altruism and the shaky concept of kin  selection.  The title is partly ironic, since much of the material suggests  that we are something less than \\"moral.\\"  The \\"Everyday Life\\" in the title  is an allusion to Freud (The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, 1904) who  makes a dual appearance in the text, first as a kind of not-yet-illuminated  precursor to modern Darwinian thought, and second as the reigning champ of  psychology that evolutionary psychology is out to dethrone.  (See  especially page 314.)<br /><br />What's exciting about evolutionary psychology is  that for the first time psychology has a firm scientific foundation upon  which to build.  But it's a tough subject for some people, I think,  mainly  because they confuse \\"is\\" with \\"ought.\\"  The discoveries of evolutionary  psychology about the differing reproductive strategies of the sexes offend  some people in the same way that Darwin's insight about our kinship with  (other) animals offended the Victorians.  Evolutionary psychology shows us  that men lie, cheat and hustle relentlessly for sex, while women manipulate  available males into caring for their offspring, and if possible for  children fathered by other males.  Insights like these are seen by some as  immoral imperatives, when in fact they are amoral statements of factual  observation.  What \\"is\\" isn't necessarily the same thing as what ought to  be.  And really, we shouldn't blame the messenger.<br /><br />Where Wright's book  especially shows its age is in trying to explain altruism.  He wasn't aware  of the handicap principle developed by Amotz and Avishag in their exciting  book,  The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle (1997)  which nicely explains \\"altruism\\" (it's an advertisement of fitness) and a  number of other evolutionary conundrums, including Wright's question on  page 390, \\"Why do soldiers die for their country?\\"  Additionally on pages  68-70, where Wright attempts to account for female cuckoldry, he gives  three reasons, but seems uncertain of the most important one, which is that  a woman, once established in a secure pair-bond will sometimes seek to  upgrade the genetic input by having a clandestine fling with what she sees  as an alpha male.  Also Wright's attempt to account for homosexuality  (pages 384-386) stumbles over itself in trying to be politically correct  while missing the major point that homosexuality facilitates male bonding  and therefore is certainly adaptive since male coalitions increase each  member of the coalition's chance of securing females.  It fact, Wright  misses the whole concept of male bonding.  There's not even an index entry  for it.<br /><br />These observations are not to be taken as criticisms of the book  since Wright was writing before knowledge of some of these ideas became  widespread.  The Moral Animal remains an outstanding opus and one that has  helped introduce a large readership to the power and efficacy of  evolutionary psychology, a scientific approach to psychology that will, I  believe, replace the old paradigms currently holding sway in our  universities.  Of course this will only happen when the old behaviorists,  and cognitive and psychoanalytic stalwarts...retire.<br /><br />I would like to see  Wright revise this book in light of the many discoveries made during the  nineties and reissue it.

Ebert, who conducts the \\"conversations\\" with eight current New Age illuminati that  form the bulk of the book, is a pretty fancy babble master himself, proving  without half trying that he can speak pseudobabblese with the best of them.  Consider this formulation as he converses with Rupert Sheldrake on page  46: \\"So your theory that information can be transmitted by these  non-material morphic fields makes plausible a paradigm in which phenomena  such as telepathy or ESP can be understood.  Can you explain how your  paradigm makes sense out of this type of phenomena?\\"<br />Note that Ebert is  incorporating into his talk scientific-sounding terminology shorn of any  scientific meaning.  It's a sort of sly of mouth that lends a \\"scientific\\"  gloss to the babbling.  Ebert's \\"non-material morphic fields\\" (from  Sheldrake), for example, sounds good since we have \\"field theory\\" in  physics.  Sheldrake chimes in with talk of \\"fields of perception.\\"  Note  especially, however, the killer word \\"paradigm.\\"  For the last couple of  decades or so, one way to test a book's BS content has been to count the  number of times the word \\"paradigm\\" appears.  Once every ten pages or so is  tolerable.  More than that should start your BS-detector to crackling.  New  Age babblers never use the word \\"construct\\" or \\"idea\\" or such a phrase as  \\"body of knowledge\\" when they can throw in \\"paradigm\\" instead.  In general  they like to spice up their discourse with a plethora of scientific  sounding words and phrases such as \\"psychokinetic influence,\\"  \\"fusion,\\"  \\"quantum events,\\" \\"cultural hybrids,\\" etc., as Ebert and Sheldon do on, for  example, page 48.  On pages 94 and 95, in the space of nine sentences,  Ebert manages to use the New Age shibboleth \\"resonance\\" six  times.<br />There's also the patterning of  words to imitate a reasoned  discourse, a weighing and choosing of plausibilities as though weighing  evidence or comparing experimental results.  Thus Sheldrake says on page  47, \\"...[S]ome...phenomena of parapsychology are hard to explain from the  point of view of morphic fields and morphic resonance.  For example,  anything to do with precognition or premonition doesn't fit into an idea of  influences just coming in from the past.  So, I don't think this is going  to give a blanket explanation of all parapsychological phenomena, but I  think it's going to make some of it, at least, seem normal rather than  paranormal.\\"  Notice how this mumbo jumbo makes it seem like something is  being explained.  Not all of this  is annoying, thankfully.  The conversation with psychedelic guru Terence  McKenna is interesting and invigorating, and the chat with Deepak Chopra is  uplifting and admirable, which is what New Age thought in general tries to  be.  The New Age movement itself, which is easy to make fun of (it takes  itself so seriously, I can't resist), is actually a noble enterprise  engaged in trying to free us from the shackles of antiquated religions and  the limitations of scientific materialism. The New Age in fact is a new  religion in the making.  In view of the stupidity and intolerance of some  world religions, this is a welcome development.  The problem is that many  New Age apostles in skirting scientific materialism, skirt the scientific  method as well.  Much of the conversation in this book wants to substitute  pronouncements for trial and error experiments.  Thus Sheldrake can  postulate morphic fields and morphic resonance, and continue on as though  such notions had been experimentally verified and independently confirmed.  And the terrible thing is I really don't think a lot of the New Agers  really know the difference between asserting something and presenting an  idea in a scientifically verifiable manner.  Ebert is perhaps aware of this  criticism because on page 92 he pays considerable homage to thescientific  method, but then continues on as if it didn't matter.<br />In short, this book  has a beautiful title, but it's a little after the fact since quantum  mechanics killed the clockwork god a long time ago.  Instead we have the  god who plays dice, a much more sophisticated god who can Be or Not Be in  the twinkling of a probability function.  To find out more about this god  we need  the kind of  speculation sometimes found in New Age thinking, but  more than that we need the scientific method, a process that Ebert and  friends would prefer to ignore.mage to the scientific  method, but then continues on as if it didn't matter.<br />In short, this book  has a beautiful title, but it's a little after the fact since quantum  mechanics killed the clockwork god a long time ago.

Why does the springbok leap straight up into the air when it sees a predator?  Why do people behave heroically?  The handicap principle answers these questions, eloquently, simply and with  an overwhelming sense of conviction.  The peacock is advertising his  fitness.  He is saying to the female in essence, I am so fit I can carry  around this cumbersome adornment and still scratch out a very fine living.  The springbok is saying to the predator: don't even think about going after  me.  I am in such good shape I can waste energy jumping up and down and  still have plenty of reserves to outrun you.  Save us both the bother and  go after someone weaker.  (By the way, the springbok jumps straight up  instead of sideways because by jumping straight up its performance can be  effectively judged by a predator from any direction.)  And the man who  dives into the swiftly flowing river to save a drowning child is actually  advertising his fitness and improving his station in society.  He is so fit  he can take chances that others dare not. He's the man the women want to  mate with.<br /><br />The Handicap Principle thus is about signals, signals between  prey and predator, between one sex and the other, and between the  individual and the group.  The purpose of these signals is to display in an  unequivocal way the fitness of the signaler.  Note that such signals have  to be \\"fake proof.\\"  They have to be what the authors call \\"reliable.\\"  An  animal that can't run fast and has limited resources of energy can't waste  them jumping in the air.  It needs to get going immediately or to stay  hidden if it is to have any chance of survival.  A man leads with his chin.  That's a signal that he's confident.  When men had beards it was a little  dangerous to stick your chin out since the other guy might grab your beard  and you could be in trouble.  People demonstrate wealth by wasting money.  This is a \\"reliable\\" (if ugly) signal because without an ample supply of  money, you can't afford to waste it.<br /><br />Part of the beauty of this book  comes from the personality of the authors, who spent a large part of their  lives studying little babbler birds in Israel.  I feel I know these little  social birds just from the loving descriptions in the text.  One can see  that even though the Zahavis made their discovery of the handicap principle  in 1975 and waited almost two decades before it was generally accepted in  the scientific community, they harbor no bitterness, nor is their tone at  all gloating.  They come across as hard-working field scientists who love  their work and nature.<br /><br />Besides being full of exciting and original ideas,  The Handicap Principle is also extremely well written.  Each sentence is  clear and to the point without the burden of unnecessary jargon or the  wordy clumsiness sometimes found in such books.  Amotz and Avishag Zahavi  took great pride in effectively communicating their ideas to a wide  audience.  Additionally there are scores of exquisite, loving little black  and white drawings by illustrator Amir Balaban of animals, birds, insects  and people, etc., illuminating the text.<br /><br />If you're interested in  evolutionary theory, this is a book not to be missed.

This short book without chapters is about the trauma of that  experience.  This is an intensely personal study of being powerless and  humiliated, of being reduced to something close to subhuman.  But Reemtsma  learns that the \\"he\\" who was held in that cellar (he won't call him \\"I\\")  was not subhuman, but human in a different state, a state of \\"forced  intimacy\\" with his captors.<br />Reemtsma writes with a curious, but totally  delineated sense of profound shame.  He became, however unavoidably and  however ephemerally, intimate with his captors, men who had terrorized not  just him but his family and friends.  This-a symptom of the so-called  Stockholm Syndrome in which hostages come to identify with and admire their  abductors-is something so painful to this proud and highly respected man  that he writes this book both to understand his experience and to exorcize  it.  In doing so he finds a dimension of himself and his humanity that he  never knew existed.<br />The details and the pure logistics of a $30-million  abduction dragged out for thirty-three days are fascinating in themselves.  The botched payoffs, the dangerous intrusion of the police, the furtive,  awkward exchanges between the kidnapers and Reemtsma's family and friends,  and especially the mundane and sordid details of his life in the cellar,  illustrate with compelling force the horror of the crime of kidnaping.  This is a fascinating and affecting book that, to my mind, allows Reemtsma  to rise above the degradation of his abduction.  The readable translation  by Carol Brown Janeway and the beautiful presentation by Knopf make this a  book worth owning.	2000-05-15

Consequently it is not easy to  see that nowhere in this book does he directly say what causes aging and  death.  Nor does he simply say we don't know.  What he does say is there  are some persuasive theories, especially the evolutionary model began by  Haldane and Medawar and refined by George Williams (pp. 49-50), that are  consistent with the data that \\"may be essentially correct, at least in  broad outline.\\" (p. 52).  Clark makes it clear that we have senescence  effector genes in our cells but he doesn't say how they got there, only  that they were \\"already in place in the earliest eukaryotic organisms such  as paramecia and yeast.\\" (p. 57)  The reader is left to believe that there  is a mechanism that retains them, but what that mechanism might be is  unclear.<br />I am led to believe that senescence is built into our cells and  is part of our genetic makeup.  We are programmed to grow old and die.  Just how is what Professor Clark is exploring here.  He concentrates on the  cellular level because it is his belief that this is where the mechanisms  for senescence can be found.  On page 190 he argues that senescence is  genetically controlled and not the result of a random breakdown, citing the  fact that \\"maximum lifespan is species-specific.\\"  In short, humans live a  lot longer than dogs, contrary to what might be expected if senescence were  caused by cells getting old and wearing out.  He points out on page 48 that  \\"mice and humans, although composed of proteins that are extremely similar  at a chemical level, have both average and maximal lifespans differing by a  factor of 30 or more.\\"<br />Clark also covers in some detail such issues as  the evolution of senescence, average and maximum lifespan; genetic diseases  such as Werner's syndrome, the Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome and others;  oxidative stress as a cause of cellular senescence and the use of Vitamin E  and other antioxidants; the aging brain and Alzheimer's disease; cancer and  the social and economic effect of humans living longer.

But journalist Pearson, who has a super-fine feel for the politically correct, steers her way through the granite rocks by flatly stating that women are just as violent as men while slyly suggesting that  if some people don't think that women have the same capacity for violence,  maybe they are buying the \\"weaker sex\\" mythology and by extension  continuing the subjugation.  Let me tell you, this hits home with the Ms.  crowd big time.  Pearson paints a picture of women and violence that would  give Charlie Manson pause, and you get the sense that she has the feminists  soberly nodding their heads, \\"this is true, this is true.\\"  Susan  Brownmiller, author of Against Our Will, and bona fide feminist icon, even  contributes a blurb for Pearson's book, allowing that there was \\"much to  agree...and disagree with,\\" but registers her approval with \\"...my tilt was  definitely in her favor.\\"<br />Mine too.  I was actually surprised at the  stats Pearson quotes showing the extent of feminine violence.  Men too get  beaten up (although let's be clear about this, not nearly as often).  What  I like best about the book is the hope that it is the beginning of an  understanding that violence is a human sickness, not confined to one sex,  and that psychological violence can be as brutal as physical.  The violent  evils that women are statistically more capable of-infanticide, crimes  against the elderly, the murder of children, etc.-are starkly documented  here.  The real horror though, that women actually create the violent  psychopaths through sexual choice, is a truth that even Pearson is not  capable of addressing-yet.  It's coming, though.  When it is realized that  the women who \\"can't help themselves\\" when they choose to mate with violent  psychopaths in preference to milquetoasts (to use a word Pearson employs)  also share responsibility for the violence in human society, then we will  have made real progress toward ending the violence.<br />The chapters on women  as predators, and women as partners in violent crime, and especially the  chapter on women in prison make the book.  I always wondered why the prison  system couldn't keep the drugs out.  This book has the answer: the prison  authorities want the drugs in as a means of helping them control the  prisoners.  Pearson points out that pacifying drugs, like heroin and  hashish, are easy to get; non-pacifying drugs like cocaine are not so easy  to get.  Pearson also makes it clear that violence is, as I said above, a  human problem, not confined to one sex; indeed this is her point and a  reason for exposing all the female violence that we as a society tend to  forget and to downplay.  Pearson wants to make sure we don't forget.<br />As I  read this book I was reminded of why I seldom read feminist writers or  listen to macho AM talk shows: the hard core sexists in their pathological  need to hate the opposite sex are so dishonest and so prejudiced that what  they say has no informational meaning.  Pearson exposes this mentality  again and again, sometimes by quoting feminine authors in vacuous support  of some female murderess as \\"courageous\\" or as someone \\"justifiably\\" bent  on \\"righteous\\" rage.<br />Some (now) purely political words that feminists  might want to lose (it occurred to me as I was reading this book):  \\"courage\\" as in \\"the courage to heal\\"; \\"empowerment,\\" as in shooting her  husband was \\"a liberating act of empowerment\\" (we all want to be  empowered); and especially \\"liberating.\\"  What we need to get liberated  from is the nature of sexuality itself, from identifying ourselves, as most  people do, primarily as sexual creatures.  Sex is the instrument of the  evolutionary process, the tool of creatures who eat and are eaten.  It was  here long before we evolved and it will be here long after we are gone.  While reading Pearson's vivid glimpses of women in prison, I was struck by  how demoralizing it is to see people with nothing better to do than parade  their sexuality, whatever the nature of that sexuality.  But worse yet is  people like feminist Jane Caputi (quoted in Pearson's book as saying that  serial killers act on behalf of all men as henchmen in the subordination of  women) who identify themselves primarily in terms of sex, saying they are  feminists.  Pathetic.  I should be a \\"masculinist\\" or whatever the male  equivalent is.  When I was twenty I identified with myself as a \\"man.\\"  I  didn't think how much better it would be to identify with myself as a human  being.  But I was twenty.  What's the feminist excuse?ne.

It is a little dated; for example Russell wasn't aware that  altruism is advertising.  We enhance our status and dominance in the  society by appearing altruistic.  See Zahavi, Amotz and Avishag. The  Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle (1997) for a more up  to date presentation.  And Russell's view of feminine sexuality is a little  pollyannaish.  He does not mention the now well-documented female strategy  of cuckolding a mate for a reproductive liaison with what she perceives is  an alpha male.  See, e.g., Baker, Robin. Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex  (1996) or Diamond, Jared. Why is Sex Fun? The Evolution of Human Sexuality  (1997) for the sobering revelations.  What sets this book apart from others  is Russell's thorough discussion of the war system as practiced by  primates, while his work with lemurs allows him to go back further in time  for his speculations.  His style, like Ridley's, is lively and very  readable.<br />Russell's premise is that we descended from lemurs (and from  shrews before that) and that our psychology today can be better understood  through an examination of lemur and other primate behavior.  This really is  the basis of evolutionary psychology, the idea that we can better  understand ourselves by studying the behavior of animals that are  genetically close to us, especially animals similar to ones in our  ancestry.  Russell makes a strong case for this point of view while gently  dismissing psychoanalytic theories.  He writes: \\"Freud made the mistake of  ethnocentrism by concluding that the behavior of Homo sapiens could be  understood from studies of behaviorally-troubled patients within his own  society.\\" (p. 24)  On page 152 is perhaps  Russell's main point, that \\"War evolved to displace in-group male  aggression.\\"  On page 193 he adds, \\"War, for twenty million years, has  served the needs of the ruling oligarchy above all other considerations.\\"  Those needs include killing off young males who represent not only a threat  to the power of the oligarchy, but sexual competition.  In fact, war can be  seen as a pact between the ruling classes of one tribe and another: you  kill off our excessive males and we'll kill off yours, and we'll both  benefit.<br />I have to disagree with Russell, however, on riots, which he  equates with war.  The riots in the cities are not like war; they are what  will result if an enemy outside society cannot be found.  Then the ruling  classes themselves will become the enemy.  One method of dealing with the  violent dissatisfaction expressed in riots is ruthless suppression, as in  totalitarian governments.  Another is to ship the omega males off to war as  in both totalitarian and democratic societies.  A third method, employed in  the United States today, is to put them into prison.  We are simultaneously  raising the price of the drugs that the dissatisfied are addicted to while  imprisoning them when they attempt to buy these drugs or when they commit  crimes to get money to pay for the drugs.  It's a system that appears to be  working.  Perhaps it is better than the war system.  Russell sees the  use of language as a way to lie, mislead and deceive.  \\"Romance requires  deception, most often self-deception.\\" (p. 183)  He adds: \\"...it has been  estimated that the living English language contains no fewer than 300  euphemisms for the word \\"penis,\\" a clear indication of our preoccupation  with sex and our attempts to keep communications about that important  subject private, imprecise, and obscure.\\" (p. 187)<br />The book ends with a  clarion call to save the earth's tropical forests, etc. presented with a  heavy dose of pessimism.  Russell's concern is that there are already far  too many humans on the planet.  On page 239 he complains about  \\"Well-intentioned humanitarian groups [that] feed, clothe, and house  surplus children.\\"  He adds (still p. 239) \\"why feed prolific human  breeders when we know that soon we will not have enough food to feed all  their children? ... Saved children become breeding adults who repeat their  parents' mistakes.\\"<br />I tend to agree with this, but I might ask him about  those Malagasy dogs that the blurb on the jacket says he's so fond of.  Does he feed them meat from cows bred on land that previously contained a  tropical forest or from the flesh of whales harpooned in the North Pacific?  Russell's is a voice in the wilderness, and from his strident tone, he  knows it.  I am glad that somebody agrees with me that there are too many  people on this planet.  I just hope we can curb our appetite for  reproduction before it is too late.[that] feed, clothe, and house  surplus children.\\"  He adds (still p. 239) \\"why feed prolific human  breeders when we know that soon we will not have enough food to feed all  their children? ...

Not being really conversant with the \\"who done it\\" genre, if indeed that is her genre, I can only compare her to Georges Simenon.  There  is the same intense concentration and a similar interest in the psychology  of people at cross purposes.  She does a fine job with the third-person  introspection of her leading character, Theodore Schiebelhut, a well-to-do  Swiss artist living in Mexico.  There is an unusual feel not only to her  character developments, but to the picture she paints of the upper middle  class lifestyle of Mexico in the fifties with their easy privilege amid a  restrained carnival atmosphere.  Yet there is never a sense of unreality or  of anything fake or pasted on.  Highsmith doesn't reach for effects nor  does she contrive.  She carries the burden of veracity very well while  giving \\"reality\\" an original twist that is hard to define.<br />Theodore, the  contemplative Protestant is contrasted with Ramón, the fiery Latino  Catholic, both lovers of the same woman who is found murdered as the novel  begins.  I was able to guess who did it fairly early on, although I am not  sure why.  Highsmith produces some red herrings en route to a neatly  packaged conclusion, but plays fair at all times.  Note worthy is the  easy-going, yet savvy police inspector Sauzas.  The tension between the  sin-filled Catholic Ramón, and the nearly agnostic Theodore is nicely  developed and maintained.  The feel of the Mexican hotels and the easy  Mexican lifestyle is vividly rendered while the contrast between the  well-to-do and the poor is presented in a straightforward manner.   Highsmith's plot is well thought out and dove tails nicely with the  resolution of the psychology of her characters.  It's a little slow-going  in the middle but finishes well without any artificiality.	2000-05-10
2491599:US	49786731	R2YUK7RS0SCY1R	0312141238	310744333	The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegations of Sexual Abuse	Books	5	74	109	N	N	Authoritative, courageous, convincing	Loftus is an expert on memory, a research psychologist who has spent a lifetime studying memory and how it works.  She has often appeared as an expert witness in repressed memory cases including the George Franklin case  in San Mateo County in 1990.  The main point she and co-author Ketcham make  in this calm and reasoned book is that so-called repressed memory is a  fraud and its use by clinicians and the courts to imprison people is a  tragedy and a disgrace.<br />Needless to say the repressed memory industry was  not pleased with this finding.  Because she told the truth, they tried to  brand Dr. Loftus as a traitor to the feminist cause.  Industry members who  had been making a nice living conjuring up repressed memories went on the  attack, but she held her ground.  What is amazing in this book is how well  the authors maintain a balanced and fair attitude in the midst of such  attacks.  Loftus even met with Ellen Bass, co-author of the infamous The  Courage To Heal (rightly dubbed The Courage to Hate by its victims) and  managed to keep an even keel and a civil tongue.<br />Loftus makes it clear  that human memories are reconstructions.  They are not accurate in a  scientific sense, nor meant to be.  Memories are reconstructions because  what the tribal mind wants is conformity to what is believed by the tribe  now.  So human memories are intermittently reconstructed to conform to the  \\"truth\\" as the individual under the influence of the tribe sees it at  present.  What happened years ago is important to the tribe only as it  connects to the present, and it is usually the political present that is  important.  Therefore memories need not be factually accurate; it is far  more important that they be politically correct.  To make them politically  correct they must be malleable since the political wisdom changes over  time.<br />The idea of \\"repressed\\" memories fits into this scenario  wonderfully.  The memory is said to be \\"repressed\\" until such time as it is  politically necessary to retrieve it and then it is voodooed up and molded  to fit the current power politics.  It's like the rewriting of history in  Orwell's 1984, or medieval trials by fire or water.  Through the suggestive  and coercive power of therapists (quasi-priests), memories are rewritten to  suit the needs of the therapists, and alas, sometimes the needs of a  district attorney bent on furthering his or her career at any price.  (Janet Reno in her Dade County days is a case in point.)<br />However, the  reason the repressed memory of sexual abuse scenario became such a wide  spread phenomenon in this country was not simply because it gave feminists  power.  That alone would not have done it.  The hysteria was empowered by  financial gain.  Laws in many states were rewritten to restart the statute  of limitations to begin at the time the \\"repressed memories\\" were conjured  up, not when the alleged crimes took place (pp. 173-74).  Now people could  go after their parents many years after the fact, after the parents had  made their retirement egg, and get some of it!  This potential gain  brought in the lawyers.  For the therapists it meant that the therapeutic  sessions on the couch and the group indoctrination sessions could be  dragged on and on until the insurance money ran out.  (The literature shows  just how fast therapists typically dumped their clients when they could no  longer pay.)  Carol Tavris is quoted by the authors on page 220: \\"The  problem is...their effort to create victims-to expand the market that can  then be treated with therapy and self-help books.\\"<br />What backfired on the  male-hating feminists was the realization from their more astute sisters  that this repressed memory/sex crime/satanic abuse scenario just made  victims and incest survivors out of women and effectively continued their  subjugation to the patriarchy.  As Tavris puts it: women were encouraged  \\"to incorporate the language of victimhood and survival into the sole  organizing narrative of their identity....\\" (p. 221)<br />Another fraudulent  aspect of the repressed memory business was the faddish diagnosis of  Multiple Personality Disorder that often went along with the phony  memories, an affliction heretofore almost as rare as hen's teeth.  Therapists cozied up to this once esoteric disorder because it fit in so  well with their theory about why no concrete evidence of satanic ritual  abuse was ever found; i.e., the satanic cults had so thoroughly programmed  their victims that the personalities that experienced the horrors of abuse  were repressed.  Naturally it would take a therapist many hours at  lucrative compensation to conjure up the repressed personalities and all  the horrific \\"memories\\" of abuse.  To make sure they got paid, the  therapists got the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  \\"updated\\" to make the diagnosis of multiple personality disorder \\"real\\" so  the insurance companies keyed to the Manual would have to pay for  treatment.<br />This is a courageous book that bends over backwards to be  fair, yet is uncompromised in its expression of the truth.ole  organizing narrative of their identity....\\" (p. 221)<br />Another fraudulent  aspect of the repressed memory business was the faddish diagnosis of   Multiple Personality Disorder that often went along with the phony  memories, an affliction heretofore almost as rare as hen's teeth.

(Not from  Jockeys.)\\") sometimes miss the mark.  There is also a Western bias in the  text; for example the section on religion doesn't get east of Mecca, and  even the section entitled \\"World\\" is almost exclusively concerned with  sites Western.  The information however, as far as I can tell, is textbook  accurate with one puzzling exception.  On page 219 McLain speculates about  a planet revolving around Alpha Centauri.  He writes: \\"Although the  planet's terrain would probably be similar to earth's continents, islands,  and oceans, the planet would be different in most other ways.\\"  He adds  that \\"Temperatures would be much higher than those on earth and could be  lethal to humans trying to live in the tropical regions.  Life would prefer  the cooler highlands.\\"  Amazing.  How would or could he know this!  More  likely, if the descriptions of actual extra solar planets are to be  believed, a planet revolving around Alpha Centauri (at least any one that  we could become aware of) would be a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, and  any talk of \\"tropical regions\\" or \\"cooler highlands\\" just so much  terra-centered silliness.<br />Some of my favorite bits of knowledge found  here: the amount of gold in Fort Knox; a rather thorough answer to whether  water drains clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on hemisphere; why  Eskimos don't die of scurvy; and what's the world's faster roller coaster.  This is a nice entertainment and an easy read.	2000-05-07

Consequently I was very happy to read here about the possibility of \\"universes\\" beyond ours; or differently put, something beyond the big bang.  I used to speculate about what happened before and beyond the big bang, but  I was told that such speculations were unscientific because by definition  the universe and all of time and space came into being with the big bang.  Like Fred Hoyle, I never liked this theory of the beginning of the  universe, and wished that his steady state model would gain some serious  credence.  It didn't and the evidence for the big bang grew.  Now however,  as Rees makes clear, the perspective and even the terminology has changed.  Many scientists now speculate that our universe (notice we now have an  \\"our\\") may just be a budding off of one \\"universe\\" from perhaps an infinite  potential.<br /><br />One page 158 Rees writes about the universe at the Planck time  (ten to the minus 43 seconds) which is as early as we can get, and  incidentally the universe at that time was as small as anything can get:  \\"At this stupendous density...quantum effects and gravity would both be  important.  What happens when quantum effects shake an entire  universe?\\"<br /><br />Now that is a question!  And the way it is put propels us into  something like a glimpse of the universe at that ultra early stage.  The  Planck time is a constraint on the size of anything including space.  One  of the things that this means is that spacetime is not infinitely  divisible.  Space itself has a quantum-like quality.  Really?<br /><br />On page  24 he is talking about communicating with other intelligent beings: \\"It  would be easy to devise signals that would be incontrovertibly artificial:  for instance, attention could be attracted by a series  1,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29...  These are prime numbers: no natural process  could generate them, but they would be recognized by any culture that was  interested in (and capable of) picking up cosmic radio waves.\\"  Notice how  simply but beautifully put this observation is.<br /><br />On the same page he makes  the point that even though we might get some startling advice from a more  advanced civilization, there is some question about whether we would follow  it, or even if we could benefit from it.  He writes:  \\"Optimists claim that  such signals could convey enlightening messages of such import that they  would enable us to bypass centuries of scientific endeavor and discovery...  But such a gap would be hard to bridge, even within human culture.  Could,  for instance, a short `message from the future' have guided a leading  intellect from an earlier era toward some aspect of modern scientific  knowledge?  Could Newton have been steered from alchemy toward  chemistry...?  It would be a daunting challenge to bridge even a few  centuries of human cultural change, essentially because scientific advance  depends on gradual advances of interconnected techniques and  technologies.\\"<br /><br />I was delighted to find on page 161 my favorite \\"Zen koan\\"  question, \\"Why is there anything at all?  Why isn't there nothing?\\" being  asked in a slightly different form by Stephen Hawking: \\"What is it that  breathes fire into the equations?...Why does the Universe go to all the  bother of existing?\\"  In my opinion, it is a question like this that makes  the study of cosmology so compellingly religious.  I stopped being  concerned with the question of whether God exists or not when I realized  how incredibly vast is the known universe that beings superior to us almost  certainly must exist and therefore it would be only a matter of degree to  get to some being approximating the anthropomorphic conception of \\"God.\\"  That there are demigods out there is clear.  That there are demigods who  could pass for God among humans is also clear.  As for a creator or a first  cause, or any sort of nonpersonal \\"God,\\" the Universe itself is sufficient.  So, strangely, I became a deist of sorts.  Still on page 161, Rees makes the very important distinction between the  physicist's vacuum (which is actually a \\"rich construct,\\" including \\"all  the particles and fields described by the equations of physics\\") and the  philosopher's \\"nothing,\\" which really is nothing.  Now that I think about  it, however, maybe that sort of \\"nothing\\" is not even possible, just a  philosopher's construct.<br /><br />Notice that what is wonderful about Rees's book  is how freeing it is instead of confining.  The mind soars.  If his intent  was to communicate to a large audience I believe he has succeeded.  This is  the most informative and readable book on cosmology that I have read in  quite a while.<br /><br />One last speculation: suppose that instead of the  expansion of spacetime, we have the implosion of matter, that is to say,  instead of having the universe expand, we have matter shrink.  Is it  possible to tell the difference?  Although this may seem frivolous, and  perhaps it is, asking such a question has the virtue of engaging the mind,  which is what Rees does in this book.niverse itself is sufficient.

My initial reaction was, this is either a public service or  a hustle.  Written by three different laureled academics and obviously put  together by committee, the earlier book was a big time best seller and  occasioned this sequel.  Most of the diet advice was like something I had  read twenty years ago.  The exercise program ditto.  The use of glucosamine  and chondroitin was the real difference.  In fact, the purpose of the book  could be seen as legitimizing the use of these supplements in the treatment  of osteoarthritis.  People bought the book in the hope that it would help  them with their pain.  They also bought the book so that they would be  motivated to try glucosamine and chondroitin.  Many people understandably  would not try the supplements without the seal of approval provided by an  authoritative book like this.  The question is-and it is the big  question-is their program any good, or is it just another feel good pep  talk fronting for another bogus approach?  I was a little uncertain since  the book jacket was red, white and blue, and we all know the quote about  patriotism being \\"the last refuge of a scoundrel.\\"<br />So I tried  glucosamine and chondroitin and stayed fairly close to their overall  program.  Two years have passed and although I cannot say for certain, it  is my belief that the supplements are valuable.  At any rate, my arthritic  knee is much improved.<br />In the follow-up book, the authors give  information on other treatments.<br />I have to say that I think they've done  a positive service in writing these two books.  The information about  healing in general and about prevention and about the positive effects of  exercise and attitude are worthwhile.  The authors may have made megabucks  (or maybe they didn't), but I don't feel they ripped anybody off, on the  contrary.  I am happy to be positive even though I still think \\"cure\\" is  probably too strong a word for what their program can do, although I only  have my own experience to go on.

Written by three different  laureled academics and obviously put together by committee, this first book  was a big time best seller and demanded a sequel.  Most of the diet advice  was like something I had read twenty years ago.  The exercise program  ditto.  The use of glucosamine and chondroitin was the real difference.  In  fact, the purpose of the book could be seen as legitimizing the use of  these supplements in the treatment of osteoarthritis.  People bought the  book in the hope that it would help them with their pain.  They also bought  the book so that they would be motivated to try glucosamine and  chondroitin.  Many people understandably would not try the supplements  without the seal of approval provided by an authoritative book like this.  The question is-and it is the big question-is their program any good, or is  it just another feel good pep talk fronting for another bogus approach?  I  was a little uncertain since the book jacket was red, white and blue, and  we all know the quote about patriotism being \\"the last refuge of a  scoundrel.\\"<br />So I tried glucosamine and chondroitin and stayed fairly  close to their overall program.  Two years have passed and although I  cannot say for certain, it is my belief that the supplements are valuable.  At any rate, my arthritic knee is much improved.<br />In the follow-up book,  the authors give information on other treatments.<br />I have to say that I  think they've done a positive service in writing these two books.  The  information about healing in general and about prevention and about the  positive effects of exercise and attitude are worthwhile.  The authors may  have made megabucks (or maybe they didn't), but I don't feel they ripped  anybody off, on the contrary.  I am happy to be positive even though I  still think \\"cure\\" is probably too strong a word for what their program can  do, although I only have my own experience to go on.  Their reports of the  double blind tests that have been conducted are good, but a long way from  convincing proof that glucosamine and chrondoitin and exercises can cure  osteoarthritis.ill think \\"cure\\" is probably too strong a word for what their program can  do, although I only have my own experience to go on.

The story reads like a parody of human behavior.  Alexander's narrative, chuck full of detail and precise diction and some wonderful turns of phrase, often spirals into something like a long-running slapstick comedy too  bizarre for television.  The horror of neglect and greed, hatred, prejudice  and violence are all here, but the form they take in this tale is so absurd  sometimes that you have to laugh aloud at the sick antics.<br /><br />The three most  important characters are: Franklin Bradshaw, the miserly patriarch,  apparently murdered by his grandsons at the insistence of his youngest  daughter, Frances, an incredibly depraved creature nobody could have  invented, and Berenice, mother of Frances and husband of Franklin, a  slavish practitioner of \\"smotherly love.\\"  They hail from Utah where  Franklin is a non-practicing Mormon.  He has spent a lifetime of working  sixteen hours a day and has, through his auto parts business and oil and  land leases, amassed a fortune estimated in the hundreds of millions of  (1981) dollars.  Frances and everybody else in the family would like to get  their hands on the money, and each of them is deathly afraid that the  others are scheming to cheat them out of their fair share, and they are.  But Frances, the youngest of the four Bradshaw children, is particularly  evil.  She is the pretty baby of the family that no one could ever say no  to, who always got away with everything as a child and expects that to  continue.  When the world says, \\"Whoa, child, no!\\" she fights back with  every scheme and wile she can muster, committing nearly any and all crimes  imaginable.  She usually gets away with them because she has a quality  about her that prevents anyone from saying no to her, at least anyone in  her family.  She is perhaps as neglectful a mother as one can imagine,  physically beating and mentally torturing her children, using them as pawns  in her wars with her two ex-husbands and her parents and sisters.  She is  an alcoholic, a drug addict, a paranoid schizophrenic, a bigot, a  class-conscious low life, who hates blacks, Jews and poor white trash; a  woman who is as trashy as one can get, yet a woman who manages to  manipulate her mother and father and others so that she always has time to  drink and whore around and send her children to private schools (even as  she pushes them out the door in the morning in their underwear without  breakfast or bath).<br /><br />But enough.  It's a good read, and I have to admire  Alexander's writing ability.  She makes it all very vivid and she does it  with style and grace and without taking up some phony political position or  presenting some shallow psychology.  She sparkles the narrative with  insight and bon mots and never slows down or bores.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"rs with her two ex-husbands and her parents and sisters.

Not being really conversant with the \\"who done it\\" genre, if  indeed that is her genre, I can only compare her to Georges Simenon.  There  is the same intense concentration and a similar interest in the psychology  of people at cross purposes.  She does a fine job with the third-person  introspection of her leading character, Theodore Schiebelhut, a well-to-do  Swiss artist living in Mexico.  There is an unusual feel not only to her  character developments, but to the picture she paints of the upper middle  class lifestyle of Mexico in the fifties with their easy privilege amid a  restrained carnival atmosphere.  Yet there is never a sense of unreality or  of anything fake or pasted on.  Highsmith doesn't reach for effects nor  does she contrive.  She carries the burden of veracity very well while  giving \\"reality\\" an original twist that is hard to define.<br />Theodore, the  contemplative Protestant is contrasted with Ram&oacute;n, the fiery Latino  Catholic, both lovers of the same woman who is found murdered as the novel  begins.  I was able to guess who did it fairly early on, although I am not  sure why.  Highsmith produces some red herrings en route to a neatly  packaged conclusion, but plays fair at all times  Note worthy is the  easy-going, yet savvy police inspector Sauzas.  The tension between the  sin-filled Catholic Ram&oacute;n, and the nearly agnostic Theodore is nicely  developed and maintained.  The feel of the Mexican hotels and the easy  Mexican lifestyle is vividly rendered while the contrast between the  well-to-do and the poor is presented in a straightforward manner.  Highsmith's plot is well thought out and dove tails nicely with the  resolution of the psychology of her characters.  It's a little slow-going  in the middle but finishes well without any artificiality.	2000-05-01

Cunningham is a classic psychopath in the mode of Jeffrey McDonald, but even more  predatory.  He had five or six wives, seven or so kids, made and lost  millions, a complete control freak, charming, macho, handsome, athletic, a  wife beater without a conscience.<br />Exposing characters like this is what  Ann Rule does best, and she's on top of her game here.  The women don't  look so good either, although Rule is always sympathetic.  I couldn't help  but think about all the karmas they created by having and raising  Cunningham's children.  Rule kept saying they were \\"in love\\" as though that  excused their behavior-in love with a psychopath, wanting him and wanting  his children, and even raising his children from previous marriages.  Our  social sense of right and wrong condemns his behavior, but does it applaud  theirs?  In the long run their actions create and nurture psychopaths past  and to come, yet the women couldn't resist him.  They all melted for him  and for his children. Yet he beat and brutalized them.  Their primitive  desire for what they saw as the superior man, the alpha male, was so strong  that they risked death to be possessed by him.  The Sunset Freeway victim,  apparently an otherwise excellent person, \\"upgraded\\" to him and paid the  awful price.  Rule gives no details about the drugs they did and she  considerably downplays the sex graphics as though this were evidence in a  trial and she wasn't allowed to sully the principals.  Ann Rule fans know  this is her style, and perhaps it is best to concentrate on the  essentials.<br />Dead By Sunset is a good read and a disturbing and profoundly  sad story.	2000-04-30
2507945:US	49786731	R33V1QEZTAQ2YR	1565843843	315541622	Who's Afraid of Feminism?: Seeing Through the Backlash	Books	3	3	13	N	N	The omega males are	This is war of course: rad fems vs. omega males.  I am intrigued by how the old Marxist rhetoric has been brought up to date and recycled by the feminist movement.  Capitalism and the old social order are again the enemies.  They are, perhaps, but feminism is not the solution.  If  feminists had control, instead of the underprivileged women being second  class citizens, it would be the omega males.  The human condition would not  improve.  It would be, as The Who phrased it some years ago, \\"The new boss  just like the old boss.\\"<br />The really depressing thing about feminism is  that it's just politics as usual, i.e., more of the same old sorry attempt  to get the upper hand.  Politics is about power.  It is about who gets  what, when, where, how and why, as an old poli sci textbook had it.  Nonetheless, as social criticism, feminism is interesting.  And it is from  this point of view that I found this book worth reading.  The chapter on  pornography and the debate between feminists Paglia and MacKinnon is  interesting.  MacKinnon is a puritanical prude and Paglia a tantric  wanna-be goddess who thinks pornography is freeing.  Pornography does free  males, and that's what some women don't like about it.  They want dependent  males.<br />Also interesting is the argument that the family is a patriarchal  institution that imposes subjugation on women by its very nature.  In a  sense this is right because the main societal purpose of marriage is not to  raise children. (The band and the tribe are capable of that.)  It is to  insure that the alpha males don't end up controlling most of the women,  leaving a large number of men without reproductive chances.  A feminist  might naturally prefer it that way, since then she gets to mate with the  alpha male, which is her heart's desire in the first place.  The problem is  that large-scale societies are unstable if a large percentage of the males  have no reproductive chance.  They will more than just rage against the  alpha-male/harem/matriarchal structure.  They will tear it down and rape  and pillage as they go.  Consequently, we have marriage and the family.  To  some extent it is a fraud and a lie and a patriarchal institution, but  unless we are going back to living in bands, there is no choice.<br />Since  today's sexually disenfranchised males can be controlled by the political  structure so that women have little fear of them, there arises the desire,  as expressed in this book, to get rid of marriage altogether and take one's  chance at mating with the alpha males, and if that doesn't work out, one  can always mate with the beta males, or to hell with it.  Certainly, one  does not have to marry and become a housewife, or in any other way serve an  omega male!  Please.<br />And I agree.  However, women are naturally not  satisfied with that.  What they understandably want is to somehow get rid  of those undesirable males, which has always been one of the purposes of  the war system.  But that system is dying, and with its demise will come  the ascendency of women.  The gender specific qualities of women, being  more social and more political, will catapult women into positions of  power.  That's what men fear.  However it may be that a society without war  in which all those omega males are running around without females will need  some sort of adjustment.  I'm sure the more radical feminists in  semi-conscious alliance with the alpha males will come up with  something...appropriate.  Right now we have nearly two million people in  prison in this country, the overwhelming majority of them omega  males.<br />Another (implicit) issue is the awkwardness the feminist movement  feels in the face of the rise of evolutionary psychology.  The problem  simply is that, with the discoveries of evolutionary psychology, the  feminist sense of moral righteousness as victim is destroyed; and the woman  is seen as an equal partner in the war system of violence and rape.  It was  all so much easier to blame the male for the violence and the other evils  of the war system.  Unfortunately evolutionary psychology gives the lie to  that sophistry.  Women, by their sexual choices, have again and again  preferred, and have chosen, the war-like, the powerful and the violent male  to any nerd.  I personally cannot blame them since it is a strong genetic  preference, just as males cannot help but chose the young and beautiful  over the old and unhealthy.<br />In the final analysis the problem with some  of the essays in this book and with feminism in general is that they're  sexist, relying on a gender-specific definition of being human.  Anyone who  thinks that his or her sexual identify is the most important aspect of self  is a fool.  Those who identify with sexuality or even with the slippery  concept of \\"gender,\\" and take pride in that identification, are primitives.  Sex is a mechanism of the evolutionary system eons older than humans, and  as such is a primitive attribute shared by the most unsophisticated of  creatures.  We all also move our bowels, and that's a wonderful thing to  do, but let's not see that as our finest or defining characteristic.  We  need to identify ourselves as humans or just as living creatures.  To  emphasize sex or gender as an important aspect of self is not only  degrading but delusionary.easier to blame the male for the violence and the other evils  of the war system.

Cullen Davis, warped little rich boy dominated by his incredibly wealthy and megalomanic  father, grows up to inherit most of the fortune and position.  What does he  do with it?  He chases sex kitten type women, showers them with lavish  gifts, and abuses them.<br /><br />Naifeh and Smith raise the true crime genre to  something close to literature here.  We have the usual litany of sickies  and psychopaths, the usual police incompetence, prosecutors who can't  prosecute, etc.  The \\"final justice\\" in the title is somewhat ironic since  multimillionaire Cullen Davis is never found guilty of any of his crimes,  the worst of which was the cold-blooded murder of his wife's 12-year-old  daughter; the least of which, perhaps the killing of her kitten.  The  juries in Texas just would not convict him (although they have put a number  of poor people on death row).  Instead they admired him for his money,  stupidly since he just inherited it.  And before the book is over, he blows  most of it.<br /><br />We get a terrible sense here that people with riches in  positions of power really can get away with murder.  People look up to them  regardless of their crimes.  It helps us to understand how murderers like  Sadaam Hussein and what's his name in Yugoslavia continue in power.  It's  not just that people are afraid of them, they look up to them and find ways  to excuse their crimes.  This is the human tribal mind at work: better our  corrupt and evil leader than theirs, and better a corrupt and evil leader  than no leader at all.  The women in this one come off as particularly  subject to manipulation by power and money, although that was not  necessarily the authors' intent.  They wanted to show just what a sick,  sick man Cullen Davis is, and they succeed in that.  But incidentally they  revealed the women around him, especially his gold-digging wives, as sad,  sad creatures who would be abused and wallow in it for the sake of being  close to all that money and power and maybe getting a little of it.  One  has the sense that they couldn't help themselves.<br /><br />This is a good read  that will rouse your sense of indignation.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Dennis Littrell's True Crime Companion\\"ging wives, as sad,  sad creatures who would be abused and wallow in it for the sake of being  close to all that money and power and maybe getting a little of it.

Also one finds delight in the colorful and descriptive language.  Some examples:<br />Visible matter in the universe as  &quot;just foam on a deep, dark sea.&quot; (p. 96)<br />Dawkins as  &quot;Darwin's greyhound&quot; (cf. Huxley as his &quot;bulldog&quot;) on  page 116.<br />This exchange on page 125:  &quot;What's beyond the brick  wall?&quot; &quot;But that's Cartesian space, and even if space is curved  you still can't help thinking what's beyond the curve, even if that's not  the right way of thinking about it.&quot;<br />My sentiments exactly! and  something I've felt for many years.  I used to hate it when I was told that  there was nothing \\"as a matter of definition\\" beyond the universe as  defined in the Big Bang model, and advised to stop thinking in terms of  something beyond!<br />Useful as a Zen koan is Horgan's question on page 247,  &quot;What would we do if we could do anything?&quot;  Ditto for &quot;What  will mind chose to do when it informs and controls the universe?&quot;  (from Freeman Dyson on p. 254).  Also appearing in this book is the  question (my formulation), \\"Why is there anything at all; why isn't there  nothing?\\"  This question also appears in other books, for example, Edward  O. Wilson's On Human Nature and John Taylor's When the Clock Struck Zero.  I mention it because it is my favorite \\"Zen koan\\" kind of question.  I  first stumbled across it as a teenager, and experienced an instant  enlightenment.  It seemed to me that by being able to pose such a question  I had proven the existence of God..  Not the sort of God Horgan talks about  who is afraid of death.  No this God was more like the God of the Vedas  about which nothing can be said.  I don't mean &quot;proven&quot; in the  scientific sense or even in a sense that would necessarily be meaningful  for anyone else.  I suspect my experience was similar to that of Descartes  when he thought he had proven that he existed when he said, ergo cognito  sum.  Of course he had proven nothing since to say &quot;I think&quot; is  to assume a thinker, linguistically speaking, at any rate.<br />I like  Horgan's idea of \\"ironic science\\" and I'm amazed that he could get a whole  book out of the idea of \\"the end of science,\\" since the end of science is  just another way of saying the end of human knowledge or the limits of our  ability to know or to explore.<br />A nice bit of self-revelation at the end  is Horgan's speculations on that God who created the world as a puzzle to  &quot;shield himself from his terrible solitude and fear of death.&quot;  That was sporting of Horgan since now his critics will be able to accuse  him of anthropomorphizing God as is done in some very familiar  religions.<br />Anyway this is an excellent book and I enjoyed reading it and  I recommend it highly.anyone else.

Feynman's engaging and modest style can be clearly seen, but the lectures do not translate well onto the printed page.  He rambles and makes a number of minor points, the  most important of which is that things are uncertain.  He goes after the  Soviets, faith healers and mind readers, politicians, etc. in a relaxed and  extremely modest style.  He equivocates a lot, but that is his point about  uncertainty.  He even makes it clear that he doesn't know whether continued  testing of nuclear weapons is or is not a good idea.  I was very  disappointed, considering Feynman's reputation as about the most brilliant  man extant, and I suspect were Feynman still alive (he died in 1988) he  would not have allowed this book to be published.  It is dated and  mediocre.  What works with a lecture group may not work so well in a book,  and it doesn't here.  This is the political Feynman, not the physicist.  Still it's nice to know (I guess) that a brilliant man can sound so  ordinary.  It just goes to show that no matter how brilliant and  accomplished someone may be in his own field, it doesn't necessarily mean  he is an expert in another.	2000-04-25

The  greed and money lust and the pathetic macho posturing of the derivatives  sales people fascinated.  The stupidity of the bankers, insurance fund  managers, etc. who bought the risky and complicated derivatives concocted  by the Morgan Stanley people, amazed.  Partnoy himself comes across as  someone who went along with the program until it got just a little too ugly  and then got out.  I suspect there is another side to this story.	2000-04-25

Full of details about all sorts of Fischer tantrums, negotiations, etc., but somehow the real Fischer is absent.  Noteworthy is Brady's refusal to write a single word about  Fischer's sex life or lack thereof.  Brady outlines his career from age six  to the end of the World Championship match with Spassky in 1972.  One gets  the sense that Fischer was unconsciously a master of the psychology of  intimidation, but gradually became more of a paranoid  schizophrenic.  As  the book ends and Fischer has secured the world title, the reader can see  he is about to leave the world of the sane.  Also absent was any  explanation, or quotes from Fischer on why he embraced the fundamentalist  World Wide Church of God faith and dumped his nominal Jewish identity.  I  mean, does Fischer pray to a personal God?  Does he actually believe in  hell fire, etc.?  Brady gives no hint.  The details about Fischer's  incredible work ethic and maniacal devotion to the game, however, help us  to see how he became at the time the greatest chess player in the history  of the game.  Also good were the many glimpses of the chess players and  personalities of the times, including Evans, Cramer, Edmunson, Reschevsky,  Petrosian, Tal, Spassky, and others.<br />The other thing that Brady is mum on  is Fischer's famous prejudices.  Brady spares us Fischer's anti-Semitism,  etc.  There are almost no quotes of Fischer's famous stupidities.  When  Brady talks about the article in Harper's Magazine by Ralph Ginzburg in  1961 he says that &quot;Bobby is depicted as a monster of egotism, scornful  of everything outside himself and the game&quot; who has a &quot;hopeless  vulgarity.&quot;  But Brady quotes nary a word to show us what Fischer  supposedly said.  I guess the real problem with Brady's biography of  Fischer (&quot;profile&quot;) is that he was tiptoeing around Fischer's  prejudices as though afraid to offend him, as though it was essential to  stay in his good graces.  Brady writes that when Fischer was displeased  with anyone, he just cut them out of his life completely and ruthlessly.  I  think Brady was trying to write a true biography while staying within  Fischer's good graces, an impossible task.<br />The guy who should write a  Fischer biography is Grandmaster Larry Evans who knew him very well, who  played at Fischer's level, and a man who was instrumental in helping  Fischer achieve the success he did.  Without the patience, understanding  and guidance of Larry Evans it is likely that Fischer would have gone off  the deep end long before he began, let alone finished, the historical match  with Boris Spassky.in his good graces.

There are quaint stories from the eighteenth century, studious articles  from the nineteenth, and modern selections from such twentieth century  experts as Edward O. Wilson, Roger B. Swain. Karl von Frisch, May  Berenbaum, Harold Oldroyd and others.  Charles Darwin is represented,  Aristotle, Alfred Russel Wallace, Thoreau, even the Bible makes an  appearance.  There are selections from a novella, A.S. Byatt's \\"Morpho  Eugenia\\"; poems, Wordsworth's \\"To a Butterfly,\\" Robert Burns's \\"To a  Louse\\"; and even a bit of a movie, THEM! (1954).  Obviously, editors, Hoyt  and Schultz are as intent at entertaining as informing.  You'll find dozens  of different insects here, from house flies and ants to dung beetles and  glow-worms to ticks, wasps, silverfish, etc.  Each selection is presented  with a short note from the editors and followed by a bibliographical entry.  There is an index of authors and one of subjects.  The selections are  collected under various heading, e.g., \\"Insects Praised,\\" \\"Insects  Reviled,\\" \\"Insect Architecture,\\" etc.  The sheer breath of insect behavior  presented here is unnerving: How multifarious are the realities of life!  Noteworthy is the meticulous care taken with the editing and proofreading.  This is a good and strange read.	2000-04-22

He loves beauty in design and thinks that much of  our modern artifacts or machines are needlessly ugly.  He likes his old  1938 Emerson radio as a work of art.  He likes the MacIntosh desktop as a  thing of beauty, contrasted with the ugliness of DOS.  He will not go  further than to once mention Microsoft's Windows.  He thinks that really  good software is beautiful; in fact it is good because it is beautiful.  He  has an idea for what he calls \\"Streamlines,\\" a way of interfacing with  computer and the Internet that he finds elegant.  He puts a high value on  elegance in technology.<br />Gelernter also has a sharp and incisive mind.  Consider this quote on the nature of consciousness found on page 23.  He is  talking about computers and brains, debunking the notion that a brain is an  \\"information processor\\" like a computer.  He writes: \\"...the brain is no  mere information processor, it is a meaning creator-and meaning creation is  a trick no computer can accomplish.  The brain is a lump of hardware  artfully arranged so as to produce an I-to create the illusion that some  entity inside you is observing the world that your senses conjure up.  That  rose over there merely triggered, when you saw it, a barrage of neuron  firings in your brain.  But you have the sensation that some entity-namely,  you, not to put too fine a point on it-actually saw the rose.  Computers,  so far as we can tell, are capable of no such trick.\\"  Nicely put!<br />This  is an original and delightful book that might be compared favorably to the  work of Henry Petroski who wrote the much admired  The Pencil: a History of  Design and Circumstance (1990).	2000-04-20

Books	5	4	5	N	N	Fine update	Probably not any time soon but, as this very readable volume insists, we  sure ought to try.  Messrs. Clark explore the Search for Extraterrestrial  Intelligence as completely as any book I've read, from rocketry to  genetics, and they do it with a calm rationality that inspires confidence  and credence.<br />The book is organized around what they consider the three  big questions of ETI: The \\"SETI Question,\\" the \\"McCrea Question,\\" and the  \\"Fermi Question.\\"  The SETI question from the Drake equation asks, if ETI  is common in the galaxy, why haven't we detected signals from them?  The  McCrea query from astronomer Sir William McCrea, who asked it of the  authors, posits, if elementary life forms are common, what is the chance  that creatures like humans will evolve?  The famous Fermi quip is, if they  are there, why aren't they here?  The authors explore these questions in  light of the latest knowledge and speculation.  The answers they come to  are similar to those found in the classic Extraterrestrials: Where Are  They? edited by Ben Zuckerman and Michael H. Hart, namely that there are  many reasons we haven't heard from them, from they don't care to  communicate, to their civilizations are short-lived, to creatures like  humans are very rare, etc.<br />The authors make a couple of important points  I don't recall in other SETI books.  The first is obvious once mentioned,  namely that a communicating ETI must have more than just intelligence.  It  must have dexterity.  \\"[H]ighly evolved dolphins with the intellect of  Frank Drake are not going to build radio telescopes to search out ETI,\\" is  the way the authors put it on page 92.<br />The second point is that science  should not abandon \\"ufology\\" because it is now mostly in the hands of  pseudoscience and the tabloid mind; instead the methods of science should  be applied to UFOs as elsewhere; this despite the fact that it is pretty  well realized that alien visits are highly unlikely.  I might add that  keeping a scientific eye on UFOs is valuable because if aliens ever do  visit we may need the most acute and discerning instruments, experience,  and intelligence to even notice them.  My suspicion is that ETI may be so  much different from us that we wouldn't recognize it if it sat down next to  us!  This is an up to date report that  manages to be accessible to a wide audience without any dumbing-down.  It  includes a glossary, a short bibliography and some web sites.  But books on  SETI are like computers.  Because of the rapid pace of technological and  scientific advancements, we must have a new one every three years or so.  I'm already looking forward to the next.g a scientific eye on UFOs is valuable because if aliens ever do  visit we may need the most acute and discerning instruments, experience,  and intelligence to even notice them.

It's not  that the ageing of individuals is good for the species.  That's a fallacy,  although it works that way.  And it is not because of limited cell  division.  That too is an effect.  Rather it is because evolution does not  support system maintenance past the age of reproduction.  In other words  (this is a slippery, but nonetheless cogent and persuasive argument) no  gene that either maintains the system or tears down the system or even just  leaves the system as it is past reproductive age is selected.  None are  selected.  All post-reproductive age mechanisms are instead randomly  selected; that is, selected by accident.  Since there is the second law of  thermodynamics, or entropy, a random system will just run down.  It will go  to chaos; and for our bodies, that means breakdown.  Simple as  that.<br />Still, the question remains, why don't we continue to reproduce as  we grow older?  Or, why isn't our reproductive age unlimited?  The answer  is subtle: such a system wouldn't work because it would be static and  couldn't change with the environment.  The old reproducers would, through  the strength of their experience and position, control reproduction and  naturally work against change.  Consequently, they would drift away from  their changing environment and become less fit.  Also, the faster an  environment changes the faster the species must adjust; therefore,  reproduction at an earlier and earlier age would be selected for,  consistent with the ability to gain subsistence.  As is noted here and  elsewhere, it is a melancholy fact that we age and die because of  sexuality.  Sexual reproduction only works if the young have a better  chance at reproducing than the old.  It should be realized that someone a  generation younger is, paradoxically, a generation older in terms of  genetic experience.  The gene pool has mixed one more time.  The young can  only have the advantage if the experienced and powerful get old, weak and  die.  And so we do.ould be realized that someone a  generation younger is, paradoxically, a generation older in terms of  genetic experience.  The gene pool has mixed one more time.  The young can  only have the advantage if the experienced and powerful get old, weak and  die.  And so we do.	2000-04-18

What he does add is that  \\"to most people\\" this is \\"a really surprising concept.\\"  I think Crick is a  little out of touch because it's not surprising to me or to any number of  people I know.  His view, along with my addendum, is generally considered  the standard \\"no ghost in the machine\\" view of  consciousness.<br /><br />Consciousness, then, is what this book is really about.  The \\"soul\\" in the title is meant tongue in cheek, or ironically since the  idea of a soul is not amenable to scientific inquiry.  Crick thinks that  the best way to understand consciousness is first to understand, at the  cellular/chemical level, how the brain works.  He proposes to make an  attack on this (he likes the military metaphor) through a study of how the  brain \\"sees.\\"  Consequently he presents a number of optical illusions, some  of which I hadn't seen before.  He believes it is \\"hopeless to try to solve  the problems of consciousness by general philosophical arguments...\\" (p.  19).  He uses the terms \\"awareness\\" and \\"consciousness\\" \\"more or less  interchangeably\\" (p. 10) which I think is good since it takes the aura of  awe off the pumpkin, so to speak.  Crick is not a dualist who believes  there is a \\"mind\\" independent of the neurons.<br /><br />Of course, from my point of  view there is indeed a \\"mind\\" independent of the nerve cells; this \\"mind\\"  however is an abstract construct consisting of thoughts, ideas,  experiences, however vaguely and inaccurately recalled, hopes and dreams,  etc.  It exists \\"nowhere\\" and of course everywhere.  It exists before time  and after time.  It is not matter or energy but information written not on  the wind nor on the ether, but on the vacuum of time and space.  It cannot  be accessed by anyone, although I personally can access some of my own  mind, again however incompletely.  I like to think of this \\"mind\\" as the  rationalist's soul  It is information, period.<br /><br />Now it may be that there  is an intelligence or intelligences elsewhere in the universe with the  power to access such information and to reconstruct it in some sense,  perhaps able even to reconstruct the matter and energy that developed it!  However this is just the sort of fanciful speculation that Crick wants to  get away from.<br /><br />Even before he wrote this not very readable and somewhat  opaque book, there have appeared a number of excellent books on  consciousness discussing what Crick thinks is the astonishing hypothesis,  especially books that see consciousness as a sort of illusion developed by  the evolutionary mechanism.  Two very readable ones are David Darling's Zen  Physics (1996) and Tor Norretranders' The User Illusion: Cutting  Consciousness Down to Size (1991;1998).<br /><br />Incidentally, this is the same  Francis Crick, who in the early fifties, along with James D.

Deborah Blum strove for objectivity and empathy, understanding and identification,  and she achieved it.  In so far as a true crime story can be a work of art,  this is one.<br /><br />The setting is Berkeley 1969, Telegraph Avenue and People's  Park, etc. recalled with vivid and nostalgic detail.  The two central  characters, Prosenjit, an Indian exchange student at the university and  Tanya, an American student, begin a flirtation that ends in tragedy.  She  is a sweet, innocent (or nearly innocent) girl who really only deserved to  be loved, but she plays head games and heart games with Prosenjit who loves  her passionately, and he is deeply hurt.  I guess she couldn't know from  her limited experience that in such situations some men can be dangerous.  He is an Untouchable, or at least his grandfather was, and a nerd, and she  lords it over him with her Caucasian beauty so that gradually he becomes  obsessed with her.  She grows uncomfortable with his obsession and wants  him out of her life.  But she calls him back after being dumped by another  guy.  The reader knows, as in a Greek tragedy, that this calling Prosenjit  back reveals her fatal flaw.<br /><br />Blum includes some photos of Tanya and some  of Prosenji and his village in India.  Her father is a jealous and  controlling alcoholic, a Russian by birth who snoops around her room  looking for evidence of liaisons and follows her about and forbids her to  date although she is in college.  She is a bright pretty girl who lacks in  confidence.  Prosenjit is a genius or nearly so, who has risen from his  lowly birth to be one of the most promising of his generation in India.  Interesting is his friend Jal Mehta, a Parsi Indian who knows Prosenjit  from school in India and believes in his genius and tries to help him.  Jal  is confident and charming, articulate and wise in the ways of the world,  but Prosenjit is jealous of him and cannot accept his help.<br /><br />At some point  Prosenjit begins to threaten violence, but Tanya continues to taunt him.  She gets some satisfaction out of his obsessive love for her, but she hates  him because he is such a nerd, and she despises his fawning behavior.  Nonetheless, she comes to his room a couple of times a week and lords it  over him.  He secretly tape everything, and when she is gone he listens to  the tapes over and over again, looking for some sign that she really loves  him.  He even splices some words together so that he has her saying \\"I  love you.\\"  She rewards him sometimes with a tongue kiss on the mouth.  Prosenjit, who is a prudish Victorian Indian, is both thrilled and  shocked.<br /><br />This is an excellent portrait of obsession.  The clear  compliancy of Tanya is notable.  It suggests not just carelessness or an  adolescent meanness, but something sadder, perhaps a self-destructive wish.  Of course we feel sorry for her.  We are led to feel sorry for both of  them, just as we felt sorry for Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />Incidentally Tanya's  parents eventually sued UC  Berkeley, the shrinks in particular, for not  warning them that their daughter was in danger.  They won a landmark case  that makes it mandatory for mental health care workers to warn potential  victims if they think their client is dangerous.e world,  but Prosenjit is jealous of him and cannot accept his help.

2532115:US	49786731	R3A93SLZ9YZFIQ	0553375067	559651636	Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ	Books	3	506	642	N	N	Not exactly what it appears to be	There is a lot to admire here and I enjoyed returning to a genre (popular psychology) that I left many years ago.  If my recollection is correct, Goleman's book is a step beyond such \\"classics\\" as I'm Okay, You're  Okay..., etc., particularly in terms of scholarship.  I liked the way he  took the medical profession to task for its lack of empathy and its failure  to provide emotional support for patients.  He does not however address the  cause, which is the desire of the AMA and its members to maintain the  exclusivity and high economic status of the profession.  I loved the  affection Goleman showed for the children learning to be social.<br /><br />However  I don't think the book is about emotional so much as social intelligence,  and perhaps that is entirely to the good since social intelligence is a  fundamental human need, and certainly for most people it is easier to learn  social skills than it is to discard negative emotions and achieve positive  ones.  Most of the book is about how to behave effectively in society, how  to make adjustments in marriage, on the job, with peers, at school, etc.  Some space is given to the experiences in childhood that mold us  emotionally (or so it is believed).<br /><br />This is all fine, but I don't think  Goleman makes much of a case for changing emotions as he does for changing  behavior.  Of course, I'm all for that: if you don't feel empathy, at least  fake it!  On page 107 for example he talks about the \\"utter lack of empathy  for their victims\\" by \\"child molesters and other such offenders.\\"  He  describes \\"one of the most promising treatment programs\\" in which \\"the  offenders read heart-wrenching accounts of crimes like their own, told from  the victim's perspective.\\"  The psychologist who developed the program  claims that the recidivism rate for those who complete the program is half  that of those who did not receive the treatment.  Even if true, it doesn't  follow that these guys learned any empathy.  Most likely they learned more  clever behavior, and of course the people who entered and stayed with the  program are preselected to not return  for any number of reasons, mainly  they're smarter.<br /><br />I have a similar objection to the idea (for example)  that depression leads to increased death and disease.  Certainly the life  expectancy of depressed people is less than that of optimistic people, but  it is not clear whether depression is a cause or a symptom.  And the well  known connection between social isolation and morbidity reported by Goleman  doesn't necessarily mean that social isolation kills, but could mean that  people who want to die, first isolate themselves from society, which is the  way in some cultures-or it could mean something else entirely.<br /><br />I also  object to the general idea that emotions, instruments of the evolutionary  mechanism, can or should be much influenced by society except in  self-defense.  The purpose of many emotions is to drive the individual in a  direction consistent with the needs of the species mechanism regardless of  what society or the individual wants.  The needs, concerns and prejudices  of any given society are relatively ephemeral notions compared to the  evolutionary imperative, and in many cases it's a good thing we have  instincts that override what society wants.<br /><br />Goleman's book is  understandably written from the point of view of the society and as such  puts social concerns first; however I am at that place in my life where I  find the concerns of the individual to be more important.  The (rather  limited) psychological tradition that Goleman is an effective spokesman  for, is not to me as important or as valuable or even as \\"true\\" as the  psychological ideas found in the great religions of the world.<br /><br />One last  very important quibble: nowhere in the book is the most deleterious emotion  mentioned or identified as such.  That emotion is desire.  Goleman,  unaccountably, does not even identify sexual desire!  He lists love in  Appendix A but it is apparent that sexual desire is not part of that  classification (p. 289).  He allows that there are \\"hundreds of emotions.\\"  The fact that he does not recognize desire would be amazing except we know  that his readers would not like to hear about any problems with desire, and  this book is pristinely PC with a clear eye to the marketplace.  Desire is  what keeps the economic machine of the society that he represents going!  As the economists say, goods are limited, but human desires are infinite.  Additionally the secret to avoiding the inevitable pain caused by desire is  not any attempt to fulfill those desires, but to lose the desires.  That  formula would not sit well with his readers nor with his  publishers.<br /><br />Goleman is accomplished and clever.  He went to the best  schools and he has made quite a success of his education.  He is  politically astute, and he may be an expert on emotion, but he should know  that the splashy idea of emotional intelligence is as vague, subjective and  limiting as that of IQ, perhaps more so.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"ntify sexual desire!

Goldman is playing the old saw about thescreenwriter as very well-paid whore.  Be that as it may, this is an excellent book. If you're even thinking of becoming a screenwriter you ought to read it.  You may change your mind, and then again you may not.  You'll learn some screenwriting tricks and get a vivid glimpse inside the industry, circa 1982.<br />Goldman has a style that is as earnest as all heck, emphatic, breezy, engaging, flippant, a little high schoolish-but that plays.  He thinks very highly of himself, but he is also a modest man.  (Reasonable combination.)  He trashes some people here, lionizes some others, but bottom line, he's not afraid to reveal himself, foibles and all.  His two main rules of Hollywood are: NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING and SCREENPLAYS ARE STRUCTURE (his caps).  He means that nobody knows ahead of time what is going to be a successful movie, and it's a mistake to think that screenplays are mainly dialogue (I used to think that) because what really counts is the structure.<br />Part One is about \\"Hollywood Realities\\" and it's the best part of the book: who controls whom and what, the pecking order, etc.  Part Two he calls \\"Adventures\\" and it's about what it was like making some of the movies he was involved in; and remember Goldman wrote some top drawer films: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), All the President's Men (1976), to name a couple.  This part is also very good.  Part Three he calls \\"Da Vinci\\" from the title of a short story he wrote as a young man that he turns into a screen play for the edification of his readers.  The story is a dog and the screenplay not very readable, but it's good textbook stuff.  A highlight is George Roy Hill's acidic comments on the script.  I give Goldman credit for including that and I also give him credit for telling it like it is from his POV.  He's one very professional, very hard-working writer with a fine understanding of movie psychology, somebody well worth listening to.  ENDof movie psychology, somebody well worth listening to.

She shows how  harvester ants perform four kinds of work, foraging, patrolling, nest  maintenance, and midden work (feeding the refuse pile).  She gives details  from her experiments in the Arizona desert where she studied harvester ant  colonies for seventeen summers.<br />The fascinating thing about ants is that  they are able to organize and accomplish their work without a central  authority telling them what to do.  Gordon's main purpose is to understand  how they do this.  She shows that pheromone messages and contacts among  individual ants lead to a kind of group knowledge that is reflected in  individual behavior.  Each ant makes its own choice about what to do at any  given time based on clues it gets from its environment, either its nest  mates, the weather, or other changing circumstances, or from contacts with  ants from other colonies.  She shows that the life cycle of a colony and  its overall behavior can be seen as that of an organism composed of  individuals analogous (but without central management) to an animal made up  of individual cells.  The colony has a life span, and during that span  behaves differently depending upon its age.  Because disrupting the  underground nests of the ants would alter their behavior, we don't get a  very clear picture of how the nest appears.  Gordon implies that nests  maintained in labs are not the same thing.  She makes it clear that such  ants also behave differently than ants in a natural setting.<br />This is a  fine book.  My only quibble would be to say that I would like to read a  book on ants with a wider focus, especially on the Argentine ants that  dominate the urban environment here in southern California.  Additionally  it would be nice to know how the organization of harvester ant society  compares and contrasts with that of other species.ontrasts with that of other species.	2000-04-13

Ditto evolution, I might add.<br />This is an excellent book, perhaps the best I've read on the  title subject.  An interesting point made on page 77 is that there is a  conflict of goals between management and shareholders.  Shareholders want  the stock to go up in value, period.  Managers on the other hand are  interested in \\"prestige, control of markets, and other objectives.\\"  The  other objectives that Siegel is too polite to mention include maximizing  their power and control and increasing the size of their fiefdoms, which is  one reason managers must be periodically tossed.<br />The \\"long run\\" is  perhaps an ambiguous concept.  For the day trader it is like the life of  some insects, a day.  For \\"buy and hold\\" strategists it can be decades.  This book conceives of the long run in the latter sense.  It has been said,  of course, that in the long run we are all dead.	2000-04-10

The new plague is \\"mad cow disease\\" which includes various transmissible spongiform encephalopathic diseases most notably kuru from New Guinea, a disease of the brain of not clear cause spread by eating human brains, which the women and children of a New Guinea  tribe did ritualistically until sometime in the late fifties or early  sixties.  The men did not partake.<br /><br />This strange set of diseases produces holes in brain tissue and inevitably leads to death. It is caused by a protein that is just a little off from what it should be, called a prion that replicates itself by changing existing brain protein cells, making them slightly different, therefore useless. There is apparently no virus, etc., just a kind of copying error that is  replicated once it starts.  It is transmitted by eating animal tissue,  especially brain tissue that has miss-replicated.  It is scary and ugly and  makes me not want to eat meat.  The mad cow disease in Europe from U.K.  beef was the result of cattle being fed feed that contained animal parts, in particular animal brains.  Pass the asparagus, please.	2000-04-08

Humes loves to go after town hall, and we can thank him for that.  Biloxi, Mississippi, corrupt, decadent, stupid, \\"a sewerage\\" as one of its citizens  called it, is put on trial here and found quite guilty.  One of the most  remarkable things about this book is the account of the scam against gay  men conducted from Angola prison by Kirksey Nix and other criminals.  They  made hundreds of thousands of dollars with just telephone calls.  Unlike  most of the true crime books I have been reading, the characters here are  hardened professional criminals, true hit men, etc.  The stupid, greedy,  sick characters of the other stories are here represented by a couple of  corrupt lawyers, Halat and Sherry, the former, also a one-time mayor of  Biloxi and the latter, one of the murder victims.

The lie constantly to themselves and those around them.  Their behavior is duplicitous and blind, within insight.  They use each other and in turn are used.  They make a big deal of going to church but have the spiritual sensitivity of hyenas. They do volunteer work for charity but rob each other and society every chance they get.  They have the sexual behavior of gutter trash. They do drugs, drink themselves into stupors, and kill one another. And I wonder, am I like that too, except that the circumstances of my life are different?  Had I been in their circumstances would I have resembled them?<br />And the answer is, who knows?<br />The scene is the Park Circle section of Dallas where everybody has lots of money.  The principals are Harvard design school graduates, but any difference between them and your standard USC grad is not noticeable.  The husband either poisons the wife or she poisons herself.  The court found him guilty.  She's something of a nut case, wallowing in the narco-guilt of a sister-brother incestuous relationship when she was eleven and Bill Jr.  was thirteen.  Her husband, Richard, a sexual addict (according to her) has a steamy affair with a shallow blonde. Her father has mass bucks and is called \\"Big Daddy\\" although he's a bantam of only five-seven.  He uses his money to control his family, but of course it all backfires.  Bill Jr.  takes the cocaine/alcohol cure at the Sierra Tuscon drying out farm and then Richard attends briefly for both sexual addiction and alcoholism, both sent with Big Daddy's money.  Nancy, the wife, is semi-frigid, but does get it on at strategic times, enough to be pregnant five times (two miscarriages and an abortion, two kids).  Reading between the lines, one might guess that she is a semi-conscious furtive tease. They all abuse one another in various ways.  Would I have done the same thing?<br />You know, I think (a) I wouldn't have had the energy and (b) I would rather stay home and read a book, any book.  The above was written after reading about half the book.  It is amazing how good this book was near the end!  Which only goes to show, it's the material that counts.  I think Gray was padding it out a little. The truly amazing thing is how inadequate at getting the truth is our legal system.  It's a statement about human kind: truth really is just a word: what counts is social, political and economic power.  Or should I say forensic truth is a secondary consideration.<br />Poisoned Dreams is written in a quick and slightly dirty style that suggests that Gray believes the dictum from literary agent Evan Fogelman, quoted on page 270, that good writing doesn't count for as much today as it once did.  Yet, I wouldn't call this bad, or anything of the sort.  What really works for Gray is the story, and he does deliver that.  Furthermore, he presents both sides, which is something he believes in, and he keeps us guessing until past the end.  So nice job, but perhaps a little seasoning, a little polishing, and a little editing would have made this an outstanding piece of work.have done the same thing?<br />You know, I think (a) I wouldn't have had the energy and (b) I would rather stay home and read a book, any book.

It is so complex and so full of characters that it is like several stories.  I am struck again at how  stupid people are and at how they seem so desperate for any sort of  excitement.  Adultery seems to be the biggest thrill here.  Additionally, I  see that so many of the people doing harm to others have sociopathic  perhaps this is just an impression.  I won't detail any of the story here  because it is too complex and I would only be giving a part of it.  Like  some other juicy true crime tales (see A.W. Gray's Poisoned Dreams (1993),  for example) this takes place in and around Dallas, Texas.  The characters  are not quite as stupid as the ones in Gray's book, and the writing is  better.<br />It interesting how these \\"true stories\\" all seem to run  together in my mind.  The characters are shallow sociopaths, doing drugs,  committing adultery willy-nilly, hustling money, flashing status and  spending conspicuously.  That's it.  That's their lives.  It's kind of like  a burlesque of normal human behavior.  That's all, just more extreme.  It's  really a crack-up at how the authors always say the women are beautiful,  and all the losers had everything life could offer and a bright future in  front of them before they went down hill.  The women, however, judging from  their photos, which typically come in a ten page or so spread in the middle  of the book, are not \\"beautiful.\\"  They often have dyed blond hair and  expensive clothes, etc., but I sure as hell would not find them attractive.  The central murderess of this one is Joy Ayler, said to be beautiful, but  just one look at her photo and I can tell that she is someone desperately  trying to appear attractive.  I can tell she would be a nightmare as a  mate.  Her slutty-looking younger sister would be better.  And the guys are  all macho types flashing the usual big man, big deal personalities, trying  to hustle as much of everything in this world as possible, sex, money,  drugs, experiences, status, etc.  And how they pretend such tender  emotions; how much they love their children, etc.  They think.  They  actually believe they love their children, but their behavior suggests  otherwise as they destroy their lives, and the lives of those around them.<br />Stowers begins very well, keeping us in doubt about who is really guilty  a medical doctor; or her boyfriend, a building contractor.  He writes the  story from a police POV with Dallas police detective Morris McGowan as the  hero.  Stowers does such a good job of getting us to identify with McGowan  that I saw for a moment just how difficult it must be to be a cop, and how  easy it is to screw up an investigation, since they are so so difficult to  pursue.  And for that, Stowers is to be commended.  The latter half of the  book is less well-focused, scattered as it is among so many personalties,  but still well done.  By the way, this Joy Aylor is another female  sociopath, a merciless killer without conscious.<br />What separates me and  most people from these true crime story creatures?  They live faster and  they take more chances, yes.  They are more superficial and their values  are shallow, yes.  But I think the main thing is their insatiable desire  for the things of this world.  Of course I am speaking now as a  fifty-year-old man.  When I was younger, perhaps I would have said they  were just stupid.  But in the final analysis (an analysis well beyond my  ken) it may be just a question of a difference in brain chemistry or an  hormonal imbalance.

2548033:US	49786731	R1NBXKG8Z0RC0W	0060173521	156971610	Zen Physics: The Science of Death, the Logic of Reincarnation	Books	5	27	28	N	Y	Infectious ideas: consciousness and the illusion of death	In this exciting book David Darling makes a number of startling observations, most notably that it is our ego-sense or our \\"consciousness\\" that makes us afraid of death. On page 104 Darling writes,  \\"the prime  biological function of the self is to be afraid of death.\\"  This is an  ancient idea straight from the Upanishads, incorporated in the Bhagavad  Gita and found in Buddhism as well as in yogic theory and practice.  It is  also an important idea in evolutionary psychology where consciousness or  the sense of the individual self is just a trick of the species mechanism  to make us fear death (among other things).<br />Unlike the scientific  purveyors of evolutionary psychology, Darling sees us surviving death in  another consciousness, although he assures us we will not be aware of our  previous consciousness(es).  He sees consciousness as something we all  share with my consciousness being no different than yours, and in fact, it  is the same thing and so can easily be taken up.  We are \\"reincarnated\\" in  this special sense.  Darling says, on p. 180, \\"It is not a case of you  becoming one person and me becoming someone else in the traditional sense  of transmigrating souls.  We have to see that `being you' is just a general  phenomenon.  There is no actual, objective link that determines who you  will become.  You will not become anyone.  There is just a continuously  experienced condition of you-ness.\\"  In yoga this is maya,  the veil of  illusion that continuously shrouds our perception.<br />Another nice quote is  on page 176:  \\"What the brain really does is to sample extremely narrow  aspects of reality through the senses and then subject these to further  drastic and highly selective reinterpretation.\\"  (See Norretranders's The  User Illusion (1991) for a similar expression.)  Darling's point is that  the brain, as William James said in his famous quote about \\"the doors of  perception,\\" restricts our ability to see the world objectively.  We see  the world only as our system needs to see it to survive.  Or, to quote  Darling, (p. 180) \\"The brain effectively pinches off a little bubble of  introverted awareness and stores and manipulates information relevant  exclusively to the survival needs of the individual so created.\\"  Our sense  of ourselves as individuals is, as the yogis teach, a delusion fostered on  us by the evolutionary mechanism to help us cope with living on this animal  plane.<br />Here's another idea that relates to the subjectivity of our view:  If a spaceship should fall into the sun, we would see it as \\"burning up.\\"  To another consciousness, it might be seen as getting \\"tremendously  excited\\" or \\"wonderfully transformed\\" or to a third consciousness, even  \\"securing a place in the sun\\" so that it might be launched into space when  the sun explodes, reproducing and spreading out.  The whole point is, our  bias and our expectations create our view of what is happening-indeed our  expectations create our universe.<br />Some years ago I was excited with the  idea that my consciousness is eternal, that my ideas will never die even  after the universe has grown cold, nor will the unique organization of my  brain cells and the pattern of their connections ever die, since it is the  information they contain that is really \\"alive.\\"  Theoretically, I could be  reconstructed and return, perhaps in a hundred billion years.  Of course,  that suggests the question, would I want to? and begs the observation, So  what? since it is natural to feel that my \\"consciousness\\" (a kind of ghost  in the machine) would not survive the reconstruction.<br />Darling contends  (p. 175) that \\"consciousness can never be divorced from matter\\" (and  vice-versa) and that the universe and everything in it has both \\"an  objective and a subjective nature.\\"  He adds, \\"`Things' have no reality  independent of their location in experience; they require the intimate  involvement of mind to be given substance.\\"<br />If we only experience  consciousness when \\"alive,\\" we could be dead for billions of years and  alive for a few decades, on and off alternately, and we would only be aware  of being alive.  Sound familiar?  In this sense we are immortal.<br />Although  all this seems to be just playing with words and offering no solace to  those in the thrall of the fear of death, it is not so.  Regard the Gita,  where it is written, we do not die.  Our deaths, like our births and like  our sense of self are very powerful illusions that only understanding can  dispel.  Darling's book is a very readable effort in that direction.onsciousness when \\"alive,\\" we could be dead for billions of years and  alive for a few decades, on and off alternately, and we would only be aware  of being alive.

Farrell's Studs Lonigan comes to mind) that I thought was dead.  The first  person narration by the central character, Paula Spencer, is painfully  real.  It's hard not to identify with her.  She seems trapped by her  poverty and lack of education and her attraction to the wrong kind of man.  I found Doyle's treatment of this all too familiar scenario interesting,  especially as we see her many years later, but somewhat one-sided.  The  Irish terms and the lower middle class venue enlivened the narrative and  Doyle has a fine eye for sexual and social detail.  Nonetheless the tale is  dreary in an all too familiar way and his obvious pandering to his female  readership is a little embarrassing for a writer as good as he is.  I  suspect that Doyle was torn between attraction to his central male  character, a violent, macho wife beater; but because of his need to be  politically correct with feminism, he was never able to develop his  character beyond the straw man.<br />The clever title on one level is a  euphemism for a batted woman, but on another suggests something deeper, a  blind tropism that the woman couldn't help.  I think Doyle needed to  develop that potential in the character of the husband as well.  For a  novelist the toughest thing often is to tell the psychological truth in  spite of, and in the face of what your readership expects.  Although I have  no sympathy for wife beaters, and certainly none for Doyle's pathetic  wretch, it is not enough to show that the wife is a victim.  The husband is  as well.  And she makes choices.  In the proletariat tradition the cause  was poverty; today it is either the \\"daemonic nature\\" of males or the  values of the patriarchy that lead to the violence.  None of these answers  is the whole story.	2000-04-05

Books	3	5	13	N	N	Exorcizing Daemons	Furhman gets to exorcize some daemons here while playing judge and jury.  He convicts Michael Skakel of the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley,  and that's good since there's little doubt the sick little rich boy did it.  Furhman  also takes the Greenwich police to task for bungling the investigation and  for being afraid to go after anyone in the rich and politically powerful  Skakel family.  He calls them \\"servants of the rich,\\" but of course that's  what cops are.  He says he is the last person in the world to believe the  police would purposely compromise the crime scene, while intimating they  did.  All and all, Furhman looks good here amid the pedestrian prose, and  the Greenwich cops look dumber than, say, LA cops.<br />That Furhman was able  to solve this murder so easily is to illustrate the difference between  knowing who did it, and getting a jury to agree.  The Greenwich cops, after  much indirection and various stupidities, no doubt also figured out that  Michael Skakel had to be the murderer.  By the time they did, however, they  had so completely compromised the investigation that there was no chance  they could get a conviction.  So they never arrested the guy.  Meanwhile,  the Skakel family also figured out that their violent, manic-depressive boy  did it, and they secreted him off to various shrink tanks to keep him out  of trouble and away from the media.<br />The Moxleys seemed incredibly  mild-mannered in a bending over backwards to be fair style as they followed  the fruitless investigation to nowhere.  The father took refuse from the  tragedy in his work until he worked himself to death while the mother  stayed in the background.  Furhman dedicated the book to Martha Moxley and  championed the cause of the Moxley family while doing a fine job of  trashing the Skakels.  He also got in some nice shots at the Kennedys.  Reading between the lines of Furhman's portrait, however, one can see that  Martha should have known better than to truck with the likes of the Skakel  boys.  She played sex games with both of them while having another  boyfriend.  She drank with them and smoked.  She was openly and even  provocatively flirtatious.  She knew she was playing with fire since she  didn't tell her mother she was seeing them, and she had been warned against  seeing them.  Her mother only found out about her activities after her  death.<br />I like this kind of journalism since it embarrasses the guilty,  the compromised, and the incompetent.  Furhman can feel better about  himself after being the main reason O.J. Simpson walked.

The movie was excellent (see my review at IMDb), and this first novel is also very good.  The main difference is in the book the brother-sister incest is  only part of a larger close family bonding.  The youngest son's dressing up  as a girl was down played somewhat in the movie; the house was cleaner in  the movie, and the sensuality between brother and older sister was (of  course) highlighted in the movie.  The movie left out the fact that the  sister's sometime boyfriend was a professional snooker player.  Otherwise  the movie was true fairly to the novel.  Oh, in the book it's clear at the  end that the cops are outside the door, and the boyfriend has dug up the  dead mother.  In the movie, I'm not sure that was revealed.  John Irving  wrote a glowing blurb for the cover. McEwan's first person narrative by the  fifteen-year-old boy is full of sharp observations and self-revelation,  some of it inadvertent, as is the case in the best first person narratives.  A good novel, but a little slight, like a long drawn out short story,  which isn't surprising since McEwan made his reputation as a short story  writer before this novel came out.	2000-04-02

The  author makes the point that the use of addictive drugs is not as bad as  middle America would like to believe. Gray points to studies showing that  people addicted to heroin (for example) can hold down jobs and be  &quot;productive&quot; citizens at a maintenance level, a truth that the  &quot;drug war industry&quot; wants to keep hidden.  However, junkies can't  be productive when they have to hustle and commit crimes to support their  habit.  Hence the so-called war on drugs, which artificially keeps the  price of street drugs high, works to keep users unproductive (not to  mention criminal).<br />Gray also makes the familiar point that this is the  sort of thing that some humans will always do.  Just as a certain  percentage of the population will always be unemployed, a certain  percentage will turn to drug addiction-Prohibition all over again.<br />Less  familiar however is the idea that street drugs and street drug users supply  our society with a target for hate now that the &quot;evil empire&quot; of  communism has largely expired.  Ordinary people can sit around and get  morally worked up about the evil of drugs the way they once got worked up  about the &quot;red menace.&quot;  We might be in for a perpetually divided  society.  If we didn't have the druggies, whom would we hate?<br />More  ominous for the present society though is the possibility that the war on  drugs, by supporting the price of street drugs the way tobacco farmers  would like us to support the price of tobacco, has increased drug use by  making it into a hugely profitable business. Since we are a capitalist  society that celebrates financial success above all else, it is not  surprising that the illegal drug business is seen as glamorous by a  significant percentage of our young people.<br />Even scarier is the very sad  truth that &quot;the war&quot; continues to be &quot;waged&quot; as a means  to support the huge criminal justice bureaucracy that it created!<br />With  this last point in mind, Gray's way out of the mess through the  decriminalization of street drugs isn't likely to happen any time soon.our young people. <br />Even scarier is the very sad  truth that &quot;the war&quot; continues to be &quot;waged&quot; as a means  to support the huge criminal justice bureaucracy that it created!<br />With  this last point in mind, Gray's way out of the mess through the  decriminalization of street drugs isn't likely to happen any time soon.	2000-03-30

The emphasis is on helping the non-mathematical reader understand modern cosmology without the need for math.  While reading this  I had the sense that I was getting closer to visualizing the fifth  dimension, but of course that is only an illusion.<br />Repeated here is the  idea that there is something amazing about the ability of mathematics to  describe the universe.  Mathematics is amazing, no doubt about that, but  our amazement ought to be tempered with the realization that the knowledge  and extent of mathematics has grown along with our knowledge of the  universe around us; and that the mathematics of the Greeks, for example,  would not adequately describe the universe as it is known today.  This  makes me suppose that along with the incredibly vast areas of  the universe  unknown to us, there is also the vast extent of mathematics not yet even  dreamed of by even our best mathematicians.  Something to look forward to.	1999-09-14

The writing is lively and  readable, familiar and even warm.  This lady can cuddle with insects!  The  chapter on ladybugs and how they are captured to be sold to gardeners is  particularly interesting.  However the overall content of the book is a  little less than I was hoping for.  In particular I could have used more  information on the habits of silverfish.<br />What I hope Hubbell focuses on  in her next book is urban insects.  I would especially appreciate a popular  and detailed account of the lives of Argentine ants since they are the ones  that plague us during the hot days of summer in southern California-or of  flour beetles and book beetles and what have you.  And it would be nice to  read a book that identified the myriad of insects that live in and around  contracts with entomologically-based companies that forbid them to disclose  their knowledge of insect behavior for fear of giving away potentially  valuable secrets?!	1999-09-14

Cain wrote history, this is the style he would employ.<br />Hobhouse's terse, unflowered prose moves the narrative along, and he<br />has an an attitude: cynical.  If you liked Marvin Harris and Jared<br />Diamond, and I know you did, you'll like Henry Hobhouse because he has<br />a similar myth-exploding, cant-debasing, and finely tuned BS detector<br />a-working.<br />The five plants are quinine, the potato, sugar cane,<br />cotton, and tea.  He's a little thin on the properties of the plants,<br />but strong on the historical consequences.  His explanation of why<br />slavery died and why it remains a dead institution is excellent.  (NOT<br />because it is immoral, although it is that, but because slavery is<br />inefficient, economically speaking.)  Beware some unusual syntax.	1999-09-13

Books	4	17	19	N	N	The classical and largely skeptical SETI volume, revised	They aren't here, that's for sure-are is it?  Nothing is sure in<br />this wide-ranging collection of essays.  Opinion seems fairly evenly<br />divided: about half say we are probably alone in the galaxy, and the<br />other half say we probably have intelligent neighbors.  Clear to me is<br />that extraterrestrial life is very, very likely, since life itself is<br />probably-as several of the writers in this volume assert-an<br />emergent property of matter and energy.  &quot;Intelligent&quot; or<br />communicating extraterrestrial life is another matter.  The guess here<br />is that it is much less common.<br />Jared Diamond, who writes one of the<br />essays, makes the point that intelligence, as we define it, has<br />evolved here on earth only once, and so the argument from convergent<br />evolution, sometimes advanced to support there being intelligent life<br />elsewhere in the galaxy, is not convincing.  Diamond gives the example<br />of the woodpecker which did not evolve in Australian, nor did any<br />other bird converge sufficiently to assume the woodpecker's niche<br />there.<br />The damnable thing about the arguments both for and against<br />intelligent extraterrestrial life is they are all based on<br />assumptions: if your assumptions differ, your conclusions almost<br />certainly will.<br />Another problem is defining &quot;intelligent&quot;<br />life, or even life itself, for that matter.  One of the writers<br />defines life in terms of matter that goes through a Darwinian<br />evolution, which I guess is the way life is defined these days: seems<br />strangely narrow, but maybe not.  The amazing truth about intelligent<br />life is we may be looking right at it and not recognize it!<br />This<br />is an excellent (although uneven) book that I read at varying degrees<br />of attention: some of it is highly technical, and some is popular.<br />It's revision of the 1982 edition.  The title refers to the quote from<br />Fermi, whose famous opinion about extraterrestrial intelligent life<br />was summed up in the skeptical phrase: \\"Where are they?\\" What he meant<br />was, if they existed they'd be here by now.  This book addresses that<br />argument, mostly in agreement with Fermi.  One authority estimates<br />that humanoid-like beings would have explored the entire galaxy in 60<br />million years.  My question (and the question of others) is WHY would<br />they?  Further I suspect that ETI may not share our psychology, and<br />have no desire to explore at all.  Or may have no need to explore, or<br />may have explored so long ago there is no trace...etc.  One author<br />comes close to the old idea that the stars themselves are<br />&quot;alive&quot; by postulating life forms that live within the stars<br />as &quot;plasmobes.&quot; He even sees possible life on neutron<br />stars.<br />My bottom line belief is that intelligent life evolves into<br />something that we can't recognize as being alive (and, paradoxically,<br />maybe it isn't).  It may be that life is just a primitive step on the<br />way to Becoming; that our consciousness is just a trick of the<br />evolutionary mechanism, and that it is information itself that is<br />alive, and that &quot;real&quot; &quot;intelligence&quot; in the<br />universe is something beyond our kin and beyond our ability to<br />comprehend in the slightest, just as our day-to-day concerns are<br />beyond the comprehension of a bacterium.ey'd be here by now.

Some would say this thin  comedic volume was Nabokov's best novel.  He certainly thought highly of  it, and I agree, it is excellent, but has no where near the scope of  Ada  or Lolita.  Like The Defense from his Russian period, Pnin is almost  deliberately non-commercial, an anti- best seller in subject matter,  treatment and style.  The prose is dense, full of wit and meant for a  careful reading.  With this however Nabokov had had enough of obscurity and  art for art's sake.  His next novel was Lolita.	1999-09-11

Simon's neanderthal offerings, e.g., &quot;multiculturalism&quot; as one of the &quot;Most  Destructive Ideas in Public Life&quot; along with &quot;No-fault  divorce&quot; and &quot;The welfare state,&quot; etc.  His list of  &quot;God's Greatest Gifts to Mankind&quot; includes Jesus Christ, heaven,  the USA and the Bible, no kidding.<br />Initially I thought that Rukeyser had  lost a few I.Q. points, but then I realized that he did include &quot;the  worst&quot; in the title.

It is tightly edited but at first seems rather pedestrian.  There is the pall of gloom  and depression that one would expect from a criminal lawyer's tales of  prosecuting and defending clients in Newark, New Jersey.  Yet as the pages  go by the book gains in power and effect.  It's a dirty business, unfair,  but one that has to be done and in the end one that we are doing as best we  can, perhaps.<br />Seymour is a card-carrying, bleeding-heart liberal who  visited the Soviet Union as a college student in a friendship program in  the sixties, a Jew whose father walked halfway across Eastern Europe to  immigrate to the US, a man who gets a lot of personal satisfaction from  defending the underdogs of society.  One of the surprises in the book is  how much he reveals about himself that is not positive.  Yet he does manage  to bottom line it that he is a good guy.	1999-09-10

I like the way he handles time, as though painting in layers, going back to a point and elaborating on it, coming back to a  &quot;present&quot; and then going back again and again, and then finally  moving forward to the end, although I don't think the last parts of the  book live up to the promise at the beginning.<br /> I have remarked  elsewhere that the book disappoints with its phony PC notions about how Kip  and some others might have reacted to the atomic bombing of the Japanese  cities, the author imagining that Kip would be offended that the bomb was  dropped on &quot;brown people&quot; and not on Europeans; but in truth, few  at the time really comprehended nor cared about anything other than ending  the horror of the worst war in human history.  I was more horrified by the  booby trap bombs left behind by the Germans that Kip had to disarm because  they were left specially to murder people whereas the atomic bombs had at  quickly as possible and with a minimum of lost life.  Would Ondaatje have  wanted to storm the island of Japan?  I don't think so.<br /> But that is  not the novel's only conformance with the current politically correct  climate.  The English Patient, like the preponderence of contemporary  novels focuses on a woman, in this case the nurse Hana, surrounded by  various interesting men, mainly because that is what the market place  requires.  My point is that even the most skillful and accomplished  artists, and Ondaatje is one of them, must conform to the dictates of their  age in commercial terms or not be published at all.<br /> I saw the movie  first and then read the book, something I almost never do, and I was  reminded of a remark by a student of mine who said that she preferred to  read the book first because that way she drew in her mind her own picture  of what the characters were like.  I found myself greatly influenced by the  actress who played Hana (Juliette Binoche), so much so that I did not form  any independent conception of the way Hana appeared in the book.  I think  and the actor's interpretation.<br /> Good book, but not the masterpiece I  had hoped for.y independent conception of the way Hana appeared in the book.

Written by a clinical psychologist who is a director of the False Memory  Foundation, this book shows in detail how social workers, police and the  courts helped to send innocent people to jail.  In particular the  indoctrination of the children is presented, step by ugly step, leaving no  doubt about what really happened.  A sad, sad chapter in American history  gets another documentation.  I am hoping that next we will have books on  just why so many &quot;well-meaning&quot; people went astray and/or were  led astray.  I think the underlying guilt of parents with latch-key  children projected onto others is a largely unexplored psychological  factor.  The American puritanical obsession with sex is another.  The  feminazi attack on men as well, of course.  With this book it appears that  the word has finally gotten around and the courts are beginning to throw  out the tainted &quot;evidence&quot; and the counseling profession is  beginning to see the error of its ways.<br />Campbell speaks with authority  since it was his profession, although not him personally, that was a  central part of the insanity.  If the therapists had read the studies from  their own journals they would have known that the sensational  &quot;recovered memories&quot;of sexual abuse could only be highly suspect.  One weakness of the book is Campbell's understandable reluctance to fully  criticize these clinical psychologists.  The truth is, not just some, but a  significant portion of abuse counselors proved to be incompetent, mercenary  and under educated.  The harm done to patients and their families and  friends by the worst of the therapists exceeds in some respects the harm  done through the use of electric shock therapy and frontal lobotomies by  witch doctors of a previous era.	1999-09-10
