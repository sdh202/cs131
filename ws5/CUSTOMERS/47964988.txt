29892:US	47964988	R3AO15IU1W2JSH	0743487869	147055063	The Black Angel: A Thriller	Books	5	51	53	N	N	Myth and Mayhem	The 5th book in the Charlie Parker series, The Black Angel is probably the most ambitious work that author John Connolly has undertaken yet. Lurking behind the seemingly mundane, though by no means less disturbing, murder of a New York prostitute lies a more horrifying tale of evil featuring fallen angels and their insidious spread on earth. This is a compelling book that combines the modern day thriller with the dank realm of the myth and supernatural with spine tingling results.  <br /> <br />The story opens with a presentation of the myth that will drive the entire story. This myth involves The Black Angels known as Ashmael and Immael who gloried in the death and destruction that they brought down on the earth in the form of wars, rape and murder. But then Immael was confronted by a Cistercian monk and in the ensuing battle fell into a vast vat of molten silver where he was trapped, cast as a silver statue, and hidden. Ever since, Ashmael his brother has been searching for the map detailing where Immael was held. The map had been separated into fragments and scattered around the world. Should Immael be freed, an unthinkable fury would be unleashed on the world.  <br /> <br />Charlie Parker is a Maine private investigator who is still haunted by the death of his wife and daughter with a guilt that refuses to be diminished. He now has another baby daughter, Sam, and a girlfriend, Rachel, who he loves very much, but the strain of his dangerous job plus his inability to move on in life is taking its toll on their relationship.  <br /> <br />This strain is multiplied when, at his daughter's christening no less, he is caught up in the disappearance and possible murder of Louis' cousin Alice. Louis is Charlie's murderous, gay business partner, an extremely dangerous man from whom Rachel maintains a disapproving distance. Rightly or wrongly, Charlie immediately joins in the search for Alice leaving his girlfriend and daughter at home putting into doubt yet another relationship.  <br /> <br />The book separates into two stories here. The first is the investigation of Alice's disappearance as Charlie, Louis and Louis' partner Angel hit the streets of New York to try to retrace Alice's last known steps. The retribution that Louis is known for will come swiftly and brutally when he founds out the person responsible for any harm that has been done to his cousin. This part of the story is your standard hardboiled thriller filled with street violence, crime and fast-paced action.  <br /> <br />Now enter the Other side of the story. We know that the \\"person\\" behind Alice's murder is a man known as Brightwell, a huge monstrous man with a frightening disregard for human life and an unquenchable need to kill. But more frightening about this man is that he appears to have supernatural powers that he uses to gruesome effect on his victims. Brightwell leads a secret group of people known as \\"Believers\\" who are all on the hunt for the elusive fragments of the missing map. When they track down a piece they go to any lengths to acquire it, with devastating results.  <br /> <br />Their mistake is unintentionally made by drawing Parker and his partners into the mix, although it seems that there will be no stopping Brightwell and his evil plans, even after Brightwell senses that there is something special about Parker, a terrible truth that could go a long way towards explaining his tragic past.  <br /> <br />The Black Angel is a superbly satisfying thriller that delves deeply into mythology, dragging us back to the 15th century with stirring historical stories before taking us to the present and the horrifying evil that has resulted. From European monasteries to grim ossuaries and vast monuments to the dead, talk of apocrypha and the Book of Enoch to the creepy hobbyists who deal in the sale of human bones and the statues from which they are made this is a complex, yet rather creepy book.  <br /> <br />For the fans of the series, there are numerous references to events from earlier books as well as returning characters, heroes and villains alike. While it is obviously aimed at readers who have experienced the earlier books, The Black Angel has such immense scope that it can stand on its own and still provide immense entertainment.  <br /> <br />John Connelly has created a story of enormous depth and has been uncompromising in the amount of detail and research that has gone into the historical references. He has richly drawn his characters filling them in with alarming detail to create some of the most fully-fleshed villains I have ever encountered. He has then thrown a chilling other-worldly aspect over the top of all of this that nastily creeps into nightmares, is vividly descriptive and will stain your imagination for weeks to come.  <br /> <br />At over 500 pages, The Black Angel is long by today's standards, but it is a story that simply flies by as you are lost in the dark underworld of the hunt for the fallen angel. Stout of heart and strong of stomach will devour this supernatural thriller of the highest order.	2005-09-27
30865:US	47964988	RZ7GP9V3LF0D6	0385508611	575990647	Suspect	Books	5	22	24	N	N	Psychologically Brilliant	Michael Robotham's debut novel is a psychological thriller that is deeply involving, running smoothly from the narrative of psychologist Joseph O'Loughlin. Suspect takes us into a dark world of troubled minds and we watch the beginning of the disintegration of a strong family life. This was a book that I found (at the risk of flying straight into overused clich) difficult to put down.  <br /> <br />The story begins in the middle of a tense situation as we are greeted with O'Loughlin sitting on a London rooftop trying to talk down a young suicidal cancer patient. We are immediately given a sense of his capabilities as a psychologist not to mention the hint of roguishness that makes him an endearing character. He seems to have a perfect life with a beautiful wife and daughter and a successful practice. The only dark cloud hanging over the vital 42 year old is that he has been recently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.  <br /> <br />As well as working in his day to day practice, O'Loughlin is the kind of man who gives up his time to counsel prostitutes in ways in which they might be able to work more safely. It's while talking at one of these gatherings that he meets Detective Inspector Vincent Ruiz, who has walked in with a picture of a murdered woman hoping to get her identified by one of the attendees. In the course of their confrontation, Ruiz decides that O'Loughlin's keen eye for detail and professional credits might be useful in providing some insights into the dead woman, so he invites him into the investigation as a consultant.  <br /> <br />The woman had been found in a shallow grave next to a London canal. She has multiple stab wounds over her body, all of them self-inflicted plus many old wounds on her arms and thighs indicating that she was a self-mutilator. Contrary to Ruiz's assumption, O'Loughlin tells him the woman is not a prostitute. He also believes she did not commit suicide but was murdered.  <br /> <br />It's not until after viewing the body that the stunning realisation dawns on Joseph O'Loughlin...he knows who the dead woman is, not only that, he knew her very well because she was once a patient of his. That he didn't immediately tell Ruiz about this makes the detective a little wary.  <br /> <br />Back within his practice, O'Loughlin has been meeting with Bobby Moran, a very disturbed person who has been describing violent dreams and is afraid that these dreams may begin to manifest themselves in his waking life. As the sessions progress, O'Loughlin can't help but notice the similarity in the details of Bobby's ramblings and certain aspects of the murder case that he is helping out on. Could it be possible that he is treating the murderer?  <br /> <br />But Ruiz is collecting evidence and the evidence isn't pointing at Bobby Moran, the evidence is pointing at Joseph O'Loughlin.  <br /> <br />The moment Joseph O'Loughlin goes from consultant to prime suspect is the moment that the story kicks up into a high speed desperate chase along an unpredictable road. O'Loughlin's life is in danger of falling apart, kicked out of his house and now pursued by the police he is left with only one avenue open to him: gather enough evidence to prove his innocence. So he flees to Liverpool, the city in which he once lived, in a lonely bid to sift through past cases hoping that something stands out. What he finds will unearth an unimagined horror that still looms ahead of him.  <br /> <br />This is an immediately engaging story that takes a likable, yet humanly flawed protagonist and then puts him through the emotional wringer. His reactions are wholly realistic and he deals with his problems as any of us would. Equally, Detective Ruiz is alternately measured, disbelieving and aggressive, just as one would expect an overworked homicide detective to be. The two contrasting characters make good foils for one another.  <br /> <br />Suspect moves forward logically as it is told from O'Loughlin's first person perspective. The emotional insights that we gain from this perspective are profound too as we are made privy to his frantic thought processes as each accusation or hurdle is thrust in front of him. Whether it's confusion, fear or delight it feels as though we are living the moment along with him in complete clarity.  <br /> <br />There is a great dependence on coincidence early in the story. But as the coincidences were really beginning to mount up and just as I was thinking that they were getting a bit too unbelievable, it becomes clear that there is a very good reason for the coincidences after all. It's all part of Robotham's diabolically intricate plot that is deviously conceived and then unraveled at a tremendous rate.  <br /> <br />As far as debut novels go, Australia's Michael Robotham has produced a thriller of high class. There is surely the prospect that we are in for some very entertaining reading in the future. Admittedly, I am cheating a little here because I make my last statement with the knowledge that, with his second book, Lost, Robotham took out the 2005 Ned Kelly Award for Best Australian Crime Book. Even more reason to get started on Michael Robotham thrillers.	2005-09-27

Blood Father plunges fully into the twisted psyche of a twisted part of today's society, visiting with the seemingly hopeless plight of the drug addicted kids caught up in the LA street gangs. Peter Craig has given us an absorbing story featuring an estranged father / daughter relationship that has been brought back together in a grim fight for survival.  <br /> <br />I found Blood Father to be a particularly moving story that is a modern day tragedy about a former Hell's Angel who is just putting his life back together after a long stretch in prison and his daughter, a wild child rebel whose addiction to drugs and danger have thrown her into trouble way above her head.  <br /> <br />This character-based story is dominated by Link and Lydia Jane, the father and daughter who have to learn and accept each other as they also try to evade an array of pursuers.  <br /> <br />Link was a member of the Hell's Angels, a biker who lived life on the absolute edge, often through a haze of drugs and alcohol. There can be no doubt, he was a loser on a one way ride to self-destruction and his imprisonment for manslaughter was not only inevitable but also partly his salvation. The other part came before he went to jail when his girlfriend gave birth to a baby girl. She was born very premature and it seemed unlikely that she would survive her first week. She did and Link named her Lydia Jane. Although Link loved her, he and her mother moved apart and he fell into trouble and a long prison stretch.  <br /> <br />Through a series of marriages, Lydia's mother turned herself into a high society woman, part of the rich set leaving her days as a biker's woman well and truly behind her. Lydia however was a rebellious girl who was occasionally abused by her stepfathers and she turned to drugs at a young age. Gradually, she moved in with a smooth talking dealer, unaware just how dangerous he was until she made one mistake too many and had to run.  <br /> <br />When Lydia joins Link they head for open country with the initial fear that the police were after them and then later, the cold realisation hits that someone with a grudge against Lydia was also on their trail. But this seems so much more than a simple grudge, her pursuers leaving behind a frightening trail of devastation leading Link to wonder what she had left behind her and how he was going to protect her.  <br /> <br />Blood Father is a grim story oozing with hopelessness with both father and daughter in desperate need of support with one either picking up the pieces of his life and the other strung out on drugs. They are a couple who are simultaneously fighting their own demons, learning to love and respect each other while distracted by the terrible danger that seems to be a mere step behind them.  <br /> <br />Although the second half of the book steams ahead with the frantic thrill of the chase, the pace is a lot more leisurely at the start with a great deal of groundwork put in place regarding the character backgrounds. I appreciated the background detail finding it gave a greater feeling of depth and understanding for Link and Lydia, not to mention stark insight into the type of people who would be coming after them later.  <br /> <br />Peter Craig has done an outstanding job of creating an extreme situation with a strong leaning towards tremendous violence and has made it seem entirely plausible. He has written a powerful story, filled it with flawed heroes and then has made us care about them. It gets into the dirty cracks of society prising out the greedy, the needy and the vicious who thrive on the blooming drug culture. The focus for us is whether two people will be able to escape from that life unscathed.  <br /> <br />Well-written and provocative, this is an excellent modern noir thriller with relevant themes that are portrayed all too realistically. Because happy endings are never assured in real life, nothing can be taken for granted her either other than the certainty that this book will move you.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-04

For the police and the D.A. it looks as though luck is on their side with any number of pieces of evidence left behind by the killer. So it doesn't take them long to haul in former army sniper James Barr. <br /> <br />Barr says very little to anyone except for making one important request to his lawyer, \\"Get Jack Reacher for me.\\" <br /> <br />But Reacher's already on his way from Florida, having seen the drama reported on the news. Surprisingly though, he isn't coming to help Barr. In fact, he's coming to bury him at least, that's the intention when he first hits town. But he's about to find that there's a lot more to this story than first meets the eye. <br /> <br />This is a cracking thriller that once again displays Reacher's skills of detective work, intimidation and evasion off to great advantage. He becomes immersed in a convoluted plot that brings him up against an unknown, unseen enemy. He actually only finds out that he has an enemy just before it's too late - and when he does, the fun really begins. <br /> <br />The Jack Reacher books are all full of fast action, clever plot twists and headed by an ultra competent protagonist. One Shot falls directly into line with this and fans of the earlier books can rest assured that this is more of the same. <br />	2005-07-04

Ridley Pearson has taken a break from his outstanding Lou Boldt series with a gut-wrenching thriller involving federal agents, organised crime and a chilling paid assassin who will stop at nothing and no-one to reach his target. <br /> <br />Roland Larson is a deputy US Marshal who was removed from the WITSEC (Witness Security) Task Force after he became romantically involved with Hope Stevens, the woman he was supposed to be protecting. A huge no-no. <br /> <br />Now he's with the Fugitive Apprehension Task Force, it is 6 years later and a devastating theft has taken place from within the US Marshal's Office. The encrypted witness database has been stolen and the man who created the encryption key has also gone missing. It seems that the crime family who was after Hope all those years ago is still trying to find her, this time to get revenge. The sale of the list of witnesses to other crime cartels is their bonus after they use it to find her. A frantic race against time is set in place as it's up to Roland to try to find Hope and retrieve the list before it can be decrypted. <br /> <br />Meanwhile a vicious killer is hot on Hope's trail, crudely extracting the necessary information he needs to get to her. He's not very particular about the carnage he has to wreak to find her. <br /> <br />This is a fast-paced thriller filled with gory action sequences that lack believability but provide plenty of entertainment. Although the outcome is quite predictable, the ride to get there is full of excitement and made it a book that was difficult to put down. <br />	2005-06-14
222536:US	47964988	R6DWB1XAUHJLV	031232135X	902001253	Flat Crazy: A Blanco County, Texas, Novel (Game Warden John Marlin)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Hunt For the Chupacabra	Put together a mythical beast hunt, an out of control hunt guide, a playboy millionaire, a Chinese dwarf porn star and a sexy out-of-town news reporter and you've got the making of a dangerous end to the hunting season. Life in Blanco County, Texas should be quiet, but for the 3rd book in succession proves that this is not so. Flat Crazy is a mixture of good humour and heart-stopping danger told at a cracking pace.  <br /> <br />When a Mexican labourer witnesses a strange-looking animal devouring a goat in the woods his terrified conclusion is that he had just seen the dreaded chupacabra. The chupacabra is supposedly a mythical beast that wanders around feasting on the blood of its victims. The news sends something of a shiver through the citizens of Blanco County, to think that this ungodly creature should be roaming around out there.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Duke Waldrip is having a few more pressing problems. Duke is a hunting guide who caters to the sorts of clients who are after the more extreme and less legal kind of game. If you're after a rare, high-scoring buck with a magnificent buck or if you want to hunt more exotic game imported from another continent, Duke's your man. The problem that has captured Duke's attention is that the latest exotic creatures have managed to escape and are roaming free in the countryside. If any of these animals are spotted he will surely find himself heading back to prison.  <br /> <br />John Marlin is the game warden for Blanco County and the protagonist of the series, an all around nice guy who works closely with the sheriff's department, so he's drawn into some pretty interesting investigations. As Flat Crazy opens he is run off his feet with the end of hunting season nearing and the hunters doing a mad scramble to make the most of the last few days. The last thing he needs is the fear of an unknown animal, mythical or otherwise, roaming in the woods. Making things worse is the presence of a news team who have picked up thestory and have caused a rush to the area of every half-baked would-be thrill-seeker who thinks it would be fun to capture a chupacabra.  <br /> <br />In the course of searching for the animal that may or may not be real, the intrigue is kicked off in earnest when the first body is discovered on a vacant property. It's obvious that the death has been caused by a human, not a chupacabra so what is to become a perplexing and ultimately extremely dangerous investigation begins.  <br /> <br />Flat Crazy is the kind of mystery where we the readers know all the details, who the murderer is, how and why the murder was committed. The satisfying aspect of the book is watching to see just how he is going to be caught, who else he might take out along the way and how the vast array of seemingly unrelated sub-stories are going to have an effect.  <br /> <br />Ben Rehder has the admirable quality of keeping the story consistently paced throughout and shows a remarkable flair for displaying a wickedly dark humour. He drew me in with a definite light-hearted feel about the story and then, before I knew what was happening through some very serious moments into the mix. It has the effect of throwing you off balance and makes you hesitant as to what the tone is going to be next.  <br /> <br />The off-beat characters that consistently make appearances in the Blanco County series are present again in Flat Crazy and adds another dimension of appeal to the book. The air of unexpectedness hangs over every scene thanks to the skewed thinking of the Blanco County regulars. It keeps the story very fresh and throws up some very enjoyable surprises.  <br /> <br />Like the earlier books in the Blanco County series ( Buck Fever and Bone Dry ), Flat Crazy is an extremely satisfying read, recommended to mystery lovers who prefer their stories to be on the humorous side. That's not to say that there isn't a darker side to this story, it has an intensity that commands you to keep reading.  <br /> <br/>And as for the Chinese dwarf porn star? Well, if your curiosity as to how he comes into the story hasn't been aroused *ahem* then you're just not trying.	2005-05-30
222632:US	47964988	R34C11NPQI4BBL	0385504284	202497183	The Forgotten Man: A Novel (Elvis Cole Novels)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Elvis Uncovered	Elvis Cole, the LA private investigator who breezily dubs himself the World's Greatest Detective returns in The Forgotten Man, the 10th book in Robert Crais' series, one that continues to stand out in the private detective genre as being of consistently high quality.  <br /> <br />The Elvis Cole series has long been a favourite of mine because of the fast pace of the investigations, the easy, chatty style in which the story is told, the infectious good humour of Elvis and for the near psychopathic nature of his enigmatic partner, Joe Pike. While all of these qualities return not all of them are displayed quite to the degree of past books. In The Forgotten Man we are instead given a bonus glimpse into Elvis' turbulent past.  <br /> <br />A man is shot and with his dying breath he tells the cop who finds him that he was looking for his son, Elvis Cole. When Elvis is informed of this startling news he is suddenly thrust back to his childhood and the quest to find his father that dominated his thoughts for so long. With nothing more to occupy his time Elvis decides to help the police investigate the murder of the mysterious man with a tantalizing possibility that he may finally be able to close a harrowing chapter of his life.  <br /> <br />It is inevitable, then that we are thrust back to Elvis' childhood and learn how he was raised, his unending search for his father as a boy and what became of his mother. For long time fans of the Elvis Cole, I think this is a necessary process that allows us to finally get to know the man behind the loud Hawaiian shirts with the wise-cracking habit. This process allows us to see him as a much more vulnerable character which humanizes him significantly.  <br /> <br />As for the investigation, it continues at a reasonably fast pace, interrupted occasionally with trips back in time. It is also paced by the growing unease of Frederick, a paranoid schizophrenic living under an assumed name who is awaiting the return of his friend Payne.It becomes obvious that Frederick and Payne were responsible for some pretty grim crimes and Frederick is increasingly terrified that these crimes will be discovered.  <br /> <br />His unease flushes him out of his small town hidey hole as he begins the search for Payne. It's a search that takes him across Elvis' investigation and introduces an unexpected wildcard to the story as his paranoia and violent tendencies are directed at the World's Greatest Detective. The prospect of the Frederick effect on the story is delicious as it gradually unfolds.  <br /> <br />Carol Starkey, protagonist of the non-Elvis Cole book Demolition Angel and reintroduced in The Last Detective has taken a much greater role in this book. Elvis tends to use Starkey as his inside connection to the LAPD files but Starkey is starting to make it clear that she would like to take their relationship further, at least she makes it clear to the reader.  <br /> <br />I'm a little perturbed about the direction Crais is taking her character considering she was such a strong woman in Demolition Angel. She comes across here as a bit of a doormat, unable or unwilling to express her feelings for Elvis while doing his bidding without question. The moodiness and lack of confidence was frustrating, particularly when she was such a strong character in the earlier books.  <br /> <br />Even more disappointing was the minimal role played by Joe Pike in this story. The unsmiling, aviator glasses wearing warrior's presence always ensures that something unusual is going to happen, often violently, which in my book means entertaining. His absence meant a lack of flair in the critical action sequences, no feeling of reassurance that the ultimate in backups was backing things up.  <br /> <br />Finally, in the gripe/warning department, I feel it necessary to warn anyone who hasn't read the previous book yet that there are major plot spoilers to The Last Detective revealed in the course of this book. The crucial outcomeis completely given away early on which, I think, would leave you with no compelling reason to go back to the previous book - a good reason to read series books in order, but still, I don't think Crais should have done it.  <br /> <br />Gone is the light, witty narrative that dominated the early books in the series. Robert Crais has decided to take Elvis into much more thoughtful territory as he becomes introspective, dwelling on his past and questioning his own identity. The result is a story that is slower paced with grater emphasis placed on the characters making them greatly detailed and finely drawn. This is important to the outcome of The Forgotten Man as psychological make-up plays a big role in the investigation.  <br /> <br />Overall, I was just a little disappointed with The Forgotten Man when comparing it to other books in the series (LA Requiem still stands out as the shining light). However, as a straight out psychological thriller it stacks up very well, bringing together the various unconnected threads and tying them up into a satisfyingly neat ending. Most importantly, Crais was able to keep a surprise or two from me right up until the end.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-30

They had a synergy that allowed them to combine efficiently while working on the case. They return in another tense police procedural and that good relationship will be required again in The Malcontenta as Kolla faces a particularly frustrating case.  <br /> <br />The story opens with a very perturbed Kathy Kolla making her way to DCI Brock's house to seek his advice. Brock, who is a highly regarded Scotland Yard detective, has been on leave as he prepares a paper for a conference in Rome and so is removed from the day to day police-work. DS Kolla usually works at the London Met but has been sent to the Southern Counties for a year's secondment possibly as a punishment for the events detailed in The Marx Sisters.  <br /> <br />The case in question is the apparent suicide of a man employed at Stanhope Naturopath Clinic, a health farm style complex that basks in its isolation. The director of the clinic seems particularly reluctant to help with providing any information and in fact, even hinders the case. This is annoying and perhaps even a little suspicious but she receives a shock to be confronted and berated by the Deputy Chief Constable who happened to be staying at the clinic.  <br /> <br />The Deputy Chief Constable's wrath notwithstanding, she carries on and begins to make progress on the case, suspecting strongly that the suicide is in fact a murder. Just when real breakthroughs are being made she and the constable she is working with are hauled into their superior's office, taken off the case and warned to leave the people from the clinic alone.  <br /> <br />Sensing that there is some sort of cover-up going on and determined to find out what it is, it's at this point that she turns to Brock to see if he could come up with a plan. He can, an undercover operation, completely unofficial and against therules, where he would pose as a patient and enter Stanhope himself. The results are not exactly what Kolla or Brock would have hoped for, but their actions certainly stir things into a delightful frenzy.  <br /> <br />Starting off slowly as many police procedurals tend to do, the story builds in intensity developing a distinct us versus them feeling. Once the initial crime has been laid out for us and the main characters (suspects) are introduced, they are almost disregarded as the more troubling interference and discipline from within the police force takes over.  <br /> <br />As readers we are kept in the dark during most of The Malcontenta just as the protagonists are. We are just as confused as Kolla and Brock when the case goes spinning out of control and there is a continuing sense of injustice about the events, even a feeling of outrage at the treatment that's being handed out. Barry Maitland has done a superb job of drawing me into the story by playing upon my own emotions, putting me in Kathy Kolla's predicament and effectively asking how I would feel in the same situation. It's a style that gave me the feeling that I held a stake in the outcome.  <br /> <br />The Malcontenta is a strong follow-up to The Marx Sisters firmly establishing the partnership that was formed between DS Kolla and DCI Brock. We are given the benefit of learning a little more about both of them although the character development is probably the least strong aspect of the book. At this point I think they are still far from fully formed characters with the concentration placed more on their handling of the case. In particular it seems to me that Brock is yet to reach his full potential.  <br /> <br />Insightful detective work while facing possibly career destroying opposition carries the story and is made consistently interesting by changing the lead character, first Kathy Kolla and then David Brock. Barry Maitland is definitely an author to follow for those who enjoy strong police procedurals.	2005-05-30
223313:US	47964988	R1UTQM8ZEB5607	0743234707	647042226	Blood Memory: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Psychologically thrilling	As far as psychological thrillers go, Greg Iles has come up with a real heart-stopper in Blood Memory, incorporating recovered memory syndrome into a story that initially appears to be a more common serial killer mystery.  <br /> <br />Cat Ferry is a forensic odontologist working in New Orleans, Her life is a little complicated when the story opens, dealing with a drinking problem plus the pressure of hiding an affair with a married homicide cop with whom she works. The complications intensify while she is attending a murder scene, the handiwork of a serial killer who bites their victims, hence her presence. For the second time in as many crime scenes she suffers a panic attack, as unexpected as it is embarrassing and it brings to a cataclysmic head all of the pressures that have been building within her.  <br /> <br />It's at this point that the story takes a complete 90 degree turn as Cat escapes New Orleans and heads to her childhood home in Natchez, Mississippi. It's been many years since she has been home and as she gets closer begins to feel some disturbing emotions that she can only put down to the length of time since she had been there. These feelings grow and rather than providing her with the much needed relief from her problems she craved, she actually stumbles upon another mystery that has been hiding in Cat's past.  <br /> <br />She is suddenly faced with the prospect that everything she had believed about her family is a lie. Against the strongest of opposition she is driven by an inner need to open up the secrets of her past.  <br /> <br />Blood Memory is a tremendous book filled with pain and frustration, lies and half truths and a slow revelation of the truth that could be overshadowed by a terrible fight for survival. While not exactly a fast-paced thriller, after all we have a lot of nightmares to endure, souls to be searched and past secrets to unearth, there are plenty of moments that will have you engrossed.  <br /> <br />The strong emphasis on detailed characterization is crucial to the story. It is the past of every major player that determines the answers that Cat is looking for and by a quirky link, it is the ongoing serial-killer investigation that gives her an unlikely insight into her own past. Iles has run the full range of character traits, too, whether they are unforgivably evil, hatefully sleazy, woefully nave or simply mentally tortured, he examines them all in detail bringing them to full life for us.  <br /> <br />It's unusual that the outcome of a murder investigation, particularly one as unusual as this one sounds, takes secondary importance in a thriller, but such is the emphasis given to Cat Ferry and her single-minded determination to find the truth. Greg Iles has told an engrossing story dealing with the emotional subjects of recovered memory syndrome and child molestation in a very confrontational style.  <br /> <br />Incidentally, readers of past Greg Iles books may recognize the return of a past character, FBI profiler John Kaiser. Kaiser last made an appearance in Dead Sleep where he played a major role. This time his role is significantly smaller but, from past experience you know that he is a strong, decent law officer who can be trusted, and believe me, if there's something that Cat Ferry needs in this story is a trustworthy ally.  <br /> <br />Greg Iles has a knack of writing thought-provoking thrillers and he has achieved that once again with Blood Memory. I would recommend it for people who enjoy psychological thrillers on a grand scale.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-30

He is now a fully licensed private investigator working for the energetic and, let's face it, slightly manic Erainya Manos.  <br /> <br />Its six months after the finale of the second book in the series, The Widower's Two-Step , and Tres is once again being offered the teaching position at the University of Texas at San Antonio. This time though the position is vacant because the previous professor had been shot to death. Only after narrowly escaping a letter-bomb explosion while sitting at the dead professor's desk does Tres decide that he'll take the job. Now that's says a lot about the type of guy Tres Navarre is.  <br /> <br />Zeta Sanchez has been away from San Antonio for quite some time. In fact, he disappeared very soon after someone matching his description was seen shooting Jeremiah Brandon in the chest. From all reports Zeta has returned to town and in a remarkable coincidence Aaron Brandon, the late English professor at UTSA and son of Jeremiah is now dead. It doesn't take a great deal of detective work for the San Antonio PD to figure out who the number one suspect is.  <br /> <br />But it all seems too easy for Tres, he smells a set-up and then, when the murders continue after Zeta is caught he becomes convinced that he's right. He makes himself unpopular with the police when he suggests they've arrested the wrong man for Aaron Brandon's murder, he's just as unpopular with the gangs hanging around the barrio, pushing them around and dissing their boss. But he's most unpopular with Brandon's family who would just like to get on with their lives.  <br /> <br />Tres sure is one unpopular man, but that's because he's on to something and he's about to uncover some closely kept secrets. Secrets that some people will do just about anything to keep. Zeta Sanchez is a killer, thereis no doubt and while he's in jail you can be sure that there are plenty of men willing to step into his shoes to deal with a nosy detective.  <br /> <br />I felt that The Last King of Texas compares very well with the earlier Tres Navarre books, taking off with a real bang and never really letting up as he puts himself in extreme danger at every opportunity. Considering that the earlier books are by no means slow this is a strong indication of what a pulse-quickening story it is. Making it even more thrilling is the disregard Tres seems to have for his own safety. He's always been a confident man but he is now bordering on the outlandishly reckless. The action first, worry about the consequences later approach can be exasperating at times, but it certainly maximizes the excitement.  <br /> <br />Rick Riordan has kept the series fresh by resting a couple of characters who featured prominently in the earlier books and introducing a few interesting new characters. The most dynamic of these is homicide detective Ana DeLeon with whom Tres enjoys a rather stormy working relationship. If he survives her friendship she promises to be a formidable ally in the police force. Of course staying on her good side is not high on his list of priorities providing some of the more amusing encounters in the book.  <br /> <br />Uncompromising violence, drug dealing and drug taking and frequent coarse language ensures that The Last King of Texas sits firmly in the hardboiled category. A solid mystery that should have you guessing until the end and the unveiling of a surprise twist or two makes this an all round entertaining story. <br />	2005-04-27

Author Rick Riordan provides us with a tangled mystery based around the budding career of a promising country singer and the creeping corruption that lurks behind the lure of success.  <br /> <br />Tres is within 10 hours of finishing his apprenticeship before a P.I. license is his when the case he is working, a simple surveillance job goes horribly wrong. When the dust clears he's on the verge of quitting with very few prospects on the horizon. Holding a degree in English Literature, he lines up a job teaching English at UTSA, thanks to his mother's pushiness. But before stepping into a life of academia, he still has some unfinished business to attend to.  <br /> <br />Old school friend and now a partner in a talent agency, Milo Chavez makes Tres a huge offer to find his partner Les Saint-Pierre who has been missing for two weeks. Saint-Pierre had been involved in a tug-of-war battle with Tilden Sheckly over the right to represent up and coming country singer Miranda Daniels. What Tres uncovers is more than simply a couple of would-be agents squabbling over an up and coming musical talent. It's more about the money that can be made by the music industry through black market dealings. It's a tangled web that just gets worse when the nose of Tres Navarre is shoved in the middle.  <br /> <br />In his search for Saint-Pierre, Tres finds himself drawn into Miranda's world, forming an emotional attachment that reveals a more sober, thoughtful Tres Navarre than we have seen in the past. His involvement with the singer and her family threatens to distract him from the main game. Fortunately, Tres is a talented guy who is able to juggle the problem of the missing agent, the turmoil of the singer's family and the shady dealings of a marginally scrupulous agent.  <br /> <br />The story starts off at a solid clip as Tres is up against a deadline, both in the missing person case and in his bid to find a new profession. Rick Riordan writes with an engaging style which is complemented by the breezy first person delivery from Navarre. I felt as though I am being welcomed back to San Antonio after visiting when reading Big Red Tequila, such is the familiarity with which the city and the South Texas customs are described.  <br /> <br />The only minor problem I had while reading the book was a flat spot mid-way through where the investigation tended to lose momentum and the story tended to drift along without anything of interest happening. It didn't last overly long, but I found it difficult to maintain my attention through it and was then struggling to pick the pieces of the plot back up again.  <br /> <br />I've found Tres Navarre an extremely likable protagonist with a roguish wit and quiet confidence (very reminiscent of Elvis Cole in the early books by Robert Crais). Riordan returns a few of the more memorable characters from Big Red Tequila such as Ralph Arguello his invaluable pawnshop owning friend who fought his way out of the slums and now carries a lot of weight on the streets of San Antonio; his barely in control, wheelchair-bound computer genius brother Garrett; and, of course, his neurotic cat Robert Johnson. They're all becoming charmingly familiar, slightly off-beat and a reason to return to the series.  <br /> <br />The Widower's Two-Step is a fine follow-up to Big Red Tequila bringing all the down-home good nature of Texas to life while taking us through a well constructed mystery. The fact that at the end of it all, Riordan has given us the odd punch in the gut with a sudden unexpected revelation only adds to the enjoyment. <br />	2005-04-27

Tres Navarre is an unlicensed private investigator, tequila drinker and all around nice guy. But he's also troubled by the past and when he sets about easing his mind, more than a few feathers or going to get ruffled.  <br /> <br />As the story opens, Tres has returned to San Antonio after a 10 year absence and is nonchalantly throwing the previous tenant out of the house he is now renting. Immediately we are confronted with a guy who is very capable with his hands, won't back down from a fight and the nonchalance is the way he performs most tasks. Add to that a vague air of amusement and the character of Tres Navarre is virtually complete.  <br /> <br />Tres is back in San Antonio at the request of Lillian Cambridge, the girl with whom he was madly in love with and had plans to marry 10 years before. She's one of the few people pleased to see him come home with quite a number of very lukewarm greetings received. A lot of people still haven't forgiven him for his decision to suddenly leave town after watching his father get gunned down on his front doorstep.  <br /> <br />Anyway, he's back, Lillian's overjoyed and he's determined to solve his father's murder which had remained unsolved all these years. Suddenly Lillian goes missing, her business partner looks to be connected to one of San Antonio's wealthiest families in some kind of shady deal and the death rate has suddenly spiked, particularly among people who may have been able to help Tres solve his father's murder. Tres has effectively poked an anthill with a stick and the inhabitants are not the slightest bit happy about it. What follows is a stirring thriller combining the heart pounding desperation of a kidnapping case with a complex story of corruption that spreads through major development contracts, big business and politics, all tied in to a 10 year old murder.  <br /> <br />Rick Riordan employs a delightful style, whipping the story along at a cracking pace ensuring that the story is always interesting. The characters cover a wide range of classes and personalities, from the millionaire pawn-broker who has fought his way out of the slums to Tres' legless half-brother computer whiz, each is refreshingly unique. In his own laid back demeanour Tres himself is an engaging character giving the impression to friends and enemies alike to be an amiable feller, but when pushed he is not above taking action with deadly consequences.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most difficult thing to reconcile about Tres Navarre is the Teflon-like qualities he possesses. Nothing ever seems to stick to the guy. Failed relationships, murdered father, killing a man, they all seem to slide straight off him with nary a second thought. I don't like getting bogged down by an extended bout of depression and introspection on the part of the protagonist but can handle the odd mourning period - it makes them human. But heck, it just seems a little inhuman to show no emotion whatsoever, and believe me, Navarre goes through enough trauma here to stop ten men cold.  <br /> <br />By way of introducing Tres Navarre and the city of San Antonio, Big Red Tequila has a lot to like about it. It's hardboiled and uncompromising, it moves fast with a well-constructed storyline that runs through to a satisfying, if somewhat too conveniently neat, ending. It's the kind of book that invites you to return for another visit with the promise that you will be entertained. <br />	2005-04-27
262484:US	47964988	RK7HSNTTTRV7	0670033197	309005909	Dirty Sally	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Stunning Noir Debut	Set in Austin, Texas, Dirty Sally is the brooding debut novel of Michael Simon and hits the ground with a dark murder, an even darker more disturbed homicide squad and a compelling investigation taking place among the detritus of society. It's the kind of contemporary noir story that fans of George Pelecanos, James Sallis and Ken Bruen will enjoy and be clamoring for more.  <br /> <br />The story begins with a gruesome murder.  <br /> <br />Well actually, that's not entirely accurate. In fact the murder is a fairly run of the mill strangulation of a prostitute, the likes of which has been detailed in any number of thriller in the past. The gruesome part comes after the torso of the victim is discovered by Dan Reles when parts of the body begin showing up in the mail of selected Austin businessmen.  <br /> <br />Dan Reles is a homicide detective with the Austin police department and is one extremely tormented guy with a list of emotional issues dating way back to his childhood. The first time we meet him though is his first day back at work after he had been suspended for hitting another cop. Dominating just about every thought in his head is Joey Velez, his partner, mentor and friend who was killed 6 months previously. His inability to cope with the death has turned him into an unpredictable loner and he is generally regarded by his fellow cops as a loose cannon.  <br /> <br />But back to the case. An unidentified prostitute's torso is a grim enough find but pieces of her being sent through the mail calls for full and immediate action. Someone is out there sending a powerful message, but to whom?  <br /> <br />This is a much more complicated story than a simple murder investigation. Reles is also distracted by a young university student who is in fear of his life, having just lost a couple of friends in \\"accidents\\". It's one of those side-stories that appears unrelated but persists on the periphery until it gradually integrates with the main storyline. Simon seamlessly joins the lines together to build a tightly woven tale that had me casting around in every direction, unsure of who was good and who was evil - who would live and who would die.  <br /> <br />Much of the story is told from the first person perspective of Reles and through him we are tossed into the maelstrom of an enormously complicated person. But the point of view switches, rather fluidly I might add, to the 3rd person narrative in order to get an alternative viewpoint of the story and to catch up on parts of the story that doesn't involve Reles.  <br /> <br />Dirty Sally is unmistakably noir with the protagonist displaying serious personality flaws, as does the rest of his fellow homicide detectives. There is a consistent feeling of hopeless failure about the investigation so that even when progress is made it invariably comes at a cost. Maybe that cost is a life or a friendship or a trust.  <br /> <br />Across the board the main characters are a pretty off-beat, unlikable lot. Even Dan Reles, our protagonist mind you, is a moody, self-absorbed so-and-so who barely makes a decision without wondering how his dead partner would have done things. The rest of the squad are either corrupt bigots who delight in baiting their colleagues or defensive, unfriendly men with whom you would hesitate before trusting. It's a good thing I don't have to like the central characters to enjoy a book because looking back, they're all a fairly motley bunch of people with few redeeming qualities.  <br /> <br />As the story really gets going you sense a tremendous feeling of desperation, heightened by a growing body count, an impatient set of superiors who want results yet seemingly hamstring the investigation and a growing suspicion that not everyone is on the same team.  <br /> <br />Michael Simon has written an incredibly deep and incredibly complex thriller that I found captivating as we groped our way though some pretty depressing neighborhoods, met some of the scum who live there and found that it was all controlled by the usual rich power brokers who believe themselves above the law. Readers of hardboiled mysteries looking for a new name on the block will be pleased to hear that there is a new name on the block who has produced a resounding winner in Dirty Sally.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-27

Allan Guthrie has followed up his outstanding debut novel, Two-Way Split with another taut thriller that races through a criminal world where the rules are largely ignored, the violence is frequent and no-one can be trusted. <br /> <br />When Joe Hope goes to work he usually takes a baseball bat with him. He works as a leg-breaker for his loan-shark friend, Cooper, encouraging punters to be more prompt with their payments next time. He's a man used to violence, dealing it out on a regular basis. When it comes to dealing with pain, though, he's not so assured, particularly when the pain is the raw emotion of finding out that his daughter has just committed suicide. <br /> <br />Before he has a chance to deal with his grief properly he is hit with another body blow, namely the murder of his wife. But this time, he finds out when the police arrest him for it. He didn't love the woman but he certainly didn't kill her. He smells a set-up but has no idea who it could be, or why. To save himself he has control his rage and put a fiendish plan into place to catch the real killer all the while evading the police. <br /> <br />This is a well-constructed story capturing attitude and dialogue admirably well, the characters jump out of the pages as fully formed individuals. At times the violence is extreme but wholly within the context of the story serving to establish the main character's personalities.  <br /> <br />From the Orkneys back to Edinburgh, inside prison cells and interrogation rooms, a loan-shark's house and a prostitute's apartment, the story whizzes along at great pace setting up a dramatic ending. Once again Allan Guthrie has written a thoroughly entertaining mystery and is a worthy addition to the already strong Hard Case Crime library. <br />	2005-03-31

To be more specific, a dive named Oscar's and the bartender who works there, Brian McNulty. <br /> <br />A young woman becomes a regular fixture at Oscar's and in a very short time gets to know the assorted regular assortment of winos and barflies who are permanent fixture in the place. An incredibly complicated and troubled woman she reveals a hard, depressing past and gravitates straight to McNulty, merely seeking friendship, something he is only too happy to provide. <br /> <br />When the woman is murdered, McNulty and the rest of the Oscar regulars are stunned but not overly surprised. She had a tendency to sleep with anyone and everyone, quite often with men who could be considered dangerous. More than a few of these men drink at Oscar's. <br /> <br />Given that McNulty was the closest friend she had when the woman died, he takes on the task of trying to track down her killer. He has a whole bar full of suspects and realizes that even though he sees them every night, he doesn't truly know these people. Thus begins the slow process of working out who the murderer is. <br /> <br />This is a grim story told from the perspective of Brian McNulty and set in the desperate late night hours. Fuelled by alcohol and cocaine, McNulty takes greater and greater risks as he homes in on the killer and puts himself and those close to him in danger. It's a methodical mystery, McNulty is an everyday guy just trying to get by and the world he inhabits is a dangerous place. Excellent fair for lovers of noir. <br />	2005-03-28

The events of the previous book are still hanging over Sarah's head as the story opens with a quick recap bringing those who hadn't read the first book up to speed.  <br />  <br />A couple of unrelated, yet deeply absorbing cases dominate the book. The first begins when Marlinchen Hennessey walks in to Sarah's office. She has the type of story that has been heard numerous times before by numerous police around the world. Marlinchen's 17 year old twin brother, Aidan, has gone missing. There's nothing unusual in that, but then she goes on to reveal that not only has he been missing for two months, but he was living in Georgia at the time.  <br />  <br />Being a busy cop, Sarah has also been given the job of locating someone who has been practicing medicine without a license. Her task is to use her contacts to find the phony doctor and shut him down before he causes some real damage. Finding him isn't a problem, not becoming emotionally involved with a caring man who is obviously a terrific doctor but is denied the right to practice because of a silly mistake? Yep, now that's a problem.  <br /> <br />Finally, there's the little matter of the other shoe dropping, and it looks as though it will come in the form of an internal investigation. Just what Sarah needs is the distraction of some very pointed questions and a forensic investigation taking place with her as the subject under the microscope.  <br />  <br />From the moment the book opens with Sarah diving into a dirty storm-water drain to save some young boys to her heroics later on, there is barely time to draw breath. Yet Sarah still has time to suffer a debilitating illness, carry on a lightning-fast (although completely unrealistic and out of place) affair and generally get the stuffing knocked out of herself.  <br /> <br />Piled on top of thesome character analysis, Compton hits us with a multitude of plot twists at the end that will, if you're anything like me, have you reeling with one closely following the other. There is a risk of over-loading the senses with too many shocks in too short a time, but it's definitely a book that will remain with you long after you've finished. I think Jodi Compton has surpassed her excellent debut with a compelling second book in Sympathy Between Humans. <br />	2005-03-26

Jake Rossiter and his partner, the lovely Miss Jenkins are back fighting crime, talking tough and living large. <br /> <br />Queer Street starts off as a murder case, but a risque complication is added to the case, with the setting among the wild world of homosexuals and female impersonators, a side of life that was far from accepted in the 1950s. The case progresses to the exposure of blackmail, protection rackets and some goings on in the more seamy parts of Seattle, parts that Jake would have preferred not to have learned about.  <br />  <br />Great effort has been made by Curt Colbert to recreate the feel of a 1950's pulp detective story with the dialogue so authentic it could be mistaken as coming out of the mouth of Mike Hammer. Jake Rossiter's narrative is droll with a heavy tough-guy attitude indicating that he's proud of the fact that he can take a punch and down his fair share of Cutty Sark. Sure, at times it comes across as cliched, but as a lover of the old-style pulps I found that this is one of the endearing aspects of the story.  <br />  <br />Although this is most certainly a hardboiled private investigator story as told by a hardened gumshoe, there is a consistent humorous tone to the book as Jake seems to find himself in numerous compromising situations. Queer Street and indeed the entire series, is ideal for people who love reading no-nonsense detective novels, the pulpier the better. <br />	2005-03-26

In the meantime he works as a double glazing salesman by day and accompanies Les Beale, his friend and colleague to the city's casinos by night. Somewhere in between he finds time for his girlfriend Lucy, a university student and a possible stabilizing influence on his life.  <br /> <br />But it's the destabilizing influence who dominates Slater's attention - Les Beale. Beale has a habit of attracting trouble and then relies on Alan to get him out of it. Whether it's drunk and obnoxious in a casino, starting fights with bar patrons or getting home unscathed, Beale has some sort of hold over Alan that he can't say no to and drops everything to help him out. The story, and Alan Slater's future all hinge on the night of a fixed poker game. Beale is playing the game, Slater is at home with Lucy, but as has happened every other time he's gotten into trouble, Beale calls Slater to help bail him out. Slater provides his help one time too many and the ride into hell begins.  <br /> <br />Searing hangovers follow drunken nights and Alan's vows to cut his ties to Beale dominate the story as the slow spiral begins to gather momentum. The mirage of happiness in the form of his girlfriend, his job and his health flickers as Beale's influence is stronger than Alan's determination.  <br /> <br />There is a boozy, paranoid hysteria about the story, opening with the breathless dread following a car accident in which Slater has hit and killed a dog. The pressure never lets up with a definite sense that Alan's life is always about to spin out of control. Told in the first person we become intimately familiar with Slater's feelings and the incredible lethargy he feels when it comes to standing up for himself. He knows how to get his life on track, he knows who the bad influence in his life is but he just doesn't seem to be able to bring himself to finally cut the ties.  <br /> <br />Atonly 170 pages long, The Big Blind takes us through a lot of angst in a short amount of time. Days pile on top of one another at a furious pace while Slater vainly tries to make some sense of his life. He is a frustrating mixture of contradictions and at times I felt like reaching into the pages and giving him a good shake. At one point he's ready to chuck in his relationship with Lucy because he feels she's smothering him, the next he is bereft at the thought that he's not good enough for her and she may leave him. You can see that he's so close to dragging himself out of the hole that he's dug for himself, so tantalisingly close.  <br /> <br />So as Alan Slater stumbles along ruining his life, I suddenly found that I felt as though I had a vested interest in the outcome. I cared about the man who couldn't say no to his friend. It's the drawing out of this empathy that separates the good noir stories from the not so good and Ray Banks has done a helluva job in The Big Blind. <br />	2005-03-18

Set largely up and down the New England coastline, but mainly in Boston, the much maligned occupation of the repo man (or woman, in this case) is spotlighted.  <br /> <br />Jack Merchant is a former DEA agent now trying to scratch enough money together to make the repayments on the boat on which he lives. Sarah Ballard is a marine repo woman who knew and admired Jack when he was still working with the DEA.  <br /> <br />Their paths cross many years after they first meet when Sarah shows up one day to repossess Jack's boat. Rather than carrying out the repossession she takes pity on him and makes him an alternative offer that would benefit them both. If Jack worked for her on her latest case he would earn enough to keep his boat and she would get a wealth of experience in return, not to mention the company of a man to whom she had always been attracted.  <br /> <br />The case in question is the repossession of a boat that has gone missing, along with her owners, Paul and Julie Baylor. Both of the Baylors were well-to-do young professionals and their disappearance is very out of character. It doesn't take a genius to work out that there is a lot more going on than the simple recovery of a boat from some deadbeat who is behind on his payments. Sure enough, there is a lot more behind the story. In fact, the repo game has never been more dangerous.  <br /> <br />Together, Jack and Sarah make a good team with Sarah providing a measure of world-weary cynicism, having worked in the repo game since she was a kid. As far as she's concerned everyone is a potential deadbeat upon whom she will have to ply her repossession skills. Jack's a bit more prepared to find the good side of people, showing more sympathy and a knack for gathering information. But both of them are haunted by their respective pasts, nightmares and memories of violence ensure that they sleep poorly and that they have some psychological healing to go through. You can tell it's going to be a tempestuous relationship now and in future books and the inevitable sexual tension lurks lazily within every quiet moment.  <br /> <br /> A good mix of in-depth character development and hard, fast action ensures that we care enough about the characters to get a sense of having a vested interest in their well-being. This not only applies to Merchant and Ballard but also to the minor characters, all of whom, the good the bad and the downright disgusting are given full and believable personalities.  <br /> <br />I thought this was a marvellous opening book to a new series. The lead characters are both interesting, carrying just the right amount of baggage (you know, enough to give them depth but not so much that you're bored by their hang ups). The repo game hasn't been this enjoyable since Joe Gores' DKA Files series and a return visit to Boston Harbour holds the promise of further mean moments with Jack Merchant and Sarah Ballard. <br />	2005-03-18

Murder Suicide is the 5th book in the Dr Frank Clevenger series and the Boston-based psychiatrist has become a well-organised, responsible parent as well as an insightful psychiatrist.  <br /> <br />Frank Clevenger is called in by the police to assist in the investigation of the shooting death of John Snow. Snow was a brilliant aeronautical engineer and inventor but was prone to severe seizures, thought to be brought on by the overload of impulses to the brain when he was at his most creative. He was due to undergo radical brain surgery to try to stop the seizures, but this surgery ran the risk of horrifying side-effects. The reason Clevenger's expertise is required is to assess whether the prospect of the upcoming surgery and his possible future was too much for Snow to handle and chose to commit suicide instead.  <br /> <br />With any number of suspects to choose from Clevenger can't help but lean towards the real possibility that Snow was murdered. Suicide just looks too out of character for the genius who loved nothing more than to create rather than destruct. Clevenger proceeds to unpick the pieces that have put together Snow's life aver the previous few months. <br /> <br />The Frank Clevenger seen here bears little resemblance to the alcohol and drug dependent man who first made his appearance in Denial. Back then he stood out as a fascinatingly complex man who was deeply troubled, suffering from the same psychological issues as the patients he treated. The focus is now more on Clevenger's investigation and his ability to get inside the heads of people he interviews. Although the pace is fast, the psychological insights are interesting and the question of who killed whom, the book now has a definite mainstream feeling about it, no longer having anything to offer that makes it stand out from the crowd. <br />	2005-03-10

The dead couple were part of the witness protection program at the time of their brutal murder. Sounds like your standard opening to a run-of-the-mill thriller, doesn't it? But this is anything but. You see, not only is Kevin Kennedy really Del Farmer, but Del Farmer has been dead for years.  <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Del Farmer was murdered by The Association, which is his name for the unknown members of the Las Vegas mob, with whom he had run afoul thanks to his work as an investigative journalist. When he died, his soul was \\"collected\\" and stored inside the mind of another person effectively keeping him alive, at least in spirit if not in body. He now controls that body and devotes his time to hunting down The Association with the aim of eliminating them. Along the way he collects the souls of the dead, using their talents to draw him nearer to his goal. But while Del is concentrating on satisfying his thirst for revenge he is unaware that one of the souls he has collected is about to send his virtual world spinning out of control.  <br /> <br />Secret Dead Men is a fast-paced story based around murder, revenge, peace of mind and peace in mind. . The obvious difference here to other murder investigation stories is that people are seeking revenge for their own murders! Author Duane Swierczynski (it's pronounced the way its spelt) has come up with a mind bending scenario for life after death and the possible fate of your soul once it has departed the body. Starting with the intriguing concept of a soul collector, he runs with it, developing a complex virtual world within the mind where just about anything is possible: the construction of a Brain Hotel, face-changing, possession of other bodies and inanimate objects, resurrection from the dead.  <br /> <br />This is a lively thriller withthe added spice of a whole new dimension inside the head of the protagonist. Swierczynski sets the parameters early on giving us a credible account of just how the whole soul getting collected and stored in another body thing works. He then sets about ripping those parameters to shreds, introducing unexpected twists that are startling when they arrive forcing a necessary adjustment in thinking. It's off-beat, but it is amazingly effective opening all sorts of possibilities to explore. <br /> <br />Just when you get comfortable with that idea and the hunt for The Associates is in full swing, we are knocked off balance once again with a riveting battle taking place, not out in the real world where you'd expect it, but from within. It's a battle of souls and you are reminded that nothing is forever, not even the afterlife. I mean, how do you kill a soul? If it's already dead, can you make it even deader? We get to explore the possibility that maybe you can.  <br />  <br />In his debut novel, Duane Swierczynski has created a quirky story that is part hardboiled private investigator novel, part psychological thriller, part supernatural suspense story. It's original, tremendously entertaining and, as worlds crumble, bodies die and souls remain, it also becomes extremely thought-provoking. I found it a very enjoyable novel that appealed to my love for the hardboiled crime novel and my desire for a refreshing change of pace. <br />	2005-03-08
322447:US	47964988	R11SSL2M3GC3R3	0843953519	671490794	Little Girl Lost (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Outstanding Debut	Richard Aleas has made an outstanding debut with a hardboiled private detective thriller that sizzles through the streets of New York City. Little Girl Lost pits a heartbroken young PI against strip club toughs, vicious gangsters and murderers who will do whatever it takes to get away with their crime.  <br /> <br />Young New York private detective John Banks is distressed to hear that his former high school sweetheart Miranda Sugarman has been shot dead. He is then shocked to learn that, at the time of her death, she was working as a stripper in a 10th rate dive. How did she go from medical student to stripper in 10 years?  <br /> <br />Against his partner's advice Banks decides he's going to find out why Miranda was murdered. He starts at the strip club where she worked but it doesn't take very long nor many questions before he finds himself being assisted from the premises. As it turns out, this is the first and least violent of his encounters with the employees of the club. Someone doesn't appreciate the attention he's paying to the place. Far from making him back off, it only adds to his determination.  <br /> <br />The owner of the club is a small-time hood named Murco Khachadarian and while Blake is trying to track him down, it turns out that Murco is after him too. Murco heads Blake's suspect list for Miranda's murder, but Blake discovers that not only did he not kill her but he had good reason to want her to be alive. He has been robbed of $1 million and suspects that Miranda played some role in the robbery but is not sure exactly what. He would have liked the opportunity to ask her about it himself. Now Murco convinces Blake that it would be in both their interests if he were to find the missing money while he was trying to find her murderer. So, rather than butting heads with the organized crime boss, Blake finds himself in the uncomfortable position of working for him.  <br /> <br /> Richard Aleas has crafted an excellent mystery initially treading the time honoured traditional private detective path of endless questions seemingly leading nowhere with little indication that they will amount to anything until suddenly, all hell breaks loose. In this case Aleas actually uses a device that I find annoying as a way of breaking the case wide open. This device involves an anonymous note warning Blake to back off the investigation just as it seems he's got nowhere else to go and it has the predictably opposite effect. I've always thought this kind of situation is a rather unimaginative way to break a case but, thanks to the quality ending that follows it, I can forgive its inclusion here.  <br /> <br />The story develops quickly and speeds from a murder inquiry to a more sobering study of a character who has fallen from a life with endless possibilities before she fell to a sad end. Along the way we get a taste of the nationwide sex industry from the sleazy to the high-class, visited with some organized crime types, saved a girl from the strip-club life (one of the highlights of the book) and reached a dramatic ending filled with noir atmosphere.  <br /> <br />Richard Aleas is the pseudonym for Charles Ardai, founder of Hard Case Crime, the new publishing phenomenon under whose label this is published. The consistently high standard of hardboiled fiction released by this small publisher is continued with Little Girl Lost with it recently earning the accolade of an Edgar Award nomination for the Best First Book of the Year. <br />	2005-03-08

Plenty of violent action, mobbed up criminals and small time crooks feature against Harry Rane, a reluctant hero nursing a broken heart and an inability to overcome his grief and sense of guilt. Fans of hardboiled crime fiction should rejoice over another new name to look out for.  <br /> <br />Harry Rane is an ex-New Jersey state trooper living quietly on his own, grieving for his wife who died from cancer, now content to drift along doing nothing of any consequence. He is forced out of his malaise by a call from an old friend who has gotten himself into some financial trouble with a crime boss. His friend's name is Bobby Fox, and Bobby has been left holding the bag on a drug deal to the tune of 50 grand. The man he owes the money to is Eddie Fallon and Eddie's putting the pressure on him to repay the money, or else (insert your favourite mob-like threat here).  <br /> <br />Harry acts as Bobby's negotiator, meeting with Eddie to work out a plan that would get Bobby out from under. All goes reasonably smoothly, managing to get under the skin of Eddie's bodyguard, when Harry's world is rocked at the end of the meeting when he finds out that Eddie's wife is his first love Cristina, whom he hasn't seen in 30 years. Inevitably, they begin meeting behind Eddie's back, renewing their old acquaintances, and just as inevitably Eddie finds out about it which is just around the point where the action rockets into stratospheric proportions.  <br /> <br />From this point, the wise-guy violence that was simmering with cruel promise just below the surface is revealed as Eddie and his men flex their muscles. But rather than running along a predictable storyline, there is a suddenly tangent thrown in that reveals a surprising twist that will turn a simple debt repayment into a fight for Harry's life.  <br /> <br />Over and over in the course of the book, through his words and his actions, you get the impression that Harry cares little about consequences. His friend's in debt to a crime boss? No problem, confront the man and work out an arrangement to pay him back on your terms...take it or leave it. Met your former lover who now happens to be unhappily married to a crime boss? No worries! Begin an affair with her without being particularly careful about hiding it.  <br /> <br />When you feel as though you've got nothing to lose you can act with impunity. The problems arise when other people are involved and you realize that you're not as isolated as you thought. Such is the lot of Harry Rane.  <br /> <br />Wallace Stroby does an excellent job of setting the mood of the book early through Harry's mourning and then builds on it with a tough, no-nonsense plot that is both taut and gripping. Fully fleshed out characters who are given solid backgrounds that are brought to life by Stroby's colorful prose ensure that we care about the good guys, hate with a passion the bad and remain unsure who is going to get out of it with their lives.  <br /> <br />Setting a high standard first time out, the noir genre has been further enriched by The Barbed-Wire Kiss. Long on action and not overly burdened with needless detail, this book was \\"hold onto your hats\\" fast, pared to the bone and a dangerously enthralling read.	2005-03-01
337828:US	47964988	R1XDWGUJMI6UR6	0425195953	469848429	Winterkill (A Joe Pickett Novel)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Things get personal	The third Joe Pickett mystery once again finds trouble brewing in the wilds of Wyoming, but this time there is an added obstacle to maintaining peace and tranquility in this beautiful part of the world - the harsh winter storms have closed the place down. In the first two books by C.J. Box, (Open Season and Savage Run), we have been treated to mysteries with strong environmental themes. In Winterkill Joe turns his attention to a murder investigation and then a more pressing personal crisis.  <br /> <br />Joe Pickett is the game warden with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department living in the small town of Saddlestring, Twelve Sleep County. He is a quiet and easy-going family man, husband to Marybeth, father to 11 year-old Sheridan, 6 year old Lucy and foster-father to 9 year-old April. A fair, hard-working man he stands up for what he believes in even when that means leaving himself and, occasionally, his family open to get hurt.  <br /> <br />While out on his regular patrol one winter's day, Joe witnesses a hunter who flouts the 1 elk bag limit by running amok through a herd, taking down 7 animals before Joe can get to him. When he does he is shocked to find that the hunter is none other than Lamar Gardiner, the district supervisor for Twelve Sleep National Forest, the person who makes the hunting laws, not the person who breaks them. In a typically Joe Pickett moment, Lamar escapes his custody and rushes into the forest in the middle of a worsening snowstorm. By the time Joe finds him again, he has been brutally murdered.  <br /> <br />Coinciding with the murder is the arrival of a ragtag group of people in SUV's and camper-vans who take up residence in the National Park outside of town; they call themselves Sovereigns and are a mixture of anti-government protesters and dropouts. Among the Sovereigns is Jeannie Keeley, April's mother, a bitter and angry woman who abandoned April when she was a toddler. Joe and Marybeth are faced with the prospect of losing the little girl they had come to love as their own daughter.  <br /> <br />The murder results in the arrival of another Forest Service agent, Melinda Strickland, supposedly sent to investigate her fellow officer's death. But she's bad news, you can tell that straight away when, moments after being introduced to Joe he watches as she barely restrains from kicking her dog in a moment of anger. Dog-kicking proves to be the least of her sins though. She is a self-centered woman with little regard for the safety of others, a dangerous woman when dealing with murderers and harsh climactic conditions.  <br /> <br />Joe is dragged into the mess as a potential bloodbath looks a likely result of the standoff between the Sovereigns and the Federal Agents. To start with he is merely a concerned local citizen whose concern is primarily for a peaceful existence, but it becomes personal when April is placed right in the firing line inside the Sovereign camp.  <br /> <br />Winterkill starts out at a very relaxed pace and we are allowed to settle in and enjoy a snowed-in Christmas with the Picketts, giving us a chance to feel comfortable with them. We are also given ample opportunity to enjoy the descriptions of the spectacular scenery surrounding them. This soon changes to the mounting tension and frustration levels as Strickland and the feds take over the town. Finally, we are thrust into a dramatic race against time through atrocious conditions ensuring a breathless ending.  <br /> <br />It was established in the earlier books of the series that Joe Pickett is a \\"good\\" man. He always takes the passive option, often to his own detriment, and is ruled by his conscience. This is carried on in Winterkill, but it tends to restrict his effectiveness as a protagonist, particularly when he comes up against completely morally bankrupt people, as he does here. Enter a new character and eventual ally for Joe, Nate Romanowski. Nate oozes confidence and violence and adds a touch of the maverick for the good guys. He's a perfect foil to Joe's upstanding philosophy and, although we don't learn a lot about his past, every time he entered the scene he was a breath of fresh air.  <br /> <br />A murder investigation, a Ruby Ridge style stand-off on Battle Mountain and a desperate bid by a father to protect his daughter makes Winterkill a thrilling book. Add to that Box's ability to paint the Wyoming landscape with wonderful clarity that gave me a strong sense of place and you've got a very enjoyable book.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-24

From the turmoil of Belfast to the chaos of Harlem and a living hell in Mexico, every location is brought to vivid life thanks to McKinty's prose. Here is a gritty hardboiled story complete with violent gangsters and a desperate struggle for survival. It's a story of vengeance that is tough, uncompromising and grabs you demanding that you pay close attention.  <br /> <br />When Michael Forsythe leaves his home in Belfast, he is only 19 but is already a hard man, exposed to the gang violence that dominates his city. He arrives in New York where he is employed by crime boss Darkey White for whom he works as muscle to enforce his protection and loan shark rackets. While working for Darkey, Michael proves himself to be a dependable man to have around, earning the respect of all the other men in Darkey's crew. He's a violent man displaying an almost sociopathic lack of emotion after severely crippling another man in a cold-blooded revenge attack.  <br /> <br />The story is narrated by Michael and even while everything appears to be going well for him, he warns us of the events that are soon to follow. He points out the men he will kill and the way they will die, men he will later work for and the fact that his life is about to be drastically altered. These snapshots give us a chance to look forward, whetting our appetite for the major events that are still to take place.  <br /> <br />One of the things that is going well for him is a secret affair he is having with Bridget, Darkey's girlfriend. He is well aware that he would pay a high price should Darkey find out about it but he likes to flirt with danger and carries on regardless. Little is he to know that the \\"simple little job\\" he is sent to Mexico for is going to be that high price.  <br /> <br />This is a consistently fast-paced story concentrating on the cut-throat world of the small-time hoods of New York's Harlem and The Bronx. Smattered amongst the colourful descriptions of the neighborhoods in which Michael lives and works are some intense scenes that graphically demonstrate what a cold-blooded man he is. But for all of his violent tendencies he instills an aura of the underdog, a quality that makes you want to like him.  <br /> <br />His fellow Irish thugs are all young men who seem to be playing the part of hard men whereas Michael is the real deal. This is about as in-depth as McKinty allows the characterisation to go for Michael's partners - Scotchie, Fergal and Andy. We never really know much more about them than the fact that they are young hoods who talk big and act big when they're armed. A lot of this is because the story is told from Michael's perspective and is indicative of how little he bothers to get to know them.  <br /> <br />Dead I Well May Be is a book of two halves with the first all about survival on the New York streets fighting for territory from rival gangs, urban warfare among the slums and cockroaches with survival dependant not only upon who has the greater firepower, but also on who is prepared to use it. The second is a different kind of survival story as Michael's world completely crumbles in Mexico. He is now dependent on his will to live, mental toughness being the key to whether he will live or die. It's during these hard times through a series of flashbacks and hallucinations that we learn a lot about his background and the hardships that he endured as a boy in Belfast.  <br /> <br />A quick note about the violence in the book, even though it was mentioned earlier, it is worth warning again that some of it is quite extreme and is even more shocking by the suddenness in which it is inflicted. I read hardboiled crime stories all the time and I even found myself flinching once or twice at the descriptions of the punishment that was handed out.  <br /> <br />This taut thriller has announced Adrian McKinty as a crime writer to look out for, particularly for those who are looking for a wild ride through some of the meanest streets imaginable.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-24
343079:US	47964988	R2HLUBV8198T8G	0060544333	94870015	Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Outstanding  entry in an outstanding series	Strange Affair is the 15th book of the Inspector Banks series, an outstanding series of police procedural crime novels set in Yorkshire, England. In recent books, Banks has suffered some traumatic experiences, particularly at the end of the previous book, Playing With Fire . It seems to me that Peter Robinson has written Strange Affair as a sort of bridge to future Inspector Banks books and is one that will appeal mainly to the devoted fans of the Inspector Banks series.  <br /> <br />The fire that destroyed his house and put him in hospital 4 months previously has also affected DCI Alan Banks psychologically, sending him into a depression that he has trouble fighting through. When the story opens he is on an extended holiday which is interrupted when he receives a phone call from his brother Roy, who sounds as though he may be in some trouble. Alan and Roy have never been particularly close and Roy has always sailed close to the wind as far as his business dealings were concerned, but when Banks can't get in contact with him, he grows more than a little concerned. With nothing better to do, Banks sets off for London to find out what could make his brother sound so nervous.  <br /> <br />Back in Yorkshire, DI Annie Cabbott has been called to a murder scene on a quiet stretch of road where a young woman sits in her car, having been shot in the back of the head. It's bad enough find a murder victim on your patch, but is even more perplexing when absolutely no motive can be found for the killing. But the clincher that really attracts Annie's attention is the piece of paper found in the victim's back pocket with Banks' name and address written on it.  <br /> <br />The bulk of the story takes place in London with Banks' attempting to trace his brothers last known movements and Annie investigating the background of the dead woman. The focus of the story alternates between Banks and Cabbott and it soon becomes apparent that the two cases are connected: it's just a matter of time before the coppers from Yorkshire bump into each other in London.  <br /> <br />The majority of the books in the Inspector Banks series deals with police solving crimes by following a set of procedures, hence the description police procedural, and a great deal of each book is devoted to the crime itself. While Strange Affair contains an investigation that follows this style, the main focus is on the characters, their pasts and the way they have been affected by them. Banks goes through a re-evaluation of his life thanks to the disappearance of his brother and through the reaction of his parents. Annie brings to mind a couple of failed relationships, in particular her former relationship with Banks and the one that ended disastrously in Playing With Fire.  <br /> <br />Once Banks' state of mind has balanced itself again we are able to focus on a darn good mystery that ties Roy Banks in with the Yorkshire investigation conducted by Annie Cabbott. From a slow, careful and rather introspective beginning the story swells to an outstanding conclusion full of emotion that tests both Banks and Cabbott's self control.  <br /> <br />DCI Alan Banks reminds me a great deal of Ian Rankin's Inspector John Rebus. Both men prefer to work alone, reluctant to share their theories with their colleagues. Both are driven by their need to see justice done, allowing the job to take over their lives to the detriment of personal relationships. Heck, both men have a female subordinate who is the source of sexual tension to one degree or another. Both series are outstanding police procedural series featuring interesting, fully fleshed out characters.  <br /> <br />Peter Robinson has put a lot of effort into his characters, developing them painstakingly over the past 14 books and it continues in Strange Affair. Banks' past is hinted at as part of the explanation for his depression and a newcomer to the series could come along and enjoy this book, picking up on the tidbits from the pastand perhaps even finding their interest piqued enough to go back through the series and see how Alan Banks came to become a Detective Chief Inspector.	2005-02-20
346440:US	47964988	R19VONSDB29921	0316095656	443619920	Fleshmarket Alley	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Rebus is at his best	Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus series is now 15 books strong and probably stands at the top of the list of new releases that I look forward to each year. John Rebus is a CID detective with the Lothian and Borders Police in Edinburgh, Scotland. He's a driven, dedicated policeman who lives for his job and rarely rests until his case is solved. But for all his dedication he has always had a distinct disregard for his superiors with his unorthodox and preference for working in solitude regularly landing him in trouble.  <br /> <br />Faithful readers of the series will have noticed a gradual but definite change in John Rebus' personality (a necessity in the success of a long-running series). When we first met him in Knots and Crosses he was a tormented man who was trying to get over a failed marriage, invariably drinking himself to sleep, that is, when he could sleep at all, and seriously contemplating suicide. The overall mood was dark and depressing and worthy of the categorisation as Tartan Noir.  <br /> <br />A very notable change in Rebus came around 2 books ago in Resurrection Men and was continued in the Edgar Award winning A Question of Blood. He has become more open with his investigations, he has actually begun to socialise more often and is less inclined to drink himself into a stupor. As a matter of fact, at one point in Fleshmarket Alley he plays a practical joke on one of the junior police officers in the office, something that he would simply not have been capable of earlier in the series.  <br /> <br />One thing that has never changed has been Rebus' suspicion towards the people in power, be they his immediate superiors or politicians. His attitude is summed up in Fleshmarket Alley as he explains to another police officer:  <br /> <br />\\"I've got this theory, we spend most of our time chasing something called 'the underworld', but it's the overworld we should really be keeping an eye on.\\"  <br /> <br />To open Fleshmarket Alley we are greeted with a development that seems about par for the course in the life of John Rebus. He and DS Siobhan Clarke have been unceremoniously relocated from their familiar offices at St Leonards CID and reassigned to the nearby station at Gayfield Square. In even more typical fashion, Rebus is left without a desk from which to work.  <br /> <br />Carrying on regardless out of his new Gayfield Square digs he is loaned out to yet another station at West End to assist on the scene of a stabbing murder of a possible illegal immigrant in an apartment in Knoxland. Knoxland is a low-rent, low-class housing development that predominantly accommodates immigrants and the occupants regularly bear the brunt of racist attacks and taunts. The immediate suspicion is the attack was fuelled by racial hatred. Little does Rebus know that this case is about to open his eyes to the plight of the illegal immigrants in Scotland, particularly the women and children who are locked up in detention centres while awaiting a decision on whether they will be allowed to stay.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile Siobhan is asked by the parents of a girl who has disappeared to help them find her. Siobhan and the family have a history together after she worked on the rape case that subsequently resulted in the suicide of their oldest daughter. The difficulty for Siobhan lies in the fact that it's not an official missing persons case, so she has to be circumspect in her efforts, an attribute that comes straight out of the John Rebus handbook. A further sticking point in this tricky little subplot is the recent release of the man who raped the older daughter, a particularly nasty man who is not the least bit repentant for his crime. Just how Siobhan handles the situation marks her growing aptitude and highlights some of the skills she has picked up from Rebus.  <br /> <br />A third subplot involves both Rebus and Clarke as they are called out together to a pub undergoing renovations in Fleshmaket Alley. Discovered under the cellar of the pub are two skeletons raising all sorts of speculation over the pub's history. This seemingly unrelated case is going to prove to be important to the other cases they are working on - you can count on it.  <br /> <br />The Inspector Rebus series has become a consistently high-quality British police procedural with a smoothly ordered story that is developing the lives of the two main characters. Combined with the strong characterizations are interesting, thought-provoking crimes that often challenges Rebus' moral beliefs. Certainly this is the case in Fleshmarket Alley.  <br /> <br />Far from the dark atmosphere of the earlier Rebus books, this has a feeling of wry amusement about it, particularly notable is the almost legendary status Rebus has attained among his new colleagues at Gayfield Square and the liberties he takes with it. However at times, the mood sobers significantly as Rebus faces the fact that there are problems that he can't solve, such as the detention of refugees in prison-like conditions. Even more difficult for him to face is the realization that, as a policeman, he is seen as the enemy by the people with whom he empathizes so strongly.  <br /> <br />It is becoming more and more apparent that DS Siobhan Clarke is going to play much larger roles in future books, proving herself to be a perfect foil for Rebus' gruff, stand-offish exterior. That being said, she is beginning to take on a few Rebus-like qualities, a fact she comments on to herself with more than a little satisfaction. To this point their relationship has been kept on a professional level (with one exception that continues to confuse them), one feels that it's only a matter of time before a more personal side of their relationship will be explored.  <br /> <br />Ian Rankin has followed up his excellent, award winning A Question of Blood with another outstanding novel, one that has, I think, raised the bar even higher. Fleshmarket Alley is a book that followers of the series will love, but I think it will also appeal to those who have never read any of the earlier books too. <br /> <br />For some reason, the title of this book has been changed for the US market from Fleshmarket Close. The purpose? Who knows, but there you are just in case you find the \\"other\\" title. <br />	2005-02-17
346780:US	47964988	RH4EFUW2LIHAU	0312332459	614936079	Tonight I Said Goodbye (Lincoln Perry)	Books	4	9	10	N	N	An excellent debut	As Tonight I Said Goodbye was about to be released in mid-2004 I was hearing a lot of publicity and praise for the author, Michael Koryta The buzz began when the book won the 2003 St Martins Press PWA Prize for Best First PI Novel, a terrific achievement but made more notable by the fact that he was only 20 when he wrote the book. I was curious to find out whether the book would live up to the hype. My hopes were high and I'm pleased to say, I haven't been disappointed.  <br /> <br />Set in Cleveland and told from the first person perspective of Lincoln Perry, this is private investigator novel that runs along the well-worn tracks of many PI books that have come before it. Lincoln Perry is one half of Perry and Pritchard Investigations, the other half being his partner Joe Pritchard. They are a couple of ex-cops who make a good team combining Perry's youth with Pritchard's more than 50 years experience and level-headedness.  <br /> <br />As many private investigator stories do, Tonight I Said Goodbye opens with an interview with a prospective client who explains what he wants investigated. In this case John Weston wants Perry and Pritchard to investigate the circumstances surrounding his son Wayne's death and the disappearance of Wayne's wife and daughter. According to the police, they suspect Wayne of murdering his wife Julie and his daughter Betsy before killing himself. John Weston rejects this scenario out of hand insisting his son was murdered and that Julie and Betsy have been kidnapped.  <br /> <br />The fact that Wayne Weston was a top notch private investigator himself gives Perry and Pritchard an obvious starting point in their investigation. The assumption is that he got himself involved in a job that has resulted in retaliation. What they find when they look into his affairs is both surprising and very disturbing. One of his most recent clients - in multiple jobs - was one of the richest, most powerful men in Cleveland, impressive but not exactly earth-shattering. What really makes them sit up and take notice is an apparent involvement with the Russian mafiya. Put together they make a formidable group of people. Could his association with either of them gotten him killed?  <br /> <br />One further dead body later and the stakes have grown considerably. Lincoln and Joe begin to reconsider their involvement in the case. The FBI have moved in and are far from happy with the private investigators, they've been joined by Weston's former partner Aaron Kincaid and now it looks like they've got a Russian mafiya problem. On top of all that they are still no closer to finding Julie and Betsy Weston. But when they do get closer, that's when all hell breaks loose.  <br /> <br />I would put the tone of the book on the lighter side of hardboiled with subtle injections of humour through Perry's sharp tongue softening the mood. Neither PI carries any issues into the story, at least none of great note and although there are occasionally some violent scenes, Koryta doesn't get carried away with lurid descriptions designed to shock.  <br /> <br />Tonight I Said Goodbye is a plot-driven thriller that relies on the constant development of the investigation rather than on the characters doing the investigating. Very little effort is made to flesh out the characters of Lincoln Perry and Joe Pritchard apart from a brief background into how they came to be private investigators. As the first book in a series, I can understand and readily accept the establishment of Perry and Pritchard as outstanding detectives first and foremost. Hopefully we will learn more about them in future books, the little glimpse into their personal lives suggests that learning more will be rewarding, particularly when it comes to Pritchard.  <br /> <br />Koryta writes in an easygoing conversational style combining dialogue that flows nicely and rings true with a well-paced plot that appears to be straightforward but grows progressively involved as the investigation hits full swing. I enjoyed the interaction between the characters and, as I mentioned earlier, would have liked to have found out a little more about what makes them tick. One quick word on a character that I thought Koryta portrayed very well that I think a lot of authors do poorly and that was his handling of 6 year old Betsy. I thought he got her just right, both the dialogue she used and never acting beyond her years.  <br /> <br />Comparisons with other contemporary private investigator series are inevitable and I think Tonight I Said Goodbye stacks up well against some of the big names such as Robert Crais, Robert B. Parker and Harlan Coben. Perry is the smart-mouth of the outfit (he is to Koryta what Elvis Cole is to Robert Crais, Spenser is to Robert B. Parker and Myron Bolitar is to Harlan Coben). Joe Pritchard is the more serious half of the business and is something of an enigma, working with cool efficiency and occasional flashes of the sublime (a la Robert Crais' Joe Pike).  <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable debut mystery that delivers a solid introduction to Perry and Pritchard as well as a well-worked mystery and even a surprise or two at the end. It's the kind of page-turner that has left me eagerly awaiting the next book featuring the Cleveland detectives.	2005-02-17

This time around the West Yorkshire Police Force is faced with the gut-wrenching case of child abduction with the added possibility of a widely organised pedophile ring operating in the area. <br /> <br />The missing girl is 13 year old Sophie Kenyon the daughter of a prominent judge. Heading up the investigation is SIO John Munro who has just managed to get his career back on track after the devastation that followed the events that were chronicled in Phoenix. This operation is dubbed Operation Shade and will prove to be a particularly harrowing one for Munro and his officers. <br /> <br />While Operation Shade swings into action, Karen Sharpe has her own case to pursue. She meets with a woman who claims to have been abducted and raped 10 years ago as a 13 year old. She says that she has only just remembered the incident, her memory of it being prompted by seeing the man who assaulted her on television. Recovered memory cases are particularly difficult to prove at the best of times but this one will be even tougher for Sharpe because the man the woman is fingering is none other than local MP Geoffrey Reed. <br /> <br />A seemingly standard police operation takes on a new life when the deaths of witnesses and suspects send it and the investigating officers for a loop. When the Assistant Chief Constable insists that Karen Sharpe be included in Operation Shade she finds a kindred spirit in DC Pete Bains. Bains and Sharpe form a formidable partnership with both of them shying away from the usual teamwork style advocated by the force, preferring to pursue their own leads. Both seem to have a pathological aversion to answering their phone or beeper, and have a similar penchant operating outside the usual rules. A very refreshing pair when everyone else is restricted to the rules of a police procedural.  <br /><br />John Connor has continued from where he left off with Phoenix in this emotionally charged thriller. He has combined an emotion charged case that is pursued by the majority of the West Yorkshire Police Force with Karen Sharpe's own desperate fight against her demons.  <br /> <br />Karen's personal life has become even more complicated after being reunited with her daughter Mairead after Mairead's father was gaoled for life. It is the first contact that Karen has had with Mairead since she was born and Mairead is under the impression Karen is her aunt, an impression that Karen has not found a way to correct. A further problem is that Karen never finds time for her daughter, creating a guilt that continually gnaws at her. <br /> <br />This is a story that tears along at breakneck speed due to the desperate frenzy the investigating officers are whipped into as they race against time to find the missing girl. As the investigation proceeds and Karen Sharpe is eventually drawn into it, a larger, more intriguing and sinister web is revealed to take us to a heart-stopping conclusion. <br /> <br />Once again I think Connor has written a cleverly interwoven story featuring a protagonist who is one of the most pig-headedly determined cops I have come across. Although this proves to be to the detriment of the criminals she is chasing, it also proves to be to the detriment of her own personal life. As we go along, though, she is proving to be an increasingly fascinating character with more layers of her past being revealed to us. <br />	2005-02-08
358256:US	47964988	RXGMDLRUM3A21	0765307863	730536027	Shotgun Alley (Weiss and Bishop Novels)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Weiss and Bishop are back	Scott Weiss and Jim Bishop burst into the private investigation spotlight for the first time in the thrilling Dynamite Road . Together they form an unlikely but very effective combination, so effective that they have remained in business long enough to feature in Shotgun Alley, a sequel that picks up where Dynamite Road left off.  <br /> <br />Andrew Klavan has put an interesting spin on his hardboiled private detective series that just tweaks it a little to give it a refreshing nuance. It's not the investigative work that is carried out although they are very adept at their jobs and the action flows in waves; it isn't Weiss and Bishop's character traits or personalities, although they are very distinctive and well-developed; it's not even the way they operate, although undercover work has featured in both Dynamite Road and Shotgun Alley and is rich in suspense and intrigue. All of these qualities would have drawn me to the series anyway, but the quality that gives the series that little distinctive twist is that it is narrated by Andrew Klavan who is working as a young office clerk in Weiss's firm.  <br /> <br />Shotgun Alley is the name of a bar frequented almost exclusively by bikers and, in particular, by a group known as The Outriders. Not an official gang, they display no colours on their jackets, they are considered too violent and unstable to be part of the more formalised biker gangs. Scary thought, huh? They've already proven what they're capable of when Jim Bishop moves into their midst in a not-so-subtle way. The raw, tough, sneering persona of the biker outlaw comes easily to Bishop making him the ideal operative for the undercover job he has been assigned. His job in this case is to infiltrate this criminal crew and lure away the leader's girlfriend, Honey. Honey happens to be a rich man's daughter and he doesn't want her shenanigans jeopardising his future political plans. Yep, he's a sentimental, loving rich man.  <br /> <br />Bishop's operation isn't the only job keeping Weiss in business. The agency is also approached by Professor M.R. Brinks who has been receiving a long series of sexually explicit and harassing emails. She wants Weiss to find out who is sending them, claiming to be outraged and promising all sorts of repercussions. Weiss is not so sure about her real reasons for finding her cyber-stalker but takes the job.  <br /> <br />It's this job that Weiss gives the young Klavan his big chance to do some real detective work. Klavan confesses that as a fan of Chandler and Hammett he has always dreamt of becoming a private detective like Marlowe or Sam Spade. He idolises Weiss, pointing out that he's everything a hardboiled private detective should be, even down to the bottle of Macallan Whisky in the bottom drawer, and he's eager to impress him.  <br /> <br />So what is this Scott Weiss like anyway? According to Klavan he's a big ugly man with a paunch, basset hound features, mournful, world weary eyes and a habit of feeling sorry for everyone else. He has an uncanny knack for tracking people down and almost a second sight when it comes to problem solving (much to Jim Bishop's good fortune).  <br /> <br />Jim Bishop, on the other hand, is a dangerous dude who plays by his own rules. He's at his best when the adrenaline is pumping and all hell is about to break loose, which seems to be a regular state of affairs where he's concerned.  <br /> <br />Klavan's two protagonists are richly developed characters who are as vastly different to one another as it is possible to get, yet they manage to work together successfully, possibly because they rarely meet each other during the course of the story.  <br /> <br />The tone of the story maintains a dark and dangerous edge throughout as we live with the volatile bikers. You can sense the barely contained rage in every confrontation that Bishop has with Cobra, the gang's leader. Switching the focus across to Weiss doesn't lighten things any, either. He seems to wander around with a black cloud above his head and a hangdog expression on his face, sighing at every opportunity, to the point where it starts to become an amusing attribute of the man. He is constantly haunted by the spectre of Ben Fry, known as the Shadowman and acting as an ever-present threat to Weiss. This looming presence carries over from Dynamite Road and remains just beyond Weiss's peripheral vision, lurking as a constant reminder that he lives in a dangerous world. (Weiss would sigh heavily at this point...)  <br /> <br />Shotgun Alley is a hardboiled detective story that delivers a brooding story of gang violence highlighted by sudden scenes of frenetic action balanced with periods of introspection and self-absorption. Apart from a short section where Weiss's reflections become particularly tedious, the book maintains a solid pace that will be sure to keep all private detective fans glued to the pages.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-07

In essence what we witness is a man who will stop at absolutely nothing (and he goes through hell - believe me) in his bid to get his daughter back. I was starting to feel the effects of his struggle myself by the end of the book. <br />From the beachfront of Coney Island in the heart of Russian mafiya territory and on up to Yonkers The Con Man's Daughter is set in the darker, more dangerous neighborhoods of New York. This is a brooding novel with violence only a matter of eye contact with the wrong person away. Ed Dee immerses us in the dark world controlled by the Russian mafiya, visits with Italian gangsters and reminisces through an ex-cop who gladly bent the law whenever it suited him.  <br /> <br />Eddie Dunne is 54 years old, an ex-cop, a father and a grandfather. Since leaving the force he has worked a variety of jobs but the most notable was as a chauffeur for Anatoly Lukin, a Russian businessman considered by the police to be a crime lord.  <br /> <br />When Eddie Dunne witnesses the kidnapping of his daughter he can only think of one person who could be responsible. Yuri Borodenko is the powerful head of a Russian mafiya family that is taking control of the area around Coney Island in New York. He is in direct competition with Anatoly Lukin, Eddie's former boss. Could it be that Borodenko is finally repaying some kind of vendetta from the days he was involved in mafiya business?  <br /> <br />Eddie uses all of his experience as an ex-cop and his connections with the underworld to try to get a handle on where his daughter is being held. He has added motivation to find his daughter apart from the obvious fact that she's his daughter and he loves her very much, and that motivation comes in the form of his six year old grad-daughter Grace. He must be ever mindful that the Russians couldjust as readily snatch Grace as they did Kate.  <br /> <br /> When the days pass and no ransom demand or contact of any kind comes from the kidnappers, Eddie is forced to the conclusion that the kidnapping must be some sort of revenge against him for something he had done in the past. Important busts he made as a cop, criminals he once associated with, any number of things could be used as motivation against him. But which one is it? And how can he find out the answer?  <br /> <br />Rather than the more expected feeling of desperation that would normally be typical of a kidnapping case the pace of The Con Man's Daughter is more like the slow pacing of a caged tiger, filled with pent up energy and rage. His movements are controlled but rather than wait for instructions from the police or the FBI, he's just going to go ahead and solve this one on his own...in his own way.  <br /> <br />As Eddie gradually homes in on his daughter's captors you can sense that that energy that has slowly been leaking out is about to be unleashed in a terrible fury. Indeed, there is nothing subtle about Eddie's methods right from the start. He is not a believer in reasoning with someone when intimidation can be used just as effectively, or if that doesn't work then bribery may be used. Of course, he is not afraid to skip straight to the old \\"beat the information out of them\\" method.  <br /> <br />Ed Dee has mixed the dangerous world of the organized criminal with the close-knit law abiding family displaying a stark contrast between good and evil. But then he blurs that line through the persona of Eddie Dunne and the ramifications of his past that come back to haunt him. It's up to us to decide whether Eddie is a guilty man or a victim. <br />	2005-01-18

Noir themes dominate the story as all three men wrestle with their consciences, finding it difficult to live with the choices they have made or were forced to make. By the end of the story helpless despair has begun to take hold of each of these men.<br /><br />This is a crime novel that is dominated by a feeling of quiet desperation, a feeling that is generated through the lives of the three lead characters. Jake Arnott does an excellent job of recreating the mood and attitudes of London in 1966, giving the mood an avid, energetic atmosphere. It's an optimistic tone with which to open and one that is squashed pretty quickly.<br /><br />Arnott tells the story through the voices of his three main characters. Frank Taylor is a cop desperate to advance up the ranks of the police force but is all too aware of the corruption within the ranks and can't quite remove himself from the taint; Tony Meehan is a writer, a freelance journalist, but he harbours dark and very disturbing impulses and is able to identify all too easily with the crime figures he writes about; Billy Porter is an ex-army corporal, ex-convict, and small time crook who is about to become number one on the police hit parade because...He Kills Coppers.<br /><br />Its England 1966 and the police force are trying to stamp out the corruption that's running rampant in the city streets. We meet Frank Taylor, a young plain clothes detective on the police force's fast-track promotion scheme. He has been drafted into the taskforce charged with cleaning up the streets of London, more specifically, the clip joints of Soho where tourists are being regularly fleeced. You see, the soccer World Cup has come to London, bringing with it a healthy influx of tourists just begging to be robbed.<br /><br />But Frank soon discovers that the corruption has spread to the ranks of the police force and much to his disappointment in himself, he decides that it's easier to go along and accept the dirty money that comes his way rather than risk setting himself apart from his fellow officers. This is a decision that will haunt him through the years covered by the story. The murder of 3 fellow police officers gives him his focus pushing him to strive for promotion in order to solve the case. Part of his motivation is an inescapable feeling of guilt over the death of one of the slain cops.<br /><br />Freelance reporter Tony Meehan is an unusual character in the story, seemingly having no real relevance to the main story other than to somehow provide a link between the police and the criminals they are chasing. Meehan though is a troubled man, haunted by the sinister thoughts that he winds up fighting his whole life. However, Tony Meehan remains an enigma in He Kills Coppers. A reporter with secrets and with issues that are never resolved, without fail the sections that spotlight him have a decided noirish quality to them.<br /><br />Billy Porter is a man on the run. He starts out as a lost soul who then tries to lose himself physically as the police net closes around him. He's a tragic figure with whom I was surprised to find that I felt sympathy for, even though he was a killer with little or no conscience. Like with Meehan and Taylor, we learn all about Billy Porter inside and out, giving us a full understanding of what motivates him and what has brought him to the desperate point in his life in which he has arrived. More than anything else, it is Jake Arnott's characterisations that makes this an involving story.<br /><br />He Kills Coppers starts at a furious rate with the hustle and bustle surrounding the World Cup, the clean up of the streets of London and then the massive manhunt for the killer of 3 cops. But the story eventually settles down to focus on effect the early events would have on the lives of the central characters.<br /><br />Initially the narration is a little confusing as Arnott uses multiple voices to tell the story with the point of view changing several times in each chapter. I found, though that I quickly settled into the routine of changing voices following an asterisk in the middle of a paragraph break. Once I understood that the story would be told on three fronts I found that it was effective mechanism that was nicely controlled by the author.is a little confusing as Arnott uses multiple voices to tell the story with the point of view changing several times in each chapter.

411086:US	47964988	R2D62XQWTGF2LZ	0044422776	308026149	The Case of the Chinese Boxes (Allen & Unwin Original Fiction)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Crime in Chinatown	Following on from THE LIFE AND CRIMES OF HARRY LAVENDER, the book that introduced tough Sydney private investigator Claudia Valentine comes this second book in the series, THE CASE OF THE CHINESE BOXES. It's now 1988, the year of Australia's Bicentennial and there's a lot of celebrating going on. But the National Australia Bank aren't celebrating. They've just been knocked over in one of the biggest, most daring robberies in Australia's history and the fall-out is about to land in Claudia's lap. Like the first book it's a traditional PI story that starts out with few leads before careful digging unearths an unexpected twist and some villains not happy with the attention.  <br /> <br />Claudia is hired by Charles Chen and his mother Victoria to recover a lost key that had been stolen from a bank safe deposit box during a recent daring bank robbery. The key is particularly ornate and apparently opens some traditional Buddhist Chinese Boxes, but more importantly, is a symbol of the family's power and standing in the community. This case will not only take Claudia out of her comfort zone and into the underworld dominated by the dangerous Chinese Triads who rule Chinatown, but it will also take her to parts of Sydney that she never knew existed and, for her own safety, perhaps wished she still didn't know.  <br /> <br />Not only does Claudia have to contend with an unknown enemy who, at one point, thoughtfully slips a warning message inside her fortune cookie, but she finds that she is working for a client who is very unwilling to provide her with any details that might prove helpful in solving the case. Claudia has to resort to some pretty unorthodox investigative methods before she begins to achieve results.  <br /> <br />As a consequence, for much of the story we are carried along while waiting for something to happen. Because the case is fairly vague and clues are hard to come by, Claudia - to invoke a relevant metaphor - is left to poke at the dragon in the hope that it might wake and try to bite her. The result is a case that shoots off into a completely unexpected direction dragging an unwilling private investigation along with it.  <br /> <br />Many of the characters who were introduced in Harry Lavender returned to assist Claudia with this case too, but author Marele Day didn't think to reintroduce those characters to us. So unless you had just finished the first book or had a particularly good memory, you wouldn't know who these characters were or how they fit into Claudia's life. I had only finished Harry Lavender a month before reading this and I was still struggling to recall who some of the vaguely familiar characters were.  <br /> <br />A delightful addition to the story is Hong Kong based visitor James Ho, a flirtatious nuisance who quickly becomes the bane of Claudia's life with his unexpected appearances and amusingly obvious suggestions. Claudia's annoyance and discomfort around Ho provides for some lighter moments in an otherwise dangerous and serious case. But Ho is also the holder of some of the more tantalising secrets in this story and proves to be an exceptional private investigator in his own right.  <br /> <br />This is an intriguing investigation that displays Claudia Valentine's ingenuity and dogged determination. She takes us on a visit into Sydney's Chinese community, faces down a Triad member or two, makes contact with the most talked about bank robber in the country and crosses swords with a visiting P.I.	2004-12-27

Why would someone murder a harmless old woman? Ok, she was a bit of a busybody and some people could find her loud nature abrasive but surely that's no reason to top the old dear.  <br /> <br />The case is Detective Kathy Kolla's to investigate but she is a little perturbed to find Detective Chief Inspector David Brock of Scotland Yard's Serious Crimes Branch has been called in to assist. Brock is widely admired as being an excellent detective, having solved some very high profile cases but Kolla can't work out why he would be assigned to such a low profile case such as this.  <br /> <br />The thought processes of Scotland Yard's powers that be aside, Kolla and Brock begin their investigation in the apartment of Meredith Winterbottom, the aforementioned dead woman. She lived with her two sisters, Eleanor and Peg and the three of them are part of a small, rather isolated and insular London neighbourhood referred to as Jerusalem Lane. The neighbourhood is made up of an aging population, mainly refugees from Central Europe and at first glance it looks as though the residents all get on well together.  <br /> <br />At first glance...  <br /> <br />But an interesting fact about these people is unearthed in the course of the investigation. Almost to a person they are selling up their businesses and houses and leaving the neighbourhood. A developer is buying out Jerusalem Lane with plans of building a huge new business complex on the site. The only people who have refused to sell are Meredith, Eleanor and Peg.  <br /> <br />Jerusalem Lane provides a number of suspects, both likely and unlikely, as does the stubborn immovability of the sisters in the face of the developers who want to buy their house. Speaking of the sisters, as the name of the book suggests, they are great-granddaughters of Karl Marx, the letters and inscribed books they have inherited could also be reason enough to motivate someone to murder.  <br /> <br />DS Kolla and DCI Brock move steadily through the case rarely wavering into possible distractions of personal lives. While this keeps the story moving nicely it also means we learn very little about the two main characters. In fact, David Brock remains just as enigmatic at the end of the book as he was when he was first introduced, the longest description of the man came as the rumours that Kathy Kolla had heard about him.  <br /> <br />The rapport between Kolla and Brock is one of the more appealing aspects of the book. They combine nicely as a team together to ensure that the investigation runs smoothly. The determined and driven Kolla pushes forward as hard as she can at every opportunity while the laid back experience of Brock throttles back the investigation at just the right time. It's a combination that I thought worked very well.  <br /> <br />One aspect of many police procedurals that often drives me crazy but is thankfully missing in The Marx Sisters is any suggestion of police bureaucracy or political game-playing by the senior officers. The focus is always on the investigation which I found particularly refreshing and enabled the momentum of the story to be maintained throughout.  <br /> <br />Far from being a single-dimensioned murder mystery, The Marx Sisters is a complex story with layer upon layer of unexpected twists told in an engaging style. Barry Maitland has started the Kathy Kolla and David Brock series with an outstanding story.	2004-12-27

Understandably the focus of thriller writers has made a definite shift towards incorporating the threat of terrorism into their storylines. In Night Fall, Nelson DeMille uses terrorism as the central theme to great effect firstly as a potential threat and then as an actual event.  <br /> <br />The crash of TWA Flight 800 off the Long Island coast on July 17 1996 was ruled an accident by investigators, faulty wiring causing a spark in an empty fuel tank was said to have ignited fuel vapors. 200 eyewitness reports suggest that a more sinister cause of the crash took place that night. Were they all wrong or has there been a monumental cover up by the FBI who controlled the scene?  <br /> <br />John Corey (Plum Island and The Lion's Game) returns and is now working for the Anti-Terrorist Task Force, an agency that places him under the FBI. Readers of the earlier John Corey books will be aware of the deep suspicion and animosity he holds for most FBI agents and the fact that he is working more closely than ever with them only sharpens the acerbic wit with which he attacks.  <br /> <br />The irony of Corey's antagonism towards all things FBI? He is now married to Special Agent Kate Mayfield of the FBI - a nice little trick played on him by Demille.  <br /> <br />It's actually Kate who piques her husband's interest in the TWA crash 5 years after the event. She was part of the investigation team interviewing witnesses and wasn't happy with the eventual finding. Officially she was told to forget the case. Officially she was ordered to speak to no-one about what she found while investigating. Officially she complied with that order. Unofficially she just happened to show her husband a few relevant pieces of evidence, let him listen to a credible eye-witness or two...basically, wind him up and let him go.  <br /> <br/>Essentially this is a cold case investigation with the edge provided by the fact that Corey and his wife had been ordered not to touch it. The tension is provided by Corey's paranoia that the FBI were about to bust his investigation wide open and he and his wife would pay the consequences.  <br /> <br />Maybe so, but I was hoping for a bit more. Readers who have enjoyed the earlier John Corey books Plum Island and The Lion's Game will be pleased to see that his wiseguy humour is as strong as ever. As far as the tension and drama goes, Night Fall falls well short of the earlier books. The pace is of a moderate police procedural as Corey assembles evidence and runs down leads and interview statements. The threat of FBI involvement feels neither insidious nor real.  <br /> <br />The major problem I had with the book was over the premise that was holding the whole thing together. John Corey is trying to expose a major cover-up of the cause of an aircraft crash, yet there is never a suggestion that there might be a compelling reason for the cover-up. Pretty unbelievable considering the lengths that the FBI has supposedly gone to.  <br /> <br />Finally, a quick word on the ending. I thought from a long way out that it was painfully obvious how the book was going to end and I hoped I was wrong. Unfortunately I wasn't. Personally, I find it disappointing to get the feeling that I could have written an ending myself and this one was a bit of a let down.	2004-12-27
411683:US	47964988	R1R7TVQKEVEWLW	186373323X	319085588	The Last Tango of Dolores Delgado	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Danced To Death	Right up until the moment Dolores Delgado dropped dead on the dance floor, Claudia Valentine really enjoyed working as the dancer's minder. Claudia Valentine, the sassy Sydney private investigator who was introduced to us in The Life and Crimes of Harry Lavender and then returned in The Case of the Chinese Boxes, hits us again with a 3rd perplexing mystery in The Last Tango Of Dolores Delgado.  <br /> <br />Before Dolores died, Claudia thought that she had gotten to know the dancer pretty well, after all she had been her confidante and constant companion for over 2 weeks, rarely parting from each others company. But while investigating her death it becomes apparent that Dolores kept some pretty mind-boggling secrets and as Claudia keeps digging the more amazing the secrets become. The more Claudia learns though, the more dangerous she is to Dolores' killer, potentially putting her own head on the chopping block.  <br /> <br />Claudia takes the unusual step of disguising herself as her former employer in a bid to fool the killer into thinking he had failed in his first murder attempt and would try again. A good but dangerous plan. In her efforts to flush the killer out she also manages to see a lot of Sydney, thus providing the reader with a comprehensive tour of Sydney city and all points west to the suburb of Lidcombe (made doubly interesting to me because this was the suburb in which I grew up).  <br /> <br />When going through Dolores' things while \\"being Dolores\\" it doesn't take long for Claudia to realise that she didn't really know the woman she was minding nearly as well as she thought she did. In fact, it begins to look as though Dolores Delgado was up to all sorts of mischief and it may very well have resulted in getting her killed.  <br /> <br />One small problem I had with the book was that, at times, I felt the pace was inordinately slow due to Claudia's reluctance to take action in many situations. Too many times, rather than take the initiative and forcing things to happen, potentially exciting encounters were allowed to simply fizzle out as she decides to give up a chase or not to chase at all, or she allows herself to be followed without confronting her pursuer.  <br /> <br />Claudia Valentine remains an engaging character combining an admirable air of self-assurance with a quick wit. Sadly for her she's nowhere near as funny as she thinks she is with her clever one-liners falling like lead balloons to a consistently unappreciative audience, much to her chagrin and our amusement. When trying to compare her with some of the more well-known female P.I.'s I would say she reminds me most of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone and Sara Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski. She's a dogged, determined investigator who doesn't know how to give in and has the toughness to take care of herself should it come to a fight.  <br /> <br />For the most part, the tone of Claudia's narration remains light and breezy. Even when she finds herself in a dangerous situation she invariably points out a humorous aspect to her dilemma. This use of humour is actually a clever device that serves to highlight when things become truly ominous and all signs of humour evaporate and a definite sense of desperation creeps in.  <br /> <br />As a long-time Sydneysider I enjoyed following Claudia around the suburbs of Sydney and felt that Marele Day managed to capture the different moods of each suburb perfectly. From the trendy heart of Kings Cross with its shabby underbelly out west to the working class Five Dock and back to the more exclusive beach front of Coogee, the description of each part of Sydney is spot on - even down to the different class of graffiti adorning each area.  <br /> <br />From a low-key beginning triggered by an untimely death, The Last Tango Of Dolores Delgado grows into a pot-boiler with more than one surprise twist along the way.	2004-12-27

The Disappearances of Madalena Grimaldi finds Claudia hard at work on a missing person case during one of Sydney's hottest and most brutal summers in living memory. Claudia Valentine is a private investigator living and working in Sydney, Australia. She's tough, quick-witted and independent and has been a very enjoyable protagonist to get to know over the previous 3 books.  <br /> <br />The person Claudia is hired to find is a 15 year old schoolgirl named Madalena Grimaldi who, it appears, has run away from home after a disagreement with her father. Not as straightforward as it first sounds, she was staying with some friends in a share house for a while before she disappeared a second time. It's the second disappearance that is cause for concern. Who is she hiding from? What made her run again? Where would she hide? Or was there an even more sinister reason for her to vanish?  <br /> <br />From Lugarno in Sydney's south all the way in to Kings Cross in the dingy heart of the city and even under Sydney's streets, Claudia covers an awful lot of territory in her search for Madalena. But she finds her focus distracted by some unexpected news.  <br /> <br />The subplot that runs parallel to the main case is an issue that has been present on the periphery of Claudia's thoughts through each of the previous 3 books. The question of what became of her father after he walked out on her and her mother when Claudia was 5 years old has been constantly nagging at her. By all reports he had become one of Sydney's many homeless deros living rough on the streets. Finally, it looks as though she may have a chance at finding out what really became of him.  <br /> <br />Set during the Sydney bushfires of January 1994, Marele Day uses the backdrop of a hot, dry city constantly shrouded in smoke and ringed by bushfires to help create the atmosphere of a grim, desolate landscape in whichClaudia had to work. Her feelings of desperation during both her personal and professional searches confirm this background very effectively.  <br /> <br />Consequently, compared to the earlier books in the series, the mood here is a little more subdued. I had the impression that Claudia was playing for higher stakes, particularly seeing as one half of her investigation was very personal for her. There are still traces of the wry humour that endeared us to her in the earlier books, it's just tinged with a more sober realisation that failure will have a profound emotional effect on her. Through her desperate search we get an even more complete picture of Claudia Valentine, revealing her weaknesses and fears whereas in the past we only really ever encountered her strengths.  <br /> <br />This is a typical private investigator story with the usual methods of scouring the streets for clues, discreet surveillance jobs and the over-consumption of alcohol by the protagonist taking place. But then a plunge into some of Sydney's more unsavoury sections plus a flirt with organised crime completes an emotional finale to the book.  <br /> <br />	2004-12-27

In his debut novel, Michael Herrmann has woven a lurid tale where duplicitous deceit, double-cross and evangelical fervor spread over 17 years will bubble and ferment before producing a cataclysmic finale.  <br /> <br />In an unnamed Australian city in an unnamed Australian state in 1969 a devious fraud plot suddenly falls apart. Reverend Reginald Hamilton, the Investment Manager for the Church of the Second Coming has found himself in the middle of a nasty case of embezzlement that is about to be exposed. While he's not the most scrupulous of characters at the best of times he realizes that ultimately, it's his lap into which the responsibility is going to fall. Together with Miss Kiki Lowenthal (billed here as the World's Greatest Christian) they desperately devise a plan - very poorly I might add - to get them out of the trouble that appears to be inevitable.  <br /> <br />For you see, Reverend Hamilton answers to a higher power, a force that must be respected and honored lest his furious wrath be reigned down upon them. Of course, I'm referring to state Premier Jonathan Price, on whose behalf the fraud is taking place. Price vows that the fallout from this failed embezzlement will not include him and goes into damage control. Unfortunately for his co-conspirators, damage control means no witnesses and a series of nasty accidents are about to descend on the otherwise quiet tourist city.  <br /> <br />After the debacle of 1969 we fast forward to 1986 to find that it's the night before the state elections and Sir Jonathan Price is on the verge of winning an unprecedented 11th term. But, man oh man, is there some trouble brewing out there! Not the least of this trouble is a daring attempt by the TLC (that's the Transglobal Lesbian Coalition in case ya didn't know) to blow up the Big Passionfruit. Furthermore, the ramifications from the 1969 fiasco are about to finally come back to bite Price firmly on the bum. Price is also up against one Mark Throdeus, adopted son of the ill-fated Miss Kiki Lowenthal and a man who would dance with glee over the prospect of bringing the unscrupulous Premier down. The result is utter chaos on election day with our attention madly flicking from the Big Passionfruit to the polling booths to journalist Ray Montego, who is about to uncover the state's biggest story of the year.  <br /> <br />Billed as being set in \\"a city in the tropics\\" with numerous drawings of bananas interspersed through the pages I think it would be safe to assume that the action takes place in Queensland. Certainly the idea of a giant piece of fruit as a tourist attraction lends itself to that part of the world..ahem.  <br /> <br />Big Jesus Trash Can is a wildly amusing story that is rather reminiscent of Carl Hiaasen or Elmore Leonard's Florida books. It's tinged with just a hint of mania, with the characters skewed ever so slightly to give them a not quite right feeling. All of this aids the comedic aspect of the story as Herrmann casts an ironical eye over the subjects of religion, dirty politicians (excuse the tautology) and the newspaper business. He manages to hit the bulls-eye time and again through his deeply flawed characters, characters who I found it all too easy to compare to some real-life stinkers, to Herrmann's credit.  <br /> <br />I only have one point of annoyance and that was the lack of quotation marks around the dialogue which made it difficult to distinguish from the narration of the story.  <br /> <br />This is Volume I of the White Trash Trilogy with Volume II already released and titled breakfastinfur. It introduces us to a darkly humorous Australian city where normalcy can just be glimpsed over there on the horizon. I thought it was good fun all round. <br /> <br/>	2004-11-29

Samantha Kincaid is a Deputy District Attorney with the DA's office in Portland, Oregon and has just been promoted to the Major Crimes Division, the team that investigates and prosecutes homicide cases. She is thrown straight into the deep end with this case, her first after the trauma of the previous book.  <br /> <br />The case starts out as a missing person case, made high profile because the missing person was Appeals Court judge Clarissa Easterbrook. Samantha is given the assignment of lending reassurance to Clarissa's husband. Townsend. It's not long before the missing person case turns into a murder case when Clarissa's body is found. The fact that it is a judge who has been murdered gives the case added importance and, for Samantha, added pressure. But this is the kind of case that Samantha thrives on and is eager to prove that she's up to the challenge that her new promotion has provided.  <br /> <br />Although a suspect is charged and the legal proceedings get underway with Kincaid prosecuting, Samantha comes across evidence that casts doubt on her own case. Apart from the obvious problems involved with sabotaging her case, Samantha isn't quite sure exactly how it all ties together and so begins running her own investigation, by necessity without police help because by this stage it is officially a closed case. The progress she makes is slow and, at times confusing, and is also at the expense of a few high profile toes, arousing the interest of the DA, making for a few fiery confrontations.  <br /> <br />This story boils down to one question: why would an Appeals Court judge be murdered? In trying to answer this question, Samantha will risk her career, her personal relationships and even her life in an effort to find out.  <br /> <br />MISSING JUSTICE establishes the toughness and resourcefulness of Samantha Kincaid in numerous ways both large and small. From hustling down to someone's office after they've refused to take her phone calls to meet them face to face, to making plea bargain deals without consulting her boss, she's a rule-breaking breath of fresh air. Consequently, a lot of the drama is played out within the offices of the District Attorney as she settles into her new job. Her willingness to step outside the accepted boundaries normally obeyed by a Deputy District Attorney makes for a volatile workplace, but it's this characteristic that makes this book, and the ongoing series, enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Insinuated between the time spent on the trial and the unofficial investigation is the further development of her romance with Major Crimes Unit detective Chuck Forbes, providing the romantic interlude that seems to be de rigueur for thrillers with female protagonists. It's a sub-story that serves to display Samantha's more vulnerable side. This, along with some touching moments with her father, helps to fill in her past a little more and I now feel as though I am tied to her more emotionally.  <br /> <br />I found that as the case progressed it began to get very complex with the introduction of a lot of new names making it difficult to keep track of who was doing what to whom and how their inclusion fitted. At times I was scratching my head wondering why Samantha was getting so excited over a piece of information that seemed innocuous to me. What I'm trying to say is that it's essential to pay very close attention to the story and it's rather intricate plot.  <br /> <br />MISSING JUSTICE is a solid sequel to JUDGMENT CALLS combining interesting and informative courtroom scenes, a strong point of Alafair Burke's, with an intricate plot and a thrilling ending. It's fast-paced thanks to the no-nonsense style of Samantha Kincaid and tempered with a sprinkling of subtle humour.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-02

Each of the attacks was simple yet untraceable and devastatingly effective resulting in the loss of many lives. The disturbing fact for the British Police Force is that the intelligence gathered by MI5 indicates that the Black Spirit's next attack is likely to occur somewhere on British soil.<br /><br />Raymond Ash is a bored English teacher suffering the sleep deprivation that comes with living with a 3 month old baby with colic. One day while sitting in Aberdeen airport imagining what it might be like to just chuck it all in and jump on a plane out of there, he is startled to see his room-mate from his college days walking through the terminal. The reason for his surprise is that the guy had died in a plane crash 3 years ago. From this innocuous sighting, Raymond is about to have a very bad couple of days and a whole new appreciation of how fortunate he was to have led such a boring life.<br /><br />The main storyline is set in Scotland with much of the dialogue spoken in Scottish slang for an authentic (although at times hard to understand) feel. We are slowly led towards the terrorist's target and the \\"against all odds\\" attempts by an unlikely bunch of \\"heroes\\" to avert a full on disaster. Along the way, Christopher Brookmyre has a habit of punctuating his story with a constant stream of asides, anecdotes, character introductions and histories. These interjections are both amusing and entertaining but they tended to break the flow of the story and occasionally made it a little hard to follow at times.<br /><br />This minor inconvenience is offset by the enormous wealth of background information we get about each of the central characters. Whether it's an explanation on how a low-level marketing guy with a failed attempt at a rock career could become a deadly international terrorist or an interlude to reminisce about Raymond Ash's school days, Brookmyre has a flair for executing with an entertaining delivery. One thing's for sure, thanks to the plentiful supply of anecdotes throughout, we know all of the central characters inside and out. We care about them, we can identify with them and we can understand how they're feeling during the more stressful scenes. And believe me, towards the end of the book there are plenty of stressful moments.<br /><br />When the finale takes place, it's inside a large complex and was rather reminiscent of some of the Matthew Reilly books that rely on action at all costs and a suspension of disbelief to ensure that a wild ride is had by all. It's a complete change to the way the first three quarters of the book was written, but it certainly entertained. One problem I had was in the convoluted description of the layout of the complex and where all the characters were in relation to one another. This part was crying out for an illustrated layout to be included a la Reilly or Clive Cussler.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoys a humorous mystery that makes light of the more serious global concerns we face today, Christopher Brookmyre's A BIG BOY DID IT AND RAN AWAY is extremely satisfying. I have heard him compared to Carl Hiaasen both for his humour and his more serious underlying themes and I would have to agree with the comparison.

They meet every Thursday night with their psychologist in the back room of a restaurant where they discuss their failed relationships and try to offer each other support and understanding. <br /> <br />One night, after a particularly emotional meeting, the unthinkable happens and one of the men decides it's time to confront the woman who caused him so much heartache. The result is a most brutal murder and you get the sense that a monster has been unleashed on the streets of New York City. <br /> <br />Taking the case is Conrad Voort, a millionaire homicide cop, and his equally affluent partner Mickie. Their investigation begins perfectly normally although they are hampered by a distinct lack of clues apart from the letters BHC gouged into the victim's kitchen table. On the part of Voort and Mickie we are taken through the standard police procedure of tracking down known friends and enemies and paper trails. Progress is slow until victim number 2 is found. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, we're made privy to the build-up to each murder as we sit in on each meeting of the Broken Hearts Club and the emotion that starts to simmer as each man recounts his tale of woe at the hands of a heartless woman. The inevitability of the trip to each woman's apartment each week is terrible in the knowledge of how the visits will end. <br /> <br />As I said earlier, the premise of the book is good, but there are problems that I found annoying at first and then later had me just plain frustrated. To start with, Black has decided to include graphic sex scenes between Voort and his girlfriend which, while it doesn't offend me at all, was completely irrelevant to the story. Sex scenes are fine with me if they're in context with the story but the detail used here was reminiscent of some of the stuff found in Penthouse Forum - and about as believable too. <br /> <br />I feltcoincidence played too large a part in the investigation, so much so that I found myself rolling my eyes as yet another improbable lead resulted in a home run for the police. I put this down to clumsy plotting and was just a little disappointed that it seemed unlikely that I was going to be wowed by the police work. The disappointment flowed through to the ending which I felt was built on glaringly obvious plot holes in an attempt to force the feeling of tension so much so that rather than build tension, I found that I was frustrated to distraction by the contrived nature of the final showdown. <br /> <br />THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB is Ethan Black's debut novel, but apart from an interesting opening premise, it is hampered by clumsy plotting, needlessly graphic scenes and a twist that was revealed way too early in the book. All in all I was disappointed with THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB. The idea of a wealthy homicide cop who has the means to circumvent authority has the potential to be quite refreshing compared with the majority of stories featuring over-worked underpaid cops who deal with personal issues that invariably lead to broken marriages and drinking problems. <br />	2004-10-15

One night while sitting in his long-time friend Jojo's bar, Jojo's wife Loretta drags Travers aside to ask him to find her brother for her. She had recently received a visit from a couple of men looking for him and wanted to make sure he was alright. However, the word was that her brother, broken down soul legend Clyde Jones had died recently in Memphis where he had been living as a homeless shell of a man. No one could confirm Clyde's death for him when Travers asked around, in fact, his questions made some people downright uncomfortable. <br /> <br />Meanwhile in Tunica a young woman by the name of Abby who is still trying to come to grips with the murder of her father and mother is being stalked by Perfect Leigh. Perfect works for Levi Ransom a member of the Dixie mafia and a very dangerous man. Abby is eventually captured and is in the process of being interrogated, none too gently, when Nick's path crosses hers in dramatic circumstances, immediately casting him as her knight in shining armor and Ransom's bitter enemy. <br /> <br />The story quickly progresses from a missing person's case to a fight for survival as Nick gets caught between the Dixie mafia and a white supremist group who call themselves the Sons of the South. Apart from a small continuity problem towards the end where we seemed to jump from scene to scene without any logical reason, this is another enthralling music-base mystery. <br /> <br />Ace Atkins is starting to make a habit of coming up with some very off-beat characters to play his villains, rather reminiscent of James W. Hall and his unique portrayal of rogues. In his previous book, LEAVIN' TRUNK BLUES, Atkins introduced us to Annie and Fannie, a couple of killer prostitutes with a love of Archie comics and, in Annie's case, a special relationship with her knife. Now, in DARK END OF THE STREET we get a hit man who is not only a devotee of Elvis Presley but who believes Elvis is a divine being. Although the man is obviously an efficient and remorseless killer it's rather difficult to take a man seriously when he's kneeling and praying to his higher being, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br />He has also done a terrific job of capturing the atmosphere of Memphis through the style of music Travers recalls, the bars he frequents on Beale Street and the house styles that are noted as he moves through the city. I enjoyed experiencing the feeling of visiting Memphis almost as much as the story around which the visit was based. <br />	2004-10-11

Like his first book it is set in Brooklyn and features homicide prosecutor Andrew Giobberti. Also, like his first book, SEMIAUTOMATIC focuses heavily on the legal system and the faith that the central characters place in it. <br /> <br />It's been eighteen months since the events of HOLLOW POINT took place and Andrew Giobberti has been removed from his position in the DA's Homicide Bureau to the safer, more sedate dead end that is the Appeals Bureau. But now the DA has decided that Gio has served his penance and is now ready to prosecute homicide cases again. <br /> <br />The homicide case in question is the shooting of the owner of a bodega by a young black man who was robbing the store. At first glance it looks like a straightforward case with a witness who has identified Haskin Pool, the defendant, and is willing and able to testify to what he saw. But after reading through the case records, Gio can't help but feel that there is something more to the case that he's not been told about. <br /> <br />Gio is taking over the case from Laurel Ashfield, a young prosecutor who has been recently appointed to the Homicide Bureau. Laurel had worked the case from the moment it broke until trial only to have Gio brought in to take over at the last minute. Gio expects her to be resentful of him for being bumped to second chair, but surprisingly she is anything but. The reason that she's not is the big mystery of the story. It starts out as a nagging itch but soon leads to the greatest cause for division between the two lawyers.  <br /> <br />This is a rather unusual book because although it revolves around a murder trial and features the prosecuting attorney who is trying the case, we never really experience any of the usual courtroom drama scenes. The only time the courtroom comes into play is in between sessions with Gio and Laurel discussing points of the case. As each day's proceedings actually begin we invariably fade to black and then cut to a later scene outside the court.  <br /> <br />Social and moral values are put under the microscope as arguments from the younger, idealistic but rather nave Laurel are countered by the more seasoned and realistic Gio. Reuland concentrates more on emotions and personalities pushing this mystery into a category beyond the mere legal thriller standing. It's dark, confrontational and proceeds to grab your attention as the true story of the case gradually unfolds. <br />	2004-10-10

It may not be the first book of its kind but it's certainly the earliest that I can remember reading and is a terrific study of the interactions of a diverse group of individuals who are all dependent on one another for the success of their operation. <br /> <br />We are softened up right at the opening of the book with a statement from the new Chief of Police acknowledging that the crime rate in their (unnamed) city was at disturbing levels. He follows this up by vowing that he was going to make a difference and clean up the city while he was running the police force. <br /> <br />We switch over to the criminals where a plan is being organised by a mastermind criminal known as Herr Doktor, a very unlikely looking little man who has just been released from prison. Doc is after three reliable men to help him carry out his plan and asks a small-time bookie named Cobby for help assembling them. Cobby's link to Doc is through Doc's cellmate from prison. The plan that Doc has cooking is of a jewellery heist that could be worth half a million dollars. <br /> <br />They recruit Gus, a small hunchbacked man with a bad temper as their driver, Louis \\"Schemer\\" Bellini as their lockman and the largely unknown quantity of a man named Dix as their muscle. They then turn to a crooked lawyer named Emmerich to stake the operation. Emmerich is well known in criminal circles for his wealth and tight lips, but little do the conspiring thieves know that his fortune has dwindled to the point where he is now just about broke. The prospect of such a huge take is almost too much for Emmerich to conceal his enthusiasm agreeing to finance the operation while secretly planning a double cross would solve his financial woes. <br /> <br />Even though the planning is impeccable, problems occur during the heist and the way in which the makeshift team works together is critical to their success. It's this aspect of the story that becomes the main focus once the robbery is over and the pressure of evading an ever tightening police dragnet is applied. <br /> <br />W.R. Burnett has written a wonderful story of desperation, deception and mistrust set in a gritty world of tough criminals and equally tough cops. He has given his caper the suitably dark setting of a brooding city rife with corruption as he dangles the promise of vast wealth just out of reach of his flawed characters. <br />	2004-10-06

Once again we are immersed in blues music lore, legend and attitude as we are taken to nightclubs, are fed lines from blues numbers and left to appreciate the depth of emotion that goes into the blues. At the same time, there are some pretty tense and violent moments as Travers investigates an old murder.<br /><br />Nick Travers is a blues historian living in New Orleans who works at Tulane University while compiling the research necessary to write his biography of Eddie Jones, better known as Guitar Slim. As part of his all-encompassing interest in the blues he has been sending letters to Ruby Walker, a former blues singer, requesting an interview with her. Ruby is currently in prison and has so far served a 40 year sentence for the murder of her lover and manager, Billy Lyons. She has agreed to speak to Nick and this prompts him to leave New Orleans and head to Chicago. After talking to Ruby and later, when interviewing more old-time blues players around Chicago, Nick gets the impression that there is a strong possibility that she is innocent and has spent the last 40 years paying for a crime she didn't commit.<br /><br />Nick begins tracking down the old blues artists around Chicago in a bid to find out what they remembered about the night Billy Lyons died. His presence and his line of questioning don't go unnoticed however and it's not long before Stagger Lee gets to hear of him. Stagger Lee is the ruler of Chicago's South Side projects, ruling through terror and an abundance of crack. He is ably assisted by a couple of prostitutes, Annie and Fannie, who are as deadly as they are alluring, a fact that is demonstrated to us a number of times. When Stagger Lee decides he wants Travers stopped, it's these two he sends to do the dirty work.<br /><br />The story turns into a tense hunter/stalker scenario, with Travers playing the part of both the hunter and the hunted. While he hunts for information, contacting famous musicians and forgotten recording artists, he is unknowingly being stalked by a couple of killers with an impressive track record. Backing them up is the frighteningly imposing figure of Stagger Lee who, like his namesake of legend, is also a man to be feared.<br /><br />I found that the actual identity of the murderer really becomes of secondary importance as the story progresses, particularly because it is made perfectly obvious who it is so very early on. Instead, it's the tension built into Travers' search that really dragged me in. The reason behind why Billy Lyons was killed dominates our attention too and is the source of a number of surprises along the way.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters used throughout the book and they ranged from the crazy, off-beat Annie and Fannie who never really progressed beyond the role of killers who wanted to escape the life they led, to the wonderfully captured irreverence of Dirty Jimmy. Jimmy had the demeanor one would expect of an ex-musician who has already seen it all and the harp-blowing little man livened up every scene in which he was included. As for Nick Travers, he is a fine character with the tough background as an ex-NFL footballer with the New Orleans Saints offset by the music geek enthusiasm he displays when he meets the odd blues legend. He comes with just the right mix of strength and vulnerability.<br /><br />LEAVIN' TRUNK BLUES is a dark, moody story that showcases Chicago's rich history of blues music while providing an enthralling thriller. With the lure of more Nick Travers mysteries to come, I'm sure to be diving into the blues scene courtesy of Ace Atkins in the future.	2004-10-05

Hard Case Crime co-founder and author Max Phillips has produced a quality mystery to kick-start the label very effectively. Suffice to say, if this nugget is an indicator of the quality to come, then hardboiled readers have found themselves a valuable gold mine. <br /> <br />Ray Corson would like to make it in Hollywood some day as a writer, but in the meantime is willing to do just about any job to bring money in and food on his table. He's tiling a roof one day when the beautiful Rebecca LaFontaine approaches him with a plea to help her get rid of Lance Halliday, who has threatened her after their relationship went sour. <br /> <br />It's not a lot to start with but, as I said, Corson is prepared to do just about anything and the chance to help a beautiful woman sounds like a pretty good deal to him. So just how far will Ray go to help a beautiful woman? It initially leads him is into the grim underbelly of the Hollywood scene, crowded with gangsters, porn producing pretty boys, sleazy women and failed actors and he takes it further by working as an enforcer for a drug-dealing gangster. <br /> <br />Starting off with few leads - and those that he has only insubstantial - Corson stampedes his way through the rough underworld with barely a care for his own safety and suffers for it as a consequence. His own recklessness doesn't stop him from delivering a resounding denouement that delivers a superb twist and a satisfying ending. <br /> <br />Max Phillips has captured the mean streets of 1950's L.A. with this hardboiled crime novel that recalls the pulps from the period in which it is set. It's a fast-moving story that passes from high class joints to cheap dives all comfortably filled with an assortment of Hollywood's criminal element. <br />	2004-09-29

Set in the California Delta region, it's a story that is filled with violence, betrayal, suspicion and tragedy. Throughout all of this are a far from innocent couple who are desperate to escape this scene to resume their lives.<br /><br />Dan Abatangelo and Shel Beaudry fell in love almost the instant they met one night in a Vegas casino, but there was something Dan had to get off his chest before he would let their relationship progress past that first attraction. He wanted to come clean with Shel over the fact that he was a major drug smuggler and would understand if she decided to run. She stays.<br /><br />When he finally gets busted, Dan gets 10 years in an Arizona prison. He chooses a tougher sentence in exchange for a shorter prison term for Shel. By the time he gets out, Shel has gotten herself involved with a loser crankhead and is hopelessly entwined with the Akers brothers, a redneck family who operate a methamphetamine lab. Things are just starting to go south for Shel when an all out war break out between the brothers and a group of Mexicans who are looking to move in on the operation, leaving her stuck in the middle where she is used as a bargaining chip.<br /><br />While Dan finds himself on the periphery of this crime war, there are many reasons for him to not get involved with some amazingly gruesome scenes taking place as the battle for drug supremacy takes place. But his one reason for persevering wins out giving us hope for a triumphant ending. Before that can take place, though, he has to find a way to break through the defences of a veritable fortress while watching his back for the revenge-seeking Mexicans.<br /><br />There is a pervading sense of desperation to the story that is tinged with a creeping sense of hopelessness. It seems that no matter how hard Dan tries to find a way to get to Shel his attemptsalways managed to get frustrated. David Corbett has done an excellent job first up in creating a compelling story that had me unable to guess which way it was headed next.	2004-09-28
514517:US	47964988	R3T6YEGJSLQS2L	0843953497	112027662	Grifter's Game (Hard Case Crime (Mass Market Paperback))	Books	5	20	20	N	N	A Stunning Publication	This book was first published in 1961 under the title \\"Mona\\" and has now been republished some 23 years later, renamed to GRIFTER'S GAME and is the first title published by Hard Case Crime, an exciting new small publisher.  <br /> <br />GRIFTER'S GAME is a story of lust, greed and deceit told in the gritty voice of Joe Marlin, a self-confessed con-man hustler. Joe tells us he is always on the lookout for a possible score and is just as happy to have felt victory over someone as he is to have actually earned something from his scam. We meet Marlin just as he skips out on a $600+ hotel bill in Philadelphia where a possible scam he was setting up feel through with nothing to show for it. He's philosophical about the experience, happy to move on to the next city which in this case happens to be Atlantic City. <br /> <br />His hotel trick depends on an important prop to work successfully: luggage, something that Joe no longer had after his disappearing act in Philly. This is really no problem for the resourceful criminal and a quick visit to a train station where he picks up a couple of unattended bags soon remedies the situation and he's soon checking into an up-scale hotel room. <br /> <br />Imagine his surprise when he later discovers a sizable brick of heroin secreted among the socks and undies in one of the suitcases. The finger of coincidence points squarely at him not long after when he meets and falls for Mona, the wife of the out of luck (but very rich) luggage owner. The ensuing affair is torrid with both Joe and Mona desperate for the relationship to carry on further after Mona's stay in Atlantic City is over. It's almost inevitable that the solution to their problem is for Mona's husband to die. What follows is a series of events that get progressively more tragic as it goes along. <br /> <br />A particularly strong point of the book is the speed in which everything takes place. It's a plot-driven story with the focus remaining squarely on the unfolding of events with a minimum of time devoted to building up suspense or developing the characters involved. In fact, by the story's end, although she's one of the two main characters, we really don't know much more about Mona than we did when we first met her. This isn't a criticism, more a comment on the strength of the plot which was able to effortlessly take us to a moving ending. I'll just make a special mention of the ending here and the sense of despair that it evinces which I think typifies a well-constructed noir novel. <br /> <br />I think the choice of GRIFTER'S GAME by Lawrence Block as the maiden publication of Hard Case Crime is an inspired one. Its hardboiled nature mixed with the dark ending is exactly the kind of book that fans of the genre seek out. It also showcases Lawrence Block's talent for writing compelling fiction. <br />	2004-09-21

Now he's back, although any sign of a fanfare for his return is sadly missing. I though Ken Bruen took Jack Taylor just about as low as it is possible to take a character in THE GUARDS, but he's managed to follow that dark excursion up by plunging him into an even deeper canyon in THE KILLING OF THE TINKERS. <br /> <br />He's not long back home when he is sought out by a man who needs his help. Of course, Jack is in a pub at the time and has no problem listening to the man, a tinker named Sweeper. He explains that someone has been savagely murdering, occasionally including dismemberment, the young men from his clan. The feelings towards the tinkers (sometimes otherwise known as gypsies) range from dislike to fear and hatred, so the suspect pool could be very large. Sweeper has resorted to turning to Taylor for help because the Garda Siochana (the Irish police force), of which Taylor used to be a member, have not bothered to investigate preferring to write the deaths off as the result of a feud between tinker families. <br /> <br />It's a pretty grim sounding situation and a difficult case, but when the offer of free accommodation is included with a healthy pay packet, jack can't refuse. <br /> <br />Just because he has agreed to take the case, taken the tinker's money and moved into a tinker's house, it doesn't mean he will throw himself into a full-scale investigation. His intentions are honorable, mind you, but the temptations of the many pubs see him succumbing all too often, mixing his alcohol consumption with a steady supply of cocaine. <br /> <br />He makes progress on the case thanks mainly to the help of a policeman friend from London, but there are external factors that also adversely affect his progress. When he isn't being harassed by his ex-colleagues from the Garda, he is being severely beaten by men who despise tinkers or he's being hounded by nuisance suspects.Somehow amongst all of this drama, drug-taking and intrigue, Jack also manages a couple of relationships and accompanying break-ups. Yes, there's certainly a lot going on and emotions are being whipped from high to low. <br /> <br />This is a bleak story filled with noir themes. A sense of hopelessness surrounds Jack who is either unwilling or unable to save himself even while he's trying to help others. The mood isn't improved by the repeated warnings given to us in Jack's narrative that mistakes and oversights he is making will later result in tragedy. Armed with this fact from quite early I was on my guard to trust nothing and nobody, but Bruen was still able to produce an ending that moved me. <br />	2004-09-18
520353:US	47964988	R2NKCAM872P3GB	0399150528	144380993	Hard Rain (John Rain)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Solid Thriller Set In Japan	In HARD RAIN we get the strong impression that the life of an assassin would be a very harrowing existence. The mental strain that it would place on you would be enormous, but there are other considerations that would have to be dealt with. You need to remain anonymous; your movements must be undetected; you must remain unobserved; you must be aware of your enemies and the possibility that you will be tailed. Personal relationships are another difficult area because of the possible weakness in your defenses they might expose. It's a lonely, harrowing existence and that's exactly the way John Rain lives. <br /> <br />John Rain is an assassin living in Japan who has a special talent for killing people in such a way that it looks as though they died of natural causes. He was introduced in RAIN FALL and this is the second book in the series featuring this most unusual protagonist. The story opens with Rain about to close the deal on his latest contract, a steroid enhanced enforcer from the Yakuza (the Japanese mafia). This opening job establishes two aspects that will be reinforced throughout the book. First, Rain is incredibly effective at what he does and second, his preparation before taking action is exhaustive. <br /> <br />After the initial excitement and action that comes with killing a man face to face, the mood quickly settles down to one that is more sedate. The background of John Rain is explained including how he came to be an assassin and the careful daily routines he must go through to ensure his own life is not in danger. It's during this down time that Rain is approached by his contact, a Japanese FBI agent named Tatsu, with details of another job he wants done. <br /> <br />The next job is the main focus of the book. The man to be killed is another mafia killer, a man who is feared for both his sadistic ruthlessness and for his innate instinct for survival. This particular job will pose an incredible challenge for Rain, so much so that he strongly doubts he wants the job. But then it becomes personal and he throws himself completely into preparing to take down the Yakuza heavyweight. <br /> <br />One of the strongest features of the book outside the tension of the assassination attempt was the way in which Japan was depicted. The settings, the customs and history were all integrated into the storyline in a way that was both informative and interesting. Where possible Barry Eisler gave us the Japanese terms and then followed them with the English translations. When John Rain visited a place of interest he included relevant background and he describes customary behavior whenever traditional Japanese methods were used, for example, when dining or when visiting a sento, a public bath. It's obvious that Eisler has spent a lot of time in Japan and has introduced me to a setting that I rarely read about. <br /> <br />As a sequel to the outstanding RAIN FALL, this book excels in the development of the John Rain character. We get a real sense of the loneliness and self-doubt that surges through him, even when on the outside he appears bullet-proof. We understand more fully his thoughts, fears and regrets and also his limits. It's not quite as fast paced as the first book in the series, settling into a more brooding, predatory mood as it carefully hunts us to the moving finale. <br />	2004-09-15

Claudia's usual area of expertise is insurance investigation, but when an ex-school friend calls on her about her dead brother she feels compelled to help determine whether his death was the accidental heart failure it was ruled, or something more sinister. <br /> <br />Not long into her investigation she gets the distinct impression that she is being followed, an impression that is confirmed telling her she must be onto something. Helped by friends and nosy neighbours alike, Claudia learns enough to get herself into more than one dangerous tight spot, mixing it up with the feared Harry Lavender. <br /> <br />THE LIFE AND CRIMES OF HARRY LAVENDER is the first book in the Claudia Valentine series and Valentine proves to be a no-nonsense, tough woman who views the world through a jaundiced eye, ready with a quip to lighten the moment. It's a fast-paced book that is tightly plotted moving logically from clue to clue. On the down side, coincidence seems to play a big part in the story with unlikely interconnections between characters popping up throughout the book. <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable though uncomplicated series introduction. <br />	2004-09-15
523277:US	47964988	R1Y2GNBZ5F1HQY	0060596503	479838228	Whirlwind: A Novel	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Entertaining Action Thriller	If you lower your demands for excellence in credibility and crank up your tolerance for a full-scale scale action intrigue story, then you're ready to read WHIRLWIND. WHIRLWIND ensures that people who love their mysteries to take them on a heart-stopping chase where to get caught is to die will be more than happy with this book. My first experience with Joseph R. Garber was when I read his pulse-quickening thriller VERTICAL RUN and this book matches it for pace and all-out entertainment value.  <br /> <br />The crisis begins when a couple of Russian spies who get away with a computer disk and a mysterious box break into a top secret government laboratory developing the latest and greatest in high-tech weaponry. These two items amount to critical information about project Whirlwind, a project that is hoped will put the US far ahead in the arms race.  <br /> <br />The man charged with the recovery of the items is the National Security Advisor, Sam is the only name we're given for him, and he can only think of one person who might be capable of tracking down and capturing the surviving Russian spy and returning the secrets of Whirlwind. Charlie McKenzie, a retired CIA operative is that man, but Sam has double crossed Charlie in the past and the antagonism between the two men is immense. Charlie agrees to take the job, but not before making Sam pay through the nose for his services and the first part of the chase gets underway.  <br /> <br />But Sam doesn't trust Charlie to keep his part of the agreed job and puts unrealistically tight controls on him, such as a tail, marked spending money and a bugged car. His fears are well-founded because Charlie senses that Sam's not being 100 per cent honest with him and quickly slips the Feds who are tailing him and ditches the bugged car before tracking down Irina Kolodenkova, the elusive Russian.  <br /> <br />As soon as Charlie disappears Sam switches to plan B and calls Johan Schmidt. Schmidt is a ruthless mercenary with a team of more than 500 professionals capable of tracking down and neutralising anyone. Amazingly, Schmidt and Charlie McKenzie also have had an antagonistic history with each other, so much so that Schmidt is champing at the bit at the opportunity of killing Charlie. Small world, no? What follows is a frantic chase around America with the killers gradually closing the net on Irina and Charlie. But Charlie is elusive and has friends everywhere while Irina is much more resourceful than she first seems and together they are more than a match for their pursuers.  <br /> <br />On the surface this is a fairly straightforward story: Russian spy snatches top secret information; ex-CIA operative tracks her down. But the inclusion of the second team in the chase adds tantalising complexity to the situation and then there is a hint of political intrigue hidden behind ulterior motives just to add spice. The further the story goes the more twisted grows the plot culminating in a super-charged ending.  <br /> <br />In keeping with true action thrillers, the pace of the story is frantic thanks to a ticking clock scenario imposed by a time limit placed on the required capture by Sam. I thought this particular aspect of the story was a little contrived with no real compelling reason for the time limit ever given to us. Not so in keeping with many action books was the effort by Garber to give his principal characters a lot of background detail making them much more believable and us much more sympathetic towards them.  <br /> <br />I felt the only real weakness in the story was the portrayal of Johan Schmidt. For a supposed professional soldier with high standards when it comes to discipline, his over-confidence and arrogance was totally at odds with the man he is supposed to be. When we are initially led to believe that a guy is the best of the best, I would expect that to hold true for the rest of the book. In my opinion this changed as the book progressed and the believability suffered as a result.  <br /> <br />Joseph Garber has produced a second all-out thrill ride of a book, combining impossible escapes with some ruthlessly violent scenes. It's entertaining in the same way that Matthew Reilly's SCARECROW is entertaining, with action all the way.	2004-09-13
523639:US	47964988	R2D8JG7QKZJMQ8	0743202708	785313244	Fat Ollie's Book: A Novel of the 87th Precinct	Books	4	1	2	N	N	The Creative Side of Oliver Weeks	When Oliver Wendell Weeks is called to the murder scene of mayoral candidate Lester Henderson, he was on top of the world. He had just finished writing his first book and had it safely stored on the back seat of his car. After attending the crime scene, he returns to his car to find that the unthinkable has happened, his car has been broken into and his manuscript has been stolen.  <br /> <br />I think at this point a bit of an introduction may be in order here. Ed McBain's 87th Precinct series, set in the fictional city of Isola, is now over 50 books strong with the detectives from the precinct that bears the series title all making regular appearances. Ollie Weeks, on the other hand, is only a fairly recent addition to the series and works out of the neighbouring 88th Precinct. Ollie is an ignorant bigot (is there any other kind?) who complements this with a complete lack of sympathy when dealing with victims families. He prefers the rude abrasive approach when requesting help from colleagues, usually softening them up with an insulting joke and then becoming astounded when they don't appreciate his humour. In short, Ollie Weeks is a thoroughly dislikeable guy.  <br /> <br />But back in MONEY, MONEY, MONEY (the previous 87th Precinct book) Weeks saved Steve Carella's life not once, but twice and now he's cashing in on the favours he believes Carella owes him. If you had to pick a leading character out of the ensemble cast that makes up the 87th Precinct, Detective Steve Carella would be that man.  <br /> <br />Ollie's proposed favour is for the detectives from the 87th Precinct to help him work the Lester Henderson murder case. It seems that although Lester was murdered inside the 88th Precinct boundaries, his house lies within the 87th Precinct, so Ollie would like Carella to interview Lester's widow. In return Ollie magnanimously offers to share the credit for the bust. The real reason for Ollie's appeal for help can be put down to the fact that his attention has been captured by his desire to find the person who stole his manuscript. After all, he's convinced it's bestseller material and why not when the story is based on his own experiences as a cop.  <br /> <br />And this brings us directly to the storyline that runs in parallel to the murder investigation involving the junkie who is now in possession of Ollie's book. Oh yes, not only do we know who stole the treasured manuscript but we also get to read it, while the thief thinks he has stumbled upon inside police information that will lead him to a fortune. The plight of the missing manuscript and its drug dependent new owner is cleverly worked into yet another case being pursued by the police, making its recovery oh so tantalisingly close.  <br /> <br />One of the constants of the 87th Precinct series is the sharp and snappy dialogue that prevails. Whether it's in the form of questions and answers rattled off during interviews or as a rapid fire exchange between two cops, the style is distinctive Ed McBain. I've always enjoyed this aspect of his books because you get the real impression that pressure is being put on the suspects and the pace of the investigation is instantly accelerating while clues and information are rapidly collected. The result is a fast-paced police investigation and that's exactly what we get in FAT OLLIE'S BOOK.  <br /> <br />One area in which the 87th Precinct stories have changed over the years and I thought it was particularly noticeable in this book was in the area of character development. McBain has never gone in much for giving his detectives terribly much personality, preferring to concentrate on police procedure and the case under investigation to carry the story. These days we are actually learning about the lives of the detectives outside of the precinct environs, giving them even greater appeal. Now, I admit, in the case of Oliver Wendell Weeks, the more you learn about him, the less you like him, but then that seems to be the appeal that McBain is trying to equip him with. Apart from learning all about Ollie's skewed philosophies of life, the two featured detectives, Steve Carella and Bert Kling were actually depicted at home with their families. We are now getting the impression that they're real men.  <br /> <br />Fans of the police procedural to end all police procedurals can rest assured that the fast-paced investigative style is still alive and well in the mean streets of Isola. I would caution anyone planning to read this book that it would be best to have read MONEY, MONEY, MONEY first, this book second and then THE FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH third because these 3 books read like a mini-series within the larger series.	2004-09-13

He is now 58 years old and living in Los Angeles in a shack in a poor part of town and is still in a constant battle with himself as he struggles to control the thoughts of violence that surge through him. Although Socrates is a violent man he is also a deep thinker using his own brand of insightful wisdom to combat daily problems and injustices.  <br /> <br />ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED ALWAYS OUTGUNNED is a book of 14 short stories featuring Socrates as he deals with the hardships facing an ex-convict who is trying to fit back into society. They cover a vast range of societal issues that can be considered mundane at first glance, but which make up the important detail of life. Socrates' approach to his problems range from borderline illegal to genius in their simplicity and common sense. <br /> <br />Socrates' displays hi philosophical age of wisdom in the opening story when he catches Darryl, a local boy who has stolen and killed a rooster. He proceeds to teach Darryl the difference between right and wrong in a caring but unorthodox way. Immediately following this is a story where Socrates engages in an act of vigilantism, using his violent nature to warn off an undesirable character living in the neighbourhood. These opening two stories paint a vivid picture of the two opposite sides of Socrates Fortlow, the reasoning thinker and the man of violent action. <br /> <br />Philosophical debates dominate many of these stories as Socrates meets men who: are thieves; are cheating on their wives; have walked out on their wives; have fought and killed in wars and who are now trying to cope with it; are cruel to animals. In each of these stories Socrates imparts his own brand of wisdom on others while inside he is in a struggle to contain the rage he feels towards these people. <br /> <br />While not really mystery stories, they do involvecrimes and criminals and the moral and social issues associated with them. For example, in one story Socrates has very strong suspicions that he knows the identity of a serial arsonist, but struggles with his rebellion against authority before deciding whether he should turn the man in or not. A later story brings back Darryl and his run in with one of the local gangs. Socrates does his best to protect Darryl from the perils of the gang culture that threatens to swallow him. <br /> <br />I found these stories to be particularly engaging, addressing issues that one could dismiss as everyday events, but which are also very important. Mosley has created in Socrates Fortlow a very sympathetic character who is merely trying to survive as a black ex-convict in a hostile environment. His solutions to the problems that confront him don't always fall within the bounds of legality, instead aiming for the solution that will result in the `right' outcome rather than the just outcome.	2004-09-06
534978:US	47964988	R2F4YX5J5CMT4F	0312291140	160539059	Buck Fever: A Blanco County Texas Novel	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Good Humorous Thriller	If ever there was an opening line to give a clear indication of the tone of the story that follows, Ben Rehder delivers it in BUCK FEVER with this little gem: <br />\\"By the time Red O'Brien finished his thirteenth beer, he could hardly see through his rifle scope.\\" <br /> <br />From this opening, which I found particularly amusing, Rehder introduces us to the local inhabitants of Blanco County in all their colourful glory while a seemingly innocuous deer sighting turns the county on its head with the all-important opening day of hunting season fast approaching. <br /> <br />As hunting season's opening day approaches, game warden John Marlin's hands are full with over-eager hunters getting a head-start on proceedings. When Red O'Brien and Billy Don Craddock do a spot of illegal spotlighting while drunk one evening, they accidentally shoot a biologist who happened to be performing an experiment while impersonating a deer. (I know...it seems weirder than it actually is). When Marlin is called out along with the usual ambulance, sheriff and other assorted crime scene specialists, their attention is completely taken by the strange antics of a buck who is behaving in a very un-deer like manner. <br /> <br />Marlin's solution is to capture the buck and take it home so that he can keep it under observation, unaware of the fuss and anxiety this would cause with certain members of the community. The property from which the buck was taken was Roy Swank's Circle S Ranch. Now, Roy Swank is a rich businessman / ex-political head kicker and is your typical unscrupulous operator who doesn't care who he walks all over in order to get what he wants. He has turned the Circle S into a very successful deer farm, producing prime animals for each year's hunting season. It's Swank who is almost apoplectic when he learns that Marlin has taken the buck and goes to extreme measures to get it back. <br /> <br />The reaction from Swank, which was way over the top for the loss of a single deer,was enough to make John Marlin just a little suspicious. A couple of further incidents go a long way toward confirming those suspicions and suddenly, Marlin knows just enough to make life dangerous for himself. There is also the matter of a Colombian man who has just hit town. We know he's related to the Circle S Ranch, but the question is how. One thing's for sure, you wouldn't want to get on his bad side. <br /> <br />Where Ben Rehder excels in this book is in the portrayal of his characters and their small-town attitudes and idiosyncrasies. He really makes you care about his characters. For comic relief he gives us Red O'Brien and Billy Don Craddock, two bumbling rednecks who truly believe they are cunning go-getters riding on the edge. Although their every step is punctuated by a mistake, they turn out to play a couple of the most important roles in the book. Every small town seems to have a filthy rich, morally reprehensible bully-boy who has the local sheriff in his pocket making life difficult for everyone while he lives off his ill-gotten gains. Roy Swank plays this role to a tee, although it must be said, a few of his decisions makes it difficult to believe he ever rose to the position of power he now holds. <br /> <br />One of the characters who had a rather minor role here, but who has great potential to be developed in future books is Deputy Bobby Garza. Not only is he an insightful lawman, he is an honest and interesting character who moves the story along quickly and without fuss. Finally, there's game warden John Marlin, a hard-working, much admired single man who is just plain honest. He reminds me a lot of C.J. Box's Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett. Both men care more about doing the right thing rather than massaging egos or bowing to the rich and powerful, both make mistakes, usually with disastrous consequences and both have you rooting loudly for them.  <br /> <br />BUCK FEVER ventures into dangerous waters with murderous outsiders who are prepared to do whatever it takes to keep their illegal plans secret skulking about. For all of this danger, though, there is a constant hint of humour to the tone of the narration that manages to keep the air light and breezy. To complement the light tone, the story moves along very briskly thanks to a narrow deadline set by Swank. This deadline provides the urgency to make it feel like there is always something important happening. It works very effectively here. <br /> <br />I found BUCK FEVER to be a very enjoyable humorous thriller that has introduced me to a place and to people with whom I would like to visit again. Fortunately there are two more books in the series that will allow me to do so - these being BONE DRY and FLAT CRAZY. <br />	2004-09-02

At the time she was celebrating her second wedding anniversary and the main source of her shock came from the fact that it was her husband, Chaz who did the throwing. The thing that really has her perplexed is that this is the first sign that Chaz was less than happy with their marriage. <br /> <br />Joey is fortunate enough to grab hold of a passing bale of marijuana that happened to be floating by and manages to hold on until she is saved by Mick Shanahan. Shanahan is an ex-cop who has escaped the troubles of civilisation and now minds an island for a rich old Mexican author, giving him the solitude he enjoys. When he picks up Joey and hears her story he is all for calling the police and having Chaz arrested. Joey is not so eager, knowing the uncanny ability her husband has had at avoiding prosecution in the past. Besides, she still doesn't know why her husband tried to kill her, so she'd like to satisfy her curiosity and maybe get a little payback along the way - and it's the payback that provides a good deal of the entertainment. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Chaz is doing his best impersonation of a grieving husband, distraught by the prospect of his wife falling overboard and either drowning or being eaten by a shark. From the very start we understand that Chaz is a disagreeable, self absorbed man, but as the story unfolds it becomes clear that the man is also an incompetent fool and we get to delight in the way his world falls apart thanks to his foolishness. <br /> <br />While he thinks he has committed the perfect murder, Detective Karl Rolvaag is more than a little suspicious and investigates strenuously, or at least, he does until Chaz's boss, a wealthy and therefore influential man, pressures the police department to show a little less enthusiasm. Of course, this doesn't sit well with Rolvaag at all and his efforts redouble in response.<br /> <br />Due to Chaz's incompetence, his boss assigns a bodyguard to watch over him, introducing us to my favourite character of the book, Tool. Tool is a hulking behemoth of a man simply covered from tip to toe in hair. He has a dependency on painkillers and a hobby of collecting roadside accident markers. It turns out he is wonderfully insightful - in a hairy, hulking behemothy sort of way - and turns out to have a touchingly soft side. Sure he's a drug dependent killer, but he is also stole every scene he was in. <br /> <br />This is a wildly amusing story with multiple storylines that careen toward each other resulting in a tremendous crescendo. Joey and Mick play out their revenge plot, Rolvaag plays his likable, competent detective role while Chaz doggedly digs himself deeply into trouble without ever being aware of how out of control his life has become.  <br /> <br />Carl Hiaasen consistently produces highly amusing stories set in Florida and this is another fine example. His characters range from mildly offbeat (his police detective Karl Rolvaag is an excellent example in this book) to outrageously out of control. Slipped in among the light tone and humorous attitude of the story, Hiaasen stealthily inserts his environmental messages. Although they are added with a derisive tone to them, they are obviously heartfelt comments about the way parts of Florida are being decimated through overdevelopment or just plain irresponsible human habitation. The clever thing about Hiaasen's environmental comment is that he doesn't take it so far as to feel as though he is preaching to us. <br />	2004-08-26

Banner (Lost Classics)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Locked Room Conundrums	The locked-door mystery appears to be a style of a bygone era and is rarely found nowadays. These intriguing types of mysteries usually involve a crime - usually a murder - involving a dead body discovered in a sealed room that is left in such a way that there can be no possible way for the murderer to have committed the crime and then gotten away undetected. <br /> <br />BANNER DEADLINES is a collection of exactly these types of locked-door short stories by Joseph Commings. They have been gathered from such old-time pulp magazines as 10-Story Detectives, Ten Detective Aces and Mystery Digest and put together in this wonderfully presented volume. The stories contained within range in publication date from as early as 1947 and as recently as 1984 and all feature New York Senator Brooks U. Banner, a huge, cigar chomping man with a passion for puzzles, magic and the art of criminal detection. He is loud, gruff and abrasive...and he solves some of the most impossible mysteries through 14 stories. <br /> <br />The book kicks off with a classic locked-room story involving a clearly murdered body found inside a room made entirely of glass and, most astoundingly, with no doors. Conundrums like these seem to be right up Senator Banner's alley as, story after story he is faced with the most perplexing crimes only to dispatch them with relative ease, usually revealing a delightful twist at the end.  <br /> <br />As a taste of what you can expect among the stories, murders take place: at a sance; in a rowboat in the middle of a lake; inside a magician's escape box; in a cemetery; on a movie set; and, a personal favourite of mine, in an old haunted house. For the most part there are plenty of clues provided in each story to give you a chance at figuring out the puzzle, although vital clues are withheld in a couple of the stories until Banner makes his dramatic announcement about who the murderer is and how the crime was committed. <br /> <br />All in all this is a beautifully presented collection of intriguing mysteries that will send your mind bending in all sorts of directions as you try to solve the puzzles before Banner. <br />	2004-08-24
556962:US	47964988	R3PD6B37K6OJSK	052594821X	89678523	The Hundredth Man	Books	3	4	4	N	N	An Interesting Thriller	In his debut novel, Jack Kerley has delivered an intense serial killer story and has introduced us to some extremely complex characters. I get the feeling we will be seeing more of many of these characters with THE HUNDREDTH MAN having the feel of the first book in a series. <br /> <br />The story opens with Carson Ryder and his partner Harry Nautilus being called to a murder scene in a park in Mobile. The victim has been decapitated and left where it would be easily spotted, a vicious and bold attack. Ryder and Nautilus are members of the Mobile Police Department's Psychological and Sociopathological Investigative Team (better known as PSIT) whose umbrella this sort of crime appears to fall under. <br /> <br />Before they can progress the case Captain Terrence Squill arrives on the scene and takes over. Squill is obviously not a fan of PSIT and has even bigger issues with Ryder. He is a political figure more suited to dealing with the media than conducting a police investigation, but has risen to his present rank on the back of an earlier case, a case in which Ryder played a major role and also secured his promotion. Squill appears resentful of Ryder's detective abilities and is intent on stymieing any responsibility or role in the investigation, to the point of hindering the investigation. <br /> <br />Jack Kerley has packed the story with a lot of side-stories, hidden agendas, past grudges and skeletons in the closet that he uses to add intrigue and mystery to what is already a compelling thriller. Some of these devices are woven seamlessly into the story giving it greater complexity. I particularly liked the role of Jeremy, Ryder's older brother who is incarcerated in a state mental institution. The way he habitually insinuated himself into Ryder's consciousness - and consequently, ours - added great expectation and curiosity about both him and his role in the investigation. <br /> <br />On the downside, I found the head-to-head battle between Ryder and CaptainSquill to be both annoying and distracting. I felt it added little or no real value to the story and would have preferred the case be held without the intrusion of the petty police bureaucracies and personality clashes. Such is the nature of police procedurals, I suppose, but the politics doesn't usually take over the story to the extent that it does here. <br /> <br />Overall, I found THE HUNDREDTH MAN to be an interesting thriller without providing the compelling spark that would otherwise have had me waiting expectantly for the next book in the series to be released. <br />	2004-08-13
565466:US	47964988	R1IALNKS8FER5M	0312266715	917331861	Psychopath: A Novel	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Psychiatrist v Psychiatrist	There are many psychological thrillers out there that run to a fairly standard formula. They're usually based around a serial killer who commits shocking crimes and is then hunted down by various law enforcement agencies following procedures such as data profiling, forensic research and evidence gathering. The law enforcement officers, usually FBI agents, are pretty much cut from the same cloth too, dedicated to their job to the detriment of their own personal lives. By and large they're ultimate professionals who could probably be taken from one story and placed within another, virtually without noticing. <br /> <br />Keith Ablow has taken the psychological thriller to a new level delving deeply into the disturbed minds of the criminals who have darkened the series so far. PSYCHOPATH is the 4th book in the Dr Frank Clevenger series a series notable both for it's dark themes that are dealt with and for the very disturbed protagonist who bears the brunt of these issues. Frank Clevenger is a forensic psychiatrist who has been plagued with all of the addictions and psychological weaknesses he usually treats. These have all been displayed in the earlier books as he battles through drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling all stemming from abuses he suffered as a child. He is not your average protagonist, but he is definitely one of the more interesting that I have come across. <br /> <br />This 4th Frank Clevenger book is not a mystery. Right from the opening page we know that Jonah Wrens is a serial killer who will come to be known as the Highway Killer. We also know that he is good-looking, personable, friendly, approachable and a brilliant pediatric psychiatrist in fact, the most dangerous kind of sociopath possible. Instead, this is a dark psychological thriller delving deeply inside the mind of a man tortured by his past. <br /> <br />Clevenger's notoriety has risen thanks to his exploits chronicled in the book preceding this one, DENIAL and he has become a psychiatrist who is very much in demand. With no progress being made on the Highway Killer case, the FBI contact Clevenger and ask him to add his expertise. Although interested in taking the case, Clevenger's personal life has once again reached crisis point with his adopted seventeen year old son, Billy getting into trouble at school, fighting with other boys and getting caught dealing drugs. Fearing he could lose his son if he was distracted, he refuses the FBI's request. <br /> <br />What he hadn't bargained on though was Jonah Wrens reaching out to him in the form of a letter published in the newspaper. This direct contact drags him back to the case and into a head-to-head public battle with the killer as they trade letters with each other in the newspaper. <br /> <br />As the story progresses we switch from Clevenger, who is juggling the case while trying to deal with his rebellious son, to Jonah Wrens who, in his professional guise is displaying sublime psychiatric abilities. Yet all the while, Wrens is slowly unravelling, losing his hold on the killer inside him, setting up for an inevitable showdown. <br /> <br />A disappointing part of the story came towards the end when Ablow inexplicably chose to add a rather clichd lady in distress scene that saw Wrens act completely out of character. Actually, that should be unrealistically out of character. Up until this point he was a horrifyingly efficient killer when suddenly he changed his routine for no logical reason and no explanation for it was given. It smacked of the author taking the easy way out in an attempt to insert a dramatic scene that simply wasn't required. <br /> <br />Keith Ablow deals with some of the darkest fears, addictions and compulsions throughout the Frank Clevenger series and does so with stunning clarity bringing his characters to life by revealing their minds to us completely. It's not surprising to find that Ablow is himself a forensic psychiatrist enriching the story with his first-hand knowledge and experience which I have found continually absorbing. His specialty throughout the series has been the human psyche that has been severely traumatized as a child which then manifests itself in some sort of destructive behaviour later in life.  <br /> <br />In the 3 earlier books we have seen Clevenger deal with his drug abuse, alcoholism and gambling addiction while still functioning as an excellent forensic psychiatrist. We have learnt watched him step to the edge of the cliff of despair and have a good look over the edge before stepping back. In this latest book, Frank Clevenger has progressed past the dark days described in COMPULSION and PROJECTION thanks mainly to his adoption of Billy. <br /> <br />There is a sinister edge to this book, sharpened by the fact that we know so much about the Highway Killer. We know both sides of him, the brilliant psychiatrist who achieves amazing results with his patients and the unbalanced killer who is nearly driven to insanity by his need to kill.  <br /> <br />While I have enjoyed this series immensely, the continual excursions into a very disturbed mind may become very harrowing for some readers. While it makes compelling reading, the subject matter, such as child abuse and schizophrenic episodes on top of vivid descriptions of a serial killer in action makes for a seriously dark story and wouldn't be to everyone's liking. <br />	2004-08-05

I'm talking about John Dortmunder, creation of Donald Westlake, who first appeared back in 1970 in THE HOT ROCK and is back in the 11th book in the series, THE ROAD TO RUIN.<br /><br />In this outing John Dortmunder and his crew targets Monroe Hall's classic car collection. Monroe Hall is a pariah. He has recently been caught robbing his own company blind and is now in seclusion within his sprawling compound with his wife, security guards and various collections that include cuckoo clocks, chess sets, rare books and music boxes. In fact, the man collects just about everything. The only thing he seems unable to collect is servants who don't want anything to do with him - after all, he's a pariah.<br /><br />So, as I mentioned, there's a classic car collection just begging to be stolen. The main problem confronting Dortmunder is the electric fence that stands between him and the cars. This problem is closely followed by the problem posed by the security guards manning the front gates. But Dortmunder is an ideas man, problem solving is his specialty and once again he comes up with a novel solution to their entry problem. So the heist is a goer - nothing can possibly go wrong.<br /><br />Unknown to Dortmunder and his crew is a fly in their ointment that is sure to spoil their carefully thought out heist. Monroe Hall is such a rotter that he has made enemies up, down and sideways all waiting their chance to try to wring some of the money he took back out of him. They're faced with much the same problem as Dortmunder, namely getting to Hall. You see, he's such a pariah (do you get the idea that he's a pariah yet?) that he never leaves his compound making it difficult for the waiting ex-business partners and union workers to get to him. So while Dortmunder is executing his plan, these other blokes,better described as blundering fools actually, are making their own devious plans.<br /><br />Naturally, the opposing plans are destined to come crashing together which is sure to cause all manner of uproar, mayhem and general hilarity. From book to book, the general premise hasn't changed in the Dortmunder series, that is, a can't-miss caper is planned down to the last detail only to be upset by some unforeseen circumstance. The pleasure in the books lies in Donald Westlake's uncanny ability to deliver off-beat characters, scathingly brilliant comedic dialogue, cleverly devised crimes and imaginative solutions to his problems.<br /><br />Although this book comes late in the series, it can be enjoyed without having to read any of the earlier books, although the earlier books will obviously give you more of a familiarisation with the characters who make up Dortmunder's gang. So if it's a light-hearted crime book you're after where the criminal is the good guy, this book will meet your needs.	2004-08-02
572164:US	47964988	R2XKAH01IIP77Q	0743222016	582723746	Garden of Beasts: A Novel of Berlin 1936	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Tense War-Time Drama	It has been the Lincoln Rhyme books (THE BONE COLLECTOR, THE COFFIN DANCER, etc.) that has earned Jeffery Deaver a place on my must-read list, the series featuring the quadriplegic master criminalist providing fascinating reading as well as cleverly plotted thrillers. GARDEN OF BEASTS is a departure from the Rhyme series, set in 1936 Berlin during the tumultuous rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist Party. Deaver has expertly interwoven a fictional assassination plot through the lives of the notorious leaders of Germany at the time. He has also created another brilliant criminalist whose powers of deduction are a delight to follow. <br /> <br />It's 1936 and Paul Schumann has just been recruited to do a job to assist the American cause, it's to be done quietly and without the knowledge of the government. Schumann is a mob hit man, a button man, and is the ultimate professional when it comes to his job. But he has been captured by the military and they, along with a US senator and a millionaire to fund the project, have made him a one-time offer to travel to Berlin to murder the man responsible for Germany's rearmament scheme, Reinhardt Ernst. He is given the incentive to accept by promising that, should he refuse the job, he will face prison and then execution for his past crimes. <br /> <br />So Schumann's adventure in Germany begins, but right from the start it seems that his chances of slipping into the country and performing his hit undetected are zero. Somehow, on the ship to Germany, he has been overheard plotting his intentions by a man who is sympathetic to the Nazis and is in danger of having his identity revealed. Things don't get much better when he reaches Germany. Almost instantly his life is in danger and is caught up in a man's murder whilst trying to meet his Berlin contact. The murder puts Detective Willi Kohl of the Kripo (Criminal Police) on his trail, possibly the least desirable outcome when trying to carry out an assassination in a foreign country. <br /> <br />Regardless of the detective behind him and the threats posed by the ever present SS, SD and Gestapo, Schumann proceeds with his plan. The tension mounts as the point of view switches from Schumann to his prey, Reinhardt Ernst and then to his hunter Willi Kohl and around again to Schumann until a series of unexpected twists sends the whole ballgame spinning out of control.  <br /> <br />In a book that mixed fictional characters with real people, Jeffery Deaver has made a special effort to bring his created characters (Schumann, Ernst and Kohl) to life, making them seem every bit as real as their real-life counterparts. Of these fictional characters, I thought 2 stood out, though for different reasons. <br /> <br />The first is Paul Schumann who is given a complete background helping to explain how he came to be a button man, helping me identify with his professionalism if not with his profession. It becomes clear as the story unfolds that he is somewhat ashamed of his emotional make up that allows him to kill with no hesitation or remorse. Yet paradoxically, he feels that he is different from the SS officers who beat up Jewish store owners, becoming so enraged that he foolishly intervenes to save them. <br /> <br />The second character, who I felt stole the show, is Detective Inspector Willi Kohl of the Kripo. Kohl is a brilliant detective working under immense hardship thanks to shortages of resources that are now being dedicated to the Gestapo. What we get with Kohl is a clever investigator who is ahead of his time and adept at using whatever clues come his way to stay on the trail of his quarry, in this case Paul Schumann. <br /> <br />With these two inspiring characters opposed to each other in a desperate double hunter thriller, I was placed in a terrible dilemma. Usually I would side with the protagonist, hoping that he would reach his goal, but in this case that would mean committing cold-blooded murder. Then there is the likable, brilliant detective who is so unassuming but sharp witted that you hope that he succeeds, but this would mean capturing the protagonist.  <br /> <br />Those who have read other books by Jeffery Deaver would know that he is a master of the plot twist allowing nothing to be taken for granted. In GARDEN OF BEASTS, Deaver has thrown in an array of unexpected turns that certainly had me re-evaluating my expectations of where the story was headed. I always applaud an author who can take me by surprise and Deaver does here. <br /> <br />Jeffery Deaver has once again created a superb story. For the most part it is set over only 2 days forcing a lot of action to be crammed into a very short period of time giving this necessary feeling of hectic danger that marks all good thrillers.  <br />	2004-07-29
577406:US	47964988	R23R519SKASUT1	0345467779	799300283	Earthquake Weather	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Inside Hollywood	What better way to grab a reader's attention that to start a book with a major, building destroying earthquake.  EARTHQUAKE WEATHER starts with the 1994 Los Angeles quake to get things jumping. We ride it out through the eyes of Mark Hayes who, along with his room-mate handles the terrifying event like a veteran. Apart from providing a rip-roaring start to the book, the earthquake is used as the catalyst for the events that follow over the next few months in Hayes' life. <br /> <br />While L.A. is recovering from the earthquake, Hayes' life gets rocked for a second time when he discovers Dexter Morton floating face down in his swimming pool. Dexter Morton is a movie producer and is Mark's boss, but he is also a detestable man who was sure to have had many enemies any of whom would have had reason to kill him. <br /> <br />Partly because he feels that he may be the number one suspect and partly because he thinks he may know who the killer actually is, Mark throws himself into a spot of amateur sleuthing. The fact that he is suddenly unemployed thanks to his boss's untimely demise has something to do with his interest in the case too. <br /> <br />So what we are treated to is a murder investigation of sorts delving into the more seamy bars and nightclubs around Hollywood. Interestingly, although the main storyline revolves around a murder, it's not the murder itself that gives this book its direction it's the effect that the murder has on the lives of those who were close to the victim.  <br /> <br />Through the characters, the grimy second-tier of Hollywood is uncovered as a world of dissatisfied, bitter or downright beaten people who have tried to make it in the industry, only to be eaten up and spat out. Mark Hayes, the narrating voice of the story, works as a lowly creative executive (script reader), working for the tyrannical Dexter Morton. He has aspirations to become a producer himself one day, although as the story progresses that possibility looks more and more remote. <br /> <br />Representing the most common category of failed aspirants is Charity Brown. She is the small-town beauty who came to Hollywood to be an actress and got herself a couple of small movie roles thanks to her stunning looks. Then the roles dried up and she became the trophy girlfriend of Dexter Morton and hopelessly addicted to drugs. The inevitable downward spiral of her life is as common as it is tragic. <br /> <br />Then there is Clyde McCoy, Mark's neighbour and an ex-screenwriter who has turned his back on the business after being burnt on a movie deal years before. He puts forward the plight of the screenwriter as sitting on the lowest rung of the Hollywood ladder. He's a bitter disillusioned man, but he is also the source of many of the insightful stories about the life that he shunned. McCoy is given a fully developed background by Lankford breathing life into his character, yet he remains the great enigma of the story. <br /> <br />I found this to be a hugely entertaining book, with the story smacking of the feeling that, yes, this is what life is actually like for the writers, the aspiring actresses, the hopeful film-makers. Mark's investigation doesn't necessarily roll along at a fast pace, but it opens up the world around him and introduces us to more troubling issues such as the role of drugs and sex in this surreal side of life. <br /> <br />Given that Terrill Lee Lankford has produced, directed and written feature films, his take on the darker side of Hollywood can be considered as coming from the voice of experience. He takes a great poke at a huge and powerful industry while providing a story that is darkly humorous and richly entertaining. <br /> <br />I would categorise EARTHQUAKE WEATHER as Hollywood noir, providing a realistic, but very entertaining insider view of the less glamorous side of the Hollywood film industry.  <br />	2004-07-25
581074:US	47964988	R2EL61LATEJSJW	1930997507	176941266	Texas Wind	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Strong Private Investigator Mystery	Originally released in 1980, TEXAS WIND was virtually out of print the moment it was published thanks to the distribution problems of Manor Books, the book's publisher. But the book has long been on the lips of fans of hardboiled private detective novels, ever on the lookout for quality stories from the genre. Finally, in 2004 the small publisher Point Blank Press has republished the book and provided us with the opportunity of meeting Cody, James Reasoner's calm but reassuringly capable Texan private investigator. <br /> <br />The book starts with an introduction by Ed Gorman where he gives a brief history of the early fate of the book, why he feels that it?s an important book and its place within the private investigator sub-genre. It effective in whetting the appetite by hinting at what we can expect in the story to follow, telling us what it is about the story and the principle character that appeals to him. <br /> <br />Set in Fort Worth, Texas, TEXAS WIND is as pure a private investigator story as I can remember reading. In so saying, I would be inclined to recommend it to the dedicated P.I. readers who like to absorb themselves in the case rather than learning too much about the characters involved and then enjoy seeing them evolve throughout a story. <br /> <br />We pick up the story as Cody is travelling through Fort Worth on his way to the opulent residence of the Traft family where he is to meet Gloria Traft who wants to hire him to find her daughter, Amanda. Amanda is a university student living away from home, but she has been missing for some time and Mrs Traft wants her found quietly while her husband is away to avoid unwanted publicity. Cody immediately does what all good private investigators do; he starts off gathering information through interviews. His first stop is Lisa Montgomery, Amanda's roommate. Lisa was the person who first raised the alarm and who seems to be taking her absence hardest. He follows that up with the owner of a bar where Amanda, Lisa and a boy named Jeff Willington worked as part of a band. They?re straightforward leads but they establish Cody?s no-nonsense clear-headed investigative technique. <br /> <br />Reasoner does a good job of stepping up the pace of the story at regular intervals throughout the book. At about the time that the case looks as though it is about to stall, Cody discovers that Jeff Willington has also not been seen since the night Amanda disappeared. This leads him to suspect that maybe Amanda has run off with the boy of her own free will until a ransom demand is received by Gloria Traft. The case suddenly spins in a new direction and Cody is no longer working on a missing person case, he's working on a kidnapping and has to make the decision whether to involve the police or keep on investigating. <br /> <br />At around 140 pages long there is no choice than for this to be a fast paced mystery. The action moves so quickly that Cody barely has time for a date with his long time admirer, Janice Bryant. Reasoner has not wasted a word as he has presented a private investigator story that focuses almost exclusively on the plot and, with one exception, has ignored any thought of giving us more than a bare-bones introduction to the characters. They're simply there to move the case forward. <br /> <br />The exception to this, of course, is Cody himself. Giving the story added appeal is his clean-cut personality. It really is refreshing to follow a protagonist who doesn't go in for the hard drinking or macho posturing which you find sometimes gets in the way of an investigation. We know he is well educated, owns a large collection of books and is a connoisseur of modern western art, listing favourites such as Frederick Remington and Charlie Russell.  <br /> <br />I found this to be an enthralling book that combines a good solid mystery with a straightforward plot and a strong protagonist. Speaking as a fan of this sub-genre of fiction, I thought this was a very satisfying read. <br />	2004-07-21

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I picked up my copy of TWO-WAY SPLIT by Allan Guthrie although I had my suspicions it would involve the darker side of life. At least I was correct in that assumption. What I wasn't prepared for was the superb depiction of a group of troubled people unknowingly digging themselves deeper and deeper into terrible trouble.<br />Robin Greaves, his wife Carol and her lover Eddie Soutar are robbers who are planning on robbing a post office in a daring daylight raid. Their plan, in order to get the cashiers to cooperate, is to utilise the two ingredients that they believe is common in all successful robberies: hostage taking and violence. It's not a perfect plan but it's a pretty good one and should have a good possibility of success. But a few ingredients are added to the set-up that not only tips the balance towards a more precarious outcome, but also turns the story into a melange of unexpected twists and turns.<br />The first glimmer that all may not go smoothly comes when Greaves finds out through a private investigator that Carol and Eddie are having an affair. Understandably Robin doesn't take the news well and the simmering rage he harbours looks like it could bubble over at any moment.<br />Possible problem number two is the revelation that Robin has already spent some time in a mental institution. In itself this wouldn't exactly be a problem, but we also know that he hasn't been taking some sort of medication for almost five months. When going into a tense situation carrying weapons, one wouldn't think that the ideal person to be watching your back is a betrayed husband, who may not be 100% mentally stable, would one?<br />Another problem is that a man named Pearce, a recently released prisoner who has done time for murder is planning on visiting his mother at lunchtime. Oh yeah...his mother works in a post office.<br />The final little fly in theointment is the appearance of Don. (Keep an eye out for Don).<br />Guthrie has chosen to tell this story along a timeline, heading each new chapter with a timestamp which serves to remind us just how quickly the events unfold. It's a wonderfully tough crime novel set in Edinburgh in a suitably sleazy part of town where the feeling of desperation simply oozes off the pages. Massage parlours, broken down tenements and dirty alleyways form the grim backdrop to this dark story of greed, violence and betrayal.<br />There are no heroes in TWO-WAY SPLIT, in fact none of the main characters are particularly likable but what they lack in endearing personality they more than make up in complex obsessions. The gang of Robin, Carol and Eddie are doomed to fail from the start. What's unclear is just what character deficiency will be the one to ultimately trip them up.  Pearce probably comes closest to hero status, at least displaying some sort of empathy with others. But he is also established as a man of extreme violence, much of it controlled and rather cold-blooded giving him a frighteningly dangerous air about him. And as for Don, well you'll just have to wait and read about him yourself.<br />At only around 180 pages long, it is an extremely fast-paced book with not a word wasted on overly long descriptions of incidental details. From the build up of the robbery to the robbery itself and beyond to the thieves apartment den, this is a tightly woven story that flow together seamlessly as all the main players are drawn inexorably together for a thrilling finale.<br />Although I've painted a picture of a rather dark story of violence, hatred and evil, it's a fascinating story that will keep you guessing as there is no telling in which direction Guthrie will take it next. From a simple robbery to a showdown of unbelievably unusual proportions, it's an engaging example of tartan noir that is very difficult to put down once picked up.	2004-07-19
586399:US	47964988	R3NJMRSFUYACF2	0312305281	951781936	Hard as Nails: A Joe Kurtz Novel	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Kurtz is Tougher Than Tough	This is the 3rd book in Dan Simmons' ultra-hardboiled Joe Kurtz series a private investigator series that is perfect for lovers of gritty, violent and somewhat dark thrillers. An important point before moving any further into this review, I would recommend reading the first two books in the series, HARDCASE and HARD FREEZE first. Numerous references are made to characters and events from the first two books and if you haven't read them, it could become very confused. Simmons also tends to assume that the reader is aware of Kurtz's personal history throwing in references to earlier books that explain why he has taken the actions that he did. I see this as a bit of a weakness as far as the book is concerned; it doesn't cater very well for people who are new to the series. <br />Things don't start well for Joe Kurtz in HARD AS NAILS although when you consider that he is shot in the head, I suppose you could say that the fact that he survived suggests he was actually lucky. Anyway, the wound he receives and the resultant headache are used time and again throughout the story to emphasize just how tough he is. Joe Kurtz is the kind of character who makes you feel tired just reading about him at the best of times, but Simmons puts him through such extreme pain that by the end I was completely exhausted. <br />The force driving Kurtz forward is his desire to find out who shot him and why. With almost manic determination he begins his hunt, but getting in his way is not one but two mafia dons, past adversaries Angelina Farino Ferrara and Toma Gonzaga. Both of them have had reason in the past to attempt to have Kurtz killed but this time they have sought him out to ask him to help them with a problem. <br />Their problem is that someone is killing their junkie customers and dealers and then phoning with the details of the location as confirmation. The mafia is then stepping in and cleaning up the killer's mess, afraid that word will get out and the customers will be scared off. They want Kurtz to identify the killer for them so they can rid themselves of this threat to their profitability. It's a highly improbable premise, as is the suggestion that the best solution that 2 mafia families can come up with is a man who has been a thorn in their sides for years. <br /> A couple of interesting minor characters are introduced in the course of the investigation. Firstly, Joe is reunited with an old flame and now a police officer, Rigby King. She provides the first glimmer of romance in the series and also evokes the first indication of some sort of human emotion out of Kurtz. She also provides him with a partner (of sorts) during his investigation - someone he can talk to and bounce ideas off of. Up until this book, he has been the ultimate loner, living by the creed of looking out for number one at all times. Secondly, we meet the killer. Known to us as The Dodger we're made privy to a few of his executions and the thoughts going through his head before, during and after he carries them out. It is clear that he's a heartless, soulless killing machine who is frighteningly efficient at his job. We know he's working for a master, but we don't know who that is, providing us with the number 1 mystery of the book. <br />The story charges ahead at breakneck speed building from an action-packed opening to an outrageous battle towards the end. I got the impression that Dan Simmons tried to jam every thriller plot device he could think of into the book and, while it succeeds in providing a very entertaining thriller, I thought it lost the edgy dangerous appeal that had been built so effectively in the first two books of the series. <br />While Dan Simmons has moved the Joe Kurtz series away from the bleak, desperate tone that shrouded the first two books and has opted for a more high-octane thriller with HARD AS NAILS, I'm a sucker for fast-paced thrillers and this book is certainly that in my opinion. It's exciting, it's suspenseful and Kurtz is still one of the meanest, toughest guys ever to have graced the pages of a hardboiled novel.	2004-07-16

Those 7 books are set in the present and Reacher's past is merely hinted at, the reason why he left the army unclear. In THE ENEMY we go back 14 years, Reacher is a young MP at the start of a promising military career.<br />It's New Year's Eve, 1989, and Jack Reacher is the MP Duty Officer for the night at Fort Bird, North Carolina when he receives a phone call from the local police telling him that a soldier had died in a nearby cheap motel. He gives it only minor importance until he learns that the &quot;dead soldier&quot; is actually a 2-star General who has suffered a fatal heart attack. This is enough to jolt him into action.<br />We know that the General was in a place he shouldn't have been doing something he shouldn't and he was in possession of something that would be dynamite if it got into the wrong hands. The timing of the heart attack that killed him couldn't have been worse. We know these things but Reacher doesn't. All he knows is that there is something wrong with the scene where a General, who is supposed to have been on his way to an important conference but doesn't appear to have a briefcase with him.<br />He has barely begun trying to piece together the why's and wherefore's about the General when he is faced with two more deaths, murders this time, that are obviously related. By this stage he has recruited a partner, young, fast-driving go-getter Lieutenant Summer who is prepared to push as many boundaries as Reacher asks her to. They're both all set to run a full-scale investigation into the deaths and the possibility of missing documents when they are ordered off the case by their Commanding Officer, a very strange order that does not sit well with either of them.<br />As readers of past Jack Reacher booksalready know and new readers to the series will soon find out, nothing fires Jack Reacher up more quickly than an obvious cover-up. He's an investigator and has a keen sense of what's right and what's not and the order to stand down only results in him continuing his investigation - with prejudice. The fly in the ointment is that now, the investigation must be done covertly or both Reacher and Summer will face disciplinary action from their superiors.<br />Written in the first person, this turns out to be an intriguing mystery to follow with aspects of the case giving the feeling of being a &quot;locked room&quot; mystery, thanks to the tight security surrounding the entry to and exit from the Fort Bird base. Of added interest are the protocols that come from conducting an investigation from within the armed forces and Reacher's initiative in getting around pesky problems such as obeying the orders of a superior officer and insubordination.<br />Lee Child writes this plot driven military police procedural with an economical style, putting together an intriguing mystery while keeping character development to a minimum. The exception to this is in the inclusion of a side story involving Reacher's family. In a brief interlude to the investigation Reacher and his brother, Joe, visit their dying mother in Paris and they talk together about past, happier times. In so doing they fill in Reacher's background, fleshing him out and giving us a character who we can feel even more sympathetic to. <br />As mentioned at the start of this review, this is the 8th Jack Reacher book, but the good news for those who have never read one of the books from the series before is that, because this book is a prequel to the series, it's not only possible to read it if you haven't read the others, but I think it would be the perfect place to start. Speaking for myself, I didn't read the books strictly in the order in which they were published and didn't really feel as though I were losing anything in past knowledge or getting spoilers from earlier reacher adventures.	2004-07-16

So what gives the series that little something special? Well actually, it's a couple of things. The first is that Tony Valentine is a 64 year old retired cop, an unusually advanced age for the protagonist of a hardboiled private investigator series bringing with it a completely different perspective than his younger, less experience counterparts. The second is that Valentine specialises in a very specific, but very fascinating field. He runs an agency as a consultant to the country's casinos. When it comes to spotting a cheat or a scam in action he has no peer, an ability known as Grift Sense, and is constantly fielding calls from desperate casinos asking him for help.<br />Before his first day back in Las Vegas is out, Valentine has saved a woman from committing suicide, renewed his acquaintance with the owner of the Acropolis Resort and Casino (scene of GRIFT SENSE), become a suspect in a murder, fought off an intruder in his hotel room and identified numerous scams both over the phone and after watching security video. Not bad for an old guy. But this is just a precursor to the main event that is to come when he identifies an old adversary he assumed was still in prison.<br />Meanwhile, his son Gerry is up to his old tricks again, mixing with the wrong crowd and looking to make a fast buck. What starts out as a card-counting hustle turns into a much larger, much more life threatening proposition for Gerry Valentine. It's just as well for him that Tony is close at hand and has the connections to mount some sort of rescue operation. What isn't so certain is whether Tony's efforts will be enough to save Gerry's life.<br />I think I may have made a misjudgement of the Tony Valentine persona and hence, the overall tone of the series while reading the earlier books. I placed the series on the lighter side of hardboiled thanks to the lightness in tone in which it is told and the many pithy observations made by Valentine as he makes his way from casino to casino and one gambling city to another. During LOADED DICE it became blindingly obvious that what I took to be light-hearted witticisms can more accurately be diagnosed as observations made by a world-weary ex-cop.<br />As the series has progressed Valentine has become a tougher character to go with his already established genius when it comes to spotting a scam. In LOADED DICE he displays a ruthlessness that caught me unprepared considering his usually more passive responses to confrontation. This book was certainly given a much harder edge than the earlier ones; an edge that increases the level of action and paints Valentine as a more gritty character than I first credited him with being.<br />The appeal that the Tony Valentine books have for me comes from the many cheats, cons and scams that are uncovered and explained throughout each book. Many of them have nothing to do with the main story, but are added as part of Valentine's day to day duties as a consultant. These sidelights are highly entertaining and are combined with a compelling thriller that turns out to be very relevant to recent terrorist events.	2004-07-09
601633:US	47964988	R1XSIV8HZM5F90	0345464818	932499618	The Madman's Tale: A Novel (Katzenbach, John)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Chillingly Unusual	This is a psychological thriller set in a mental hospital, and is told by a schizophrenic. Francis Xavier Petrel is a former patient of Western State Hospital and is writing down his memories of his time at the hospital after meeting another former patient and agreeing that certain incidents simply had to be revealed. Running true to his status as someone who is mentally ill, he chooses to write his story on the walls of his apartment.<br />Petrel picks the story up as he is being escorted into the hospital for the first time. At the time, he is virtually incoherent, scared and distracted he is unable to answer the most basic of questions and repeatedly begs to be allowed to go home. His fear is wonderfully captured in the opening few pages and perfectly displays how sick Francis could become without the proper treatment.<br />Soon after being admitted, Francis meets his first major ally, Peter the Fireman. Peter is in the hospital to undergo observation before an upcoming court appearance in which he has to answer a murder charge. He instantly bestows upon Francis the nickname C-Bird and it is by this name that he known throughout the rest of the book. Peter is a strong character in the story, in his outside life he was an arson investigator and so was used to taking charge of situations. It's obvious from the outset that he doesn't really belong in a mental institution, but his immediate past that brought him to the hospital is not so clear.<br />Not long after Francis has been in the hospital, a horrifying murder of a trainee nurse rocks the hospital, both for it's viciousness and for the fact that everyone is supposed to be locked up tight at night. The murder prompts the arrival of the story's 3rd major character, prosecutor Lucy Jones. Lucy has been on the trail of a serial killer and the M.O. of this murder matches the earlier cases. She makes an interesting character, a beautiful woman whose beauty is marred by a disfiguring scar that runs down one side of her face. She received the scar many years ago when she was attacked and raped one night at university. It's an incident that sits heavily on her and that she plays over and over in her mind throughout the investigation. <br />The story is essentially a murder investigation, but it's an investigation with a difference because it is run completely within the mental hospital raising all sorts of pitfalls and barriers. Trying to locate a suspected serial killer by pinpointing unusual behaviour is virtually impossible because everyone there is responsible for abnormal traits of one form or another. When the resident's routines are disrupted there is generally widespread emotional upheaval which puts everyone in the hospital under immense pressure. Interviewing witnesses is almost irrelevant with most of the patients either catatonic or delusional not a lot of valuable information can be obtained.<br />Together the three main characters conduct their investigation as best they can, hampered by the fact that one of them is known to be suffering schizophrenia and another has been arrested for murder and is being assessed on his sanity. This is not your ordinary run-of-the-mill murder investigation. While the investigation continues with very little progress being made, the unthinkable realisation hits home...the killer, who is in all likelihood a serial killer, is still living in the hospital locked up with everyone else just biding his time and waiting to kill again. Yikes!<br />If the story has a weakness it is in the slow pace in which the events inside the hospital take place. Katzenbach concentrates on the effect every event has on the mind of the person experiencing it, making each scene seem to last for an inordinately long time. While it enables us to get a perfect idea of just what each character is going through, it tends to inhibit the flow of the story. That being said, I still found myself becoming drawn into the story, easily able to imagine the frustration ofliving inside the hospital.<br />Thanks to constant flashes forward to the present where we see the effects that reliving his memories has on Francis, we are given hints as to what is going to happen later on in the story. Rather than spoiling the story for me, it tended to create a tremendous feeling of anticipation, with just enough information being given out to create uncertainty about the direction the story will head next. The flashes to the present also revealed that Francis is becoming more unstable as he neglects his medication due to his single-minded determination to tell his story. In the end, he is in a race against his own mind to get his story out before madness completely engulfs him.<br />John Katzenbach has once again produced an outstanding psychological thriller combining a terrifying murder investigation conducted under tight restrictions with the unusual but very interesting surroundings of a mental hospital. I was pulled completely into the story and found myself frantically choosing suspects and then discarding them in an effort to work out who the killer was.	2004-07-06

Why, you follow it up with an even better book that leaves the reader begging for more. (Please Mr O'Connor, may I read some more?)<br />When Simon Crouch discovers that his girlfriend is sleeping with a git like Max Fallon, his grief is soon overcome by a hot rage. His answer, in terms of revenge, is to spike Max's drink with a few tablets of acid. The result of the introduction of the mind-altering substance is that Max's mind is altered just a little too much and he goes from Max Fallon, bond trader extraordinaire to Max Fallon, vessel of Soma the Hindu God.<br />Using the speed in which I raced through the book as a guide, this was one of the most enjoyable books I've read this year. For its suspense and the way in which the story unfolded, I found it to be compelling reading. If you're a fan of psychological thrillers then you're in for a treat when you read this one, with the bodies piling up at an alarming rate. A nice little touch was the addition of a paranormal to the book, but you'll have to find out about that when you read the book...and I strongly recommend that you do.	2004-07-05

Displaying sharp humour, taut plotting and crackling dialogue, THE GLASS HIGHWAY is the archetypical hardboiled mystery.<br />The storyline of THE GLASS HIGHWAY follows the well worn traditional formula of many private investigator books that have come before it or have followed. It's a missing person investigation that is solved very quickly, but in solving it many more questions are raised revealing a darker, more sordid mystery underneath. It's Estleman's ability to keep the pace high while the atmosphere borders on bleak that sets the story apart from others.<br />The missing person that Walker is hired to find is Bud Broderick, the estranged son of local newsreader Sandy Broderick. Rather than showing concern for his son's safety, he wants him found because he is worried that Bud may be into drugs, a possibility that may adversely affect his broadcasting career. It doesn't take long for Walker to find Bud, but he also finds Paula Royce, the girl he has been staying with. It's Paula Royce who sends the investigation spinning off on a right hand turn.<br />Soon after supposedly solving his missing person investigation, a murder takes place. Although Walker is, at best, a fringe participant, the police jump all over him, taking him in for questioning and locking him away for a couple of days. In quick succession, another couple of bodies are discovered by Walker, both somehow linked to Paula Royce, who has now gone into hiding, but who is still obviously the key to everything. It's up to Walker to piece the mystery together, save his own skin and keep his private investigator's licence.<br />This is a gritty mystery combining clever, light humoured dialogue with Walker's darker more introspective moments. Walker displays a keen tenacity as well as an intuitive detective's brain in this very enjoyable hardboiled mystery.	2004-06-30

Unfortunately the series only runs to 3 books (at least so far) and Musclebound is the 3rd book. Eva Wylie is a tough woman who defiantly narrates her story. She doesn't tell us the story so much as she drops it in a sodden heap at our feet and then says, \\"Well what are ya waiting for, read it\\". <br />She is a raw, in-your-face professional wrestler who holds a night watchman job at a car-wreckers. At least, she was a professional wrestler, known as the London Lassassin until she was banned from the ring. Now she just works nights with her dogs, Ramses, Linnekar and Milo.<br />At the start of the book, Eva is down on her luck, out of work, often drunk and getting tossed out of pubs. But she's still the same tough character. She brooks no nonsense from anyone and will loudly tell you where to go if you cross her. Her put downs and sarcastic comebacks range from crude to blatantly abusive and are a feature of the story that I find hugely entertaining.<br />After getting kicked out of a pub late one night, she spots a car at a service station just begging to be \\"borrowed\\". She barely hesitates before jumping in and speeding off, only to be shocked when the owner of the car shoots out the passenger windows. She is even more shocked when she later discovers that sitting on the back seat of the car is a bag full of cash. Naturally Eva takes the cash, pleased with her unexpected change of fortune. But she finds out that having money can cause almost as many problems as having none. <br />Her easy life is suddenly disrupted by a procession of unwelcome visitors as can be imagined when coming into possession of that much many in dubious circumstances. There's Keif, a fellow wrestler who virtually adopts Eva and vows to train her back into shape, Fish Face, Droopy-drawers, The Enemy (Anna Lee, Cody's other protagonist) and God Greg, not to mention Wozzizname and the police. They sound like weird names, but only because Eva tends to christen people with her own nicknames and then refers to them only by their new nicknames, no matter how derogatory they may be.<br />Among the unwelcome guests who visit her home comes a visitor who is very definitely in the welcome category. Her sister, Simone appears one day much to Eva's joy. For the duration of the first two books, Eva has had a burning desire to find Simone but her mother continually refused to tell her where she was. Simone's introduction to the story is an interesting one because it enables us to finally see another side of Eva, one where she is desperate to please somebody else.<br />What makes this book so enjoyable is the total consistency of Eva's hate. She doesn't discriminate, if you tick her off she will give you an absolute gob full and that's where the fun begins. She also has an interesting philosophy on life one that is, shall we say, unconventional, and she updates us with it as we follow her story.	2004-06-29

After beautiful young law student Chloe Lawson is brutally raped and horribly disfigured then left for dead in her bed by a masked intruder, she drops out of her life in New York City. She begins to live in terror of a repeat attack. The opening few scenes of this gripping legal thriller are shocking in their violence but they set Chloe's victim mentality up perfectly.<br />We then jump forward 12 years to Miami, Florida where Chloe has reinvented herself as C.J. Townsend, an Assistant State Attorney, and a darn good one at that. She is working on a serial killer case, currently 11 victims strong, that has suddenly broken wide open with a suspect in custody. C.J. will be prosecuting and is looking forward to the challenge. When she meets the suspect in court, she realises that he's the man who raped her 12 years ago and suddenly her case and her life spins out of control once again.<br />C.J. is forced to make a decision based on her feelings of revenge versus her training in what is right in the eyes of the law. As a prosecutor, no one works harder, but she knows her judgement is bound to be impaired by the knowledge of what this man has done to her in the past. It makes the case even more fascinating than it promises to be.<br />It's a serial killer story, but it's more. And it's more than just a legal thriller. There is a fascinating moral and ethical dilemma that a rape victim is placed in when she is unexpectedly given her chance at revenge. The question is, will she take it? This book was satisfying on many levels, but mainly because it forced me to think while I was being entertained. This is a wonderful debut by Jilliane Hoffman.	2004-06-28

It's an old photo and one of the people in it looks a lot like her husband, even though he denies it's him. However, when her husband disappears only moments after seeing it, the only thing she can think of that may be related is the photo.<br />Grace takes on the role of investigator after failing to convince the police that her husband may not have left willingly. The ensuing hunt becomes increasingly desperate and Grace has the added burden of caring for her two young children while fighting off the feeling that she's all alone in her search. The questions she has to answer, where is her husband and why has one of the faces in the photo been obliterated by an X?<br />The presence of an assassin named Eric Wu, first introduced to scare the pants off us in TELL NO ONE, adds a certain level of unbridled terror to the story. Eric Wu is a martial arts expert, specialising in incapacitating or killing his victims simply by attacking pressure points on the body. He is a man completely devoid of emotion, effectively a killing machine and a formidable opponent. He has been hired to eliminate the people in the photo and it looks as though nothing's going to stop him.<br />As the investigation unfolds, we begin to find out more about Grace's past which is cunningly woven into her current crisis. The addition of a few menacingly dangerous characters like the enigmatic Cram and his boss Carl Vespa provides an added surreal dimension to the story. The obviously dangerous Wu and the violence exuded by Cram sets the scene for a tantalising showdown.<br />Harlan Coben has once again produced a thrill-ride of a book with unexpected twists, unlikely heroes and an unusual outcome at the end. His new speciality of books about marriages in which secrets come back to haunt the spouses is continued here and it works just as well her as it did in his firststand-alone, TELL NO ONE.	2004-06-23

Pelecanos is an acquired taste because when he tells his story he holds nothing back no matter how distasteful the acts may be. Modern hardboiled at it's nastiest but brilliant in capturing the mood of the people and the time. <br />Before HARD REVOLUTION came the Derek Strange trilogy of RIGHT AS RAIN, HELL TO PAY and SOUL CIRCUS. Set in present day Washington D.C., they featured the black private detective struggling to earn a buck while making every effort to ensure the children from his neighbourhood had a chance to make something of themselves rather than being drawn into the gang lifestyle. Now we are taken back in time, first to 1959 and then to 1968 to meet the young Derek Strange. <br />Unrest simmers close to the surface as everyone senses that there is a social change in the air. This part of the story is paced by constant updates about the approaching rally in Memphis that Martin Luther King JR is due to speak at. So apart from the fictional tension built up by the actions of Pelecanos' characters, there is also the added tension that comes from knowing the true events that about to take place.<BR> <BR>This is not what I would term your usual crime novel because there is no clear single plot. Rather, it travels along many paths and gives an insightful commentary about social unrest in a tumultuous period of modern history. Murders take place, murders are solved, but they are more or less incidental to the story which is more a focus on the characters and the period of time in which they lived. It's a powerful book that deals with sensitive issues in a hard-nosed way.	2004-06-23

Shug's life is far from normal and even further from ideal. The only person in the world who loves Shug is his mother, but although she tries to protect him with sweet words of encouragement - referring to him as her Sweet Mister - Red's hatred and meanness digs its way through to him.<br />Although Red hates Shug, he is not above using him for his criminal ventures. His favourite is making Shug break into people's houses to steal their prescription drugs. When Red's around, Shug and Glenda huddle together in fear, walking on eggshells for fear of setting him off. When Red's not around Shug pleads with Glenda to leave Red and end their misery, but Glenda needs a man around and just can't bring herself to leave.<br />It's not until a stranger enters the scene, giving Glenda the hope that she may be able to escape Red's clutches that the story, and Shug's life, is thrown into utter chaos. The result is violent, taking a terrible toll on the tiny family. <br />This is an exquisitely told story that is as striking in its tragedy as it is in the perfect imagery that Woodrell's prose evokes. The tragedy in the story lies in the confusion experienced by Shug, thanks to his exclusive exposure to his dysfunctional family. He sees things that no 13-year-old child should see and tries things that no child should use.<br />Woodrell has written a book that I found unputdownable. The characters aren't particularly likable in fact, some of them are very hateable, but the emotion is perfectly captured, the story is thought provoking and leaves you feeling sadly shocked by the end.	2004-06-20

If you were planning on reading THE POET, do so before picking this book up. In my opinion, failing to do so will ruin both books. <br />The Poet is active again. The brilliant but deranged serial killer who somehow escaped in Michael Connelly's award-winning book THE POET has left the FBI the location of his killing field. He also leaves a note inviting Rachel Walling, his FBI combatant in the earlier book, to come and catch him. Since The Poet disappeared Rachel has been posted to the Dakotas as a form of FBI punishment for her failures, but she answers the call and heads straight for the Nevada desert where ten bodies are being exhumed. Joining her, in a round about sort of way is Harry Bosch, who happens to stumble into the investigation, but naturally, runs rings around the FBI.<br />Their partnership is an uneasy one. Bosch suspects that Rachel has been ordered by her superior to keep an eye on him and this is how she has decided to do it, Rachel knows that Bosch isn't telling her everything he knows about the case. And they're both pretty certain that The Poet is luring them into a trap that he will spring at a time of his choosing. It's a chase that will take them from Las Vegas all the way back to Harry's home turf in Los Angeles.<br />Michael Connelly has written a celebration of past books by joining together characters from his different series and stand-alones. This isn't the first time he has done this, having already brought together Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb in A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT.<br />This is certainly not the most compelling book in the Harry Bosch series, but to give it its dues, the detective work was clever and insightful. Where it fell down for me was in the pacing. It drifts along for an inordinate length of time before there was any real interaction between the killer and the protagonists. In place of the head-to-head confrontations between Harry Bosch and The Poet, the story was taken up with Bosch butting heads with the FBI. While this was entertaining to begin with, its continuation became irritating because it impeded the flow of the story.<br />THE NARROWS never really delivers on the promises it makes through the knowledge that a heartless killer is out there possibly hunting the hunters. Comparing it to a couple of the books from which the characters were taken, I thought THE POET was a more face-paced thriller that contained much edgier drama, while the previous Harry Bosch book LOST LIGHT gave us a more introspective analysis of the Bosch persona, which epitomises the Harry Bosch series, while also providing a heart-pounding thriller. <br />An unusual but effective feature employed by Connelly was to shift from a first person narrative to a third person description from chapter to chapter. Whenever Bosch too the scene, it was told from his perspective, but Connelly gave himself the freedom to describe events outside of Bosch's realm too.<br />It's a good thing I'm just wild about Harry or I'd be wondering what all the fuss was about. Although it was a treat to have the interwoven characters and past storylines joined, I felt the story fell a little flat.	2004-06-18
633127:US	47964988	R8SN7883UH9Q8	0786710187	440760121	Streets on Fire: A Jack Liffey Mystery	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Heart Pounding	In the 5th book of the Jack Liffey series, John Shannon has created dual plots that start off as two completely separate incidents, but become extremely significant to each other and to the outcome of the story. His control of these plots is very effective, never letting one storyline take over the other. Instead, he just reminds us occasionally that there is \\"another danger\\" out there.<br />Jack Liffey is an unofficial private detective who specialises in finding missing children. In this case, the plot that has Liffey's attention is an investigation into the disappearance of a black boy and his white girlfriend. There is a strong suggestion that their disappearance may have something to do with an earlier altercation with a bike gang.<br />In the course of his investigation, Liffey crosses paths with the aforementioned bike gang, has a major run-in with an unusual but extremely dangerous religious group and meets Ornetta, the delightful shining light of the story. Ornetta is an 11-year-old girl who has an incredible gift for storytelling. She steals every scene in which she appears, which is fortunately many.<br />The wider storyline running in parallel to the Liffey focus is a wave of rioting that has broken out throughout L.A. on the back of the knocking unconscious of a black baseball star by a member of the LAPD. The riots are triggered when the officer involved is acquitted of any wrongdoing. The ongoing riots play a major part in the story as Liffey is caught up in them in a desperate race against time while crossing from one side of the city to the other.<br />A much larger role in this book compared to earlier books is given to Maeve, Jack's 15 year old daughter. She has been a fringe character up until STREETS ON FIRE, merely providing a poignant side story that highlights their mutual affection for one another. Two events take place that brings Maeve to her father's place and into his investigation. The first is a run-in with her stepfather and the second is the discovery of her mother's old Nancy Drew books. She moves in with her father and gets the idea that she could try her hand at detective work a la Nancy Drew. While the results are predictable, it gives us an opportunity to get to know her better and it cements the bond between father and daughter even more than it was originally.<br />An instant friendship forms between Maeve and Ornetta that becomes an incredibly strong bond between two the girls who swear blood-sisterhood with each other. I felt their love and friendship was on of the strongest parts of the book, providing a counterpoint to the hate that Jack Liffey was fighting. It was inevitable that the girls are involved in the climax to the book, giving us someone to care about and then putting their lives at risk.<br />From a quiet start, this story builds in intensity as the unrest around the city grows and finally explodes cutting across the investigation that Jack Liffey conducts. The ending is highly charged, heart in mouth action. Overall, it's a detective story that takes us deeper into the personal life of Jack Liffey causing me to care about him and his family even more.	2004-06-11

He leaves a video message, challenging his sons to find him and their inheritance, which comes in the form of paintings, gems, jewellery and sculptures among other valuable artefacts. Max accumulated his wealth by robbing ancient tombs and would like his sons to &quot;earn&quot; their inheritance in a treasure hunt of their own.<br />Almost immediately, the brothers split up even though they are strongly advised to cooperate with each other. The oldest brother, Philip, visits his father's former partner; a private investigator named Marcus Hauser to request his help and almost immediately discovers that the trail will lead to Honduras.<br />Vernon is the second oldest of the brothers and is a cult member. When he seeks the cult's leader's advice on what he should do, the lure of a possible $100 million payout is too much for the Teacher and he accompanies Vernon to Honduras too.<br />The youngest brother and easily the most grounded of the three, Tom decides, to hell with his father and returns to his Utah veterinary practice. It's not until the beautiful anthropologist Sally Colorado arrives to tell him about an important Mayan document in his father's possession that must be recovered that he begins to consider joining in. Soon after, he finds out that the lives of his brothers are in grave danger and so he decides that he too must head for the jungle of Honduras to help them.<br />The Mayan document turns out to be a codex containing two thousand medical prescriptions and preparations using all sorts of plants and animals found in the surrounding rainforest. These medicines promise all sorts of fabulous, undiscovered cures, possibly even for cancer and would be worth untold millions to any medical company lucky enough to own it. The lure of this codex is responsible for more treasure hunters than just the brothers themselves.<br />Okay, this kind of story has been done many times over. It's an adventure story where good guys enter an inhospitable environment, like a South American jungle, in search of a fabulous treasure. When good guys and treasure are placed in close proximity there will inevitably be bad guys who won't think twice about killing to lay their hands on the treasure. This is the basis for the excitement produced in the book, although only partly. The other ever-present danger comes from the dangers in the jungle itself.<br />If you like treasure hunt adventures based on against-the-odds survival this book will prove to be very enjoyable. The characters we meet during the journey range from fascinating to delightful to downright dangerous. The characters are somewhat clich&eacute;d, taken straight out of Indiana Jones, but the story is compelling and allow you to sit back, stick the brain in neutral and enjoy the ride.	2004-06-06

It's told from the point of view of Macky, a photojournalist living in Tucson, Arizona. Macky is the kind of man prepared to go the extra mile in order to get the story.<br />Before hitting us with the main story, we open with an example of how far Macky will go to get his story when he impersonates a miner. He plunges into the depths of the earth to take photos of the dangerous working conditions that a major mining company allows its employees to work. Effectively we are told that here is a guy who is prepared to go to any lengths to get a good story. The fact that he unearths a major scandal proves that he can deliver.<br />But it's the opening couple of sentences that set the hook in my mouth with expectation of an interesting story:<br /> \\"I didn't set out to kill anyone. All I wanted was a good story, which is all a journalist ever wants, but I should have seen it was going bad.\\"<br />This is the kind of opening that prompts all sorts of questions in me. Obviously someone dies, but who and how? How was Macky involved? How did it go bad? Was Macky affected by the death?<br />The good story that Macky refers to in the quoted opening sentence involves a retired judge who has a passion for dog fighting. That's right, dog fighting...as in putting two pit bulls in a ring and letting them have at it in a fight to the death. Highly illegal and just the sort of juicy stuff that has Macky salivating at the prospect of revealing.<br />Macky's source is the judge's former girlfriend, Alice Malone, who has been abused by the judge and is looking for a chance to get her revenge. She has come to Macky after seeing his earlier mining expose and wants the judge to receive the same sort of treatment as the mining company.<br />What follows is a sordid affair between Macky and Malone as he falls under her spell, allowing himself to be manipulated, both by the graphicscenes he witnesses at a dog fight and by her stories of abuse at the hands of the judge. She becomes the ultimate temptress, whipping Macky up into such moral outrage that he is open to the suggestion that perhaps destroying the judge with words and pictures may not be going far enough.<br />ARIZONA KISS is an emotionally harrowing story set in a bleak (and somewhat despised by Macky) land. It's a story of betrayal and survival, and like most noir stories, leaves you feeling a little uncomfortable at the end. It contains scenes of tremendous violence, both canine and human which some people may find disturbing.	2004-06-03
645204:US	47964988	REBFSAOKMVTPM	078670876X	95886759	The Orange Curtain: A Jack Liffey Mystery	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Slow and Methodical	I've enjoyed many detective stories over the years and some of my favourites have come in the little niche of unofficial private detectives. From John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee through Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder and James W. Hall's fly-tying Thorn, they all have the attraction of a certain maverick unconventional quality to them. So when I heard about John Shannon's Jack Liffey series I was excited by the prospect of another fast-paced detective series to add to the list. While it's true Liffey is not hampered by the shackles of pesky rules and regulations, I felt this book suffered from a level of inertia that took a long time to be shaken.<br />THE ORANGE CURTAIN is the 4th book in the Jack Liffey series. Jack Liffey is an unofficial private detective working in L.A. with a specialty of finding missing persons. He is hired by a Vietnamese man to find his daughter, a girl who has consistently scored top grades at school and had never been in trouble in her life. It's a baffling disappearance that is made more interesting for Liffey because it will take him into a part of L.A. that he has never had reason to go before.<br />Little Saigon is not a place where Jack Liffey is easily able to blend into his environment and so he is noticed almost immediately upon his arrival be one of the local street gangs. To say they are suspicious of his presence is a major understatement and they are responsible for a string of increasingly intrusive incidents that hamper his investigation.<br />It's not until Liffey meets Vietnamese businesswoman Tien Joubert, a former employer of the missing girl, that the story begins to crackle. Tien is a forthright, aggressive and beautiful woman who is used to getting what she wants...and right from the off she decides that Liffey would suit her needs as a lover. The dialog between Tien and Liffey is sharp and amusing and thanks to her connections within the Vietnamese community, she helps Jack move his investigation forward.<br />Runningin parallel to Jack Liffey's investigation and his forays amongst the residents of Little Saigon, we are fed brief flashes into the life and thoughts of Billy Gudger, a lonely, rather pathetic man. Gudger considers himself a deep thinking philosopher but in fact is just a man with some very strange ideas about his place in the world. Obviously, the fact that we keep returning to Gudger throughout the story in seemingly unrelated snatches indicates that he will play some sort of major role, the only question is how Jack Liffey and he will cross paths and what the outcome of their meeting will be.<br />I thought the strongest feature of the book is Jack Liffey. He is an easy-going, likable guy who has an everyman feel about him making him easy to relate to. He succumbs to temptation, he makes mistakes, he loses fights and the thought of dying makes his blood run cold. He has the failed marriage that seems to be de-rigueur for fictional police officers or private investigators and has a 14-year-old daughter (Maeve) with whom he shares a delightfully close relationship.<br />As I mentioned at the start of this review, the main problem I had with the book was the extremely slow pace in which everything unfolded. This may possibly reflect the cool-headed nature of Jack Liffey, but I found my mind beginning to wander, wondering when we would be getting to the point of the story. Unfortunately, the pace didn't even pick up at the higher points in the story. Instead we had to wade through pages of philosophizing by the antagonist until by the end he had me on my knees begging for mercy.<br />John Shannon presents L.A. through a rather jaundiced eye, highlighting the more remarkable sights around the city, making them part of a game between Liffey and Maeve. Although this gives the story a rather lighter tone, it actually highlights what a dangerously unconventional place their city can be, where the unexpected has a habit of happening. Liffey is willing to place himself among the unusual and unconventional, so there is a constant undertone of danger throughout the book.<br />I would be inclined to suggest reading the series mentioned at the start of this review if you are after strong, fast-paced crime novels of a hardboiled nature. Each of them features a protagonist who falls outside of the traditional private detective mold, but the action comes at a much faster rate.	2004-06-02

This unusual feature is that the very first thing we are told is that Mary Baker is telling us the story from her prison cell. Given that the bulk of the book is about her attempts to hide from the FBI and the police, we know from the start that she is ultimately unsuccessful. But as we are to learn, success or failure can be a very subjective thing. <br />Mary Baker should have known better than to trust Wrex. Her unshaven, tattooed, Harley-riding boyfriend with his ripped jeans and red bandanna was hardly convincing when he pleaded with her to deliver a package to someone waiting at L.A. International Airport. The package turns out to be a briefcase and moments after she has delivered it to a man with a foreign accent, the briefcase explodes killing the man and ensuring that pandemonium breaks out. In return for the briefcase, she has been given a heavy case which she manages to get to her car amid the confusion and then makes herself scarce. <br />After taking a little time to recover from the excitement at the airport, Mary soon realises that it won't be long before the police or the FBI come looking for her, so she decides to change her appearance and go into hiding. Before she gets a chance to leave though, she is visited by a couple of look-alike foreign agent-types who want to get their hands on the case she picked up from the airport. It's a visit from which she barely escapes and understands that her need to hide will be important to her health as well as to her freedom. <br />So Mary reinvents herself as Nina Zero, a retro punk drop-out, used to surviving the harsh street life. She finds herself a couple of room-mates who are suitably off-beat while providing adequate cover. Billy b is a driven artist intent on producing the ultimate American kitsch symbol and Cass is an out of work screenwriter waiting for her big break to come along. They each discover that the answer to what they are looking for may have walked into their laps in the form of the fugitive Mary and prepare themselves for fame or fortune on the back of her notoriety. <br />Meanwhile, Mary (as Nina) divides her time between trying to break into the artistic photography scene and joining a detective agency. The first has always been a far off, unattainable dream while the second is her way of solving some of the mysteries brought about by her new role as criminal-in-hiding. <br />First and foremost, this is an entertaining thriller dealing primarily with a cat and mouse chase story, but it's told with a humorously droll delivery. But it's also an examination of the way the experience has affected Mary. She starts out as an ordinary young woman leading a reasonably normal uneventful life. She allowed herself to be pushed around by her father and boyfriend, lacking the courage to stick up for herself. By the end of the book, although she's in a lot more trouble, she's a changed woman and has come out of the ordeal a mentally stronger person. It's this character development that I thought gave the story tremendous depth, unexpectedly so. <br />Robert Eversz has managed to keep the tone of the novel light even though the action becomes quite tense, sometimes downright desperate. The story moves ahead at all times without any flat spots, occasionally taking time out from the main chase storyline to explore a minor life experience that adds to the transformation from Mary to Nina. I found the book to be very entertaining, culminating in a poignant, satisfying ending.	2004-05-27

What makes PHOENIX stand out from the crowd as a memorable thriller is the introduction of Detective Constable Karen Sharpe. In his debut novel, Jon Connor has produced a strong mystery with an even stronger protagonist.<br />Karen Sharpe is a tough talking, hard-drinking woman. She breaks the mold as far as most of the female protagonists that I've come across go. She strikes me as a cross between Ian Rankin's Detective Inspector John Rebus and Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. The similarity comes from her total disregard for the wishes of her superior officers which is matched by her near pathological desire to work alone. <br />Our introduction to Karen comes as she is suffering from a hangover after drinking herself into oblivion the night before in an effort to cope with an unspecified anniversary. From early on we understand that there is a lot more to Karen Sharpe than first meets the eye. <br />Detective Sergeant Phil Leech of the West Yorkshire Police Department's drug squad is found shot in the head in his car in a remote field on a South Pennine moor. Leech is Karen Sharpe's superior officer and was working as her partner at the time. She can vaguely remember a late night phone call urging her to an important meeting that had to do with a case they were working on, but she was too drunk to leave her house. Leech went in her stead. Consequently, she is beset by guilt with the thought that the person with the bullet holes in their head could very well have been her. <br />A major taskforce is set up, code named Phoenix, and is headed by Detective Chief Inspector John Munroe. He appears to be a very compassionate man who takes it upon himself to help Karen through the shock of having to identifyher partner at the murder scene, not that she appears to need to be mollycoddled. He then decides to include Karen on the taskforce due to her knowledge of the case that she and Leech were working on before he was killed. <br />The investigation conducted by the West Yorkshire Police is probably the most procedural police procedural I have ever read. What I mean by this is that the actual breakdown of tasks are described in great detail at the start of the operation, more so than in most other police procedural mysteries that I have read. Plenty of detail is given in the areas of gathering evidence at the crime scene, viewing CCTV footage, following terrorist connections to eliminate the possibility that it was a Provisional IRA hit. We really knew that every avenue was being explored by the police. <br />Karen Sharpe breaks away to conduct her own investigation, blithely ignoring the tasks given to her by her Sergeant. There is a constant aura of mystery about Karen's past, glimpsed occasionally through the strange direction that she takes the case. She seems to know about suspects and facts that help her move her investigation forward, yet she doesn't really know how she knows about them. There is a definite sense that something big is going to be revealed about her before this case is solved, effectively luring me to the ending with the promise of a surprise. <br />The interaction between DCI John Munroe and Karen Sharpe is particularly interesting as their relationship develops beyond the professional. Although he holds a position of power over her due to his rank, it is Karen who rules their relationship, not only mentally but physically too (which comes as a major shock to Munroe, let me tell you). <br />The only problem I had with the book was the size of the team used to investigate the murder. The team of over 50 officers seemed unfeasibly large to me, compared to the size of the small town in which the murder was committed. It was difficult to believe that there were so few other crimes being committed that this kind of manpower could be committed to a single investigation. Admittedly, it was a fellow police officer who was murdered, but still it seemed a little unrealistic. <br />Jon Connor weaves an intriguing mystery that branches out into a much more complex plot than I first expected. Giving the story a solid edge, he has created a strong protagonist and has revealed enough about her past to make her a fascinating character, but I get the impression that he has held back more about her that will be revealed in future books.	2004-05-26

Starting in a Florida prison, the opening few chapters of OUT OF SIGHT are set as a frenetic pace as bank robber extraordinaire, Jack Foley plans and executes a daring escape. Helping him in his bid for freedom is his former partner in crime, Buddy who is waiting with a car in the prison car park. Also waiting in the car park happens to be US Marshall Karen Sisco who is sitting in her car, preparing to enter the facility when Foley makes his unexpected appearance. Quickly overpowering her, they stuff her in the trunk of her car with Foley climbing in behind her and Buddy slipping behind the wheel to affect the getaway. <br />Unbelievably cool in the crisis involved in the jail break, Foley attempts to engage Karen in conversation, even wondering aloud whether it might be possible, if circumstances were different, for the two of them to become attracted to one another. Karen of course is incredulous and wants nothing to do with the escaped prisoner, apart from capturing him and delivering him back to prison. Thinking on the events later, after escaping from Buddy and Foley, she does find herself impressed with Foley's cool head under pressure. <br />There is a brief lull in the action as we recover from the excitement of the opening scenes and the thought of the next score is placed in Foley's head. This takes the form of a robbery target in Detroit, supposedly a low-risk venture made easier by some local help. After narrowly escaping capture from the US Marshalls that includes another run-in with Karen Sisco, he decides that it's time for a change of scenery and he and Buddy heads north. <br />By this time, it becomes obvious that there's some sort of weird fascination between Jack Foley and Karen Sisco taking place. They're somehow drawn to one another, even though they are on directly opposite sides of the law. <br />In Detroit, Foley and Buddy are out of their comfort zones. They don't know the city, they don't know the people and it's just started to snow. Theyhook up with a truly dangerous fellow ex-con named Maurice. He is their aforementioned local help, but they realise that the low-risk operation is shaping up as anything but. With nothing better on offer and against their better judgement, they go ahead with the plan but are extremely wary. <br />Meanwhile Karen Sisco has tracked Foley to Detroit after some very slick detective work, and after talking her way onto the Foley case. The inevitability of their meeting is obvious. What remains up in the air is what will happen after they meet and when it comes to plots created by Elmore Leonard, this means that the story could lead anywhere from here. <br />On the surface this is told in a light, breezy tone thanks mainly to the cool behaviour of Foley in times of crisis backed up by Buddy's comical acceptance of Foley's decisions, no matter how unusual they seemed. When the setting changed to the colder wintry city of Detroit, the tone darkened considerably to reflect the dangerous Maurice, with whom they have to deal. You get a definite sense that the significant scenes are going to take place in Detroit thanks to these strong mood changes. <br />Elmore Leonard mixes an easy conversational tone with tight, tough dialogue. He manages to give each of his characters their own distinctive voice thanks to his clever use of phraseology. Even though Foley and Buddy are ex-cons, in this book they can be considered the good guys and their language reflects this through a minimum of swearing and slang. In glaring comparison, we find that the Detroit &quot;bad guys&quot; such as Maurice, although also ex-cons, litter their dialogue with constant and extreme profanities. It's a simple but effective way to differentiate the difference between bad and downright evil. <br />Ultimately, OUT OF SIGHT is a love story. Sure it's an unusual love story in the extreme, but a love story just the same. With plenty of action taking place on the periphery of the Foley and Sisco mating dance, it's an absorbing book that provided me with an unexpected ending.	2004-05-25
659626:US	47964988	R44J30B4NA5W1	5552211634	249213514	Freaky Deaky	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Dash For Cash	If you're planning to extort money from a multi-millionaire by threatening to blow up his house (or else) you should probably make sure of at least 2 things. First, the man you're threatening should be smart enough to understand the threat. Second, your partner, who also happens to be the explosives expert, probably shouldn't be spending most of his spare time tripping on acid. Thus Elmore Leonard sets the scene for Freaky Deaky. It's his penchant for creating characters just a quarter-turn from normal that makes his stories a delight to read.<br />The story opens with a lunch-time meeting between Robin Abbott and Skip Gibbs, a couple of former student radicals from the 1960s and 70s. You get the impression pretty quickly that these two people are not exactly your salt of the earth types when they fondly remember their finest moment together as the time they bombed a government building. Robin smoothly leads the conversation around to how they were both captured for their roles in the bombing, the prison sentences they served and her thoughts as to who tipped the police off as to their identities and whereabouts. She's still not happy and is after revenge in the form of a restitution payout and she needs Skip's knowledge of explosives to execute her plan. <br />This introduces us to Woody and Ricks, as well as Woody's chauffeur, ex-Black Panther Donnell Lewis. Now, Woody is a multi-millionaire, having inherited his parent's fortune after his mother died. She didn't like Mark all that much and he only received a small endowment, much to his eternal frustration. Although Woody has all the money, he is also an alcoholic and his brain has deteriorated to the point where he is totally reliant on Mark and Donnell.<br />A man with a mind like Woody's coupled with his net worth sets him up as a major target for the less scrupulous people on earth and, wouldn't you know it, Mark and Donnell just happen to be those kinds of people. Their plotting and planning from within theRicks mansion combined with Robin and Skip's activities ensure that Woody is in for a bumpy ride. The question is, will he even notice?<br />But wait, I haven't even mentioned the story's protagonist. Chris Mankowski is a police detective who has just transferred from the bomb squad to the sex crimes unit. By just, I mean it's his first day, when he gets dragged into the picture when a woman walks in to report that she has been raped by Woody Ricks. The fact that a former bomb squad detective just happens to be thrust into the midst of an impending bombing may seem too coincidental to accept, but it is in keeping with Leonard's sense of irony.<br />Chris is by far the most complete character in the story. We learn a lot about his background, his bad luck with women, his wonderfully charming relationship with his father and his passion for his job. He is also a dangerously insightful detective who reasons problems out with startling speed, although that occasionally results in him getting himself into more trouble than he counts on. In short, he is an easy protagonist to like and I found myself quietly cheering for him.<br />So, from the set up, it sounds as though the story is just a simple grab for cash, doesn't it? Well, it's a grab for cash all right, but it's far from simple. You see, Robin and Skip's plan involves setting up bombs around the Ricks' mansion and then threatening to set them off unless they are paid. The problem with the plan lies in the fact that Skip is tripping on acid half the time and his attention to detail is not what it could be, with unexpected results.<br />Elmore Leonard sets up a hectic storyline, bordering on manic, with each attempt to carry out the extortion quickly following the last. The fact that the bad guys are a mixture of insanity and incompetence provides a strong feeling of uncertainty as to who or what is going to be blown up. There are too many humorous moments to call this a thriller, but there is also too much drug-taking and violence to describe it as a light-hearted caper. I think \\"black comedy\\" is the most fitting description for Freaky Deaky.	2004-05-21
671254:US	47964988	R359OACRE8XD7X	0060198303	120943125	The Burglar on the Prowl (Block, Lawrence)	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Bernie Steals The Show	It's strange to read books with criminals as the protagonists. In the real world you read about these guys in the paper or you come home to find yourself a victim of their handiwork and you rage \\"these people must be stopped\\". But put them in a fictional story and make them decent people apart from the burglary thing and you find yourself rooting for them, hoping they get away with it. This is my experience when reading the Burglar books, at least.<br />Lawrence Block is probably best known for his hardboiled Matt Scudder series, a P.I. series featuring the deeply troubled alcoholic as he fights his way through life. The Burglar series is a much lighter series and this book, THE BURGLAR ON THE PROWL is the 10th in the series. The series features Bernie Rhodenbarr, a bookstore owner who moonlights as a professional burglar.<br />Bernie is asked by a friend to burgle the home of a plastic surgeon as a favour for stealing his girlfriend. He's looking for a form of revenge and the fact that the surgeon has a safe filled with cash sweetens the deal. Springing from this plot come a rather unusual chain of events, murders, robberies and the like, that are unrelated at first glance but closer inspection reveals that the country of Latvia is making a disturbing number of appearances. It seems that no matter which way Bernie moves, he either meets someone from Latvia or Latvia is brought up in conversation. It really becomes a head scratcher that is as amusing as it is perplexing.<br />Although Bernie outlines the rules that a burglar must adhere to if he wants to stay out of trouble, but while waiting to pull off the plastic surgeon job he can't help but break one of those rules putting it down to restlessness. The rule he breaks states that a burglar must always prepare and study his target thoroughly - I think in burglar-ese it's known as \\"casing the joint\\". He defines his breaking of the rule as a need to go out on the prowl. When out on the prowl, he simply wanders the streets in search of a likely house or apartment to burgle without knowing whether anyone is inside, what security is in place or even if there's anything to steal.<br />Naturally, his little excursion results in the unexpected arrival home by the owner, but Bernie was quick enough to hide to avoid detection. But while he remains hidden, he overhears something taking place that is to later weigh very heavily on his conscience. (Of course, I'm not going to spoil it for you by telling you what it is!) Amazingly, this encounter which was completely random is tied in with the main plot - again using the increasingly astounding Latvian connection. Its place in the story is a very clever piece of plotting <br />The finale is presented in a rather Hercule Poirot-like manner, using the trick of gathering all the suspects and other sundry characters together in one big room and presenting the facts to everyone in the hopes that the guilty party will blink. Bernie takes the role of Poirot and ties the case together, a role that becomes particularly difficult when police are involved and much of the evidence he gathered was due to his breaking and entering abilities.<br />There are many amusing moments in the book, particularly when Bernie and his long-time friend Carolyn Kaiser get together. Carolyn is a lesbian and has trouble maintaining a relationship. Her latest solution is to take out a personal ad on the internet and their observations about the results are very funny. Similarly, Block has made it a habit in the series of poking fun at a few fellow authors, making up parody book titles and plotlines. In THE BURGLAR ON THE PROWL he does it again, this time taking aim at John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series with hilarious results.<br />You can tell that Block has delighted in throwing in coincidence upon coincidence, some of them absurdly unlikely. I think it works wonderfully well, adding quirky humour to the story that the quirk inside me appreciated. As with all of the burglar books, Block mixes the humour with more serious themes such as organised crime, murder and date rape. But the overriding tone is light and the mystery is clever and very well constructed.<br />Although this is the 10th book in the series, it's not really necessary to read the books in order and this one can be read as a stand-alone if you'd prefer not to go back and read the earlier books first. Certainly, I read the books out of order and didn't feel as though I missed any major character developments.<br />Another series that is a particular favourite of mine that also features a petty thief is Donald Westlake's John Dortmunder series. If you've tried those books and found that you enjoyed them, I think you will also enjoy THE BURGLAR ON THE PROWL.	2004-05-12

His books featuring John Dortmunder, a fatalistic thief, are hilarious capers making light of the world of criminals. The series that he writes under the pseudonym Richard Stark is probably a little less well known. This series features an anti-hero protagonist by the name of Parker and is very much in the hardboiled category and the world of criminals is portrayed as a dark, dangerous underground of professionals. THE SCORE is the 5th book in the Parker series, a series that is a little bit unusual in that it takes the role of the professional criminal and, to a certain extent, glamorises it.<br />As THE SCORE opens, Parker is in New York for a meeting to consider the prospects of an upcoming job. On the way to the meeting he notices he is being followed. The ruthless way in which he deals with his pursuer and then the way he is completely unaffected by the encounter is an early indication of the kind of cold-hearted guy he is.<br />A plot has been hatched to knock over an entire town and Parker is asked to run the show. The proposition appears ludicrous at first glance. The fact that the man presenting the plan is an amateur sets off all sorts of alarm bells in Parker's head. But the lucrative nature of the proposed heist lures Parker in to make a few adjustments to the plans before he agrees that the job can be done.<br />Parker decides that it will take 12 men to go into the North Dakota mining town of Copper Canyon, open the safes of the town's businesses including the mining company safe which will be holding that week's payroll. They will also be opening the vault of the town's only bank for good measure.<br />The one-night crime spree in the town of Copper Canyon takes place with the whole operation running like clockwork...almost. It wouldn't be much fun if Parker and his crew didn't encounter any problems and the way in which Parker handles these problems speaks volumes for the `ice in the blood' way he approaches ay crisis.<br />The Parker books all tend to follow the same general template of plan, prepare, execute and getaway. Add to that the required plan changes due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a gang member going postal for instance, and another Parker story is complete. The style of Richard Stark is abrupt, like Parker himself. If it doesn't pertain directly to the job at hand, it isn't mentioned in the book. This lack of detail holds true when talking about such things as the background of the characters, although they are each given a thumbnail sketch, but when it comes to the planning and actually carrying out of the robbery, the detail is incredibly complete.

That being said, you can't help but admire the professional way in which he goes about his business.<br />THE SCORE was first published in 1964 and so the technology used in the heist is dated and there is no way they would get away with it in this modern world.

Do you throw it in the bin or, after making a reasonable effort to find out who sent it and why, do you cash it and keep the money? Josh Redmont went with the second option and the cheques continued to arrive for seven years. <br />Since cashing that first cheque, Josh has finished university and found a job with an advertising agency. He is now married with a young son. He has also changed apartments a couple of time in those 7 years and the cheques kept arriving as regular as clockwork, finding him at his new address which was rather disturbing.<br />Then one day, while his wife and son are taking a short holiday without him, he is approached by a man who appears quite friendly right up until the moment he utters a phrase that almost stops his heart - &quot;you are now active&quot;. The man uttering these words is Mr Levrin. He's under the impression that Josh is a deep undercover mole who has been waiting these past 7 years to be called into action. It's a belief that Josh instinctively didn't dare contradict.<br />And so, Josh Redmont is thrust into the spy world, a most unwilling participant. He is joined by another accidental mole by the name of Mitchell Robbie. Together they figure out that they've been activated to participate in an assassination attempt and then they figure out just how expendable they will be when the job is over. Not a pleasant thought, but one which motivates them into action.<br />Donald Westlake is an author who is able to put an amusing spin on any subject he chooses. Whether it's the wry humour that you acknowledge with the twitching of the corner of the mouth or uncontrollable bursts of laughter that leave you red-faced while witting on the train (*sigh*), both moments are provided in MONEY FOR NOTHING. He slips the humour into this spy thriller / assassination conspiracy effortlessly and although it should feel out of place in the more dramatic scenes, it doesn't.<br />Weonly really ever find out the bare minimum about each character, just enough to keep the story unfolding. Although he's the protagonist, we don't really get to know Josh particularly well apart from the fact that he loves his family and that will motivate him to stay alive. The bad guys are nothing more than caricatures of all the menacing evil secret agents and their henchmen ever to grace a thriller story. Mitchell Robbie, however, turns out to be a goldmine of entertainment value and I felt he stole the show every time he came into the picture. He is a budding amateur actor who embraces his role of undercover mole as an opportunity to put his fledgling acting experience through its paces.  <br />It's strange, Josh, his wife and Mitchell Robbie are all in serious trouble, their lives are in danger and they suffer at the hands of their captors, yet thanks to Westlake's prose the story still felt light and amusing. Heck, it wasn't until people started getting shot that I realised that the situation was actually getting serious. It's not a complex plot in fact the premise is quite straightforward once the predicament is explained. What is complex though is working out how Josh was going to get himself and his family out of what looks to be a desperately dire situation.<br />By and large Donald Westlake stories are humorous affairs with the protagonist placed in the most difficult and sometimes ludicrous situations. The entertainment value lies in watching the imaginative ways in which these characters try to get out of those situations. In MONEY FOR NOTHING, Westlake has definitely stayed true to form, both creating an outlandish predicament for his protagonist and then injecting plenty of humorous moments as he engineers his way out of it.	2004-05-06
684000:US	47964988	R43WSPW9CMT58	0972441212	747585597	Sayonaraville (Jake Rossiter & Miss Jenkins Mystery)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Seriously Good	SAYONARAVILLE is the 2nd book in the Jake Rossiter and Miss Jenkins series following on from the tough hardboiled RAT CITY. Curt Colbert has created a private detective series that has the look and feel of a pulp detective novel written in the 1940s. Jake Rossiter is a hard-bitten, hard drinking private detective working in Seattle. The year is 1948, Rossiter has returned home from the war to find his town overrun by corruption and feels that it's his duty to see that the rats feeding off the honest joes get the punishment they deserve.<br />The story opens with the rather grisly discovery of the decapitated body of Henry Jamison by Miss Jenkins. Jamison is Rossiter's insurance agent and his office adjoins Jake's. Lying on the floor near the body is a samurai sword, obviously the murder weapon.<br />Miss Jenkins has progressed from secretary (girl Friday) to private detective and is about to take her first case. Coincidently (or perhaps not) her first client is a Japanese man named Harry Hashimoto. The fact that he is Japanese does not sit well with Rossiter at all. Remember, this is set in 1948 and Rossiter has just returned from the Pacific where he was fighting the Japanese. He insists that Miss Jenkins drop the case, which she refuses.<br />When an attempt is made on Miss Jenkins' life, putting her in hospital, Rossiter takes over the case for her. The case seems straightforward enough. Mr Hashimoto wants tot get his business back after it was burned down and the insurance company refused to pay the claim. Huh? Hang on! Insurance company, Japanese...wasn't there some sort of link mentioned earlier? Hmmm.... Would anyone care to guess who the insurance agent might have been? These were the kinds of questions that were going through my head while reading the book, so I thought, rather than accidentally include a spoiler or two, I'd simply pose them for you too.<br />There is a seemingly unrelated, but persistent subplot about the return to Seattle of Eddie Valhalla, a hit man who grew up in the same orphanage as Rossiter. Valhalla is Rossiter's sworn enemy nowadays and, upon hearing of his arrival in town, Rossiter sets out to settle a few old scores. The strange thing is, Rossiter seems to cross paths with Valhalla an unusually high number of times while working on the Hashimoto case. It becomes clear that somehow the presence of the hit man is going to have something to do with the case.<br />Finally throw into the picture the crooked police force led by Captain Harvey Blevens, a man who goes out of his way to make life difficult for Rossiter. Part of the protection racket being run by the local police force includes Hashimoto's old shop. When Rossiter asks the new owners a few questions, they call their police &quot;protectors&quot;. The fact that Blevens himself answered the call in double quick time tells Jake that he was onto something pretty big.<br />Although Jake takes the top billing, it's the increasingly surprising Miss Jenkins who steals the show, revealing an increasingly impressive array of talents. She began the series in RAT CITY as Rossiter's young, naïve and innocent secretary. When surprised or embarrassed she would utter a &quot;my goodness&quot; and then blush. She has since graduated to become a private detective in her own right, she carries a gun and has proven that her detecting abilities rivals Jake's. Clearly, Colbert has plans for her in future books.<br />The story is not what you would call a fast-paced thriller. Rather it is a methodical story where the clues are tracked down, the suspects are tailed and everything is pieced together as each new piece is discovered. All very neat and tidy. In between come some momentary bouts of violence mixed with humorous exchanges to keep things moving along. It's not breathless action but I found it enjoyable all the same.<br />Curt Colbert has written a strong sequel to RAT CITY providing an intriguing mystery. His ability to capture the period in whichit is written is unquestioned, with the dialogue and the plot giving the story the feel of an authentic 1940s detective novel. I said this when reviewing RAT CITY and it still applies for SAYONARAVILLE, people who love the hardboiled private detective stories written by authors such as Mickey Spillane will enjoy this book.	2004-05-02
686015:US	47964988	R1H1MMQNG4N5V9	0375727094	583511887	Hard Feelings: A Novel	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Builds In Intensity	HARD FEELINGS is the kind of story that benefits from a quiet, careful beginning, putting into stark contrast the nightmare place in which we end. Here is the story of a man whose life deteriorates and slowly crumbles around him one agonising, but inevitable, step at a time and is made all the more stunning by the fact that it is told from a first person perspective. <br />At the start of the story, Richard Segal is an average thirty-something DINK living in New York City. He appears to be a quiet guy trying to get ahead. And that's exactly what he is. He works as a computer network salesman in a new job and is having a few small problems making his first sale for the company - but nothing major. He gets along okay with his wife although they admittedly have their small fights now and again - but nothing major. He's also not particularly overjoyed by his wife's promotion, but that's just a small insecurity problem.<br />So what could possibly send Richard's life on a crazy downward spiral? As with many cases where disaster takes over, the trigger seems inconsequential at first but slowly builds until his life is running hopelessly out of control.<br />The trigger in this case was a chance encounter with Michael Rudnick while walking down the street one day. Rudnick was a boy who was 5 years older than Richard and he grew up in his neighbourhood 22 years ago. His appearance prompts the beginning of a series of memories that Richard had kept repressed for all of those years.<br />The memories are a series of sexual abuses that Rudnick had performed on Richard. Suddenly, Richard becomes distracted and paranoid affecting both his job and his marriage. All he can think about is what happened at the hands of Rudnick and begins to plan his revenge. <br />While Richard is enduring the torturous nightmare of these returned memories, his life continues to be burdened by worsening personal problems. He's a recovering alcoholic and he feels the strong lure of the bottle as a way to calm himself. His job situation is becoming more tenuous as he simply cannot make a sale. Finally, his marriage is deteriorating daily.<br />Quite simply, something has to give, a decision has to be made and the decision he goes for is to seek revenge against Michael Rudnick. The revenge he chooses has much more widespread consequences than anyone could imagine, not surprisingly seeing as the decision was made after the immense pressure Richard put himself under.<br />Jason Starr has managed to turn a comfortably happy man into a paranoid wreck in such a way that it's a little scary in how realistically the change was brought about. Small pieces of Richard's life, problems that by themselves could have been comfortably dealt with, were drawn together and stacked on top of each other to bury poor Richard Segal.<br />The tone of the novel quickly grows frantic and desperate as Richard can see his life, everything he had worked for and hoped for was spinning away from him. He would work as hard as he could to repair the mistakes he makes, but in the end all he is left with is a feeling of utter dispair. <br />While it was fascinating to get inside the mind of this man who was being consumed by his paranoia and rage, fighting self-doubt while battling the constant lure of alcoholism, by the end of the story I was exhausted after feeling as though I helped to bear his burden.	2004-04-30

Whether the scandals have involved drug-abuse, sexual offences, violence, right up to murder charges, I always get the impression that these sports stars all think they are above the law thanks to the hero worship of which they are the object. A good proportion of these real life stars are rolled into the character of Zelmont Raines in THE JOOK.<br />THE JOOK is a modern hardboiled novel that contains a healthy (or should that be unhealthy) dose of violence, drug-taking, swearing and sex scenes. It's a tremendously fast-paced story set in Los Angeles amongst the seedier members of the cities rich and famous. As mentioned earlier, the story is told from the perspective of Zelmont Raines, an ex-NFL wide receiver used to living the kind of life a multi-million dollar salary could provide. But those high earning days are over. He has found himself short of money and decides that a return to football would provide him with the cash injection he needs.<br />The problems standing in the way of Zee and a return to the NFL are many and significant. The first is his chronic hip injury that forced him home after an attempt on the European NFL. The next is his womanising that has landed him with an unwanted paternity suit and an even less desirable statutory rape suit hanging over him. The last and definitely not the least problem is his use of drugs, the original cause of his retirement from the NFL.<br />Thanks to his appalling past record of behaviour and the wish of Julian Weems, the NFL commissioner who is trying to clean up the game's image, Zee is cut from the team he is trialing with and expelled from the NFL altogether.<br />Predictably, Zee is a seething mass of hatred, ready to lash out any way possible at his tormentors, namely Julian Weems and the owner of the new NFL franchise team the LA Barons, Ellison Standanko. As it happens, Zee's best friend Napoleon Graham is planning to rob Standanko of around 6 - 7 million dollars. Not only is Standanko the owner of the LA Barons but he is also a big time crook and Napoleon has information about how and when he moves his ill-gotten gains. This information comes courtesy of Wilma Wells, the lawyer for the new team and the love interest for Zee.<br />Zee, Nap and Wilma then set about putting their bold plan into action, but of course, nothing in the life of Zelmont Raines seems to run smoothly and with every win in the operation comes a loss. Without giving away any of the ending, it's one heck of a wild ride for all involved.<br />So, while in essence this is a hardboiled crime story featuring a robbery, it's also a detailed look at the hard living done by a high profile sportsman. It's a tremendously fast-paced book. Raines lives the life of a celebrity sports star and so always has a party to go to or a girl to meet. But he also dabbles in shady street deals and brawls in pool joints, not to mention his role in the main game - the robbery. Keeping up with Raines may leave you a little breathless by the end of the book.<br />Gary Phillips uses language to great effect in helping to describe the type of person Zelmont Raines is. He has obviously risen from a life in the poorer parts of town, a fact that is confirmed when he muses about how his life may have turned out if he hadn't become a pro ball player. The tone created by this constant use of slang is one of barely contained violence. It seems that at any point in the story, all hell is about to break loose. Because the one big problem with Raines is that, although he acknowledges all of his problems - drugs, alcohol, womaniser etc, he appears totally powerless to overcome them.<br />It was funny how my feelings changed for Zelmont as the story progressed. At the start I felt as though he was the misunderstood hero of the story who was smart enough to get his act together and had some sort of control over his life. Then gradually, it slowly dawned on me that he wasn't the great thinker that I first assumed he was. By the end it became obvious that he was simply grabbing at any life saver that was tossed to him in a bid to prolong the good life that he had grown used to. Rather than rooting for him to win, I just felt sorry for him.<br />It's rough and it's violent and it's definitely hardboiled. For those who don't mind getting down and dirty amongst some of the more depraved sides of life, then this will be a very enjoyable read.	2004-04-29

Starting off in present-day London we meet Bettina Whitelaw, a successful 80-year-old author who is beginning to write her memoirs or, as she prefers to think of them, her memories. Through her writings the narrative alternates between the present and 1938 and the small town of Bundaroo in outback Australia where Bettina grew up. <br />Bettina's life in Bundaroo is marked by a significant incident, something that is only hinted at early on in the story, but which is revisited each time she adds to her memoirs. It's that incident that remains the focus each time the story returns to 1938. More and more is hinted at, teasing us with what might have happened before it finally gets revealed and talked about openly. (I apologise for being coy, hiding behind the word 'incident', but it would be remiss of me to reveal what it is here).<br />This particular incident is the first of two mysteries to be dealt with in the book. The second occurs in the present-day London part of the story when Bettina realises that someone has been in her house and has been searching through her desk. She asks a friend to house sit for her while she takes a short holiday in Edinburgh and is devastated to hear that her house does get broken into and the friend is severely beaten. The question in this case for Bettina is, was her friend's bashing a case of mistaken identity? Is her safety now in danger?<br />The story's mysteries really become of secondary importance, however. In both the 1938 storyline and the present day one, two unusual relationships take place. In Bundaroo, Bettina befriends a newcomer to town. Eugene &quot;Hughie&quot; Naismyth has just arrived from England and is like a fish out of water, unable to fit in with the locals. Also, his love of classical music and art consign him to a fate of being outcast from his schoolmates. The only person in school he can count onis Bettina who thumbs her nose at Hughie's tormentors and stands by him. The friendship between Bettina and Hughie endures right through to the present day and becomes one of the pivotal relationships in the book.<br />The second relationship starts off as a very stilted reunion between mother and daughter when Bettina meets Sylvia for the first time since she gave her up for adoption soon after she was born. Although both women begin determined to keep a formal distance between each other, they soon grow to enjoy each other's company and start to depend on each other. Through meeting and getting to know Sylvia we get to learn a lot more about Bettina and her life after Bundaroo. As their friendship grows, so does our knowledge of the two women, revealing their pasts to each other.<br />I enjoyed the way Bettina's life was filled in throughout the book. Although she was writing her memoirs, there were gaps in her knowledge of some very important events. These gaps were filled in through the course of seemingly unrelated events in the present day part of the story. Some people don't like stories that jump from one time period to the other finding that doing so can get confusing. In this case Barnard deals with the flashbacks to 1938 very nicely, smoothly switching timeframes and the way they were linked together made a very effective method of revealing her life to us.<br />I would call the pace of the novel measured rather than slow. Robert Barnard carefully constructs his story, adding one little clue on to another until the answer to the puzzle slowly dawned on me rather than being revealed in an earth shattering declaration.<br />Although I usually prefer fast-paced action thrillers or hardboiled private detective stories, this more sedate story kept me fully engrossed from the first page to the last. If you appreciate a plot that is filled with details, particularly where human emotions are concerned, then this book will appeal to you. The fact that there is a surprising twist or two near the end of the story is a bonus as far as I'm concerned.	2004-04-21
697363:US	47964988	R20WEAB95BJDCK	0099446839	773970697	Outside the White Lines	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Just Don't Break Down	Chris Simms has ensured that breaking down on the highway at night will never be the same again with this chilling story of a man who deals with road rage in a terrifying and deadly way. <br />This darkly frightening serial-killer story is starkly different to every other serial-killer thriller I have ever read. Whereas most stories of the genre focus on the investigation into the killer and the frustration shown by the police or FBI as they struggle to gather evidence that may eventually lead them to the killer, this book simply focuses on its 3 principle characters and lets their actions lead us to the shocking conclusion. It's obvious that these 3 people are going to be linked together somehow (otherwise, why focus so carefully on them) but just how they come to affect the others' lives provides the surprise at the end.<br />The book is broken into chapters titled for each of the characters. The chapter titles are: The Hunter, The Killer, and The Searcher. <br />THE HUNTER<br />Andy is a rookie cop, a young man who has only ever dreamt of being a road traffic cop, nothing more or less. He loves driving cars and it's his goal to get behind the wheel of his police car but at the moment has to be content with riding shotgun for his senior (but much less motivated) partner. He is also a young man of high morals and is outraged when his partner drags him into a lie to their superior officer about their whereabouts while a murder was taking place on their patch. This murder was one of a series of brutal bashing murders taking place on motorists who had broken down at night. <br />Andy becomes obsessed with the case but runs into problems within the force when he speaks out against his unmotivated partner. He winds up getting suspended from the police, a devastating outcome for so dedicated an officer, but it also allows him to spend more time on the highway killings. He's probably the closest the story comes to being a protagonist and certainly the most likable character.<br />THE KILLER<br />Dave is the highway murderer. His road rage knows no bounds. Whether he's a driver or a pedestrian he is aggressive and intimidatory - and this is his public persona. It doesn't matter that his wife and baby daughter may be in the car with him, he is prepared to abuse and yell at other drivers. Heavy traffic has him fuming by the end of even the shortest trips. But what really ticks him off, what really boils his blood, is motorists who know so little about caring for their cars that they break down on motorways. He sees these people as the main cause for the constant heavy traffic that dares to block the roads he drives on.<br />His answer is to cruise the motorways late at night acting as a road recovery worker, stopping to assist the broken down motorist (he only preys on men who are driving alone) and then bashing their heads in with a monkey wrench. He's a brutal man with a failing grip on sanity thanks to an incident that takes place early in the book. <br />Dave was brilliantly described by the author, evoking all sorts of feelings of outrage and frustration from me. The more I learnt about him, the less I found to like about him.<br />THE SEARCHER<br />The Searcher is the strangest character of the trio. It is also the most difficult to work out how he will fit into the story. What he does have in common with the others is his presence around motorways at nighttime. What he does is, he dresses up in camouflage gear, complete with face paint and then crawls through the grass and bushes along the side of the road. This behaviour is unusual enough. But then we find out what he is searching for and what he does with what he finds when he gets back to his home and discover that this is one truly bizarre character. Strangely enough, we find out most about The Searcher's past, what has driven him to this behaviour, but we never find out his name.<br />Chris Simms has written a powerful thriller that I've found unique in its presentation, particularly in the spotlight focus of the central characters. A great guide as to the effectiveness of his writing style was the strong emotions I felt while reading it. It's not often I get drawn into a book so deeply that I virtually forget that I'm reading about fictional characters, but that's what happened to me while reading this book.<br />The story progresses at a steady pace, rather than as a helter-skelter romp of mayhem. It's the kind of story that builds in intensity, magnifying the importance of the actions of the 3 main characters. This results in an exquisite tension building and had me wondering just how the climax to the story would be reached. I must say it was in a most unexpected, but wholly satisfying way.<br />I should also add a warning, although it may already be obvious, that this book contains graphic descriptions of violence. I would advise readers who are distressed by these kinds of scenes to give this book a miss.	2004-04-21

As a fan of all of these types of books, I was extremely pleased to have stumbled upon this book, which looks to be the first of a series.<br />RAT CITY is a very fast-moving detective story that could very well have been written 40 years ago, except for one important factor. Colbert chose to modernise the dialogue a little by not holding back on the use of profanity. In all other respects, the vernacular matches the time in which it is set. I didn't have a problem with the profanity and can understand that Colbert is writing for a more modern audience, but it could turn people who don't care for extreme language off the book, because it is used quite regularly.<br />The story starts as any self-respecting PI story worth its salt should, in Jake Rossiter's office. The big difference with this start though is that instead of a gorgeous dame walking into his life, Rossiter is faced with an angry bookie named Big Ed. Not only that, Big Ed introduces himself by firing two shots at Jake, fortunately missing (lucky really, otherwise it would have been an extremely short book). Pure instinct, plus the fact that he was admiring his brand new gun at the time, leads Rossiter to shoot Big Ed in the chest, killing him. Before he dies he manages to utter the name &quot;Gloria&quot;.<br />It's 1947, America is recovering from the ravages of war and Jake Rossiter is a war veteran now working in Seattle, Washington. He has discovered that the country is filled with an extra injection of corruption since the war ended and Seattle is so steeped in it that his pet name for it is Rat City.<br />His near miss at the start of the story prompts him into an investigation into finding out why someone he had never met before would try to shoot him. It's not long before another man has a crack at killing him and once again, lives long enough before uttering the name &quot;Gloria&quot; with his dying breath. This really grabs his attention because by this stage he has already met Gloria and she didn't appear to be all that keen to do him in.<br />He soon finds out that Gloria is the least of his problems. In his attempt to find out why he's being targeted Rossiter not only runs up against known gangsters and thugs, he also comes up against a corrupt police force intent on framing him for whatever crime they possibly can. Not surprisingly, as he digs deeper into the case it begins to reveal a dark and widespread cover up involving all sorts of powerful people, not the least are members of that same police force.<br />So Rossiter works the case for free, but because his life depends on it, he puts every resource he has at his disposal into it. As it turns out, this includes the very faithful, very prim and proper secretary (perhaps a little too often referred to as &quot;his girl Friday&quot;) Miss Jenkins. The relationship between Rossiter and Miss Jenkins is delightful with the rough edges of Jake being complemented beautifully by Miss Jenkins' quiet gentleness.<br />There are two main problems with the story, as far as I am concerned. The first is the aforementioned use of profanity. I thought the dialogue would have rung much more truly if Colbert had have stuck with the more traditional - yet admittedly more moderate - swearwords. Again, I will stress that I have absolutely no problem with strong language, but it detracted from the authenticity of the timeframe in which it was set.<br />The second problem I had was an idea that Rossiter used to draw out a man who was tailing him. He constructed a sign that he affixed to the back of his car with the intention of enraging his pursuer into some sort of rash action. The sign was unrealistically long and crude and just came across as a very sloppy plot device. I felt it weakened Rossiter as a character to have come up with such a harebrained idea and also weakened the story itself because so much hinged on this subplot.<br />Notwithstanding the grumpy gripes above, I really enjoyed RAT CITY. It's fast-paced and violent, both with gunplay and face-to-face confrontations. The style is reminiscent enough of the widely popular private detective stories of old to appeal to fans of the hardboiled genre of yesteryear.<br />Jake Rossiter is a likable protagonist with a healthy hatred of corruption coupled with a strong sense of loyalty and compassion for his clients and friends. That's not to say he doesn't mind the more than occasional snort from the bottle, remember, this is traditional hardboiled fare after all.<br />Fans of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer books or even Dashiell Hammett's Continental Op should rejoice, there is a new author in town producing detective stories in the style that we love. With twists and turns accompanied by an unceasing supply of violent action, Curt Colbert's debut novel RAT CITY is just good old-fashioned hardboiled fun.	2004-04-19
716193:US	47964988	R29LJRMUX6PL44	0743250346	773909635	The Frumious Bandersnatch (Mcbain, ed)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Another Outstanding Police Procedural	Tara Valparaiso is about to make it big as a pop diva, at least, that's what Barney Loomis, head of Bison Records hopes. He's hosting the launch of her new CD titled Bandersnatch and the hard sell is being made to attending media and important guests. <br />Partway through the performance of the song that should launch Tara to super-stardom, the party is rudely interrupted by a couple of masked men carrying guns. They boldly stride in and kidnap the budding songstress from under the noses of over 100 onlookers. <br />The part of the river that the kidnapping took place happens to fall under the jurisdiction of the 87th Precinct and the detective who happens to catch the call is Steve Carella. Long time readers of this series would probably agree that Carella is the best and brightest of the 87th Precinct detectives, certainly he's the central character in most of the books and he takes the lead again here. <br />The case is only in the 87th Precinct's hands for a short time before the FBI become involved and takes over. Carella however is enlisted to help on the task force at the request of Barney Loomis. As can be imagined neither the FBI nor Carella are thrilled at the prospect of working together and it isn't terribly long before Carella walks out on the team turning the investigation into a head to head race between the FBI and the 87th Precinct to catch the kidnappers and find the girl. <br />It's only when Carella leaves the FBI task force and begins investigating using the tried and true methods that have made the series so popular and long-lived, that the pace picks up. That's not to say the first half of the book was terribly slow, but it does seem to spend a good deal of time in setting up the adversarial atmosphere between the kidnappers and the law enforcement agencies. <br />One tiny annoyance was the portrayal of the FBI in this book. Painting FBI agents as egotistical fools has been done many times before, particularly when the police are the heroes,and so it happens again in this case. While I thought that this was a rather clichéd scenario which led to an obvious outcome, McBain has overcome it somewhat by giving the book a rather shocking ending by throwing in a touch of the unexpected. <BR> <br />There is a curious side story involving a semi-regular character named Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Weeks, a police detective who works at the 88th Precinct. Ollie is in the early stages of a new romance with a uniformed officer and the story constantly flashes to the progress of their various dates. I kept expecting Ollie's story to somehow be linked to the case but it never happened. It appears that the Ollie Weeks story was just meant to simmer and may perhaps be continued in a later book. This is just pure speculation on my part, though. <br />There were also signs that Ed McBain was poking a bit of fun at his series, particularly when it comes to the agelessness of his characters. In one scene, Cotton Hawes was entering a building and noticed some elderly people drinking cups of coffee and wondered what it must be like to grow older, to reach your fifties or sixties. Given that the series is bearing down on its 50th year and Cotton Hawes has barely aged a year in all that time, it's no wonder he's starting to grow curious about the elderly. Meanwhile, the detectives now have the benefit of the latest technology such as mobile phones and the Internet to assist them. It's a fascinating paradox of time and technological advancement clashing with the timelessness of the characters. And I'm sure Ed McBain is having a chuckle in this book.<br />For fans of the 87th Precinct series and also for newcomers, I recommend THE FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH as a terrific example of a police procedural, written by the master of the sub-genre.	2004-04-07
720326:US	47964988	R1B3536AP8JEO0	0966347374	3919133	The Perpetrators	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fast, furious and very violent	THE PERPETRATORS is a full-on thrill ride of violence from Tijuana, Mexico to Sacramento, California following the escapades of Lina Guzman, a drug cartel queen and Marley, her bodyguard who is given the title throughout the book as her expeditor.<br />The story starts in a hotel room in Tijuana with Marley in a life or death struggle with a knife-wielding attacker, whom Lina calmly dispatches, shooting the attacker with a silenced pistol. Already by this stage (and I'm talking 1 page, if that) the dialogue is dominated with pure gangster slang taken from the classic hardboiled novels from the 1930s and 40s. One full-on action scene, dominated by all sorts of violence and profanities and you just know it's not going to let up.<br />As Marley and Lina leave Tijuana on their way towards Sacramento we find out that she's a South American drug queen who is off to make a deal with a crooked politician that should see her distribution channels open up and he's her hired bodyguard. Trying to stop her is the man named Samson Twelvetrees who seems to have an endless supply of assassins and weapons at his disposal and so determined is he to stop Lina from making her meeting, he is prepared to throw everything at her.<br />The wild ride is punctuated with hair-raising car chases, motel room ambushes, helicopter dodgems and any number of shoot-outs. Bad guys are cut down with monotonous regularity and the good guys escape by the skinniest skin of their teeth. As you can probably tell, the story is blindingly spare in its narrative, short on intricate plot detail and characterisation and long on outlandish situations involving heavy artillery.<br />Be prepared for incredibly unrealistic dialogue full of every bad gangsta cliché ever uttered. I don't think there was a bad guy dispatched without receiving some sort of verbal send-off by Marley. (Thank goodness he never quite stooped to \\"Hasta la vista, baby\\" but I'm sure it must have crossed his mind once or twice).<br />Interspersed throughout the entire book are rough illustrations helping to add to the rough and ready style of the book. The illustrations depict either a map of the scene of the latest skirmish somewhere along the southern California landscape or a scene that takes place there, such as a car screeching to a halt (complete with the word \\"screech\\"). While not exactly adding any value to the story, the roughness of the illustrations suggest they were done in a hurry almost as if the illustrator was attempting to keep up with the extreme pace of the story.<br />Now, you can be forgiven for assuming that I didn't enjoy this book, but you'd be dead wrong. As a fan of the old detective classics made famous by Dashiell Hammett, Ross MacDonald, Mickey Spillane and the like, I loved every minute of it. Of course, I treated it as a homage to those classics and the hardboiled genre in general. Just how much of a homage to hardboiled was it? Well, when Marley used a false identity, two of his choices were as Mr Stark and Mr Pelecanos, coincidence or a tip of the hat?<br />It's graphically violent, perhaps even cartoonish, full of foul language with the occasional crude sex scene thrown in for good measure. But it is also a fast and furious ride that is guaranteed to entertain as long as you are a fan of the old pulp-fiction style crime story.	2004-04-04
723290:US	47964988	RBJ7AA0B8S15Q	0312304250	544902283	Vertical Coffin: A Shane Scully Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Strong Partnership	This is the 4th book in the Shane Scully series, a series that, I think, is getting stronger with each new book, particularly when it comes to the development of Scully, both as a policeman and as a family man. The preceding Shane Scully books are THE TIN COLLECTORS, THE VIKING FUNERAL and HOLLYWOOD TOUGH.<br />The story opens with all-out action when Vincent Smiley, a cop-hater, decides to wreak his vengeance on the various law enforcement agencies by shooting a sheriff's deputy who tried to serve him with a warrant. The agency actually responsible for the origin of the warrant was the ATF. What the ATF failed to warn the sheriff's department about was that Smiley was suspected of hoarding a huge stockpile of weapons and explosives in his house.<br />Sheriff's deputies, tactical response teams and the ATF descend on Smiley's house where he is firing indiscriminately from every window, daring the police to attack him. They finally do attack with the result seeing the house with Smiley inside, burning to the ground.<br />In the aftermath of the incident blame is passed between the elite forces of the sheriff's department and the ATF over the handling of the incident with neither group convinced that the other is telling the truth as to their knowledge about how dangerous Smiley was. What follows would be the police force's worst nightmare when the bad feeling between the two agencies escalates to the brink of outright war when first, a member of the ATF's SRT (Situation Response Team) is shot by a sniper then a member of the sheriff's department's SEB (Special Enforcement Bureau) is shot and killed in exactly the same way.<br />Shane Scully, as a homicide detective with the LAPD and consequently independent of the two agencies involved, is asked to investigate the original shooting and subsequent fire. The fact is that he is asked to investigate by his boss, who also happens to be his wife, Alexa because she can trust him over all other detectives to get the job done.<br />Of course, how can he refuse, but what he is not prepared for is the assignation of a partner from the sheriff's department, an IAD officer no less, named Jo Brickhouse. This partnership quickly becomes the classic hate-hate relationship that is to gradually thaw out to respect, admiration and trust. Although it's been done many times before, I thought it was a particularly strong part of the book and helps define Scully both as a police officer and as a family man.<br />The pressure that Scully comes under in this case is like no other he has experienced before. Firstly, Alexa continually questions his investigation techniques and second guesses him because results don't come quickly enough for her. Secondly, Brickhouse refuses to concede anything to him, particularly not that he might be carrying out a thorough investigation. All of this added pressure creates an atmosphere of desperation that had me hoping just a little harder than usual that Scully would make the right decisions. (Silly me).<br />I must admit, I saw where this story was going from pretty early on and so, by the time Scully had uncovered the clues and made the earth-shattering revelation, my reaction was merely one of satisfaction that my own sleuthing was vindicated. However, I will pardon Scully for not getting there as quickly as I did, considering the personal pressure he was working under at the time. <br />This is a highly charged thriller combining an interesting mystery to be solved with strong character interactions. It takes the usual antagonisms between different law enforcement agencies to a new level, turning heroes into villains, at times unjustly. The resolution of Scully's case provides a strong finale followed by a bittersweet ending suggesting the series won't end here.	2004-04-01

This is a series that concentrates quite heavily on the characters in the story and their development throughout the series as well as providing well-plotted mysteries. With VERTICAL BURN, Emerson has gone for a more action-oriented story, relying on his intimate knowledge of the fire brigade and fire fighting to enthuse his audience. To a large extent it works, the adrenaline charged brushes with death while combating a fire provide the story's high points, no questions asked.<br />The story's protagonist is John Finney, a fireman of considerable experience with the Seattle Fire Department. The book gets off to a furious start when Finney's company is called out to a fire and when they arrive they are faced with a large building full of smoke with the possibility of victims trapped inside and no backup because all other crews are busy, called out to various alarms, both real and false. During their search of the building, Finney and his partner become trapped by a collapsed wall with the final result seeing Finney barely escape with his life, but his partner dying in the fire.<br />The fallout from this tragedy is substantial for Finney both emotionally and physically. Apart from losing his partner and mentor, he suffers some pretty serious burns from the fire, but worse, he knows that in the eyes of his fellow firemen he is to blame for his partner's death. Due to memory loss thanks to the smoke inhalation he suffered, he can't be sure himself whether or not he was to blame.<br />A second fire results in a similar outcome to the first. This time Finney is certain that facts are being fabricated by the fire investigators that make Finney look, at best incompetent and at worst, criminally negligent. It gets to the point where it looks very likely he is going to be accused of arson. It suddenly dawns on him that there is a serious conspiracy taking place from within the department.What also becomes very obvious is that he is being set up as the fall guy for this conspiracy and the frame is working disturbingly well.<br />Left with very few allies in the department, he feels his only course of action is to start his own investigation. He aims to get to the bottom of why these fires had been set and how he might be able to convince the department chiefs of his innocence. It's this investigation that the storyline hinges with the action sequences merely a background setting.<br />The story climaxes with a massive high-rise building fire that requires Finney to act as the hero in a bid to rescue over 200 people who are trapped. Although far-fetched in many aspects, not the least of which is how he came to be at the fire in the first place, these are scenes of pure entertainment as feats of super-human strength and astounding ingenuity take over.<br />I enjoyed the breathless action sequences that came about each time a fire was fought. The fear and confusion felt during a fire was described by Emerson in such a way that it was obvious that he had experienced these feelings first hand. These sequences were strong and compelling. <br />The focus is so much on the action sequences and the intricate details of fire fighting that the characterisation and the interaction between characters suffers somewhat. I felt the dialog didn't ring true and the reasons that prompted the conspiracy were so incredibly weak as to be non-existent. It was the conspiracy that really drove the whole storyline and when that disappeared, the whole story lost it's credibility in my mind.<br />I also had a real problem with the inconsistent reactions of Finney. He swung from submissive yes-man to a take-charge action hero within a page time and again and this not only became confusing, I also found it incredibly frustrating, particularly whenever he was faced with some pretty hefty and occasionally outlandish accusations and decided to say or do nothing about them.<br />Forall out action with raging infernos as the focus, this is quite a thrilling book and certainly achieves that purpose. However, I thought it was hampered by the lack of believable storyline that is needed to give the book its substance.	2004-03-29
735376:US	47964988	R1T272PLWDH42M	1932009027	161324410	Karmesin: The World's Greatest Criminal--Or Most Outrageous Liar	Books	5	19	19	N	N	A Genius At Work	Gerald Kersh was a prolific author during the 1930s through until the 1960s, particularly when it came to short stories. Like so many authors of his era, he produced an enormous number of short stories that were published in newspapers and magazines of the day and then later picked up by pulp magazines such as Black Mask, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Argosy.<br />One publisher is now performing the wonderful task of gathering together many authors' short stories and compiling books containing a single author's works. That publisher is Crippen and Landru. Although Kersh's Karmesin stories have been reprinted individually over the years in various publications, they have never been put together in the one book...until now.<br />As all of the Crippen and Landru books do, Karmesin begins with a very informative introduction providing tremendous insight into the author. An explanation is given into how the stories came about including anecdotes from Kersh himself, as well as the real life person upon whom Karmesin is based. I found the introduction in this book to be a wonderful lead in to the stories themselves, and then found myself referring back to it as I finished each story.<br />The book contains 17 short stories and they range in length from 5 to 13 pages; just ideal to finish a single story if you have 10 minutes to spare or for settling in and reading the lot in one sitting.<br />Each story unfolds in much the same way. They open with Karmesin admonishing Kersh (who acts as Karmesin's disbelieving audience) for doubting his stories. At the same time he scoffs at the crimes that are committed nowadays, claiming that not only could he pull off a better burglary, blackmail or robbery but that he already has. He then proceeds to tell a tale of fantastic achievement that is hugely entertaining and brilliant in its simplicity and success. For, as Karmesin keeps reminding Kersh, he is a genius and a master-criminal.<br />The contradiction to Karmesin, and the reason for the title to the book, is that, while he claims to be the most successful criminal the world has ever seen, and while he claims to have easily pulled off crimes that have netted him hundreds of thousands of dollars, pounds and francs, he invariably finishes his story by cadging a cigarette or the money for a cup of tea off Kersh. As he explains when questioned as to where the money went, he can't remember every penny he ever spent.<br />Karmesin is a curmudgeonly old cuss, but an entertaining character who I would best describe as a lovable old rogue. Many of his stories rely on perfect timing and as he explains in The Conscience of Karmesin: &quot;mediocrity chooses an hour where genius picks its instant!&quot; No story is too tall to be passed off as an exploit. And how tall are the tales that he tells? Among the 17 stories, he uses a ghost named Henry as an accomplice (twice) and in another describes how he stole the crown jewels. Of course, not all of the stories are this fantastic, but in each Karmesin highlights the brilliance of his plan and the success in which he carried it out.<br />At the end of the book, a Karmesin bibliography is included detailing where and when each of the stories was published. To finish the book off, a reading list that details Kersh's novels and a couple websites containing more information about the author are added.	2004-03-23

He remains the king of the caper and THE SCARED STIFF confirms his position.<br />Now don't let the name Judson Jack Carmichael on the cover fool you because Westlake is also the king of the pseudonym. But the style is unmistakable and is as entertaining as ever.<br />Barry and Lola Lee lived their whole married lives one step ahead of the bill collectors, but now their financial shortfalls are threatening to overtake them. In desperation Barry tries to cash in their life insurance policy only to find out that it wasn't that kind of a policy, the only access to any money was if one of them died - double if they died in an accident.<br />So a master plan is hatched - Barry has to die.<br />The most important aspect of the scam is the fact that Lola comes from the South American country of Guerrera. The documentation that accounts for death in this country may be obtained a little easier than it might in the US, so they decide that this is where the accident should take place.<br />And so they go to Guerrera where, with the help of Lola's enormously extensive family, they set about arranging the scam. Not only do they have to arrange Barry's death to look like an accident, they have to organise a body to take his place, a new identity for him and they have to make it all convincing enough for the police and insurance investigators to accept.<br />Everything goes according to plan. It looks like they have pulled off the perfect fake death and now all Lola has to do is pick up the insurance check. But as readers of Westlake books would already know, it's at the moment when absolutely nothing can go wrong that everything falls apart.<br />Barry finds himself lying low in a country whose language he doesn't speak. He is forced to assume identity after identity, making up a series of cover stories as his cover is blown by a string of unlucky, and unlikely, events. Each new cover story becomes just a little more implausible and his grip on anonymity a little more tenuous.<br />The pace of the story is frenetic thanks to the farcical nature of the scam and the \\"anything that can go wrong will go wrong\\" aspect. The plot continually changes thanks to Barry's need to escape detection and his ability to devise new plans and disguises.<br />This is vintage farce from Donald Westlake. It's fast and it's fun and at times is very clever, particularly in the details of the caper. Of course, it comes complete with some very unlikely coincidences, running into the last person you would want to meet and so forth, but this just adds to the fun. Read this for it's amusement value and ride the caper with Barry.	2004-03-19

Before heading between the pages of this series it would really be a good idea to work out how susceptible to depression you are. If you prefer happy, light-hearted mysteries then believe me, this book will not be for you.<br />EYE OF THE CRICKET is an example of southern noir or, to be more precise, it's New Orleans noir told from the first person perspective. Lew Griffin is a black man who teaches French and English literature in between occasional flurries as the author of several novels. He is also known to be quite adept at finding missing persons and so he moonlights as a sort of private detective. He is a man who seems to care a great deal for others, to the point where he has difficulty saying no to people's requests, often to his own detriment.<br />It is in his capacity as a teacher that he is approached to act as a private detective by a student who had heard of his ability at finding people and asks Griffin to try to find his half-brother. Griffin immediately agrees to help, no questions asked, a typical response.<br />What is revealed is that Griffin himself has a son that is missing and the tragic irony is, although he is able to find other people's missing loved ones, he can't seem to find his own son, not even a clue of where he might be.<br />That is, until a vagrant is brought into a hospital emergency room and the only item in his possession that might identify who he is, is a copy of one of Griffin's books - a book he had inscribed for his son. Suddenly he feels he might have the clue that he needs to continue his search.<br />Although the storyline seems straightforward enough, it is littered with flashbacks, dreams and memories, all of which managed to keep throwing me completely off balance. It was not always clear which parts were actually happening and which parts were just memories. Often times they interrupted the flow so badly I had forgotten what the original storyline was about. <br />As it turns out, the actual detective work done by Griffin is inconsequential and is given only minor importance as the focus is more squarely placed on Griffin and the question of how he would survive his demons. The missing persons case serves to remind him directly of his own missing son, a fact that he dwells on constantly. Combined with this is the beginning of a new relationship with a wonderful and understanding woman. But this prompts endless memories of LaVerne, his dead wife. Dreams, memories and reality become intertwined as Griffin fights thoughts of his own failings, the results of which form the body of his (Griffin's) latest novel.<br />Towards the end of the book, Griffin allows himself to sink to incredible depths in his quest to find his son. His willingness to do this typifies the man who, for all his dark thoughts and introspection, is a deeply caring person. There are some points where some truly moving moments can be found. But it is also at this stage that the maximum attention must be paid as Griffin's consciousness becomes distorted and consequently, so does the narration.<br />As far as the characters other than Griffin are concerned, although there are many of minor players, there are only 2 who play any substantial role in the story, or who are given any real substance. The first is Don Walsh, a police detective who is equally as jaded as Griffin making him a perfect friend. He has seen too much of the seamier side of life to hold any real hopes of happiness and exudes an air of tired desperation whenever he meets Griffin. The other character is Deborah O'Neill, Griffin's new girlfriend and the shining light in the book. She represents a chance for Griffin to break out of his miasmic haze of self doubt and is a breath of fresh air each time she appears. <br />If you're a devotee of noir fiction, particularly those involving troubled loner detectives, then this book will appeal to you. It reminds me a lot of James Lee Burke's early Dave Robicheaux books. A lot of that has to do with the Louisiana setting, but is also due to the depth of turmoil going through the protagonist's mind.<br />This is a story that is carried on the shoulders of Lew Griffin. Its darkness is generated by the demons inside his head, but there is a distinct feeling of optimism by the time we reach the last few chapters. While the book doesn't exactly finish with a happy ending or an ending with any real climax, it probably comes as close to one that we're going to get in this moody series.	2004-03-16

Unbelievably, considering how action-packed his earlier books were, not only has he done it, but this book has stepped the action-thriller up a couple of notches. It's action on steroids.<br />Shane `Scarecrow' Schofield is one of 15 targets of a worldwide bounty hunt. The bounty on each target's head is over $18 million, enough to lure the best bounty hunters in the world and setting up a series of showdowns of monumental proportions. Scarecrow pretty quickly finds himself with 2 primary objectives. The first and most obvious is to try to stay alive. The second is to try to save the world. After all, what self-respecting super-thriller hasn't got a hero-saves-the-world scenario?<br />As has been proven in the 2 earlier Schofield romps, he's a hard man to kill and can get out of every hopeless situation, usually with fractions of seconds to spare and this book is certainly no different.<br />What is different is the introduction of a new ally for Schofield. One could almost term him his alter ego the Black Knight is the perfect complement to Schofield coming with an almost endless supply of weapons and nifty gadgets. His inclusion, acting as Scarecrow's guardian angel throughout the bounty hunt doubles the outrageous antics and death defying escapes.<br />Know this before you start the book. The premise is so totally outrageous the book could probably be listed in the fantasy section. But that's not the point. The point is, it's meant to be 100 per cent action and non-stop entertainment and that's what it delivers. If you're not prepared to totally suspend belief for around 450 pages for the sake of a rollicking good adventure then you shouldn't even start this book.	2004-03-15
745817:US	47964988	RY02LNQX4DVD8	0743487842	425555121	Bad Men: A Thriller (Connolly, John)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Chilling Stand-Alone	This stand-alone thriller combines a chilling thriller with a haunting supernatural tale as modern day evil parallels a 300-year-old massacre on an island off the Maine coastline. It's a break from the Charlie Parker series, although he does make a blink and you'll miss it cameo early on.<br />The island known as Dutch Island to some and Sanctuary to others is home to around 1000 inhabitants. The locals are used to strange events on the island, with unexplainable deaths throughout its history not being particularly rare. Just lately there have been a growing number of these strange events casting a rather uneasy feeling over the island.<br />A couple of the main characters on the island are the memorable policeman and giant Joe Dupree, the rock-steady Dutch Island local who oozes common sense and capability, and the quiet newcomer, Marianne Elliott who is plagued with dark secrets from her past. Both play integral parts in the story and both draw feelings of sympathy from the reader. I thought in their own ways, they were very tragic characters.<br />On the other hand, we follow the progress of a group of cold-blooded killers making their way north. Moloch, their leader has broken out of prison and is tracking down his wife in order to serve his own form of justice for handing him to the police and stealing his money. On their way they leave a shocking trail of bodies, illustrating just how dangerous they are. The tension builds as they near their destination, until it peaks in a devastating confrontation on Dutch Island.<br />I thought this was a well-crafted story that was able to slowly build up the pressure until the final rip-roaring few chapters. Although the ending is rather inevitable, the pleasure lies in it's telling and Connolly has done an excellent job in this department.	2004-03-15
746461:US	47964988	R3RHBSA8CT0ZNK	0312287844	87446236	Stone Cribs (P.I. Smokey Dalton, 4)	Books	4	5	7	N	N	The 4th In A Brilliant Series	This is the 4th book in the Smokey Dalton series, a series that is set in Memphis and then Chicago in 1968. Before STONE CRIBS the story of Smokey and Jimmy, the 10 year old boy he now cares for as his own son, was set amid turbulent times. The assassination of Martin Luther King was the backdrop of the first book, A DANGEROUS ROAD. Then the setting was moved to Chicago for the second book, SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS and the riots around the 1968 National Democratic Convention held centre court. The third book, THIN WALLS featured the increasing civil unrest and the groups such as the Black Panther Party and organised street gangs that the discontent spawned.<br />Smokey Dalton is a black man hiding from the police and FBI in Chicago living under the assumed name Bill Grimshaw. He's hiding because Jimmy witnessed the shooting of Marin Luther King and knows who the real shooter is, a fact the FBI want hidden. The tension produced by the need to remain undiscovered underlines the entire series and is continued in this book. It isn't helped by the fact that, because Smokey works as an unofficial private detective, he seems to be a magnet for trouble, threatening to bring him to the notice of the police too often.<br />The story starts off at a frantic pace after Smokey and his girlfriend Laura arrive home to find a woman lying in his neighbour's apartment bleeding to death. Upon closer inspection it becomes obvious that the woman has had an abortion, an operation that is illegal in 1969. They rush her to hospital where she is almost refused treatment because she would not name the doctor who performed the procedure.<br />The whole scene raises the abortion issue, as it was at the time in great detail. It particularly highlights the way in which a black woman was treated and explains how they were occasionally punished by being sterilized for having an abortion, a fact that shocked Smokey (and me).<br />It turns out that the woman is the \\"sort of\\" cousin of his neighbour and she hires Smokey to try to find out who performed the abortion in the hope that other women will be warned to stay away from that particular doctor. It's a vague case that appears to have no real direction to it. Smokey merely works his way down a list of names, running into dead ends and false leads, pretty standard detective work. What is established over and over is Smokey's caring nature as he puts himself out for less fortunate families that he meets while working. <br />The case is turned on its head halfway through the book when a murder takes place that hits very close to home for Smokey. The directionless feel to the story suddenly coalesces into a grim and determined fight as once again Smokey finds himself up against a police force that refuses to properly investigate a crime against a black man. In desperation, he turns to the street gang that he worked so hard to avoid in THIN WALLS for help.<br />The tension that has dominated the first three books of the series is still a major factor in STONE CRIBS, but it has been complemented by a significantly greater emphasis on the character development. Characters who played minor roles previously have been brought back here and we learn a great deal more about them and their role in Smokey's life. <br />The characters include Marvella, the voluptuous neighbour of Smokey's who, up until this book, has simply been the woman who occasionally flirted with him as he arrived home. A more sensitive and serious side to her has now been revealed. Sinkowicz, the white cop who has reluctantly put himself out for Smokey has become his permanent friend in the force and a surprisingly intuitive character. Truman Johnson, the black cop that Smokey has just started to truly trust reveals a hidden personal life. <br />The most pronounced development though, is the relationship between Jimmy and Smokey, which is becoming increasingly strained. This is mainly due to Jimmy's fear that something will happen to Smokey and he will lose him as has happened to Jimmy so many times in the past. Jimmy has become moody and uncommunicative and although Smokey seems to be able to solve everyone else's problems, he appears unable to come up with a solution to this one.<br />Nelscott continues to highlight the racial prejudices of the late 1960's through Smokey Dalton's experiences. But rather than come across as a voice that's shrieking in outraged indignation, it's more weary and grim-faced, occasionally speechless with frustration. This is illustrated by Smokey's own summation of his jaded personality when he says: &quot;...events conspired to make me serious, protective and justifiably paranoid.&quot;<br />This is a strong addition to an already powerful series. The mix between Smokey's personal troubles and the more widespread civil unrest that is sweeping the nation is proving incredibly effective and I've found it particularly compelling.	2004-03-14
752780:US	47964988	R3FIR7VZS9HNQI	0060083956	843453239	Mr. Paradise	Books	2	9	14	N	N	Forgettable Leonard	Over the years I've read a few Elmore Leonard stories and I've noticed a fair bit of inconsistency in quality.  This isn't a huge surprise considering the sheer number of books he's written, there are inevitably going to be some good `uns and some bad `uns. The good ones (such as FREAKY DEAKY and OUT OF SIGHT) have been excellent, quirky hardboiled stories that are very memorable mainly due to the off-beat characters and unexpected twists that keep you off balance. Then there are the not so good ones that are noticeable due to their instant forget-ability. MR PARADISE falls into the second category.<br />Tony Paradiso, called Mr Paradise by his two employees, is an eighty-four year old millionaire who enjoyed watching taped Michigan University football games (their wins only) while cheerleaders performed topless next to the television. All harmless fun and he paid well.<br />His favourite cheerleader is a high priced call girl named Chloe. She's so favoured that he has promised to look after her with a little present when he dies. One evening Paradiso requests an impromptu performance from Chloe, but he insists that he wants two cheerleaders, not just one. So Chloe talks her room-mate, a fashion model named Kelly, into joining them for the night.<br />The timing was poor for Chloe and Kelly because it just so happens that Paradiso's right-hand man, Montez Taylor had ordered a hit on his boss for that night. Even worse luck for Chloe because she gets caught up in the hit and is taken out along with Paradiso.<br />Montez Taylor is one of those typical Elmore Leonard characters who comes up with the most outlandish of plans and then sells it well enough to seem plausible - right up until the moment it fails dismally. You see, Chloe wasn't supposed to die. Montez was planning on sharing in her windfall after she claimed it. So a quick change of plans is required. He convinces Kelly to pretend that she's Chloe, sell it to the police and claim the \\"inheritance\\" for them.<br />The flimsiness of his plan is not the only thing working against Montez. The other fly in his ointment comes in the form of the team performing the hit. Art and Carl are a couple of fifty year old hoods who were introduced to the hit man business by their lawyer. Their stupidity is only matched by their ruthlessness. Making no effort to hide their tracks after each job, the only mystery surrounding them is how on earth they managed to stay out of prison for so long.<br />Frank Delsa is the detective working the case and the eventual protagonist who is faced with Montez's preposterous story. As a character, he is the most normal character in the book and acts as the straight man to the bunch of idiot criminals who are trying to out-think him. His cool, calm thinking was an excellent counterpoint to that of the bad guys. The only downside to the Delsa character is a very unlikely, very clichéd romance that Leonard involved him in. I felt it was out of place and ended up serving no real purpose. I thought he would be a stronger character if he were left on his own.<br />It's really surprising that this book actually dragged out beyond the 300 page mark. There really isn't a lot to the story and, once the initial premise has been set up, there is only one logical conclusion and that's exactly the way it pans out. <br />I've enjoyed Elmore Leonard's books in the past, not only for the gritty storylines that provide more than their fair share of surprises but also for the off-beat humour that manages to make the characters just skewed enough to be amusing rather than straight out scary. I found MR PARADISE lacked any of the qualities that would make it more than a moderately interesting story.	2004-03-09
758400:US	47964988	R1QE126ET3X57W	0312320442	557039017	Thin Walls: A Smokey Dalton Novel	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Just An Outstanding Book In An Outstanding Series	It's December 1968, eight months after the Democratic Convention and the riots that accompanied it, the setting of SMOKE-FILLED ROOMS. Smokey Dalton and his adopted son Jimmy are still hiding out after fleeing Memphis (and the FBI). Smokey is now working unofficially as a private detective, the same sort of job he had in Memphis and is only now beginning to feel comfortable in the new city.<br />Smokey is hired by a woman to investigate the murder of her husband after she was dissatisfied with the job the police did. She felt that because he was a black man the police made poor assumptions and gave the case a low priority without bothering to look too hard. In fact they attributed the death as a gang murder, even though the man was a respected dentist. The case is the catalyst to an investigation that leads him to uncover crimes on an unimagined magnitude. But because the crimes have been perpetrated on blacks, the solution is not as simple as just identifying the murderer.<br />Smokey has to juggle his time working on the case with getting Jimmy to and from school. A local gang, the Blackstone Rangers are attempting to recruit Jimmy, which would most likely lead to an inevitable life of crime. Smokey is determined to come up with a solution to put them off for good.<br />A further responsibility is heaped on Smokey's shoulders when Laura Hathaway asks him to act as her security for some hostile business negotiations in which she is involved. It is this sub-plot that highlights a second form of prejudice, that of sexual discrimination.<br />The story flows smoothly from crisis to crisis as Smokey handles each situation with his usual common sense and decency. Although he is challenged more regularly with the need to quell the impotent rage and frustration that he is filled with as he deals with bigotry and racism on a daily basis.<br />There is so much more to the Smokey Dalton books than just a mystery to be solved, although the mystery in this case is very interesting, cleverly constructed and relevant. Each of the books are also surrounded by turmoil often with a simmering feeling of unrest, echoed by the increasingly vocal Civil Rights movement and the backlash that it caused.<br />The mood of the book as seen through Smokey himself ranges from resignation to barely controlled fury. The portrayal of the racism that was prevalent at the time created some poignant moments and some tension-charged moments as the humiliation felt by Smokey emanated from the pages.<br />Two examples of this kind of racism stayed with me long after I finished the book. The first took place in a supermarket in a white neighbourhood that Smokey was passing through. He had decided to pick up some groceries and was pleasantly surprised to find the prices were much cheaper and the fruit and vegetables were much fresher than those found in his own neighbourhood. When he came to the checkout, the cashier simply refused to serve him, closing her checkout. The manager then confronted Smokey in front of everyone in the shop and advised him to leave the groceries and go.<br />Later that night while he was still seething, Smokey was to make the following observation about the incident.<br />\\"I hadn't encountered that kind of overt racism since I'd come to Chicago. Usually in Chicago, people smiled at you and then denied your rental application...<br />...I'd once said to Franklin that I'd preferred overt racism. At least then you knew where you stood.<br />I now regretted those words. Either kind of discrimination felt bad. Even now I felt nauseous, a sense of helplessness filling me.\\"<br />The second example was much more shocking in it's brutality. A white man and his black girlfriend were bashed and raped by a couple of white men, outraged by the white man kissing \\"that monkey\\" in a park. The assault itself was shocking to start with, but then the assumptions made by the police when they arrived were even worse.<br />I found the issues that were raised very sobering and found myself being outraged by the unfairness of the treatment, knowing that scenes like these happened every day in real life.<br />This is another superb story that continues a terrific series set right in the middle of a time of great turmoil, occasionally touched by events that followed the Civil Rights Movement. In this book, Smokey crosses paths with the fledgling Black Panthers; serving as a reminder of the difficult times he was living in.<br />Once again, Kris Nelscott has produced an outstanding thriller and set it in a difficult place and time in history. I found it compelling reading, both for the tense thriller and for the thought it promoted by raising such strong issues.	2004-03-05

While it definitely has its moments in terms of providing a tense thriller, I found that the story didn't quite ring true to me. I'll explain why a little later.<br />The story is told from the first person point of view of Mim Bracca. From the outside it would appear that Mim has it all. She's a member of a Tailhook, a rock band that is riding a wild wave of success that seems like it will never end. But Mim is haunted by her past and the early tragedies that shaped her life.<br />After her father was sent to prison for the murder of her mother, Mim and her brother were sent to a series of foster homes with varying levels of success. Mim became what could delicately be termed a &quot;problem child&quot; and her experiences could be directly related to her alcoholism now.<br />It's her problem with alcohol that eventually leads her to be confronted by the lead singer of the band while on tour with the news that Mim is being temporarily rested from the band because they consider her drinking to have gotten out of control. After spending the previous two days alternately blacked out or vomiting, Mim doesn't have much of an argument and is soon aboard a plane bound for her home in Portland, Oregon.<br />When she arrives home, nursing a hangover from the flight, she is confronted by a man on her doorstep and then abducted at gunpoint. It's an unusual abduction because she is thrown into the back of a van, forced to strip naked and then is driven around for a while before being dumped back at her own home. Confused and scared, she rings the police but when she tells them her story they are very sceptical and take little action.<br />Mim's response to her ordeal, as it is with most situations, is to get completely and utterly rat-faced drunk. From this point her life begins to nosedive as she experiences personaltragedy (response: get drunk), is publicly humiliated (response: get drunk), is blackmailed (response: get drunk), her father is kidnapped (response: well...you get the idea).<br />After what seems like an eternity Mim finally takes some sort of control of the situation and comes up with an idea about who is blackmailing her and how she can fight her way out of the problem. What annoyed me the most about Mim's helplessness was her utter refusal to let anyone else, such as the police, help her in any way. I don't yell at books very often, but I sure did this time, pleading with her to get some bloody help before we ran out of pages.<br />I found the way that Mim's alcoholism was dealt with to be extremely frustrating and unrealistic. Here was a rich and famous young woman who was sent home by her fellow band members to \\"dry out\\", yet she was given absolutely no support at all. In fact, she was just shoved on a plane by herself, expected to go home where she lived alone and then, all be herself, she had to \\"dry out\\".<br />Just a little bit of help from someone would have served the duel purpose of giving the story some added interest, and it would have helped move things along a little more quickly.<br />Finally, things begin to fall into place after numerous disagreements with the police which I simply found annoying and distracting. Once Mim pulls herself together the action picks up and we are treated to an ending with one or two unexpected twists. But on the whole I found the book rather disappointing with the resolution leaving me with a feeling that it was too little, too late.	2004-03-04
763481:US	47964988	R11AZJO1GCYM3X	006019877X	576504477	Playing with Fire: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Novels)	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Another Outstanding Inspector Banks Book	This is the 14th book in the outstanding Inspector Banks series. This is a series that relies not only on high quality mysteries to make it interesting but extremely engaging characters whose lives develop before our eyes. The main characters in the series, Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his second in command Detective Inspector Annie Banks return once again and pick up from where they left off last time. As a series, it's usually a good idea to read the books in order, although in this case I think it could be read as a stand-alone without missing out on too much valuable information.<br />But on to what actually happens in the book itself. The case that has Banks and the other members of his Western Area Headquarters, Major Crimes Team out in the middle of the night is an arson attack on two derelict barges. It's soon apparent that among the burning wreckage lie two bodies, prompting the case to be investigated as a double homicide.<br />On the surface there is no obvious reason why someone should set fire to a couple of broken down barges. The fact that they were homes to squatters at least gives Banks some leads to follow. Then, the pace accelerates when a second arson attack takes place in a caravan located less than 10 miles from the first fire.<br />What starts out as a seemingly straightforward case of arson soon becomes more complicated once some connections between the two fires are made. Thanks to one of the victims turning out to be a local artist, it looks more and more likely that the crime they are investigating could have something to do with art forgery.<br />A part of the investigation that I found particularly fascinating was the work done by the Fire Investigation Officer Geoff Hamilton. Apart from the sardonic wit and gruff attitude of the man himself, the actual process of sifting through the ashes in order to determine whether the fire was deliberately lit, where it started and when it may have been started was told in a detailed andvery interesting fashion. Call it the fire-bug in me but I found this part of the investigation enthralling.<br />There really isn't a lot in the way of new ground to be forged when dealing with police procedural stories. A crime takes place, the police arrive, work the scene, gather evidence, send it to forensics, perhaps attend an autopsy and conduct a heap of interviews. So what makes this such a fresh and interesting story is the strength of the characters, their substantial backgrounds and the dialogue that rings true.<br />Alan Banks in particular is a very engaging character, as one would hope being the main protagonist in the story. There is obviously a personal history between himself and Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, and I'm guessing that this would have been covered in one (or more) of the earlier books in the series. While it does create a little bit of tension between the two of them while working the case, it merely adds to the depth of their characters. Banks' love of a glass of Laphroaig Scotch whilst relaxing to one of his many jazz CD's of an evening sounds to me like the perfect way to end each day and epitomises the laid back nature of the man.<br />As the investigation progresses, the pace of the book increases subtly until we are faced with quite a dramatic ending, serving to top off a very satisfying story. Enough of the case is solved to provide a satisfactory ending, while enough loose ends remain to ensure that there will be something to pick up in the next book in the series.	2004-03-01
768660:US	47964988	R1BT71FRX0XOCT	0385337132	625732713	The 37th Hour	Books	4	14	16	N	N	An Emotional Wrench	Starting out as a missing person story this debut novel by Jodi Compton slowly evolves into a wonderfully emotional hunt that raises some difficult questions of whether ethics should prevail over grief. It's a story that builds up the momentum until reaching a climax that, although not earth-shattering, unearths a few surprises.<br />Written in the first person perspective of Sarah Pribek, a detective with the Hennepin County sheriff's office, we meet a capable yet vulnerable woman. The reason for her vulnerability stems from the recent semi-retirement of her partner, mentor and friend Genevieve Brown. Genevieve had recently suffered a mother's worst nightmare when her daughter was raped and murdered. To make matters worse, the man who did it escaped punishment due to a legal technicality, a technicality that Sarah feels responsible for.<br />But that is just one sub-plot. The other main sub-plot involves her husband Mike Shiloh. Shiloh is also a cop who was working with the Minneapolis Police Department until he was recruited by the FBI. From early on it is established that he and Sarah are very much in love and go out of their way to show how much they care for each other. Which is why Sarah thought it was unusual when Shiloh left for Quantico without so much as a note to say goodbye. By this time it has also been established that Shiloh tends not to do the expected all the time, so Sarah is not particularly concerned.<br />It's only when the FBI ring to ask why Shiloh hasn't shown up that the alarm bells start to ring. Fortunately, Sarah happens to specialise in finding missing persons and immediately begins to track down his last known movements. What's not so fortunate for her peace of mind is her knowledge of the probability of finding a missing person alive after they've been missing for longer than 36 hours. The tension brought about from searching for her missing husband soon consumes all other thoughts and takes over the mood of the book.<br />Even thoughthis is first and foremost a mystery story, it's main focus turns out to be about relationships. Starting with the husband and wife relationship displayed by Sarah and Shiloh. Although it appears strong at the start, and indeed it probably is, Sarah soon comes to the realisation that there is much about her husband she doesn't know. The next relationship spotlighted is the friendship forged as fellow police officers by Sarah and Genevieve. But this too is revealed to be fragile as Sarah fells she is unable to supply the support Genevieve needs in her grief. Finally there is a brother / sister relationship that is revealed towards the end of the book that holds secrets from Shiloh's past.<br />The way the book finished gave me the strong impression that this was the first of a series featuring Sarah Pribek. If this is the case then Jodi Compton will definitely be an author to look out for by readers who like a bit more depth to their characters.	2004-02-26
772554:US	47964988	R2NPBVU40V7225	0385510438	817294609	The Last Juror (Grisham, John)	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Read it for the small town values	In his latest novel, John Grisham has returned to the small town of Clanton, Mississippi, the scene of his first book A TIME TO KILL. Once again he has proven that he has the knack of drawing you into the book, compelling you to read more. I found that this was both good and bad in the case of THE LAST JUROR, good because I always had the sense that something was about to happen and I was desperate to find out what it was. Bad because, more often than not, I was left hanging.<br />Covering the years 1970 to 1979, it's written in the first person from the point of view of Willie Traynor, a young outsider to the town who has just purchased the town newspaper. It's through his eyes that all the events in Clanton are reported.<br />The big story of the day was the rape and murder of a young local woman who was able to identify her attacker as Danny Padgitt to her next-door neighbour. Much is made of the powerful and infinitely corrupt Padgitt family. We hear how dangerous they are when they're crossed, how ruthless they are when dealing with invaders to their land. They are an ever-present, menacing storm cloud lurking on the horizon of the peaceful town of Clanton. Traynor, as an outspoken mouthpiece against Danny Padgitt looks to have put himself firmly within the Padgitt's sights, as have the potential jurors for the trial.<br />Callie Ruffin is the last juror chosen for the Danny Padgitt trial. She is a notable selection because she is the first black juror chosen in Ford County and she is a god-fearing mother of eight adult children and a friend of Willie Traynor. She is a fascinating character and her past is drawn out over a series of extravagant home cooked lunchtime meals that she prepared for Willie.<br />As it turns out, the trial of Danny Padgitt is over one-third of the way into the book. From that point on it really reads like a study of life in a southern small town during the 1970's. Consequently the pace of the book settles down to match the comfortablelifestyle that comes with living in a small town. While this is fine and pleasant enough, it all became a bit frustrating after being revved up by the frenetic activity in the opening and the continual references of retribution that could possibly come from the Padgitt family.<br />Admittedly, we do see some action later in the book, but these sequences too are punctuated by long pauses of inactivity. So much so that rather than building up tension and suspense, I found that it had the opposite effect and it was more a sense of relief that something was happening that I felt. <br />I suppose the most damning observation I could make is the realisation that the anecdotes told to Willie about the misdeeds of the Padgitt family sounded a lot more interesting than the actual events of the book. The story of sheriff's deputies going missing on Padgitt land appeals to me a lot more than the manoeuvrings of minor politicians in an election race.<br />It also seems that Grisham's chronic ending problem is continuing. I've been disappointed in the way Grisham has ended his books in the past (notably in THE FIRM, THE CLIENT and THE SUMMONS), often leaving the whole story unfinished at the final full stop. I felt that he did it again here. After meandering through town learning about every religious belief in the county, renovating Willie's house in record slowness and drawing out the discussion of whether or not to sell the newspaper, we were suddenly nearing the 350-page that appears to be Grisham's limit. Before I knew it, everything was wrapped up in a clumsy package and the book was finished. Long and carefully constructed plotlines were cut without a by your leave and characters who had become very familiar were abandoned.<br />As mentioned at the start of the review, Clanton Mississippi was the setting of Grisham's first book, A TIME TO KILL and as such, we are reacquainted with a few of the characters from that book. Making his reappearance is Harry Rex Vonner, lawyerand source of all sorts of useful local knowledge for Traynor. Also, there's the deliciously unscrupulous defence attorney, Lucien Wilbanks, one of the better &quot;man you love to hate&quot; characters I've come across. Smaller appearances are made by D.A. Rufus Buckley and Judge Omar Noose who both have much larger roles in Grisham's earlier book.<br />All is not lost with THE LAST JUROR. Read it for the pleasant imagery of rural living in Mississippi. Relax on Callie Ruffin's front porch over a delicious home-cooked meal. Delight in the increasingly profitable newspaper business built by Willie Traynor. But don't go looking for a tension-charged mystery.	2004-02-24
777292:US	47964988	RAJSQQN1Z3WBC	0863222811	557837036	The Guards	Books	4	48	50	N	N	Darkly Irish	Readers hoping for a light mystery that is full of intricate plot devices that will challenge their own powers of deduction while being taken on a thrill-ride of adventure should be well advised this is not the book for you. THE GUARDS reads like a celebration of hardboiled fiction, the mood is dark, some might even use the term nourish and the style is spare as Bruen has stripped the prose down to the bare bones.<br />The story focuses on Jack Taylor, an ex-Garda Siochana officer (Ireland's National Police Service) who was kicked out of the service after he punched a member of parliament in the mouth. He spends his time, when he's not sitting drunk in his local pub, working as a private detective. Or at least, he would be working as a private detective if Ireland recognised the profession. As Jack explains it, he just finds things for people, thanks to two qualities, patience and pig stubbornness, particularly the latter.<br />One day, while sitting in Grogan's bar working on his latest drunk, Jack is approached by Ann Henderson who wants to hire him to investigate the suicide of her daughter, Sarah. Ann is convinced that her daughter wouldn't kill herself and wants Jack to find the truth. Jack, drunk at the time, agrees to take the case. Once Jack starts working the case, it becomes obvious that he has a specific sense of right and wrong as evidenced when he targets his enemies. But he offsets that with a distinctly underdeveloped sense of self-preservation, or perhaps it's just dulled by alcohol abuse, as evidenced by the forthright approach he uses to confront these same enemies.<br />Written in the first person from Jack's point of view, it is narrated in terse, clipped sentences as though Taylor is telling us his story through tightly gritted teeth, absolutely exhausted by his ordeals. It is very reminiscent of Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder series or George Pelecanos' Nick Stefanos series. Both of these series feature characters that battle constantly with alcoholism as Jack does. Further clues to the hardboiled qualities that Bruen achieves can be found in the quotes used at the start of selected chapters, the authors of these quotes include Ed McBain, Walter Mosely, Elmore Leonard and Pelecanos. At different times you can see the influence of each of these authors making their presence felt.<br />As a devotee of hardboiled fiction this book really appealed to me. It's dark and occasionally depressing but the character of Jack Taylor is an honest to goodness survivor greeting most setbacks with stoic good humour he becomes a strangely endearing character and I found myself cheering for him by the end. I think it is a worthy Edgar Award nominee.<br />By the way, between blackouts, a trip to the mental asylum, attempts at sobriety, recovering from beatings and cataclysmic falls off the wagon, Jack does actually put some time into the case he was hired to investigate. Whether he solved the case is neither here nor there really, the important thing is how he survives.	2004-02-20
777674:US	47964988	RGM8QRH0X6Z3Z	0670032891	260413038	The Well of Lost Plots: A Thursday Next Novel	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Incredibly Imaginative	For those who are late to Jasper Fforde's books, the quick overview is that he has created a brilliantly imaginative parallel world where Wales is a communist country, the Crimean War has been in progress for over 120 years, dodos and thylacines are household pets and it is possible for people to read their way into books. To get a better feel for his world and to appreciate this book more fully, it is strongly recommended that you read THE EYRE AFFAIR and LOST IN A GOOD BOOK first.<br />While the first 2 books were set mainly in the real world with occasional visits into various classic novels, this one takes place almost exclusively within books and the result is a breathtaking expansion of what was already a superb creation.<br />Thursday Next, heroine of the first two books is hiding out from the evil Goliath Corporation, among other enemies, inside The Well of Lost Plots. To be specific, she's hiding out in a dreary crime thriller called Caversham Heights where she takes over a role of Mary in the story as part of the Character Exchange Programme. The Well of Lost Plots is where all of those books that are still being written are kept, along with a wealth of plot devices, characters both good and evil who are waiting to be used and members of Jurisfiction who rule on problems within books and who generally maintain order.<br />Thursday encounters various dangers while working as a Jurisfiction apprentice including a dangerous flock of grammasites, verbisoides in this instance, who attack and consume any stray verbs they could find. She also has terrible problems with a mispeling vyrus that threatens to reduce the story and it's characters to an unrecognisable shambles. But there is also a murderer in their midst and it's left to Thursday to work out who the murderer is and why the victims were killed.<br />This really is an incredibly imaginative and entertaining book that expands Fforde's BookWorld to unbelievable proportions. It's left me fervently hoping that there are more Thursday Next stories still to come.	2004-02-20

Reed Arvin is just such an author with his terrific debut THE WILL under his belt. He has followed it up here with another heck of a legal thriller. In this book, as in his first, Arvin takes the principal character out of his comfortable, secure life and throws him into turmoil, threatening not only his job, but also his life. The result is an unpredictable thriller in which I found it easy to put myself in the protagonist's shoes and ask myself, \\"Now, what would I have done?\\"<br />The protagonist thrust into the extreme situation in this case is Jack Hammond, an up and coming lawyer who works for a major Atlanta law firm. After making a serious error in judgement while working on a criminal case, he loses his job and winds up working as a public defender, relying on a friendly judge's clerk to send cases his way. When he hears that friend and former client Doug Townsend has died of a drug overdose he is at first saddened, then surprised because although Townsend was known to take drugs, he thought he was clean now. He decides to have a look around Townsend's apartment in an attempt to find a clue as to why he would have killed himself and in doing so he discovers 2 surprising things. The first is, not only was Doug clean of drugs but he seemed to be doing quite well for himself, particularly when you consider the number of airplane trips he had taken recently. The second, judging by the hundreds of photos stuck to the walls of one of the rooms in his house, was that he had a rather disturbing obsession with noted opera singer Michele Sonnier. Not only that, but the airplane trips coincided with Sonnier's performances.<br />Jack's next step is to seek out Michele Sonnier to find out what she knows about Doug Townsend. It's the first of many chances he is to take. Sonnier turns out to be the lynchpin to the whole story, linking Townsend to a groundbreaking company called Horizn Pharmaceuticals, but the question is - was the link friendly or deadly? The company has some sort of involvement with a potential new cure for hepatitis C and will soon be listing on the stock market. The money involved is huge, therefore so are the stakes and the desperation to keep Hammond's nose out of Horizn's business.   <br />From the moment that Michele Sonnier makes her appearance the story splits off into numerous themes taking in the world of the opera diva, computer hacking, the possibility of a cure for hepatitis C, big business and a conspiracy that may be behind the deaths of 8 people. As you can tell, it's a fairly diverse story and Arvin does well to hold the various threads together to ensure that it's compelling throughout.<br />From very early on you get the impression that Hammond is operating under a feeling of complete acceptance of the consequences of his earlier actions. He seems perfectly willing to take whatever chances are necessary to accomplish his goals and so, because of this, I was prepared to accept that he would be willing to make difficult decisions. The result is a continual increase in momentum as he puts himself in ever greater danger, always against his better judgement. <br />A very important part of the story and a point that makes him a particularly endearing character is that Jack is a flawed character. He falls in love with women he shouldn't, he enters places that he knows will be dangerous to his health and he ignores warnings to stop investigating things he shouldn't. I found that I was pulling for Hammond to succeed even more than I usually might because of his flaws and because he was aware of them and accepted them. It made him much more believable as a character.<br />There was also a feeling throughout the book that someone was lying but I found it difficult to decide who it was because everyone's stories were so darn convincing. Sure, I had my suspicions but Ikept thinking they were based on who I wanted to be telling the truth rather than who actually was. It kept me guessing which way the story might head right up until the bittersweet ending.<br />Anyone who loves a good legal thriller in the John Grisham style will certainly enjoy this book and it shows that a riveting courtroom battle is not necessary to make a legal thriller terrific reading. With sharp dialogue, a complex, but not convoluted plot and likable central characters, THE LAST GOODBYE provides terrific entertainment.	2004-02-17
786566:US	47964988	R37DOMC9XCPMEM	0312301995	724784491	The Distant Echo (Mcdermid, Val)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Another excellent mystery	This book is very reminiscent of McDermid's most successful book to date, the multi-award winning A PLACE OF EXECUTION. The similarity lies in the way the story is presented in two parts, the first half dealing with the emotion of the crime as it happens and the second half fast forwards to the present and deals with the fallout. In this case we are taken back to 1978 before completing the story in 2003. On the surface it's a simple mystery, a girl is raped, stabbed and left for dead in the small university village of St Andrews in Scotland. But as the story unfolds, the consequences prove that the tragedy is much more insidious and far reaching.<br />Part 1 of the story begins with four young men walking home drunk from a party, late one night. The men met on their first day of high school and have stood by each other throughout their school life. They have now moved on to university and have remained inseparable. They each have nicknames bestowed upon them and it is by these names that we know of them throughout the book. For the record, their names and nicknames are Alex Gilbey (aka Gilly), Sigmund Malkiewicz (aka Ziggy), David Kerr (aka Mondo) and Tom Mackie (aka Weird). During their walk home they literally stumble upon the body of Rosie Duff, a barmaid from the local pub. She had been stabbed in the stomach and was barely clinging to life.<br />Faced with the dying girl, Alex is sent to get help and finds PC James Lawson who raises the alarm, but by the time they get back to Rosie, she had already died. The 4 friends start out as the only witnesses to the murder, but soon become the only suspects, thanks to two facts. The police have a distinct lack of evidence and, while being questioned all four of them withhold information that they think is unrelated to the case and would only serve to get them in trouble.<br />Although they all insist they had nothing to do with Rosie's death, news soon leaks that the police had questioned them and people start voicing their suspicions. The rest of the first part of the story sees the slow disintegration of the boy's friendship as the case drags on with the finger of blame continually pointed at them. They have to endure malicious gossip and rumour as well as physical and verbal abuse. They even get to the point where they begin to become suspicious of each other and start to blame one another for getting them into their predicament.<br />It's in the second half of the book (Part 2) that the story really comes to life as plot twists are thrown in one on top of the other. It's 25 years later and we get to see what became of the four friends and how their nightmare experience has affected their lives. We also get a complete change in tempo as the style of story jumps from police procedural to that of a thriller. McDermid does a splendid job of feeding out a little bit of the murder investigation, which has been reopened as part of the Chief Constable's cold case review programme, while supplying an intensely thrilling subplot to keep things jumping.<br />THE DISTANT ECHO shows how easily a weak friendship can be torn apart under pressure, but at the same time it highlights the strength of true friendship. I found it to be compulsive reading thanks to its multi-dimensional story line. It's more than just a murder mystery, although it's a fine murder mystery just the same, it's a book that deals with relationships (all sorts of relationships, by the way) and their survival through all sorts of adversity.	2004-02-13
792347:US	47964988	R2D37KRMIOP9FF	0399150803	642490368	Trojan Odyssey (Dirk Pitt Adventure)	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Dirk's Getting Tired	One very important point to remember when reading Clive Cussler books, they are meant to be purely entertaining. Any rescue or feat of survival that appears possible in the real world is merely accidental, the escapes from certain death are to be expected and accepted.<br />Dirk's back, but there has been a major change to his life. He has discovered that he is the father of a pair of fraternal twins who are now 23 years old and he has had to make a complete readjustment of his life's priorities. His children, named Summer and Dirk, are every bit as intrepid as their father and have both been given jobs working with him at the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA). The whole Pitt family are all involved in the start of adventure, with Dirk and Summer trying to work out the origin of a massive slick of brown crud that is killing the sea-life in the Caribbean. Like so many other Dirk Pitt adventures it appears that a mysterious multi-billionaire megalomaniac is behind the environmental disaster in the making, with even grander and earth shattering plans in store. Again, like other Dirk Pitt stories, the evil mastermind is willing to use deadly force to keep his nefarious activities a secret. It's up to Dirk and his sidekick Al Giordino to save the day - and the world.<br />Clive Cussler sticks to his tried and true formula, starting with a brief history lesson, this time harking back to the Trojan Wars around 1190 B.C. and then fast forwarding to 2006 and the research being undertaken in the Caribbean where, lo and behold they come across an ancient artefact. As usual, a nice job is made of marrying the ancient story to the present day crisis. The second part of the formula involves Dirk Pitt saving the world, yet remaining stoically modest about his role in proceedings. We all know it's going to happen; it's just a matter of how Dirk's going to get us there.<br />Unfortunately, this Dirk Pitt thriller isn't the fast-paced thrill ride of earlier books. You getthe distinct impression that Dirk Pitt is getting tired and is preparing to call it a day. The usual snap is missing and the heights of excitement just aren't reached, probably reflective of Dirk's malaise. Sure, the corny dialogue, improbable escapes and unbelievable rescues are there, but the edge feels as though it's missing. Could it be that the young Pitts will soon be taking over from their old man?<br />If you've never read a Dirk Pitt story before I would advise against starting with this one. Dirk Pitt has come a long way and been through many adventures and does quite a bit of reminiscing about the past. Better books to start with (and these are the first ones I read) might be Dragon, Sahara or Inca Gold, but don't forget the warning at the top of the review because this can't be stressed often enough, these books aren't to be taken seriously.	2004-02-09

It's wildly entertaining, managing to go from laugh out loud funny to viciously violent in the blink of an eye.<br />Harold Jenks is a lieutenant to a St Louis drug lord who sees his only opportunity for escape from the life lies in assuming the identity of a scholarship-winning poetry student. Stealing the name Sherman Ellis along with a bag full of his boss's drugs he heads for Eastern Oklahoma University and a new life of academia.<br />Jay Morgan is the poetry professor who doesn't quite know what to make of Jenks / Ellis, but points out to his fellow professors that Ellis' poetry is just as awful as his fellow students. Anyway, Morgan has his mind on more important matters, not the least of which is working out what to do with the body of the dead girl in his bed.<br />Finally, there's the enigmatic Fred Jones, an inspired character giving a refreshing injection of the unusual to the story. Jones is a rich old man who has promised to donate a large sum of money to the university with the understanding that someone (Jay Morgan) agrees to help him to get his poetry published. Not surprising to us, but very surprising to Morgan, the poetry is very, very good. But it's Jones' other talents that Morgan finds he has a more immediate use for.<br />Of course, all sorts of hell and mayhem are rained down upon the quiet university town of Fumbee, when Harold Jenks' former boss and his team of thugs come looking for his drugs. Between this mob and a rogue private investigator who becomes a one man crime wave, there's no shortage of action.<br />The cold violence displayed in the book appealed to the hardboiled reader in me, but it was mixed with plenty of humorous moments which managed to take the wicked edge off and put a smile on my face even as the bodies piled up. After reading this, the old gun lobby catch-cry may haveto change to \\"Guns don't kill people - poets kill people\\".	2004-02-03

He talks hard, he fights hard and when it comes to love he falls fast and hard. Nothing at all is held back in this highly charged murder case that cuts straight to Hammer's core.<br />The tough, no-nonsense Hammer is faced with the cruel shooting murder of Jack Williams, a close friend, and takes it hard. In front of Pat Chambers, another good friend who just happens to be the Captain of Homicide, he vows that when he catches the murderer he would gladly shoot him in the gut, just like Williams had been. The case quickly becomes a race between Hammer and Chambers, as Hammer is determined to have his vengeance.<br />This is hardboiled detective fiction as it should be. There are no qualms when it comes to violence, no regrets over shooting the bad guys, whisky is swallowed easily in one swallow and the dames are kept begging for more. We charge from suspect to suspect watching Hammer extract information under threat of violence, and following through on the threat whenever necessary. Moving at breakneck speed, the bodies pile up while Hammer finds himself falling in love. It makes for terrific reading for lovers of the hardboiled detective genre.	2004-02-02
804941:US	47964988	RT4Z2WDS8X65G	075285111X	223134214	A Question of Blood	Books	5	1	1	N	N	As Determined As Ever	This is the 14th book in the Inspector John Rebus series (not counting the book of short stories) and once again Rebus is hard at work intimidating criminals and annoying his superiors. This book is a little unusual because Rebus works pretty closely with a couple of partners, something he has steered clear from with almost pathological alacrity up until now. It felt as though the whole tone of the book was much lighter as a result, particularly when dealing with his emotional state.<br />The book opens with Rebus in hospital nursing two very badly scalded hands. Apart from raising the question as to how he came to scald his hands, which remains a secret for the majority of the book, it also makes him dependent on others for just about every simple function, such as the important ones like drinking a beer or lighting a cigarette to driving a car. The result is some interesting working interactions between Rebus and his fellow detectives which makes a very refreshing change. <br />Soon after leaving hospital, Rebus is called in to assist on what appears to be a tragic but straightforward schoolyard murder / suicide shooting. His experience is requested because the murderer is an ex-SAS soldier, a branch of the army that Rebus had trained with before quitting and joining the police. The idea is that Rebus might be able to add some unique insights due to this previous experience, but it also opens the door to a look at John's own past and a part of it that we the reader have rarely been able to look at. It was nice to finally get a bit of an insight into his life before the police, which was always mentioned in passing, but never expanded on satisfactorily. And even when it was put under the microscope here, Rebus still kept things pretty close to his chest, whetting my appetite for more in a later book, perhaps.<br />The investigation and consequently the story, moves along at a fast pace, particularly for a police procedural style of book. This is a common theme withthe Rebus stories, thanks to his sheer determination to solve the crime. He is always more intent on advancing the investigation rather than being content to sit around airing conjecture after conjecture. <br />The prose is strong on characterisation with plenty of background information given on each of the main characters making it very easy to understand the motives behind their actions. But as with just about all of the Rebus books, the greatest \\"character\\" description is reserved for the city of Edinburgh and its surrounds. You really get a terrific feeling of place thanks to the detail that Ian Rankin goes into when moving through the city.<br />If you've never read an Inspector Rebus book before and came across this one, you would be inclined to think that here was an untroubled policeman who is very proficient at his job. In actual fact, during the course of the previous 13 books, he has battled through a failed marriage, chronic insomnia, alcoholism and thoughts of suicide. Finally he appears to have arrived at a place where he is much more comfortable with himself. In the past he was a loner on the job, preferring to keep his thoughts and his theories to himself, much to his fellow detectives' frustration and his superior's total annoyance. It looks as though this attitude has changed and I think it's a change for the better. I was actually concerned for his health in the earlier books.<br />Additionally, if you haven't read the earlier Inspector Rebus books, you'd have no problem starting off with this book. There are no fears of coming across plot pieces that could act as spoilers of earlier books and the characters are introduced in such a way that you don't need any prior knowledge of them to appreciate where they fit in Rebus' life. I'm sure the result of starting with this book would be an overwhelming urge to go back and read the earlier books.<br />Thanks to the extra interaction between Rebus and Siobhan Clarke, I thought this was an excellent addition to what is already an outstanding series. It's also nice to see that his dogged determination to solve the case and his disregard for his superiors hasn't diminished at all either.	2004-01-30

Cool Investigations, is hired by Henry Ashbury to check up on his daughters finances. She has been making some strange withdrawals of late and is concerned, particularly if word got out. The last thing Ashbury wants is a financial scandal. Ashbury also doesnt want his daughter to know that Lam is a detective, so he uses the front that Lam is a jujitsu expert who will be working as his trainer, a cover that is doomed from the start.<br />It doesnt take Lam long to find where the moneys going, but in carrying out his investigation he uncovers blackmail, fraud, business scams and even a murder. There is no shortage of intrigue but Lam always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else, thanks in no small part to his previous experience as a lawyer.<br />Thanks to Lams quick-witted observations and his sharp eye for detail the story zips along at breakneck speed. A feature of this story also comes from the barbs traded by Lam and Bertha as Lam is beginning to exert himself as an influential member of their partnership. Its fun watching just how Lam is going to turn every situation to his own advantage.	2004-01-23

It's a powerful book that reads much like a documentary about growing up in Brooklyn at that time, the difficulties faced by single parent families and, not only racial divisions, but the class distinctions and their effects. It's as much about survival as it is about living.<br />What I found a little disappointing was the feeling that very little was achieved by the time I reached the end of the book. There were no life-altering realisations or achievements of any note, in particular, the characters didn't seem to grow or change much.<br />Set in two distinctive halves, the book first chronicles the lives of 2 boys, Dylan Ebdus and Mingus Rude growing through their formative years, and then there is a fast-forward to today and a look at what they have made of themselves. Along the way, we are treated to a myriad of unusual pursuits. We get a peek at graffiti artist mentality, comic book collecting, pop-art and the life and dedication of an experimental film-maker. We are even treated to an unexpected touch of the fantastic.<br />Although the odd crime is committed in the book, it's not a crime book, not a mystery. What it is is a terrific story of life in the 1970s that came across as very much real-life. I also thought the main characters were very sympathetic and believable making reading it a most rewarding experience.	2004-01-19

As far as legal thrillers go, this is a first class book, combining an intriguing mystery with the constant threat of deadly consequences. Add this to some excellent characters who are vividly brought to life and you have a book that is very difficult to put down.<br />Henry Mathews is a hotshot lawyer working for a prestigious Chicago law firm. When Ty Crandall, the richest man from Henry's home town of Council Grove Kansas dies, Henry is called and asked to return home to act as executor of the will. The will contains a major shock for the Crandall family when they learn that the bulk of the estate has been left to Raymond Boyd, known to the townsfolk as the Birdman. Boyd is a dishevelled vagrant of questionable sanity who sits in the local park preaching verses from the bible. The obvious questions are, why would a homeless man be made beneficiary of such a vast estate? What was in his past and how is he connected to Ty Crandall? Finding all this out makes terrific reading indeed.<br />Although the premise described above is interesting in itself, there is a lot more to the story than just a fight over a will. There are plenty of small town secrets, ego trips and power plays at work, as well as a significant amount of greed shown by the more powerful figures who have their own reasons for not allowing the Birdman to collect on his good fortune. There are also the ethical considerations caused by the pressure placed on Henry to return to Chicago and his high-paying job.<br />I found this to be a fast-paced thriller with a plot that contained plenty of drama and an interesting look at the place of ethics in the legal world. But most of all, it was a darn entertaining story.	2004-01-09

From here we are soon thrust into emotional turmoil as Marc finds out that his wife is dead and 6 month old daughter is missing. With this set-up its all systems go for a fast paced thriller to unfold.<br />When the ransom note is received from the kidnappers, he is warned not to notify the authorities and that he would be given \\"no second chance\\" if he didn't comply. Adding pressure to Marc is the realisation that the police may actually consider him a suspect in his wife's murder and daughter's abduction.<br />I think the supporting characters are a strong point of the book, too. The introduction of former FBI agent / former girlfriend Rachel Mills injects real confusion into the story as she brings along a secret past and raises all sorts of suspicions. Then there are the kidnappers, an odd couple of the truly unhinged variety that make you wonder how they've stayed free for so long. But the most memorable of the supporting characters is Verne, the scene stealing, gun loving redneck, who is quite willing to tell it like it is and blow the consequences.<br />Harlan Coben has once again stepped up and delivered an excellent thriller filled with an array of twists, poignant moments and cold, calculating killers. Although I'm desperately hanging out for another Myron Bolitar book, I'll still be satisfied to read more books like this.	2004-01-06

Breaking the reverie that comes with the rebuilding process is news that Vinnie's brother Tom is way overdue from a hunting expedition in Canada where he was to act as a guide. The two men decide to head north in a bid to track Tom's movements and try to find him. From here the story turns into a fight for survival in the wilds of North Canada.<br />As Alex and Vinnie uncover the story of what happened up at the hunting lodge, more questions come up than are answered. They realise too late that their lives have become endangered but can't work out why. Of course, they aren't given terribly long to work on the why part of the question because they are kept busy working overtime trying to save their own skins.<br />It's a tantalising thriller that had me guessing right up towards the very end. Thrown in with this are the wonderful descriptions of the untamed wilderness of Ontario that was brilliantly captured by Hamilton. I found the story compelling reading on more than just one level making it doubly enjoyable.	2004-01-03

The letter explains that the body of a missing woman has been buried on his property along with enough evidence to implicate him as the murderer. He has no choice but to obey the ensuing instructions given to him for fear that the police would be tipped off.<br />At breakneck speed, Thomas is sent west out into the desert to a fate unknown but powerless to disobey the orders given to him. What he finds when he arrives at his destination is a horror beyond his imagination and evil beyond his understanding. A warning to the easily disgusted, the scenes from this point on in the book may be a little too graphic for some.<br />The set up is top notch, but from the point where Thomas meets his tormentor, the story tends to run out of steam a little. As I said earlier, the scenes in the desert are graphic and particularly gruesome, but after awhile I started to feel a little bit numb to it, which was a bit of a worry. Nevertheless, I still couldn't turn the pages fast enough in getting to the big showdown of an ending and will be looking forward to Crouch's next thriller.	2004-01-03

The case is even more perplexing than usual because Walker's client is also the missing person and she hires him before she goes missing, knowing her disappearance is about to take place. Curious, no?<br />Amos Walker is your typical hardboiled detective, working alone out of a rundown office, drinking liberally from the whiskey bottle in the bottom drawer of his desk and ever ready with the wise cracks when confronted by the police. As well as this, he's just as capable with his fists as he is with a gun and is prepared to use either as is demonstrated to great effect throughout the book.<br />As is promised, Walker's client disappears, compelling him to commence the search for her. What he isn't prepared for is the number of dead bodies that he keeps tripping over along the way. There is also a question mark over his client's past, how she figures in the life of two important men: a dead judge and a leading union official. The case takes on a life of its own revealing a few unexpected twists on its way to a tremendous ending.<br />This is the kind of story that all private detective story readers would love and Amos Walker is the kind of private detective that keeps you coming back to the series. It's a well-put together story featuring a likeably hard-bitten protagonist.	2004-01-03

The case turns out to be part of a long, long night for Fortune as he conducts his search for his target, Jack Price. While on his trail, the body counts begins to grow with alarming rapidity leaving Fortune to unravel the mystery into who the murderer is and why were the murders committed.<br />Concentration is key in following the plot to this detective mystery.

The good news is, the rest of the book lives up to the early promise and provides a thrilling story that had me frantically turning pages.<br />A small company of computer whizzes who operate under the company name of Monkeewrench Inc are on the verge of releasing a sure fire hit of a computer game. It's called Serial Killer Detective and judging by the number of web-site hits, pre-release orders and prototype downloads, it's going to be a mega seller. The game itself displays murder scene photos and the player plays detective, gathering evidence in order to solve the case. The photos that make up the game are very distinctive, not to mention lifelike and seem to be one of the big attractions to the game. The Monkeewrench partners can almost see their wealth grow before their eyes.<br />But then the murders begin and when the murder scenes look almost exactly like the photos in the game all thoughts of future happiness and wealth for Mnkeewrench evaporates. Enter Minneapolis homicide detective Leo Magozzi, an instantly likable character and another of the strong points of the book. He leads the investigation into the murders, which number 2 before the comparison with the game is made. The big problem is there are a total of 20 murders in the game, which leaves a lot to go and a huge headache for Magozzi. Meanwhile, sheriff Michael Halloran is in the middle of investigating a double homicide in the small town of Calumet, Wisconsin. How on earth is this related to what's going on in Minneapolis?<br />A tremendously suspenseful story is the result as the police seem powerless to stop the murders from taking place, even though they seem to have enough information to stop them. And when we find out that the Monkeewrench people have been through this sort of thing before, well, it gets even more intriguing.	2003-12-19

It's a subtle story made up of many unsubtle scenes and it's only when you get to the end that you realise that every major event was determined due to some racist discussion or action.<br />It's Los Angeles 1953 and we are focussed on two main protagonists. The first is Lionel Walk, or Train, as he is more commonly known. Train is a young black man who works at the exclusive Brookline Country Club. We follow his fortunes first as a caddy and then as a greenkeeper and later as his relationship and feelings of responsibility for a fellow caddy known as Plural. The other is Detective Sergeant Miller Packard, an incredibly enigmatic man who seems to exude authority and confidence. He always appears to be in total control of every situation right up to the moment he loses the handle with disastrous consequences.<br />Their paths cross a number of times and although these encounters proved mutually beneficial to both men, there always seemed to be an unsatisfactory ending whenever they parted. Scenes of quiet amusement are followed by scenes of extreme violence wrenching the emotions from empathy to sympathy in an instant.<br />I had a problem with the ending, feeling it was wrapped up incredibly quickly and leaving way too many questions unanswered for my liking.

In fact her philosophy is summed up right there on page 1 of the book when she says:<br /><br />\\"What's the point in being nice to someone who can't remember how nice you've been? Tell me that. The only point in doing someone a favour is if they remember and do you a favour back.\\"<br />She's no saint and is happy to let everyone know. You get a pretty good idea how she came about that philosophy when she actually does a favour for someone and then is promptly plagued by one problem after the other as a result. When a local prostitute is murdered, the girl's sister and a few of the other local prostitutes come to Eva to ask her to teach them self defence. They figure Eva would be a good choice owing to one of her jobs as a professional wrestler, where she fights under the guise of The London Lassassin. Of course, Eva's first response is a resounding \\"Sod off!!\\" until the mention of a financial incentive is forthcoming. In a very entertaining chain of events, Eva's life begins to crumble around her.<br />This second book admirably complements the first (Bucket Nut) with Eva's defiance still the overwhelming emotion. Liza Cody's heroine from her other series of books, Anna Lee, becomes a little more prominent in this book, much to Eva's disgust. Although for the most part, the story is a humorous one, there is an underlying tone of desperation and the beginning of despair. But it doesn't seem to matter what's thrown up against her, Eva still manages to get by with her own unique rationale.	2003-12-14
867262:US	47964988	R21PGMVQ00AV7R	1551669285	373840166	The Soul Catcher (Maggie O'Dell Novels)	Books	2	3	5	N	N	Mundane and predictable	This is the 3rd book in the series featuring FBI agent Maggie O'Dell. The best that can be said about the book is that at least it reveals a little bit more about O'Dell's past, giving us a little bit more of an idea of what motivates Maggie O'Dell the person. However, this comes on the back of a fairly mundane and predictable thriller.<br />The story starts out with a standoff between the FBI and a group of heavily armed cult members. As the story progresses the cult plays a major role as murders keep occurring wherever the members get together for their rallies. Maggie finds that her interest in the cult, and particularly in their leader, Reverend Everett, is going to be a lot more personal than she would have first imagined.<br />Unfortunately this type of book has been done many times before and a lot more believably too. I had the killer pegged before I was halfway through the book and had to wait for O'Dell to catch up. All in all, I found this entry in the series to be a disappointment and easily the weakest of the series so far.	2003-12-12

This is the story of how he realised that dream and how he came to earn the respect of his peers, which was one of the few things in life he valued. It seems that it didn't matter how good or bad someone was according to Eddie, if they complimented him on his driving, then they were okay in his book.<br />Eddie makes a very interesting character. He was a mixture of extreme naivety when it came to common emotional issues, but he had an instinctive cunning when it came to survival. It gives him a much deeper level of complexity than was first apparent and is one of the great strengths of the book.<br />I found this to be a very quick read and is modelled off the old pulps of yesteryear, both in external appearance and in content. The writing is succinct and to the point and the story moves along at great pace before reaching a shattering conclusion.	2003-12-09

This is achieved by changing perspective from chapter to chapter with the title of the chapter given to the character doing the talking. It's also following a timeline that counts down to a zero hour scenario that gives the feeling of building to a tremendous crescendo. It's very effective.<br />The two men telling the story are Max Iversson and John Gallan. Max Iversson is a former soldier, first with the army and then as a mercenary who now works as a personal bodyguard. He finds himself wanted by the police when a protection job goes horribly wrong. He realises he had been set up and wasn't supposed to have survived and now is desperate to find out who set him up and why, while still avoiding apprehension by the law. John Gallan is that law, working as a Detective Sergeant in CID; he is trying to investigate an unrelated murder when Iversson's name and business begin popping up throughout the investigation.<br />Mixed into the story and the lives of the two protagonists is an organised rime family, the Holtz family, and as with most stories involving organised crime, drugs, prostitutes and violence make their appearance. Iversson is pretty sure that it was the Holtz family that was involved in the set up, so he's trying to find out why, as well as working out a way to get some sort of revenge. Gallan is pretty sure the Holtz family was somehow involved in the murder that he is working on and so he begins to tangle with them. The Holtz family is known to be ruthless towards anyone who crosses them no matter who they are, setting up a tremendous showdown as it becomes obvious that they're all going to meet somehow. The results are not going to be pretty.<br />I like my thrillers to come with a fast-paced storyline carrying plenty of action sequences, which usually equates to full on violence.This book certainly fills that bill. The bad guys are ruthless, so are some of the good guys providing a no-holds-barred battle to the death. It's a terrific follow-up to Kernick's first book, The Business of Dying, with a character or two making a return appearance here.	2003-12-09

She lives in a trailer as a security guard in a spare parts yard with two vicious guard dogs. She has very definite ideas about all aspects of life and if you don't agree with them, well, you can just sod off.<br />This was an extremely interesting book for a couple of reasons. The first is that the protagonist is not your usual likable character who wins us over despite a couple of flaws. She actually challenges us, time and again over decisions she's made and thoughts she's had. She's abrasive, rude and continually \\"narked\\", and for all of that you still feel yourself cheering for her. The second is her job, or jobs actually, a wrestler, a part-time security guard, a part-time courier for a shady character and a part-time bouncer. There's never a dull moment when Eva's around.<br />Bucket Nut is the first of only three books in the Eva Wylie series, a bittersweet fact. Only 3 books in the series will have me wishing there were more, but I'm pleased to have the other 2 books ahead of me. This is definitely one of those books that leave you wanting to read more.	2003-12-06

They are a wonderful addition to the Daniel Kearny Associates series if you've read the novels or, if you haven't, are the perfect introduction to the detectives who make up the company.<br />I think the real bonus to this book comes in two standout features. The first is the introduction by Joe Gores. In it he explains how the fiction Daniel Kearny Associates mirrors the real-life Dave Kikkert and Associates repo/P.I firm that Gores used to work for. He also reveals who his characters are modelled after including which character is based on him. The second feature is the preface to every story explaining how he came to write it, the events from which it was based and some interesting facts surrounding it. These prefaces certainly add another dimension to the stories.<br />As for the stories, each of them is more or less an account of a file involving a repo, a skip trace or a delinquent debtor. They are all somewhat out of the norm which is what makes them interesting reading. Take for example having to repossess a fire engine or a hearse, cases that spice up the life of a repo man and make for some very entertaining moments.<br />I've read all the DKA Files novels and this book of short stories was the perfect way to recap. There is the odd reference to events from the books thrown in which reminded me how much I enjoyed reading them. Crippen and Landru Publishers have done a superb job in putting the book together and have even included a checklist at the end of the book listing not only all of Gores' other books, but all of his short stories and when and where they appeared, his screenplays and television scripts too.	2003-11-29

Bob Jones is a well-educated black man who has left university to work as a leaderman in a shipbuilding factory. He has a steady girlfriend who comes from an upper middleclass family, a brand new car and good prospects. But he is fighting a daily rage that is being stoked by the constant racism and segregation that was common for the day.<br />When Bob is demoted after a run-in with a white woman at work he is barely able to control his emotions, imagining all sorts of reprisals. The shame and humiliation mixed with outrage are strong but they are tempered with the fear of consequences should he try to do anything about it.<br />Chester Himes' first novel is an extremely compelling tale of injustice as Bob's world inevitably falls apart. The helplessness is vividly portrayed as Bob's dreams are continually beaten down for no other reason than the colour of his skin and the urge to fight back is so strong it's palpable.	2003-11-28

It's dark, brooding and introspective, often violent with a loner protagonist who seems to be taking on the world. Essentially, it contains all the elements of noir at its best.<br />It's important to note that although this is his first book, it's actually the sequel to THE POISONED ROSE and will probably be more fully appreciated if it's read second. At least that's the order that I read them and was thankful that I did due to the numerous references to events from THE POISONED ROSE.<br />To quickly summarise the story, Declan (call me Mac) MacManus is just scraping by with a minimum wage job and a police chief who is out to get him. Supposedly to help Mac out, private investigator Frank Gannon offers him a surveillance job that he is to take with his long-time friend, Augie. Mac knows better than to get involved with Frank Gannon, but takes the job against his better instincts, reasoning that he is helping Augie out.<br />While on the surveillance job they witness a car accident that looks suspiciously as though it was no accident and quickly involve themselves but cannot save the driver of the car. Augie watches the police investigate the accident but isn't convinced that they did anything more than clean up the mess, so he starts to investigate himself.<br />It's as a direct result of this extra involvement that all hell breaks loose for Mac and Augie. They are each ambushed by unknown assailants in separate incidents; the result for Augie sees him charged with manslaughter as he was a little too proficient in defending himself. As for Mac, apart from being ambushed, he's set-up, hunted and almost killed (a number of times) while firstly trying to find out why the car accident happened and then as he tried to gather evidence to help Augie beat the manslaughter charge.<br />There is a strong sense that Mac is simply surviving from one encounter to the next and only managing that through sheer willpower. This is a dark thriller in which you've got to grit your teeth and hope that the right people manage to survive. As a lover of noir fiction I enjoyed this story immensely.	2003-11-25

She appears concerned for here safety, not allowing McGee to turn any lights on and continually checking over her shoulder as if someone might be following her. It turns out she is carrying a large sum of money that she asks McGee to hide for her. She adds to the intrigue by instructing him that should anything happen to her, he was to get in touch with her sister and give the money to her. <br />Inevitably she is killed a week later prompting McGee to take The Busted Flush and his neighbour and regular party fiend, Meyer south to Bayside to try to find out what happened to her.<br />What he and Meyer stumble into is an amateur marijuana smuggling racket that is starting to get out of hand. While McGee is stirring the hornets nest bodies begin to pile up at an alarming rate. He plays the avenging white knight to perfection here without becoming overly sentimental or judgemental; he simply does what he has to do, taking his bruises in the process. <br />The inclusion of his fellow Lauderdale resident and party buddy on this particular caper adds a nice balance to Travis' usual introspection. They each bounce their deep philosophies off the other keeping both each other and us amused. A fast moving Travis McGee is a good Travis McGee and this one certainly zips by with alacrity.	2003-11-24

The members of the Derbyshire Constabulary, E Division are called on to work the case, although Ben Cooper has been loaned out to the Rural Crimes Team and Diane Fry is investigating a 2-year-old missing persons case, separating the duelling coppers.<br />The story centres around the tiny hamlet of Withens leading both Cooper and Fry there on their separate investigations. The murder victim is a young local man named Neil Granger. Granger is part of a large family that makes up the majority of the residents of Withens. It's Ben's job to interview the residents but like so many isolated close-knit communities they are particularly suspicious of outsiders, and this lot are especially suspicious when it comes to the police. Ben can't help but think they are hiding something but doesn't know what.<br />Meanwhile, there is one old couple in Withens, the Renshaws, who are more than happy to talk. The problem is, the only topic of conversation is their daughter Emma, who went missing 2 years ago. The Renshaws talk of Emma in the present tense, expecting her to walk through their door at any moment, much to Diane Fry's bemusement.<br />Because of Ben Cooper's secondment to the Rural Crimes Team, Diane has had to use the ever hungry and source of numerous lighter moments, Gavin Murfin. Murfin is taking an increasingly prominent role as the series progresses and is a nice counterpoint to Fry's more dour by the book attitude.<br />This series is getting stronger and stronger with each new book and the characters of Ben Cooper and Diane Fry are developing nicely. If you're after an exceedingly enjoyable police procedural, I strongly recommend this one. In my opinion, this is the best of the series so far.	2003-11-20

Fletcher and Cragg are a couple of drifter con men types who seem to have a knack of attracting trouble. Fletcher is a fast-talking character who fancies himself as a bit of a detective, while Cragg is his muscle-bound partner. Their favourite way of making a fast buck is to peddle books on the street, titled \\"Every Man A Samson\\", Fletcher doing the talking and Cragg displaying his power, thanks to the book.<br />In this book, Fletcher and Cragg are locked out of their apartment for failure to pay their rent. They eventually manage to gain entry, hoping to grab their belongings and go when they find something in their room that they're sure they didn't leave there. A dead body.<br />Along with the body they also find a rare coin and this leads them to search for some answers to some specific questions. Who's the dead guy? Who killed him? How can they convince the police they didn't kill him? Where did the coin come from? Are there any more? How can they best profit from the situation? This provides ample opportunity for Johnny to run his little scams as he gathers information evades the law and solves the mystery.<br />This is on the lighter side of hardboiled with Fletcher and Cragg making a very off-beat yet entertaining couple of detectives.	2003-11-18

And the news is good because the second book in the series is already in the works.<br />Sam Kincaid agrees to take a case that looks like it could be poison from the start. A 13-year-old prostitute and heroin addict has been raped, severely beaten and left for dead by a couple of men. Even though the girl can positively identify one of her attackers, the fact that she's a prostitute and may have been under the influence of drugs at the time will mean the jury may be unsympathetic to say the least. Sam puts a case together regardless and pretty soon the evidence begins building and the case looks stronger all the time. It's only halfway through the trial that things begin to go wrong and the case doesn't look quite so clear cut after all.<br />This really is a particularly good legal thriller and the fact that it's a debut novel only makes it all the more commendable. Through Sam we are stepped through the legal procedure as seen from the D.A.'s perspective. This could have been quite tedious and boring, but in this case, the telling was anything but. As for the mystery, I thought it was very well constructed, complete with a clever twist or two at the end.	2003-11-17

Then he comes across a body, obviously murdered, lying in the divorcees garage and things start to get really interesting.<br />Mason has to set up a couple of brilliant deceptions to avoid being implicated in the murder when it looks as though the evidence is beginning to stack up against him - evidence such as his fingerprint on the murder weapon and an eyewitness who saw him at the garage around the time of the murder. Once again, the courtroom scenes are very entertaining as Perry Mason weaves his usual magic, trying to prove himself innocent as well as his client.	2003-11-14

It's a \\"save the world\\" thriller that provides an edge of the seat ride and I enjoyed it.<br />To give you a quick outline of the plot, it's 2009 and technology has made some notable advancements, one of which is in the field of nanotechnology. Nonotechnology has made artificial intelligence a reality and the first example of a computer using it is called Sorceress. Sorceress \\"lives\\" inside Goliath, a huge submarine shaped like a stingray. As a fighting machine, Goliath has no peers, moving almost silently through the water at tremendous speed and containing a deadly arsenal of torpedos and nuclear missiles. But it's Sorceress that makes Goliath all the more dangerous, because she controls the ship and can detect and repel danger in an instant. From very early in the story we get an idea as to just how deadly Goliath can be.<br />The heroes of the story are Gunnar Wolfe and Rochelle \\"Rocky\\" Jackson, who were both involved in the design and development of Goliath before it was stolen from the US Department of Defence. It's up to them to somehow stop this killing machine before it destroys the world. Meanwhile, with every passing second Sorceress is gaining more knowledge and power and even more frighteningly, is becoming self-aware.<br />As I said earlier, it's a thrill ride based on the assumption that artificial intelligence becomes reality. For another look at a story dealing with artificial intelligence and one that makes an interesting comparison, you could also try Footprints Of God by Greg Iles.	2003-11-13

He has reached the pinnacle with regard to power and wealth, and so he hungrily casts around for international avenues to expand his drug dealing empire. His specific target is Sarajevo in war-ravaged Bosnia.<br />Joey Cann is the most junior member of the Customs and Excise team who are investigating Mister in the hopes of bringing him down. Yet he is chosen to follow Mister to Bosnia to Bosnia with the mission being the gathering of intelligence that may help to incriminate him. To help Joey, who has never been out of England, let alone to a war-ravaged, dangerous country, he is teamed up with Maggie Bolton, a communications expert. Not only that, she is also wise to the ways of Sarajevo and reluctantly, acts as Joey's minder.<br />While this main story of dangerous hide and seek unfolds, we are treated to a chronicle of atrocities carried on over the war years in a small Bosnian valley. We learn how the war affected a pair of neighbours and how their land was turned into a deadly minefield. This background story brings to life the grim realities of war and the terrible, lasting toll it takes on innocent people. I felt that this parallel story gave amazing insight into the way war affects everyone and also, just how lasting the effects are on those who are directly touched by it.<br />I wouldn't call this a thriller or a mystery book. Rather, it is a book of suspense where the hunter appears to be hopelessly underpowered against a ruthless, cold and malicious quarry. You know that one false step will bring a devastating retribution. It's a powerful book and well worth reading.	2003-11-11

The murderer could have been any one of 5 people who were in the house at the time. The prime suspect is Billy, an adopted son of the baby's father. Billy is such a likely suspect because he has long shown signs of a tendency towards pathological behaviour. For this reason, Dr Frank Clevenger is asked to come and talk to Billy to give his opinion on whether he thought it probable that Billy was the killer.<br />While he is at the house of the murdered baby, Clevenger talks with the other family members and quickly decides that the prime suspect isn't the only one with the psychological profile of a killer. Added to the list are: the billionaire businessman, head of the family and overly dominant father figure; the beautiful younger (2nd-) wife, mother of the dead baby with a history of depression; the eldest son, also adopted and driven hard to strive for high achievement by his father; and finally, the pretty nanny who seems to be the primary caregiver to more than just the babies.<br />So Clevenger has to dig through the minds of the family members to work out whether Billy is the murderer, as has been accused, or whether it was someone else and Billy is being brilliantly set up.<br />I didn't find this book quite as compelling as the first couple of books in the series, although the frailties of the human mind are laid bare in fascinating detail. Certainly, one of the strongest aspects of the series is the substantial character descriptions and development. The past of Frank Clevenger continues to be revealed and just when I thought I knew all about him, a little more of his shocking past is told.	2003-11-11

Basing a series around a professional bodyguard could have led to a one-dimensional plot being repeated book after book, but this is far from the case and each book has pushed the boundaries of both interest and excitement and this one is definitely no exception.<br />The story starts out as business as usual for Kodiak and his partners as they go about the job of providing protection for their clients. They have been fortunate of late, guarding some high profile clients and the result has been plenty of publicity which has then generated even more business. The downside is that they have now lost the anonymity they would prefer to perform their job. Adding to their raised profile is the release of a book which roars up the best-seller lists. The book is about the events that took place in one of Rucka's earlier book (SMOKER) when Kodiak fought off repeated attacks by an assassin known as Drama.<br />Kodiak receives news that Drama is on the move again, making her way towards New York City. Thinking that the release of the book has prompted Drama to strike, this news chills everyone to the core. The thought that Drama could strike at any time should she choose sets everyone on edge and provides for tension packed operations. From this point on the story becomes packed with unexpected surprises and twists that would be ruined if I attempted to describe them here. Suffice to say, I enjoyed every moment of where the story of Atticus Kodiak headed providing a fast-paced thriller that is compelling reading.	2003-11-10

Their heartbreaking grief and despair is captured in a few powerful pages and gives us the motivation that drives Tim for the rest of the book. To add to their misery, the man who committed the murder is allowed to walk free thanks to a loophole in the legal system. <br />As a highly trained Special Forces officer turned Deputy Marshall, Tim has the power and the opportunity to exact any form of revenge he chooses on his daughter's murderer, but refrains from doing so when he learns that an accomplice may have been involved. Meanwhile, his marriage is being ripped apart as Tim and Andrea try to come to terms with the loss of their daughter. Just when it looks as though the marriage is beyond salvation and after he quits his job, he is approached by a man offering him a chance at some measure of revenge, luring him in with the possibility that he will also get a shot of finding the mysterious accomplice.<br />Essentially, what Tim is asked to do is join a group of vigilantes, calling themselves The Commission, who are aiming to serve their own justice on criminals who they consider have escaped penalty due to shortcomings in the legal system. Of course, Tim accepts and the action takes off from there as candidates are assessed and their fate is decided, with the penalty to be meted out by Tim.<br />This is a tremendously fast-paced book that highlights the way in which severe emotional situations can skew the judgement of even the most level-headed thinkers. I had a great time reading this book, finding it both thought provoking and white-knuckle thrilling.	2003-11-10

Fair, produced a rather unusual, but highly entertaining private investigator series known as The Unlikely Duo series. THE BIGGER THEY COME is the first book in the series featuring Bertha Cool and Donald Lam.<br />Meet Donald Lam, he's a private detective or at least, he is by the end of the book. A more unlikely looking P.I. you'll never meet, as he is constantly reminded. At 5 and a half feet tall and 127 pounds, he's simply not intimidating at all. But what he lacks in brawn he more than makes up for in brains, a fact that is not lost on his new employer, Bertha Cool of the B.L. Cool Agency, was sharp enough to spot.<br />Now, Bertha Cool is also not the most likely head figure of a detective agency, although physically impressive she most certainly is. She's sixty-something with grey hair, sparkling eyes and a grandmotherly expression. She weighs in at over 300 pounds and is described as having the majesty of a snow capped mountain and the assurance of a steamroller.<br />When Lam gets the job he is put to work immediately because if there's one thing Bertha Cool believes in it's getting her money's worth. His first job is to serve divorce papers on Morgan Birks, husband of Sandra Birks who claims he has been abusing her. It seems a straightforward enough job, and it is. But it's only after the papers have been served that the real fireworks begin. It's in the moments of confusion that quickly follow a seemingly successful job that Lam's genius is uncovered as he works his way through deduction after deduction and then comes up with a brilliant solution that is as impressive in it's cunning as it is in it's simplicity.<br />As the first book of a series of 29, it provides a terrific start combining an interesting duo with a clever mystery. With the promise of many more such stories to follow, it's bound to leave you begging for more.	2003-11-04

It's deeply moving and occasionally depressing in it's true to life issues.<br />The story is initially told from private investigator Bridgette Logan's viewpoint. Until now we didn't know a lot about Bridgette other than she was tattooed, body pierced and constantly ate altoids and lifesavers. Her past was filled in with a lot of detail, bringing her fully to life and promoting her to one of the main players in the series.<br />Bridgette is asked by a friend for protection from her abusive estranged husband. The husband is heavily into the drug business, a world in which the friend is desperate to escape. Bridgette agrees to help, but in doing so, puts herself at risk of losing herself to an addiction she had fought hard to overcome.<br />This is a poignantly told story that deals with the dark world of the drug addict and the drug supplier and the constant battle with addiction. This is a terrific addition to the series with the character development of Bridgette Logan a real plus.	2003-11-03

Meanwhile the snow is falling and is creating havoc is a town that seems to be going through a bit of a crime wave. Beatings, missing children and a couple of dead bodies are discovered in the snow, one going unidentified and the other prompting more questions than are answered. On top of this comes an unusually high level of interest in a 57-year-old wartime plane crash that had taken place just outside of town. How had the plane crashed? Whatever became of the pilot? Why is there so much interest in it now after all this time?<br />Detective Constable Ben Cooper is still the hardworking, under appreciated officer who is more than willing to take on any task assigned to him. His immediate superior Detective Sergeant Diane Fry is still the antagonistic outsider who resents Cooper's popularity and hardworking ethics. Surely something's got to give between these two sometime.<br />This excellent series of books is continued by yet another strong entry. Powerful writing gives the feeling of being placed within sight of the beautiful peaks around Edendale.	2003-10-30

It's an honest to goodness sequel too, with the story from Denial recalled many times along with events and characters, who come back to play significant roles. The bottom line is: you'd better read Denial before reading Projection.<br />Like in Denial, Projection is another gritty suspense thriller, packed with more than its fair share of grisly scenes that will be sure to turn the stomach of the squeamish reader - just a fair warning.<br />The story begins with the trial of a doctor suspected of committing a series of murders, but who is pleading insanity. When the doctor is taken back to the asylum for the criminally insane, where he is to be held overnight, he somehow gets free and takes over the asylum, holding the doctors, nurses and fellow inmates hostage. The doctor is convinced that Satan has taken over the bodies of just about everyone around him and his solution is to perform \\"operations\\" on whomever he can get his hands on to rid them of Satan's presence. Disturbingly, he believes his own body is controlled by Satan too and, well, you'd better read for yourself how he solves that little problem.<br />Frank Clevenger, still feeling guilty over past events and still battling his own demons, is forced to become involved in the situation, witnesses some of the depraved actions of the lunatic who has taken over the asylum, but is powerless to stop him. As a psychologist, it's up to Clevenger to work out a way to get inside the doctor's mind to coax him out of the asylum without harming the hostages.<br />It's another strong entry in a series that doesn't hold back when it comes to describing what would be considered the more distasteful side of the human psyche. It's shocking, but it definitely draws you in, as a good thriller just about always does.	2003-10-28

Kodiak is a bodyguard, but specialises in the business, running his own company and employing his own team of professionals. It's an interesting take on the mystery theme that strays just far enough from the pack to make it unusually interesting reading.<br />In his first outing, Kodiak and his employees are hired to protect a doctor who performs abortions. She is constantly harassed by protestors and the situation provides numerous difficulties for Kodiak to overcome. To top things off, she's due to speak at a conference in a couple of days where she will be left wide open for attack. It quickly becomes clear the danger she faces is most certainly real and Kodiak is going to be stretched to the limit if he's going to keep her safe.<br />This is an excellent debut that comes across as very fresh. The bodyguard angle puts a new slant on the protection caper that is usually covered by police or FBI. The characters are likable and realistic and the action rolls along at great pace.	2003-09-27

His plots are outlandish and ridiculous, his dialogue is...well, laughably pathetic and his heroes are annoyingly sanctimonious, but I'm still hooked on them all. They're worth their weight in gold just for the action and head-snapping pace. <br />And so it goes with WHITE DEATH. In this book Kurt and Joe are up against an environmental disaster thanks to some genetically modified &quot;frankenfish&quot;. Starting on the Faroes Islands and then zipping over to the Canadian wilderness, there seems to be a lot of unusual behavior and unaccountable missing fish in the vicinity of certain fish farms, and these fish farms all seem to belong to one mysterious conglomerate, Oceanus. As with many of Kurt Austin's opponents, these &quot;evil-doers&quot; prefer to take the aggressive form of defense and merely succeed in arousing Austin's wrath. This is always a serious mistake when dealing with a Cussler hero.<br />Of course, there is the usual evil megalomaniac who makes the usual cliched mistakes. Of course, there are the usual last-minute death-defying escapes. Of course, there is the usual stunningly gorgeous, though exceedingly brilliant woman who just happens to fall for Kurt. Of course, I zipped through the book and will be lining up for the next one (ain't I a tragic?) <br />So yeah, nothing's changed, substitute Dirk for Kurt, Al for Joe and whammo, you've got yourself a new series. This is one of the weaker NUMA Files adventures, going a little heavier than usual on the cheesiness, but if you're a Clive Cussler fan, I think you'll be satisfied, if you're not I would suggest starting on the Dirk Pitt series instead.	2003-09-15

Frank Clevenger is a forensic psychologist, although it's the weakness of his own mind that becomes startlingly apparent.<br />The books begins with a gruesome murder that seems open and shut after a suspect, covered in the victim's blood, is found with the body. The suspect, however, is schizophrenic and may not be mentally fit to stand trial. This is where Clevenger is called into the case to assess the suspect.<br />From the opening pages, though, it's obvious that all is not well with Clevenger as he reveals the vices to which he is a slave. And it's not just one or two that has hold of him, you can take your pick from drugs, alcohol, sex or gambling. If it's self-destructive, he's got it covered.<br />As the story unfolds we explore the early life of Frank Clevenger and what happened to him to make him the man he is today. But the character development doesn't stop with him, each and every character that has a role in the story is analysed and their mind is laid bare for us to see. The effects of child abuse on the adult, years later, is the harsh underlying theme and is brought to life in a starkly realistic way. Although some of the scenes may be distasteful to some, the scenario rings all too truly and is presented well, within the context of the story.	2003-09-04

The problem being, these criminal elements provide the bulk of the paper's advertising revenue and would take a dim view of reading about their own activities in the paper.  Protagonist Mike Dolan becomes increasingly frustrated with this attitude, so much so, he quits his job and seeks another avenue of bringing the cities corrupt to the public eye. Dolan wants to make a difference, he believes that he can write the kind of expose stories that will actually fight corruption and put some people behind bars.<br />His solution is to start his own magazine, which he names The Cosmopolite and plans to make it a magazine that won't be afraid to tell it like it is. In fact, he sub-titles the magazine with the words \\"The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth\\". So intent is he on revealing the truth and seeing that the guilty are exposed, he completely ignores the fact that the toes that he steps on belong to some pretty mean people who won't be willing to stand by and be exposed without fighting back. Undeterred, he determinedly continues to produce his magazine, living by the phrase, \\"publish and be damned\\".<br />Written so many years ago (in 1937), yet the issues raised here are just as relevant today as they were then. Freedom of speech, racism, abortion, corruption in big business, are all still big issues that only the reckless or very courageous are willing to speak out about.	2003-08-26

It's a terrific example of noir fiction. It's violent, gritty and tough, exploring the dark underbelly of a corrupt city.<br />Beginning with a prison breakout and re-establishment back into his life of crime, Ralph proves to be a violent, self-centred man. His life revolves around making money, and if that means robbery and murder is involved, then so be it. He is joined by Holiday, a jealous, suspicious and spiteful gangster's moll of low-morals who is prepared to sleep with any man who walks through her door, and Jinx, a small time crook happy to hang on to the coattails of Ralph's criminal genius. They are all a group of criminals who are anything but reliable, willing to rat each other out for any price. <br /> The unnamed city in which the book is set is filled with corruption, from the criminals themselves to the crooked cops who police it. The grab for money is intense and morals are non-existent.<br />As with all noir stories, there are no good or nice characters, most of them are pretty repugnant people, and there is no chance of even a remotely happy ending.	2003-08-20

But also a wonderfully plotted and characterised story that poignantly displays a man who has done the best he could with the lot he was given.<br />Eddie is a bar-room piano player at Harriet's Hut where he has quietly and unobtrusively played for 3 years. One night his criminal brother staggers into the bar, desperate for Eddie's help. He is being chased by a couple of gangster-types and unwillingly, Eddie is drawn into the chase.<br />From that point on, we begin to learn all about this quiet and unassuming man. We soon realise that there is a lot more to him than is first realised and, having endeared him to us, we are snapped back to the present and the trouble that is visited upon him be his brother.<br />There's plenty to like about the story's characters too: from the tough, overweight broad who owns the bar, to her common-law husband, an ex-wrestler who works as the bar's bouncer, and the femme fatale, a brazen waitress who plays a wonderful counterpoint to the introspective Eddie.<br />There really is nothing left to say than to highly recommend this book as a special example of noir fiction. It's certainly well worth reading.	2003-08-12

Jim Vanning is facing a grim future. He is being pursued by gangsters and police in relation to a robbery and a murder. We come in on the story as Vanning feels the net closing in tightly around him, but we are also given the feeling that he doesn't have the answer to the question that everyone will want to know. Where is the money?<br />The story is stark and grim as Vanning's predicament appears hopeless. His obvious feelings of helplessness are portrayed vividly as he searches around for a way to clear his name. <br />Although it's written in a spare style, Goodis doesn't waste a word as he concentrates on painting Vanning into a corner, he still manages to find time to introduce us to his all-important peripheral characters, Fraser the cop, John the gangster and Martha the love interest. All are integral to the outcome of the mystery and are given just enough attention to make them interesting.	2003-08-06

We join the story as 52 year old Rae newborn is waving goodbye to her family after being dropped off on a deserted island. On this island she plans to rebuild a house that had originally been built by her great uncle. She also hopes to rebuild herself after fighting her way through severe depression.<br />During construction of the house we learn all about Rae's past, the reasons behind her depression and her fears. We also learn about her great uncle Desmond and the mystery surrounding his life and death.<br />But while everything appears to be progressing well, we get a sense that something is not quite right. Someone appears to be trying to find her and she continues to get the feeling she is being watched, but is never sure whether that's part of her mental problems or that it's actually happening.<br />Suspense builds steadily with some remarkable discoveries taking place. I found the last 100 pages or so were filled with unexpected twists and revelations. This is a very enjoyable book containing a terrific story of discovery and renewal coupled with a very interesting mystery and tense finale.	2003-08-04

The result of this search is a visit from a couple of DEA agents. The agents convince Reacher in taking part in an undercover operation, starting us on a tense and dangerous story. <br />While the DEA agents are hoping to make a bust and crack a major crime ring, Reacher's motives are much more personal. He's out to finish something, and someone, that began 10 years ago. But to achieve either goal he has to successfully infiltrate the enemy's formidable defences, a property perched on a peninsula of land, cut off from the rest of the world by both isolation and fences.<br />As with the earlier Reacher books, this one is dominated by the ever-capable Reacher making snap decisions that more often than not are right and are also guaranteed to provide plenty of action sequences. Jack Reacher is such a refreshing character because he has no compunction to take whatever action is necessary to eliminate danger. This results in a full-on action-packed story that never gets bogged down with moralising over actions. Pure escapism at it's best.	2003-05-15

Gone is the playful, eyebrow wiggling, wisecracking detective and in his place is a more introspective desperate man. Of course, the case he is working on has a lot to do with this after his girlfriend's son, 10 year old Ben, is kidnapped.<br />During the desperate search for clues as to who has taken Ben we are treated to a detailed look into Elvis' past. The emphasis is definitely on a sober accounting of his past as his actions of many years ago are called into question. Meanwhile, back to the present day, Elvis not only has to deal with the kidnappers, he is hampered from all sides by just about everyone, from the Hollywood detectives, to his girlfriend's ex-husband. He finds an ally in one of the detectives, Carol Starkey, the protagonist in an earlier Crais book, Demolition Angel.<br />I thought this was an excellent and much needed get to know you story for all long time Elvis Cole fans. It probably won't mean as much to those who've never tried an Elvis Cole book before, but it still contains a fine thriller that should satisfy most readers.	2003-04-30

This is no ordinary work of fiction. The first thought I had while reading it, apart from \\"Man this is hilarious\\", was how much it reminded me of Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers Guide series. But this goes oh so much further. No classic work of fiction is safe and any famous fictional character may be deputised and added to the story.<br />We're talking about a parallel universe of incredible detail and vast imagination. Where dodos are pets, Tasmanian tigers are watchdogs and the annual mammoth migration is a major tourist attraction. Thursday Next is our protagonist and is able to read her way into books, yes that's right, actually INTO the story itself. But she has made some enemies who are capable of doing some pretty despicable things to cultivate their acts of revenge.<br />This is a wild, hilarious ride in which anything is possible, there is always something happening (nothing is mentioned for no reason), and the fun is endless. From time travel to Gravitube rides to visits through the pages of Kafka and Dickens, even the possibility of the end of the world this book's got it all.<br />I urge anyone who loves a good laugh and reads for the whimsical pleasure of transporting themselves via the written world to another time and place to get lost in this good book. You won't regret it for a second.	2003-04-30

The case is baffling to say the least. So far, 3 women have been found dead in their bathtubs and the killer has left absolutely no clues behind, including how the women were murdered.<br />This is a tense battle of wills between Reacher and the FBI agents, with continual antagonism between them setting the boundaries. This turns to frustration as Reacher comes up with theories that he presents to the FBI, only to have them repeatedly rejected. It turns into a battle on two fronts as Reacher is up against a killer who is sure to kill again and the FBI who seem incapable of accepting his ideas. <br />The Jack Reacher books are frantic action thrillers starring a protagonist who is ultra-capable and prepared to push boundaries, whether its legal or moral. This particular book is no exception, although the pace does tend to get hampered by the unwelcome intervention of the FBI.	2003-04-18

Or at least he would, if only his job wouldn't keep intruding on his family.<br />Scully seeks revenge on the killer of a hooker, murdered after he had tracked her down for one of his information sources. He is driven by a sense of guilt and responsibility. His most likely is an East Coast mobster who is trying to move in on the Hollywood scene by controlling the movie industry's unions. His method of attack is to go undercover as, of all things, a movie producer. His eyes are well and truly opened and a lot of fun is poked at the Hollywood movie industry when production begins on his movie (which is never meant to get made) and expenses begin to rocket out of control. <br />A parallel story involves an escalating gang-war that his wife (and boss) Alexa, who is head of the Detective Services Group is trying to calm. It soon becomes apparent that the two stories are going to overlap, but how and to what effect remains the mystery.<br />This is another compelling mystery that takes you from the extravagance of the Hollywood movie scene, right down to the mean streets of LA and the gangs who inhabit them. Plenty of action and a grandstand finish helps to make it a very enjoyable read. It has also left plenty of scope for a future Shane Scully book.	2003-03-24

Ok, Ok, he's won 3 Edgar Awards and all, but still you don't hear his name mentioned too often when asking for recommendations. His DKA Files series are full of action, humour, cons and scams and in short are pure entertainment. Well, no matter, I've discovered him now and I'm here to tell you that the series, and 32 Cadillacs in particular, is one that's not to be missed.<br />For the first time, the DKA Agency is pitted in a head-to-head battle with San Francisco's Gypsy community following a Gypsy scam that had netted a grand total of 31 Cadillacs. This is a once-in-a-lifetime job, recover the 31 Caddys for a nicely negotiated fat fee. But the Gypsies are crafty specialists of the long con and are exceedingly difficult to track down, so the recovery process will require the DKA team to use every resource available as well as every underhanded trick in the book.<br />To give you a head start, I'll introduce you to the central DKA characters. They are, Dan Kearny, Giselle Marc, Patrick O'Bannon, Larry Ballard and Bart Heslip. And two new characters are added to the staff, Trin Morales, a sleazy Latino who failed on his own as a PI, and Ken Warren, the genius carhawk with a killer speech impediment. Both bring tremendous dimension and entertainment to the DKA team.<br />But the real stars of the book are the Gypsies, colourful in character as well as in their various ingenious scams. Although they're such big thieves that they'd make a kleptomaniac look like a saint, you can't help but like them and hope that every now and then they'll catch a break.<br />Joe Gores is an author who has walked the walk, having been an agent in the real life DKA Agency. His first-hand knowledge and experience is apparent as his agents work through their cases. Rumour has it that the Larry Ballard could very well be modelled on Gores himself.<br />As a final word, if there are any Donald Westlake fans out there whohave read and enjoyed his Dortmunder book Drowned Hopes, I would urge you to read this one too with a brilliant crossover of storylines. This book was an absolute pleasure to read and, I know it's a much-overused catch phrase but I would term it a \\"must read book\\".	2003-03-10

DKA stands for Dan Kearny Associates and is a detective agency that specialises in car repossessions and tracking down skip-traces. Final Notice is full of clever cons and scams designed to gather the information required to track down their delinquent quarry.<br />When DKA agent Larry Ballard repossesses a Cadillac, he unwittingly also takes a comic book containing a number of $100 bills stuffed between the pages. In doing so he places the company in the middle of a mob pay-off. The bank that employed DKA to perform the repossession quickly order the caddy be returned to the former owner (an almost unheard of request) which DKA obediently do. It would have all ended there, but then a member of staff is savagely beaten by a known mob enforcer right outside the agency office. From this point on it becomes personal and Dan Kearny and his people become determined to find out what's going on and, perhaps get some revenge.<br />This book is a nice mix of interesting detective work couple with a likable group of individually unique characters making it a fresh detective story. There are plenty of action sequences to keep the entertainment level high as well as some light-hearted interaction between the DKA agents. As far as private investigator series go, I've found this to be one of the freshest and most enjoyable ones written in recent times.	2003-03-06

His client is Donald Willsson, but Willsson is shot and killed before the Continental Op can meet him. He decides to visit Willson's father, Elihu, who until recently ran the town. Elihu Willson winds up hiring the Continental Op to clean up the town by getting rid of the town's 3 criminal bosses. In true gangster-style, the names of the criminals are Max \\"Whisper\\" Thaler, Lew Yard and Pete the Finn.<br />The clean up job becomes the main focus of the rest of the book, although along the way, the Continental Op manages to solve the murder of his original client as well as most other minor crimes that spring up around him. The Continental Op is an interesting character, having no qualms about setting others up, knowingly placing them in mortal danger in order to uncover evidence or confirm his suspicions. He will lie, cheat and double-cross just about anyone.<br />The deaths come thick and fast and are mentioned off-handedly, almost as an afterthought.

The events surrounding the supposed fraud occurred over a year previously and all employees involved have since moved on: 1 has died and the others quit or were fired. In order to save their business, two of the investigators, Larry Ballard and Bart Heslip have to track down the former employees who may be able to provide the evidence that will prove DKAs innocence.<br />The story has two focal points running concurrently. The first is the hearing, which provides the drama and the second is on the investigation performed by Ballard and Heslip, which provides the action. The progress of the hearing is actually the stopwatch indicating how much time the DKA investigators have to find their potential witnesses. <br />The DKA books provide all the necessary ingredients that fans of PI books would be looking for, but it is also enhanced by the fact that the agency is much larger than a 1 or 2 man business and so, there are plenty of opportunities for elaborate plans involving multiple players to be carried out.	2003-02-24

Its very nature is to entertain and no apologies are made for the outrageous escapes or impossibly feats of heroics. I think he has met his goal in no uncertain terms.<br />Dr Stephen Swain has been handed one of the most sought after and prestigious opportunities in the universe. He has been chosen to represent Earth in the Presidian, a game played against the other 6 inhabited worlds. What an honour! What an opportunity! There's only 1 catch, the game is actually a fight to the death. Seven participants enter a labyrinth but only one leaves. Oh yeah, and Earth's participants have all performed remarkably poorly in past events.<br />Swain is afforded an advantage albeit a small one. This Presidian will be fought on his home ground or, more specifically, inside the New York Public Library. But any advantage he may have begins and ends there. Apparently, because previous representatives from Earth who were chosen based on their warrior backgrounds have performed so badly, Swain's selection was based solely on his ability to think his way around problems. So he enters a deadly fight to the death armed with - his wits.<br />So the battle begins after a quick rundown of the rules and the action becomes frenetic. It's a frantic bid for survival against the odds that doesn't fail in it's number one objective - namely to provide edge of the seat thrills.	2003-02-23

The police have no hard evidence or witnesses linking the man to the crime, but are firmly convinced they have the right person. Because of their lack of evidence, the police have been given a deadline to get a confession out of the man or he goes free.<br />Although this book revolves around the interrogation of the murder suspect, the underlying theme carried on from character to character is one of regret. As the interrogation continues and the deadline before the suspect is released draws closer, the feeling of regret becomes more and more pronounced before a series of climactic reactions are sparked.<br />The continued uncertainty over whether the suspected man actually committed the crime gives a feeling of growing desperation and frustration to the mood. As the night drags on and more characters are dragged into the story, it becomes even less clear as to who may done it. The desperation grows, the sense of hopelessness grows and then suddenly a series of events are sparked providing an action-packed ending that is as satisfying as the earlier build up.	2003-02-19

Burke is a formidable man who has surrounded himself with a vast network of professionals. But Burke is a criminal and a highly organised one at that.<br />This story starts off with a favour for a fellow ex-con. The ex-con has accidentally killed an abusive husband whom he was supposed to be warning away from his battered wife. The story then quickly progresses to the safe house of the book's title and the battered women who are sheltered there. At first it appears that the rest of the book would be about Burke and his partners providing protection for these women, but before you know it, the focus shifts on to a neo-Nazi movement. With the constant changes of focus, I found the plot a little hard to follow as I tried to remember the motivation behind what was taking place.<br />This is hardboiled all the way as Burke displays a willingness to do just about anything as long as it means getting the job done. A little more attention to explaining what was going on and a little less to attitude would have gone a long way.	2003-02-14

And whether that means carrying on with the boss's wife, robbing a bank or killing a man, well, sometimes you've just got no choice but to do it. As a result of his impulsiveness, Madox leaves himself open to blackmail threats from more than one person.<br />Madox has recently arrived in a small town and has just started working as a car salesman. Life is quiet, but quiet just isn't interesting enough for Harry. By chance, opportunities to get him into trouble seem to keep falling straight into his lap. Before he knows it, he is planning a bank robbery, is fooling around with a married woman, and is falling in love with a beautiful, sweet girl who may be hiding a dark secret.<br />From early on in the book, the mood of the story is on a knife-edge with plenty of fast thinking and decisive action required on Madox's part. It's an entertaining hardboiled pot boiler with tension piling in on itself until you just know that something's got to give. I found it to be a great fast read packed with plenty of action, softened occasionally with just a little romance.	2003-02-13

Have you decided it's Joe Pike? Or Hawk? Or Bubba Rugowski? Well forget about it. The meanest, most unsympathetic and unpredictable sidekick out there would have to be Carstairs, partner of private detective Doan. He's huge, aloof handsome, successful, ruthless and...a Great Dane. Who could ask for more?<br />This is the first of three Doan and Carstairs mysteries and is a comical hardboiled mystery set in the Mexican mountains in the tiny village of Los Altos. Doan accompanied, by his multi-talented partner Carstairs, visits the village in the guise of a tourist, but by the time Los Altos is cut off from the rest of the world thanks to an earthquake, it was already clear to him that there was more than the average amount of foul play taking place in such a small village. Plenty of murders, thieves and double crosses keep the action lively, while the banter from Doan continually jollies the mood along no matter how desperate the situation. For all his good-naturedness and happy go lucky exterior, there is a tough side to Doan which he is forced to exhibit on occasion and, like all hardboiled detectives, shows no hesitation in using deadly force when necessary.<br />This is an extremely fast book to read with plenty happening surrounded by snappy, often whimsical dialogue. A real pleasure to experience.	2002-12-16

As fascinating as it is sobering, Tourette's Syndrome is spotlighted as we view the world from Tourette's suffering Lionel Essrog's perspective as he carries out an investigation into the murder of his boss and mentor while held under the spell of his illness.<br />Although the book features an engrossing murder investigation complete with mob-ties and conspiracy theories, it's the battle going on inside Lionel's head that holds the most interest. At times his outbursts are presented humorously, but we are always reminded how hard he's working just to appear normal.<br />It's a book full of stark reminders of the frailty of the human condition and how things and, in particular people, aren't always as they seem on the surface. This is a book that will stay with you long after you close the cover on the last page.	2002-12-15

When he talks, he follows through with brutal efficiency. And so, when he warned the organised crime boss not to cross him or he would hurt the organisation, it would have been a good idea to listen. What would not have been a good idea was to attempt to put a hit on Parker.<br />When the hit fails, as of course it must, Parker sets in place a devious plan to hurt the Outfit just as he promised. What follows is a highly entertaining string of crimes around the country, striking blow after blow on behalf of our anti-hero, Parker.<br />If you're simply after a flat out entertaining book of action sequences that aren't cluttered up with pesky character development, then this is the book for you. As a matter of fact, the entire Parker series is for you. Parker remains the true dispassionate enigma. Sure he's heartless, cruel and vindictive but you've just gotta love the rascal.	2002-12-02

I found this to be a very clever method of piquing the interest, compelling me to read on.<br />The man facing execution is Scott Henderson, and we meet him as the story opens when he picks up a girl in a bar based solely on her outrageous hat. For some reason he's in a foul mood and pays her little attention, even though he takes her out to dinner, a theatre show and then back to the bar. When he gets home to his apartment he is greeted by the police...and the body of his strangled wife. Things start getting really interesting from here on out.<br />We find the story revolving around the careful recounting of Scott Henderson's movements on that night as he desperately tries to establish an alibi. As the title of the book suggests, the lady he was with that night has disappeared, leaving him in deep trouble. Chapter by chapter the clock ticks down building tension and adding an enormous feeling of desperation to the search. Three people, each of whom is willing to put themselves in danger to see that justice is served, conduct the search for that elusive alibi. Firstly, Henderson's girlfriend / mistress gets herself deeply involved, at times placing herself in extreme danger. The second person is an old school friend who Henderson calls, in the belief that he is the only person who would care enough to help. And thirdly, and most surprisingly, is the police officer that was instrumental in seeing Henderson convicted. He begins to hold grave misgivings about his guilt and provides the impetus behind their quest.<br />Cornell Woolrich expertly weaves an exhausting tale as lead after lead is explored in an all out effort to save Scott Henderson's life. As can be expected, given the nature of the chapter titles, the story culminates in a nail-biting ending, making it a most satisfying reading experience.it a most satisfying reading experience.	2002-11-28

As a story of revenge, it's a classic with the big mystery being, what on earth could have happened to prompt such violence.<br />The person who is seeking revenge is Julie Killeen. She is a beautiful woman, but she's also a careful, cold-blooded killer. She is on an unstoppable mission of painstakingly tracking down, stalking and then murdering men before casually walking away, unconcerned about whether or not she leaves any witnesses. She gives little away as she carries out the murders, although she does feed us with snippets of information which merely serves to add to the mystery surrounding her actions and drives us on to find out more. None of her victims seem to recognise her, nor do they seem to have anything in common with one another, which also adds greater interest to the event that started her off.<br />Attempting to track Julie down is Lew Wanger, the detective who, while not exactly hot on her trail, is the only one who believes the murders are related. It's through him that the pieces are put together forming a coherent chain of events helping us understand what went on in the past to cause the events of the present. <br />This is a captivating story told in the typically brutal fashion of the hardboiled genre. The unexpected ending caps off this highly entertaining book very nicely indeed and I found myself well and truly put in my place, just as I was congratulating myself for having figured everything out.	2002-11-20

At times it's difficult to figure out who is working for the dark side and who is on the side of light. And this confusion is all thanks to the clever plot twists and cliff-hanger chapter endings. To give names to the opposing sides, we have the Vatican on one side and the Illuminati on the other.<br />The scene is set with the murder of a brilliant scientist who was branded on his chest with a unique marking. This is followed closely by the news that a bomb (the invention of the murdered scientist) sits somewhere in Vatican City and is set to detonate at midnight, some 12 hours hence. To top off the predicament, the Pope has recently died and the Cardinals are about to enter conclave, but 4 of their number have been kidnapped with the threat that they will be killed, 1 every hour at various spots around Rome. As far as tension-packed scenarios go, this one's a doozy.<br />Caught in the crossfire and somehow charge with the task of averting disaster is Robert Langdon, a religious symbologist who is led on a treasure hunt type chase around Rome. It really is thrill-a-minute stuff mixing historical fact with present-day improbability creating a tremendously exciting story.	2002-11-15

We know the victim, the crime and who committed it from the opening page. Robert Syverten is sitting in court having already been found guilty and is in the process of being sentenced by the judge. During his sentencing his mind wanders back through the events leading up to the crime. And a most unusual story it is, too.<br />Syverten is an out of work movie extra who bumps into the chronically depressed Gloria one day and they quickly become friends. She invites him to partner her in a marathon dance contest and, with nothing better to do, he agrees. It's clear from very early on, however, that Gloria is not a happy camper and continually complains that she wishes she were dead, usually a throwaway line, but in this case it's a heartfelt wish.<br />The bulk of the story revolves around the dance contest, which quickly turns into a gruelling nightmare for the competitors, who are jollied along by the organisers to try to drum up interest from the public. The contest is frequently punctuated with outbreaks of violence and other unexpected disturbances, which provides a sense of inevitability to the final few scenes.<br />There is a lot to like about this book with the carnival atmosphere and upbeat tempo of the dance contest striking a dramatic contrast to Gloria's fatalistic view of life.	2002-11-13

It's one of those fast paced books that ensured that I was frantically turning pages in an effort to keep up.<br />John Becker is asked to have a bit of a look into some recent disappearances of some young men in the local area to see whether they are related. Becker, who is trying to enjoy his retirement, very reluctantly agrees and has soon linked the missing men through a common, yet obscure similarity. From here the chase is on to identify and track down a man who we know as Dyce. We learn a lot about Dyce quite early on, and follow along as he finds himself a girlfriend. This was probably the only part of the book that I had a problem with as the girlfriend is cast as a real desperate, so much so that she completely ignores some pretty weird things about her new boyfriend. And when I say pretty weird, I'm talking right out there, baby.<br />This is quite a typical psychological thriller with the usual extreme - dare I say it - psychotic behaviour by the killer accompanied by the odd flashback to his childhood to explain his present day actions. Becker's character is established, casting him as reliable in his instincts, but difficult to work with, particularly when fool superiors are involved. It's the sort of first book of a series that promises further development of a character who already has issues.	2002-11-06

Early on, Dave is shot in the chest by Jimmie Lee Boggs, a death row prisoner who was in the process of being transferred in preparation for his execution. After recovering, Dave is asked by the DEA to work undercover in New Orleans in a sting operation to put away Mafia don Tony Cardo. The added lure is the opportunity to catch Boggs and repay him for the bullet.<br />Once he gains the trust of Cardo, Dave finds himself developing a liking for the crime boss, regardless of the misery he is responsible for dealing out. The feeling of affection is mutual, with a deep respect developing between the two men. He finds that he has to struggle to keep focussed on the reason he's there and put his new friendship aside.<br />Dave Robicheaux is still a man in torment, particularly after the trauma of being shot had reawakened the nightmares he hoped to have put behind him. James Lee Burke's Louisiana is a grim and dangerous place at times, yet the mouth-watering cuisine seems to make all the danger worthwhile. This is another solid effort in a tremendous series.	2002-11-03

He manages to get himself into serious trouble by annoying superior officers in three different cities at the same time...and I don't think he was even trying all that hard. Part of the trouble even goes as far as becoming a suspect in his own investigation, earning Rebus a fellow detective to watch over him to ensure he stays out of mischief - much to his extreme chagrin.<br />The result of ticking his superiors off in Edinburgh was his transfer to what is acknowledged as the worst police station in the city. It's good to see that nothing has changed and Rebus is prepared to attack his cases with the usual mule-headed stubbornness.<br />Two cases head Rebus' consciousness in this book. The first case sees him teetering on the brink of obsession over a serial killer who is on the loose around the country. The unusual and intriguing part is that the M.O. and the killer's nickname are very similar to that of a killer who operated 25 years ago, but was never caught. The second case seems to be a more straightforward murder investigation, but this too is proving a difficult one to follow and leads Rebus a merry dance around Scotland.<br />John Rebus fans will be satisfied with Black and Blue, as everything we've come to love about him is here in spades. He flaunts the rules with abandon in his dogged pursuit of his quarry, he works quite comfortably alone, yet he still enjoys the assistance of Holmes and Clarke. One watershed moment is his passing dalliance with sobriety, as an old partner, Jack Morrow, exerts his reformed alcoholic influence on him.	2002-11-03

As with all of the Myron Bolitar books, the tone is light while the content is actually a little more serious. The interplay between Myron and Win, and Myron and Esperanza is always a highlight of these books, and certainly doesn't disappoint in this one.<br />Myron is asked by the owner of the New Jersey Dragons to search for the missing star player, Greg Downing. Myron has a history with Downing, which plays a bit of a part with Myron being hired for the job. While searching for Downing, he can't let on to anyone that Downing is actually missing, making the job particularly difficult. His search uncovers numerous surprises, which threatens Myron's hard won acceptance of past failures.<br />This is a fast-paced thriller that continues on what is a very entertaining series. It's better to have read the earlier books, if only to get a better idea of how the characters have come to depend on each other and why they put up with their behaviour. It's also worth reading the others because they're all just plain enjoyable reading.	2002-10-25

Like the first book, it casts Mary as an intrepid heroine who is prepared to take on all comers regardless of how prudent her approach might be.<br />Someone is killing the federal judges of the United States, 11 of them so far. Although the deaths have been set up to look like accidents - apart from the last one, that is, it has become obvious that they're anything but. After the first 11 deaths, the FBI have strong suspicions about who will be the next target and want to provide close protection, but the judge won't hear of it. It just so happens that the judge in question, Judge Irene Hannah, virtually adopted Mary after her mother was killed and has become like a second mother to her. So the FBI ask Mary to step in to try to convince Irene to accept the protection offered. Of course, once Mary Crow becomes involved, she goes the whole hog and winds up providing more assistance than she bargains for.<br />Before the dramatic conclusion to this story, Mary has reacquainted herself with the serene Upsy-Daisy Ranch, had an uncomfortable reunion with old boyfriend Jonathan Walkingstick - and his new lover Ruth Moon, enjoyed an abrasive relationship with FBI agent Dan Safer, and underestimated the people who turn out to be dangerously ruthless enemies. It's well presented, riveting reading that manages to entertain from the opening chapter.<br />For those who have read the first book, this becomes a very informative sequel, answering some very important questions regarding Mary's past that were first raised in In The Forest Of Harm. Don't worry if you haven't read In The Forest Of Harm yet, because A Darker Justice sits just as comfortably as a stand-alone thriller as it does part of an on-going series.	2002-10-24

The upheaval in question revolves around Gunther Fahnstiel who has walked out of his nursing home without any of the nursing staff noticing. Naturally his family is beside themselves and are very keen to have him found again. Gunther was in the nursing home because of the steady onset of senility. He's an ex-policeman and believes that he has some urgent unfinished business to take care of, leading him through the streets of Wichita, Kansas.<br />The time setting switches from chapter to chapter, taking us from 1989 back to 1952. The chapters about the earlier years are all written from a third person perspective, but the person whose perspective it is coming from changes in each chapter providing very interesting insights into each character.<br />Through Gunther's slipping mind it becomes clear that something very important happened in 1952 that has affected Gunther and most of the other characters in the book quite deeply. Gunther is drawn back to the place it all happened thinking he has some loose ends to tie up and so, all plotlines are inevitably drawn along with him, providing a satisfying, yet somewhat wistful ending.	2002-10-21

Milan is a middle-aged, clear-thinking, single and sensible private investigator who always seems to get things done with a minimum of fuss.<br />Although theres a minimum of fuss, theres still plenty to enjoy about this latest book in the series. Milan explores the unfamiliar territory of Irish bars when hired to track down a conman posing as an Irishman who is new to the country, He preys on Irish ex-pats, taking them into his confidence before disappearing with a modest haul. He oversteps the mark when his prey is Judge Maureen Hartigan and she demands a chance at a shot of revenge, using Milan to find him. Things become a bit more complicated when it is revealed that the judge hasnt been completely forthright about what was stolen. When Milan works out what some of the items were, their significance changes the tone of his investigation completely.<br />This is another enjoyable private investigator story, which I would term as semi-hardboiled. Its not going to offend any sensibilities with Milan remaining a gentleman throughout the entire case. As its part of a series, I would recommend that a couple of the earlier books could be read to give you a bit of an insight into Milan and the other regular characters.	2002-10-15

This book deals quite sensitively with race issues and prejudices and the way, not only Billy tries to fight them, but the way the greater population still accepts them.<br />Wiltse manages to describe rural Nebraska so poetically that he makes what would normally be considered a boring landscape of flat fields of corn seem beautiful and special to behold. His description of a Nebraska sunset had me ready to pack up my belongings and head straight to the cornfields myself.	2002-10-10

Daisy Minor wakes on the morning of her 34th birthday to the realisation that she's on the verge of becoming an old maid. After being a prim and proper librarian dressed in dowdy clothes for too long, she decides it's time to find herself a husband and start a family before it's too late. So she undergoes a makeover, dresses for attention and hits the local nightclub scene.<br />Meanwhile, there seems to be a local trade in people smuggling being undertaken by the more enterprising criminals around town. Added to that, and possibly even related to it, is a sudden spree of women becoming victims of date-rape drugs. This becomes immediately relevant to the recently bloomed Daisy.<br />Fortunately, although much to Daisy's great chagrin, she has captured the attention of the local police chief who takes it upon himself to act as Daisy's protector. Moments of hilarity ensue as she is embarrassed by his overt advances that he delights in - and so did I just quietly. The condom scenes where particular favourites of mine.<br />I would class this as a thriller-lite novel with strong romantic comedy overtones.

He is quickly established as an all round nice guy who is well liked by his customers and employees alike.<br />As with many stories set in Las Vegas, this book deals with luck, both good and bad. When Jimmy's luck turns down thanks to a rogue accountant who also happens to be his brother-in-law, he is faced with the prospect of losing his bar. Obviously not a pleasant situation to be in, but made even more unpleasant by the fact that the place used to be his fathers and he had vowed to make it a success.<br />In what becomes a final act of desperation he decides to ring a woman who advertises herself as a `Dice Angel'. Figuring he's got nothing more to lose he puts himself in her hands and we are taken on an entertaining trip around a few of the casinos of Las Vegas.<br />As well as providing a very entertaining story, we are also treated to a view of Las Vegas seldom seen by the visitors to the town. We are given the insider's tour giving us an idea of the local customs and tricks not known by the tourist trade. It adds a whole new dimension to the city of Las Vegas for someone like me who has only ever experienced the tourist-trap side. It's an upbeat novel that provides us with a likable main character who is not without his faults, but who you find yourself rooting for as he tries to save his bar.	2002-09-30

Kurtz is a former P.I. and ex-con who has multiple contracts out on his life. Hes a hard man who is quite happy to use whatever force is necessary to protect himself and his friends. The contracts on his life come from the criminal element but thats not his only problem. He also has the police dogging his heels just waiting for him to violate his parole, looking for any excuse to throw him back into Attica. To top things off the building housing his office is about to be demolished.<br />Into this tempestuous existence steps John Frears whose daughter was raped and murdered before the murderer supposedly killed himself. But Frears swears blind that he has recently seen the killer and would like Kurtz to investigate. Kurtz insists his days as a P.I. are long gone, but after a little digging, is compelled to take on the job. The killer is a truly ... piece of work and Simmons has excelled himself in creating a monster who is worthy of the wrath of someone such as Joe Kurtz.<br />Kurtz continues his rocky relationship with the ever-dwindling Farina family and, although on Stevie Little Skag Farinas hit list, manages to come to a satisfactory working relationship with Angelina Farina Ferrara. It is actually the scenes involving Angelina that I found most enjoyable as she and Kurtz sparred to maintain the stronger ground over the other.<br />As with Hardcase, Dan Simmons has produced another ultra-hardboiled thriller with no let up on the violence and adds to the dark mood by setting this book in the middle of a Buffalo winter. This is a book for the hardboiled devotees out there. If you love Richard Starks Parker, then Joe Kurtz will delight you no end.	2002-09-26

It's an insight into the law enforcement agencies across Europe and an undercover police operation all rolled into one.<br />We see the return of criminal psychologist Tony Hill and Carol Jordan a police officer who has just applied for a job with Europol, working behind a desk processing information. But her superiors see her as something more and offer her a job working undercover. Through this undercover work, she and Tony Hill renew their acquaintance and begin chasing down a German criminal named Tadeusz Radecki. He has recently branched out from his drug distribution into people smuggling.<br />Also chasing down Radecki is Petra Becker, a criminal intelligence officer in Berlin who has been after him for years and is hot on his trail after the murder of a drug dealer. She corresponds to a friend in Holland over the Internet and occasionally helps out when it comes to solving crimes. In this case, there is a serial killer on the loose across Europe who seems to be targeting psychologists by replicating atrocities performed during the reign of the Nazi's in Germany.<br />Although spread across Europe and seemingly tenuously linked, the whole story is nicely drawn together. It's a book that would best be classed as a shocker with some descriptive, grisly scenes. We are also treated to the killer's thoughts and the reasons behind his motives, suggesting that there are still more victims of the medical experiments performed during World War 2 than those who died.<br />Val McDermid has once again produced an exciting and entertaining thriller. Fans of the psychological suspense novels will find this one right up their alley.	2002-09-25

Although appearing to have put her past behind her, she still lives with it, affecting her marriage to Stan, an armoured truck driver who thinks he has devised the perfect crime, a plan in which he would rob his own truck, after which he and his girlfriend would leave Miami to live on the proceeds.<br />Inevitably, Stan's perfect crime isn't so perfect after all, having attracted the attention of some other life-long and low-life criminals who can see an easy profit for the taking. Somehow, the money falls into Alexandra's hands and she suddenly finds herself on the run from her husband, the opportunistic criminals and, just to add a nifty twist, a serial killer. With all of these people chasing the same person, their paths are bound to cross at some point with unpredictable results.<br />There are all sorts of interesting and strange characters making up the book: with Emma, the young pool cleaner who keeps a pet cockroach on a string leash in her pocket; and Lawton, Alexandra's father, an ex-policeman who is slowly losing his memory. He is a tragic figure who still has a very important part to play in the story's outcome.<br />This is a brisk thriller joining together a desperate chase across Florida with the tension and terror of not knowing when or where the serial killer will strike next.	2002-09-23

(Dortmunder Novels)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Highly Original	Burglars such as John Dortmunder can accept getting caught and turned over to the police, it goes with the territory. So it was with an air of inevitability that Dortmunder allowed himself to be handcuffed by the police after making the mistake of getting caught while robbing billionaire Max Fairbanks. What is totally unacceptable is, while in custody and about to be taken to the station, the same Max Fairbanks brazenly steals Dortmunder's `lucky' ring.<br />John is determined to recover his ring and won't rest until he has it. The fact that he's up against a billionaire with virtually unlimited resources isn't enough to alter his resolve. So we follow caper after caper as John and his old friend Andy Kelp make their attempts which occur in New York City, Washington D.C. and then, in a rousing finale, in Las Vegas.<br />This is the 9th book in the Dortmunder series and is an outstanding story that contains all the humour and characters of the previous books, but is different for one important reason. It looks as though John's luck may have changed, although he won't hear of it. It's the paradox between the luck Dortmunder thinks he is experiencing and the luck he's actually having that provides many of the more amusing moments.<br />Donald Westlake's John Dortmunder series has provided me with some of the most consistently entertaining reading of any author I have read in recent years. The books are complete farces, yet have been presented with the greatest imagination possible. What's The Worst That Could Happen picks up this precedent and carries it even further. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh.	2002-09-19

In the same note, Greg Iles claims that if nothing else, you won't be bored, and I think he got it exactly right.<br />John Waters is living a comfortable life in Natchez, Mississippi with his wife and 8-year-old daughter when he meets Eve Sumner. The chance meeting takes on greater significance when she mentions facts and little code words from his past that only he and his former girlfriend, Mallory Candler, knew. The disturbing aspect of this is that Mallory has been dead for over 10 years. The explanation provided by Eve steps us into the realms of the supernatural as she explains that she is actually the spirit of Mallory Candler living in the body of Eve Sumner.<br />Such is the skill of Greg Iles that he takes this implausible scenario and makes it sound believable. He does this simply through the rational reasoning of John Waters and his friend Penn Cage. It's actually thanks to their disbelief that the concept of soul transference becomes more real.<br />I enjoyed Sleep No More for a couple of reasons. The pace is frantic as Waters is kept off balance throughout. Facts and events keep coming at him quicker than he is prepared for. The second reason is the fact that it's quite reminiscent of some of Stephen King's books. Life starts off very normally, but soon the protagonist's world is thrown into total disarray by the seemingly impossible. You soon find yourself wistfully remembering when things weren't quite so exciting. But then, the way forward is always more interesting, and Iles wraps things up nicely, still leaving a few of the more curly questions open for possible further exploration.	2002-09-18

They are called into action after trouble in the lion enclosure at the zoo. Circumstances conspire to ensure that Fat Ollie Weeks of the 88th Precinct is also brought into the case, livening up proceedings no end.<br />Steve Carella and Ollie Weeks join forces to head up the homicide investigation, which becomes a lot more involved as they uncover more about the victim. Counterfeit $100 notes are found that are somehow linked to the victim, as are drugs - a lot of drugs, actually. The irreverent Ollie Weeks provides the lighter moments of the book as he imposes his charm on the unsuspecting public. Steve Carella still has family problems as well as personal ones, providing a more sober and darker sub-plot.<br />This is yet another strong case for the cops from the 87th Precinct combining a fast-paced story with amusing banter from the investigating officers as they go through their standard police procedures. I get the feeling that Ed McBain is becoming more and more happy with his creation of Ollie Weeks and seems to have delighted in developing his character over recent books. His personal hygiene, interviewing techniques and view on minority groups are all so bad, it's good.	2002-09-10

He seems like a gentle, somewhat simple man who believes that inaction is always the most prudent course of action. He feels it \\"just wouldn't seem right\\" to have to arrest people, so generally, he doesn't. But slowly it began to dawn on me that this is a Jim Thompson book and there simply aren't heroes in his books.<br />It turns out that Nick Corey is quite similar to another Jim Thompson character, Lou Ford from The Killer Inside Me. In fact, it's worthwhile reading both books to compare these two characters. They are so different, yet incredibly similar.<br />The chilling thing about this book lies in how deeply convinced everyone is that Nick is a simpleton who is a harmless, lazy man. But the truth is apparent to the reader how rat-cunning he actually is. The desire to be re-elected to his post as sheriff drives his day-to-day activity and everyone underestimates just how far he'll go to ensure his re-election, myself included.<br />Apart from the sinister actions of Nick Corey, the story is actually quite amusing, told in the first person in a light and witty tone of voice. Nick manages to put an amusing spin on all aspects of his day-to-day life, most especially the parts in which he's doing absolutely nothing at all.<br />This is a typical Jim Thompson story. There are no heroes, as a matter of fact; there are few, if any, likable characters in the book. The main character narrates in a style that feels as though he's saying: here are the facts, make of them what you will. It's a chiller rather than a mystery and events took me by surprise more than once.	2002-09-09

This leaves Ed alone with his stepmother and her daughter, a prospect he doesn't find too appealing. So he immediately sets off to find his Uncle Ambrose, a man he has always admired, to tell him of his father's death.<br />It's from the meeting with Uncle Ambrose that the book's pace really picks up as he takes charge and gives Ed the direction he needs. They set about investigating the murder of Ed's father using all of their combined talents, which turn out to be surprisingly considerable. Ed and Am discover they make a good team together as they methodically piece together clues and follow up leads.<br />This is a great introduction to Ed and Am Hunter, who star in a further 6 books after this one. Both characters are your typical average nice guys who manage to adapt well to their surroundings. Adding to their appeal is the mixture of youth and experience allowing us to learn the craft of detection along with Ed as Ambrose shows him the ropes.	2002-09-05

Sughrue tracking down poet and author Abraham Trahearne, who has taken off on a drinking binge. Just as Trahearne is found and run to ground in a California bar, the owner of the bar asks Sughrue if he could investigate the disappearance of her daughter. Problem is, the girl, one Betty Sue Flowers, went missing 10 years ago and finding her drifts into the realm of impossibility. Nevertheless, Sughrue agrees to do what he can.<br />James Crumley presents us with another private detective hailing from Meriwether, Montana. C. W. Sughrue is a very interesting character. While he's not without his faults, he drinks, chases women and breaks the law when he has to, he is a morally strong character who is determined to see that justice prevails above all else. He finds himself in an unusual position in dealing with Trahearne. Trahearne seems to live peacefully with his wife, ex-wife and mother, but feels the need to occasionally get away and go on a bender every so often. He befriends Sughrue and they do a bit of travelling together, but Sughrue keeps getting the feeling that something's not quite right, but can't quite put his finger on what it is.<br />There's quite a bit more to this story than first meets the eye, and the key to it has to do with Sughrue's feelings towards Trahearne and his family. Sughrue's uneasiness rubbed off to me a little and I was beginning to wonder what I was supposed to be picking up. It was a clever device that drew me into the story, ensuring that I read every word closely, looking for a clue that would tip me off.<br />This is an easy-going hardboiled story, if there can be such a thing. Sughrue is a very laid back character and seems to have all the time in the world to look for his missing persons, enjoying the journey as much as possible. This made it feel as though I was cruising through the book along with him until all the pieces of the jigsaw fell together towards the end.	2002-09-02

Lysa is being blackmailed over some photos that were taken during a 4 day drunken party, catching her in some pretty explicit scenes. She has already paid off the blackmailers once, but it would seem that the photos still exist and the blackmailers are coming back for another bite of the cherry. Travis is given a list of 10 people who knew about the party and so uses it to begin his investigation into which one of them organised to have the photos taken.<br />To help him during his investigation, Lysa supplies Travis with her own personal secretary Dana Holtzer, a highly organised, very professional and of course , strikingly beautiful woman. She also has some personal secrets that makes her cold and aloof, particularly when it comes to men. Travis, being the diligent investigator that he is, goes about unlocking the secrets to Dana's heart while he's unlocking the identity of the blackmailer.<br />This is a lively mystery which turns out to be more of a mystery than it appears at first glance. The solving of one part leads us onto the next, leading Travis and Dana across the country and forcing them closer and closer together. It's an entertaining entry in the Travis McGee series.	2002-08-29

The opening chapters of The Screaming Mimi is a good example of this. Each time we are introduced to a person or a situation, it turns out to be different to the first impressions that are created. Not only does it provide entertaining reading but it helps keep you on your toes.<br />Sweeney, a newspaper reporter, witnesses the strange aftermath of an attempted stabbing murder. The victim is a beautiful woman, a stripper who survives the attack and, while still in shock goes into her performance routine in front of astounded bystanders. As a result of the shock from the attack, she is unable to identify her attacker, but the details make it clear that she was close to being the latest victim of a killer known as The Ripper.<br />Sweeney makes it his business to discover the identity of The Ripper for two equally important reasons. The first is because it would make a sensational story and as a reporter, he cant resist a good story. The second is that by following up the story he would get to meet the stripper and as a man he cant resist a beautiful dame!<br />The pace is brisk, the dialogue is amusing and direct as Sweeney conducts his own investigation by following up hunches and suspicions. Its a very entertaining investigation with an ending worth waiting for. If you can possibly get your hands on this, or any of Fredric Browns books for that matter, its worth the effort.	2002-08-27

After a short and brutal affair, they agree that the key to their happiness together is to rid themselves of Nick, Cora's husband.  The murderous, adulterous couple carefully plot and carry out their plan with straightforward efficiency, fully expecting that the result will bring them together to live in peace and happiness. But this is classic noir fiction, so a happy ending is simply out of the question.  It's an amazingly powerful book that cuts right to the chase, scene after scene, ensuring that the all-important emotions of fear and hatred stand out even more starkly.	2002-08-23

This easy-going, well-liked man is a respected citizen of the town and is well known for his quiet, gentle nature. But its all an act and as Lou tells us a little about his past, the demons in his head are revealed as are the reasons behind his secret, violent nature.<br />This is a serial killer book with a couple of very interesting features. The first is, it was written back when stories about serial killers werent very common and so, was pretty groundbreaking stuff. The second is that it is written entirely in the first person from the point of view of the killer, so we get the total range of emotions from before, during and after each murder. The thought processes that prompt every action and the way he goes about covering up his tracks really does make for interesting reading.<br />We get a terrific example of the grim style of Jim Thompsons storytelling that is at once captivating and slightly horrifying. The Killer Inside Me fully deserves the praise that Ive seen given to it and Im adding my own to it here.	2002-08-23

As a matter of fact there is no-one who is remotely likable, trustworthy or who contains a shred of decency. It's about a group of criminals who are just as dangerous to their colleagues as they are to the innocent victims who cross their paths.<br />The story starts off with the well-planned and executed robbery of a bank. During and immediately after the heist the criminals' callous disregard for human life is displayed. These are ruthless, desperate and even deranged people. We then follow their getaway as they do their best to stay a step ahead of the law.<br />The main characters are the husband and wife team of Doc and Carol McCoy. Theirs is a tense relationship with Doc's ever-present menace thinly hidden by his outward calm demeanour. The tension in the relationship stems from the fact that Carol is well aware of what Doc is capable and doesn't quite trust him. He rules with a soft voice but backs up with a fist of iron which can hit with devastating suddenness.<br />I thought the ending was brilliantly ironic and packed with poetic justice. It's not one of those shock endings, rather it's a slow realisation that begins to dawn and then has the power to remain in the consciousness long after finishing the book. On the whole, this is a dark look at the underbelly of society told with a brutal frankness that sets the mood to perfection.	2002-08-19

On this particular Thursday night, the paper is looking extremely void of news and Doc complains that he wishes something would happen on a Thursday night to give him a hot story. As well as being editor of the local paper, Doc is also an aficionado of the works of Lewis Carroll and enjoys nothing more than spouting verse in Smiley's bar when work is over. The Lewis Carroll references become very important to the storyline and are scattered liberally throughout the book.<br />Before the night is half over, Doc's wishes come true as he is absolutely deluged with exciting stories that would make terrific reading the next morning. From bank robbers, to a factory fire, to the capture of a criminal gang. But as quickly as they break, the stories evaporate leaving him with the prospect of delivering a newspaper with nothing worthwhile to read.<br />In the midst of his newspaper worries, Doc is visited by a man calling himself Yehudi Smith - a name of great significance to a Lewis Carroll fan. Yehudi seems to know a great deal about Doc and about his fascination with Lewis Carroll and he invites Doc to accompany him later that night on a hunt for the Jabberwock. As surreal as this prospect seems, Doc is convinced that the prospect isn't as crazy as it first seems, so he agrees to go.<br />This is just the start of an amazing night for Doc Stoeger. Before the night is through, he finds himself in an unbelievably hopeless predicament on the run from the police, desperately trying to make sense of the night's events. It seems that the story goes off the rails and heads into the realms of fantasy, but the key to the whole story is hidden in the fact that, although everything that happens seems impossibly fantastic, when logic is applied and reasoned out carefully, the events become part of a very clever plot.<br />This is a brilliantly constructed book combining the strange and, at times, nonsensical talents of Lewis Carroll's brilliance with a scathingly clever mystery. This is the first book I have read by Fredric Brown, but I am now hopelessly and helplessly hooked.<br />And just as a teaser, here is an important verse of Lewis Carroll's that has a rather special meaning in Night of the Jabberwock:<BR>As I was climbing up the stair,<BR>I met a man who wasn't there<BR>He wasn't there again today<BR>I wish that man would go away	2002-08-15

A beautiful, yet troubled woman who has entered the detective's office looking for help, the down-on-his-luck detective who talks hard and drinks harder, a city that is in the grip of a crime-wave and a cracker of a mystery that builds to a terrific and unexpected ending.<br />We are introduced to Milo Milodragovitch and his hard-drinking, drug-taking, skirt-chasing ways. Milo's on the edge after two failed marriages, a failing business and a drinking problem. He makes no apologies for any of his bad habits and is prepared to blow off anyone who has a problem with him. The woman who has entered his office steals his heart and asks him to find her brother who has been missing for the past three weeks. It's a case that he doesn't really want to take, but does because, as he freely admits, she is such a stunning woman he'd do anything on the off-chance she might go to bed with him.<br />If anyone ever wanted to get a taste for modern hardboiled noir fiction, this would be the perfect book to read. I found myself drawn right into the book and could picture the town of Meriwether perfectly and at times I could picture myself occupying a stool at Mahoney's bar, the imagery is so vivid.	2002-08-09

As usual you get a great opportunity to stick the brain into neutral as the intrepid team from NUMA outwit another dastardly fiend hell-bent on destroying the world.<br />The villain this time is a Russian mega-millionaire who thinks he has found a way to prove that he is the rightful heir to the Romanov throne and thus will become the new ruler of Russia. At the same time, he has devised a cunning plan to destroy the US seaboard and alter the climates to make Russia the most powerful nation on the planet. Sounds perfectly reasonable to me as far as crazy megalomaniacal schemes go.<br />This is the usual fast-paced adventure that requires you to suspend your belief at the door. It maintains interest by making use of numerous underwater vehicles and gadgets and the genius computer wizardry of Hiram Yaegar gets a solid workout. As a long-time fan of the Clive Cussler books, both Dirk Pitt and NUMA Files, I found this to be yet another fantastic escape vehicle.	2002-08-09

It's a fast-paced story with your standard heartless killers as the bad guys, up against a nice-guy protagonist, who describes himself as a coward, working against the odds and his own self doubts to try to overcome them.	2002-08-08

He doesn't particularly look forward to the case but, with nothing better to do, he begins to sift through old ground in between cups of bourbon-laced coffee.<br />The Matt Scudder character is the important feature of this book as we follow his tortured journey around New York City chasing up clues in a long-dead case. He unearths clues and leads as a good detective should, but it's his battle with the bottle that proves the most fascinating story. He finally gets a good hard smack across the chops in this book which may help put him on the road to sobriety, at least, it scares him enough to consider he may need help.<br />This is another fine example of an outstanding modern hardboiled mystery, just part of an outstanding hardboiled series.	2002-08-02

A note here is appropriate: it is strongly advisable to read Birdman before reading this book.<br />Caffery's past continues to haunt him as he is still unable to deal with the disappearance of his brother, Ewan, 28 years ago. The latest case brings back the same feelings of rage and helplessness he felt as a child, so much so that it begins to affect his objectivity.<br />The details of the case that affects him so deeply involve a boy who is taken from his family home where he and his parents had been terrorised for days by an intruder. The boy was later found, dead and showing signs that he had been sexually assaulted and tortured. The chilling part is that Jack is sure that the man who did this was interrupted and would strike again, an opinion that is revealed to us to be right on the money.<br />A parallel story involving Jack's brother ties in nicely to the case and focuses Jack's, and consequently our, attention on the dim dark world of paedophilia. The story of the disappearance of Ewan is familiar to those who have read Birdman and it is carried on here. Jack is determined to solve the mystery that has been plaguing him regardless of what he may find. Although it's a tragic story and strains all sorts of friendships and relationships, it proves to be a vital part of the plot.<br />I particularly appreciated the diary pages at the end of the book and thought they were a brilliant addendum to the story. They gave us a peek at the distorted mind behind the unspeakable acts and the justification the guy had for his actions in the story.<br />Mo Hayder has produced another thriller that deals with a seemingly deranged maniac performing horrific crimes on innocents. She walks a fine line between fascination and repulsion, tipping to the former emotion in my opinion. My recommendation to absolutely devour this book comes with a caveat that it contains graphic scenes involving children. If you don't like reading about these kinds of subjects, then this book is not for you.	2002-08-01

Seemingly coming to his rescue with an offer of some good money for a simple job comes the shady character Dewitt Albright. Against his better judgement, he takes the job that involves finding a woman named Daphne Monet.<br />Easy Rawlins is a very interesting character set in an even more interesting time. He is a black war veteran who has witnessed plenty of death and mayhem. All of this has helped to prepare him to stand up for himself rather than submit. A trait that tends to get him into his fair share of trouble.<br />Although he's never done any detective work in the past, Easy quickly discovers that he has an aptitude and a liking for his new role and can see it becoming his new vocation. His new found dedication is soon shaken, however, after running across a number of dead bodies and homicide detectives, the latter of who take a hands-on approach during interviews.<br />This is a marvellous introduction to the Easy Rawlins series that brings the post-war era to life with startling clarity. Place an interesting mystery and a likable, go-getter protagonist on top and it adds up to a very enjoyable book.	2002-07-30

If it's possible, the predicaments he gets into are even more outlandish and are described even more vividly by Westlake.<br />The genius of the Dortmunder books is the brilliant simplicity of the plans that can't fail, followed by their inevitable failure, usually through a most unexpected foul-up. This timeout, Dortmunder is asked by regular scary man Tiny Bulcher to help recover a holy relic for his cousin's homeland. It just happens that the relic is the femur of an obscure saint, somehow important to the country being granted entry into the United Nations. As the title suggests...don't ask.<br />Once again, Dortmunder devises an ingeniously simple plan to recover the relic from the embassy of a neighbouring country. Once again his plan works perfectly - almost. Once again he must devise an even more brilliant plan which takes more risks and leaves him open to even greater failure.<br />Hilariously, the boys from the Continental Detective Agency make another ill-fated appearance. This mob would have to be the unluckiest group of blokes in New York. They continue to be the only people who consistently come off second best to Dortmunder and his crew.<br />This is the eighth book in the Dortmunder series and carries on the tradition in fine style. As a reader who has read the previous seven, the sly references to incidents that occurred in earlier books gave the feeling of being a part of the team, reminiscing about past glories. For a very humorous and enjoyable caper, this is an extremely worthwhile read.	2002-07-26

For some, the war never ends and the hatred never diminishes. The joy of the hunt and the thrill of the kill must continue forever. Such is the mindset of the man known as The Shadow Man. For the elderly Jewish survivors who now live in Florida, their worst fears are realised as the horrors of their past come back to haunt them and, even worse, to kill them.<br />The Shadow Man was one of the people in Nazi Germany who was known as a catcher. A Jew who worked with the Gestapo identifying and flushing out Jewish citizens before sending them to the concentration camps. Seeing him and being seen by him was thought to be synonymous to death. Of all the catchers in Berlin, The Shadow Man was the most feared and most hated.<br />When one of the Miami Beach residents swears she has spotted The Shadow Man right there in the neighbourhood, the news is treated with some scepticism. But when the number of suspicious deaths begins to grow, the unthinkable possibility becomes more and more likely. The Miami police are up against a man who has had over 50 years experience. Okay, he may be a senior citizen now, but he's still very good at what he does and is just as determined as ever.<br />There are some remarkable characterisations in this story making it more than just a run of the mill suspense drama. From the suicidal ex-cop, Simon Winter, to prosecutor / avenger Espy Martinez and junkie Leroy Jefferson. All make vital contributions and at times provide some telling insights into what may motivate different people to act.<br />This is a fast paced thriller with a slightly skewed spin that manages to capture the attention from the opening page.	2002-07-24

The book opens with the shooting murder of a 14-year-old girl and her baby daughter, the victims of a drive-by attack. From this incident the local black community have said enough's enough and asks Hawk for help and, in turn, Hawk asks Spenser to join him.<br />Their mission is to drive the local gang from the project they have been terrorising. This project is known to the locals as Double Deuce. To achieve their goal, Hawk and Spenser devise one of their brilliant plans which is rather reminiscent of poking an ant nest with a stick to see what happens.<br />I thought this was a case of a great opportunity that just wasn't fulfilled to it's potential. We got to know Hawk a lot better in this book due to the much larger role he plays in the job, and this was a terrific treat. Unfortunately, a good proportion of the book degenerates into a posturing standoff between Hawk and the gang leader as they tried to prove who was the tougher man.<br />That being said, any Spenser book is an enjoyable read thanks to the snappy dialogue delivered with a wry sense of humour. The banter between Spenser and Hawk is always one of the highlights of a Spenser story. Once again, I enjoyed the comfort of disappearing into Spenser's world, even if I was a little let down by a few aspects.	2002-07-22

It is a violent, dangerous place where employees have to be escorted from the office in groups to ensure their safety, and no-one walks the streets at night for fear of losing their life. Within this grim picture comes a proposed 51st state. A haven where crime will be unheard of. Entry into the state will be closely controlled and stable families will be welcomed with open arms.<br />But it's here, in the budding crime-free zone that an alarming number of young girls have gone missing with a few of them being found dead. Officially they were reported to have met with an unfortunate accident, but those in the know can see that they are dealing with the work of a serial killer. This is something thought impossible in a crime-free state and is potentially devastating to the chances of the state being accepted into the Union.<br />The concept of a new state raised a very interesting point. It was created to give people a place to live in safety, when really, all it achieved was the creation of a false sense of security in the minds of the residents. By instilling the thought that the state was crime-free, the residents did not take any precautions against crime. No one locked their doors or took the proper care when walking at night and the police didn't know how to properly process a crime scene. Basically, an environment was created where a criminal could work with virtual impunity.<br />Although the book starts out with a very clever idea that made me pause for thought about where the world is heading, Katzenbach tended to take the long road to get to the final showdown, which then seemed to pass by with an air of inevitability. Once the concept of the new state was established along with all the differences it would bring, the rest of the book just read as a standard serial killer story, granted, with a couple of twists thrown in for good measure.	2002-07-16

His interviewing technique is pure genius as he gleans every possible scintilla of information from his subject.<br />This is a classic police procedural as DI Peach visits suspect after suspect and slowly puts together the puzzle of who murdered Claptrap Clark. The entertainment lies in Peach's interviewing style, an elaborate act which is designed to keep his adversary unbalanced and in a constant state of nervousness.<br />Hilarious scenes are provided intermittently throughout the book when Peach reports to his superior, Superintendent Thomas Tucker. Showing as little respect as possible, putting forward outrageous theories and baiting his boss at every opportunity, I found myself looking forward to every meeting with ever greater enthusiasm.<br />This is a terrific book that provides a very well constructed mystery, investigated by a character who provides consistent entertainment. It's part of a series of books featuring Inspector Peach, which is good news because one book of Peach is definitely not enough.	2002-07-10

So much so that he tends to mete out the maximum punishment possible to offenders brought before him, earning him the nickname \\"Maximum Bob\\".<br />The book's protagonist is Kathy Baker who works as a probation officer which puts her in occasional contact with Judge Gibbs. It seems that Judge Gibbs takes a liking to her, so much so that he comes up with a very imaginative way to remove his wife from the picture to leave him free to pursue Kathy. What has escaped the lust-filled judge's attention is that his affection is not being returned.<br />As a probation officer, her job also puts Kathy in contact with criminals and this is where the third main character is introduced. Elvin Crowe is a mean piece of work who has recently been released from prison and it's obvious the rehabilitation didn't stick. Elvin somehow comes across someone who is willing to pay him to kill Judge Gibbs, who just happened to be the presiding judge during Elvin's case in which he drew...yep, that's right, the maximum penalty.<br />It was hard to decide how to treat this book. While it contains quite a few scenes that border on the farcical thanks to some offbeat characterisations, there is also the ever-present undertone of menace tinged with despair. What kept wrenching me back whenever I began losing myself in the book's humour was the realisation that lives were constantly in danger.<br />Maximum Bob is an enjoyable book exposing us to Florida complete with heat, psychos, druggies and alligators.	2002-07-10

She has just been involved in a car accident, which looks very much like an attempted suicide. To top things off she's suffering amnesia as a result of the accident and can't explain the events leading up to the crash.<br />It's the all-important amnesia that is the key to this mystery/thriller as the police are desperate to piece together events leading up to the accident. They want to know whether Jinx was so distraught over the break-up with her fiancé that she tried to kill herself, or was there some other motive at work. They become even more desperate to get inside Jinx's mind when a couple of bodies are discovered dumped in suspicious circumstances.<br />From this point we are taken on a somewhat surreal journey through Jinx's life as police, and Jinx herself for that matter, try to work out what actually happened. Had she attempted suicide or was it staged by her to look as though someone tried to murder her. Or was it something more sinister, a murder attempt made to look like suicide.<br />Minette Walters has written a very interesting story of intrigue providing us with plenty of possible scenarios and suspects. As readers, we are displayed with a picture at the start of the book that is very incomplete and blurry. As the story continues, the picture is gradually filled in and starts to become sharper and easy to understand. It was very well done by the author. Another aspect of the book I found particularly interesting was the character of Adam Kingsley, Jinx's father. He never actually made an appearance in the book, yet his presence is almost overbearing thanks to the regular references to him. By keeping him at a distance to us he seemed much more menacing.<br />Although I thought this was quite a good story, it tended to ramble on a little in the middle and so, fell flat, before it was gatheredup again for a strong ending.	2002-07-08

Before he can make too many inroads into the case, the prostitute is dead and the policeman is arrested on suspicion of being responsible. Something doesn't ring true to Scudder, particularly when he finds out the cop has been providing information to Internal Affairs, putting him on the out with his fellow officers.<br />This is one of the darker books in the Matt Scudder series with Matt sinking into a growing depression and succumbing to the bottle with increasing regularity. Although sinking heavily into alcoholism in this book, he still manages to hold it all together enough to perform his job admirably well. <br />Scudder is a very interesting character, but he is also defined by the actions that he can't explain, even to himself. A perfect example of this is his habit of tithing. He admits that he is in no way religious, yet every time he is paid, he tithes ten per cent of his earnings to the nearest church. The amusing part is that Scudder can't explain why he does it and reacts to it with head-shaking bemusement.<br />This is a typical hardboiled mystery, sometimes despairingly so, featuring a character who grows more fascinating and enigmatic the more we find out about him.	2002-07-05

Instead, he witnesses her husband physically abusing her and is compelled to take action to save her. The wash up of the opening scene is that the husband winds up dead and Marty disposes of the body and sets about trying to supply himself with an alibi.<br />The rest of the book is a terrific account of the resulting murder trial and the defense pit on for a man who looks, for all the world as if he's guilty. <br />I thought some of the more inspired parts of the book came from being made privy to Marty's thought processes as he set up his alibi. He kept assuring himself that everything would be alright and that he didn't have a thing to worry about. This was in stark contrast to reality when he would open his mouth and undo all of his carefully laid plans.<br />This book is brilliantly plotted and very cleverly set out. It casts doubt at every turn, even to the point of causing me to wonder about whether Marty was deluding himself about his relationship with Rachel, the star of his peepshow. The courtroom scenes were continually snappy and interesting which seems to be increasingly rare with legal thrillers. The fortune of the protagonist swings wildly from witness to witness which caused me to wonder how on earth it was going to end up.<br />Here is a book that deals with a defendant who is patently guilty, I mean, he as much as admits that to us very early on. It's just a question of finding out exactly what it is he's guilty of.	2002-07-02

The man, known as `The Spinner' was stringing along 3 different blackmail victims, but became aware that one of them was trying to kill him. Unfortunately, he doesn't know which one. He wants Scudder to hold onto a package for him that is to be opened in the event of his death, which is all too inevitable.<br />Naturally enough, Scudder accepts and then honours his agreement to find out who the murderer is. In order to flush out The Spinner's murderer, Matt decides to confront each of the people being blackmailed with the news that they're still not off the hook in the hope that one of them will blink. The obvious downside to this plan is that he would be making himself a target which, if you forget about the subsequent 13 Matt Scudder books for a moment, makes for some very tense and exciting reading.<br />This is quite a fast-paced mystery that gives us multiple suspects to choose from with the wrong choice possibly proving fatal. Scudder is still an introspective soul who seems to view the world and his place in it with bemusement. Lawrence Block doesn't waste a word in his narrative which serves to move things along nicely.<br />It's another compelling entry in a series that I think fans of hardboiled crime books would love.	2002-06-27

Minette Walters has written another fine thriller , this time it's based around an enclosed, lower class community called Bassindale Row, known to the locals as Acid Row.<br />The problems in Acid Row start when rumours begin to circulate that a paedophile has been secretly housed in their midst. This rumour is neither confirmed nor denied, but is escalated to fact in the minds of the locals when a young girl, Amy Biddulph, goes missing. Things come to a head when a march is organised to protest the housing of the `nonce' and among the protestors are the inevitable troublemakers who are determined to see the day end in bloodshed. The situation is made even worse when the entrances to the community are barricaded, making it impossible for police or ambulances to gain access.<br />From the beginning of the riot, there are two stories running in parallel. There is the story of the riot outside the house of the alleged paedophile and there is also the investigation into Amy Biddulph's disappearance. Both of these stories highlight how people's perceptions can rule over how they act and react to a given circumstance.<br />While focussing on the riot, there were two important aspects highlighted. The first was from the point of view of the rioters outside the house and the rage that was barely held in check. The second was from inside the house where a young female doctor was trapped with the two men who were the real objects of the crowd's hatred. Even within the house, while their lives were in danger from the angry mob, yet another drama was being played out, significantly adding to the tension.<br />The only problem I had with the story was the very clichéd ending which has been done to death by just about every bad sit-com ever made. I just didn't feel that such a hard-hitting story dealing with real life problems deserved to finish with two of the characters sitting around reflecting on the events and going through the lessons that they had learnt from the experience. The story was well told enough to stand on it's own.<br />Take out the last chapter and I felt that Minette Walters has produced a captivating social comment that is all too true and accurate.	2002-06-27

We learn that, while he works as a private detective, he's not licensed and will do investigative work in return for \\"gifts\\". We find out why he left the police force and the bulk of his personal life. We also find out that he's rarely without a drink in his hand. Apart from the character introduction, we are treated to a mystery that firstly, is more than it first appears, and secondly, displays Scudder's dogged determination perfectly.<br />To start off the Matt Scudder series, he is asked by a man to investigate why his daughter was murdered. Not how, not who, but why. Her killer was her male room-mate who subsequently hanged himself in his prison cell after he was arrested. The father just wants to know why she died to set his own mind at rest.<br />This is not a terrifically complex thriller that involves a lot of action sequences, rather it's a gritty hardboiled mystery that gradually uncovers facts while we get to know the protagonist. It serves it's purpose well as an introduction to the series and promises to hook you as a Matt Scudder fan.	2002-06-26

He is enlisted by the American Senior Officer in the camp to act as defending attorney for Lincoln Scott even though his qualifications consist of an incomplete law degree to his name. Scott is a fellow prisoner who has been charged with murdering another prisoner, he's an outsider in the camp and is the only black man.<br />The race issue is a major theme within the book, and Hart and Scott realise that the Germans aren't their only enemies during the trial, with the prisoners threatening to take matters into their own hands.<br />The fact that the trial takes place within a Prisoner of War camp adds an intriguing dimension to this book. The added complexities involved with living as a prisoner of war while trying to defend a man accused of murder makes this an extremely thought provoking story. Yet as the trial gets underway Hart becomes convinced that there is much more to the case than meets the eye. Evidence is tampered with, the Germans show an extraordinary amount of interest in proceedings and even the American Commanding Officers seem to have their own agendas. Meanwhile, the future continues to look bleak for Lincoln Scott.<br />I found this to be a gripping book that had me constantly dwelling on what life must have been like for the men who suffered through their captivity during the war. The scenes within the escape tunnel were so vivid that I was actually experiencing mild feelings of claustrophobia just reading about it.<br />A good courtroom drama combined with a thorough description of life in a POW camp adds up to a very compelling book.	2002-06-24

A body found in a swollen river during an unusually heavy downpour turns out to be that of a local priest who had been murdered. In the course of his investigation, Detective Inspector Percy Peach learns that the priest was already in trouble within the church for \\"inappropriate contact with a number of young boys.\\" The obvious murder suspects are the parents of the molested boys.<br />Once again, Peach is faced with a handful of unlikely suspects and has to use all of his experience to work out who the murderer is. All the while, his ongoing battle with his superior, Chief Superintendent Thomas Tucker rages on providing humorous interludes to ease the tension of the case.<br />The Percy Peach series of books is a largely overlooked series that I feel fortunate to have discovered. The Mysteries are clever, the characters are strangely endearing even though they're not trying to be and the result is that I'm more than happy to keep coming back for more.	2002-06-21

Fortunately, this mood is tempered by his adopted daughter Alafair, who he first took care of in Heaven's Prisoners. She has provided a spark for his affections and has bestowed on him a much needed reason t act more responsibly.<br />Dave is drawn into danger, which in turn endangers Alafair, after a chance meeting with an old college room-mate named Dixie Lee Pugh, who is now a washed up jazz musician. Dixie Lee feels he is in some trouble after overhearing a couple of men discussing a murder and wants Dave to investigate. He only actually becomes involved after failing to control his temper which lands him in trouble with the law. To get himself out of this trouble he moves temporarily to Montana which is the setting for the bulk of the story. He takes Alafair with him rather than leaving her with his relatives, underlining his new found sense of responsibility.<br />James Lee Burke does a wonderful job of capturing the mood of a setting and incorporating it into the story. The Louisiana setting of this and his earlier books proved his affinity with the area with special highlights given to the cuisine. A new facet was uncovered be his wondrous descriptions of the Bitterroot Valley and surrounding locales in Montana.<br />Having now read the first three books in the Dave Robicheaux series I've found that my appetite for more has been whetted. His forthright style and general toughness in the face of adversity makes him a character who is easy to cheer for.	2002-06-17

It features a hit man (naturally) who goes by the name of Keller. Keller is a seething mass of emotional contradictions. He thinks nothing of garrotting a man to death, yet gets all choked up himself when he sees animals in captivity.<br />I found that each time I started to empathise with Keller I was jolted by the realisation that - hang on, the man is a heartless murderer! It was quite a difficult hurdle to overcome. What was even harder for me to reconcile was the humorous mood of the book that dealt with the murders as quickly and efficiently as Keller himself did. This was probably the tone and the effect that Lawrence Block was hoping to achieve, but it was unsettling all the same.<br />Now, having expressed the aspects of the book that made me uncomfortable, I should point out that I found it very compelling reading and could virtually not put it down. A bit like driving past a road accident I suppose. Lawrence Block manages to portray the anti-hero very well in many of his books and almost pulls it off again here. When Keller's not working you could almost class him as a nice guy.	2002-06-13

Changes that catch the usually unflappable bulldog of a man a little off guard. But, in typical style, he adapts quickly and turns things into his favour.<br />The first change is his nomination for membership at the exclusive North Lancashire Golf Club, a fact that he delights in throwing in the face of his boss and arch-enemy Chief Superintendent Tommy Bloody Tucker. The second change is the appointment of a new Detective Sergeant to partner Peach. The mere fact that Chief Superintendent Tucker is delighted with the appointment is enough to put Percy on his guard, but he is shocked nonetheless.<br />The murder investigation facing Percy just happens to be centred around the North Lancashire Golf Club and involves a corpse that was discovered after draining a lake on the course. It turns out the corpse was put in the lake 2 years ago and was a local girl who was \\"a bit free with her affections\\" around town.<br />This is another delightful entry to a very enjoyable series featuring a protagonist who is unapologetically politically incorrect, as cunning as a fox and as determined as a dog with a bone. He is an intimidating presence which serves him well when facing down his suspects and delights in baiting his boss, which provides many amusing moments. I feel fortunate to have stumbled upon this series of books and think that anyone who loves a good mystery will enjoy it too.	2002-06-11

Dave can tell that today is not going to be a good day. He has to call on all the training he learnt many years ago in Vietnam as an army lieutenant. His specialty back then was covert operations and was armed with a vast knowledge of dirty tricks and ability to outthink the enemy. This knowledge proves to be of the utmost importance for his survival of this bewildering attack.<br />Why is he being hunted so determinedly? Why do his pursuers seem to be such professionals?<br />Throughout the chase he goes through a series of flashbacks as all of his training comes back to him. We find out where he learnt all his dirty tricks and booby traps, how he knows what his pursuers will do next and how to escape the traps that are set for him. The bulk of the action is confined within a 50-storey building as Dave tries to escape and his pursuers try to keep him penned in. With ingenious evasive manoeuvres and devious booby traps, Dave races from floor to floor as the net tightens and the number of chasers grows.<br />This is an action-all-the-way hell-raiser that is all the more enjoyable for it's unbelievable moments. There are sequences that remind me somewhat of the movie Die Hard, but was also refreshing in it's originality at the same time, funnily enough. A terrific ending capped off a very enjoyable book, containing everything required of a first-rate action adventure.	2002-06-09

His driven nature is tipped off after the bones of an abused boy are found after being buried twenty years ago. Although it's an old case, he still lets nothing get in his way to try to solve the case, and even while working with such determination still reprimands himself for letting the case progress too slowly. He's balanced enough now to keep his anger in check and, while still not particularly respectful towards his superior officers, he's not so outwardly hostile.<br />For a series that began as hardboiled as they come, it has mellowed dramatically over time. In fact, I would probably lean more towards classifying City of Bones as a police procedural. As usual, Harry is as persistent as a dog with a bone and is determined to find the boy's killer, no matter how long ago the crime was committed. At times though, in typical Harry Bosch style, he's so determined that he forgets he has a partner and reverts to his old lone-wolf ways.<br />The ever-changing fortunes of Harry Bosch are given another twist here, which continues to make the series fresh and interesting.<br />City of Bones documents a satisfying investigation that is always moving forward, which makes it a quick and compelling book to read. Like all of Connelly's previous books, I enjoyed it from cover to cover.	2002-06-05

He says he is innocent of the crime he was convicted for and, after talking to him and doing a little bit of investigating, Matt agrees that Ferguson may have been unfairly treated. He decides to write a story about Ferguson, and its a good story. Heck, its so good that he wins a couple of awards. Not only that, but its convincing enough to get the case reopened. <br />Butwhat if he got it wrong! What if he was lied to and was manipulated by a killer into helping him be released from prison.<br />Suddenly, there is doubt in every piece of evidence and every word of a confession so that Matt finds it difficult to reconcile the possible harm he has done. Added to Matts woes is another Death Row inmate, a Hannibal Lector type, who has taken it upon himself to play all sorts of mind games with him. In order to ease his mind and try to minimise any damage done by possibly setting a killer free, he teams up with the detective he virtually accused of being dirty and starts investigating the man he helped acquit.<br />John Katzenbach is a master at putting his characters through psychological turmoil. Theyre left to wrestle with their consciences as they dwell heavily on the consequences of their actions. Its this inner conflict that dictates the flow of the story and is a remarkably effective tool to build up the feeling of tension. It all adds up to a stunning thriller filled with doubts and blind alleys.	2002-06-04

Where should I start?<br />This is a murder mystery set at Augusta National during the week of The Masters. Now, for golf fans whose interest may have been piqued at the prospect of reading a book based around the most prestigious golf tournament in the world, be warned, the author has obviously never been to a golf tournament nor seen one on television. This book lacks one important aspect - credibility. When basing a story around a true-life event, it would pay to learn a little about the actual event, wouldn't you think?<br />To even suggest that professional golfers sit around in the clubhouse after their round and wait for someone to post the scores on a noticeboard to see whether they've made the cut is absolutely ridiculous. And this didn't happen once but again, at the end of the tournament we were begged to believe that the tournament winner would be announced the same way.<br />Aside from the laughable portrayal of the life of a professional golfer (a caddie berating the professional for his poor club selection!), the police dialogue contained every bad cliché ever included in a pulp magazine short story. The detective investigating the case was a normal police officer working a case until she came to arrest someone. For some reason she then turned into a bad parody of the tough policeman, trotting out cringe-worthy lines like, \\"Tell it to the judge\\" and calling the suspect, whom she had known for a day or so, a \\"perp\\" and a \\"dirt-bag\\".<br />To top off what I honestly thought was a lousy story came a cartoon-style ending to finally catch the murderer. Really, it was Tom Cat chasing Jerry Mouse stuff and had my top lip involuntarily curling up in disgust.	2002-05-31

Not so with Parker. Apart from a quick glance in the mirror to make sure he looked different, he is completely unaffected.<br />This reaction probably best sums up this mysterious and dark character. He always prefers to take the most prudent action rather than be ruled by his emotions, giving him a cold, calculating persona. But these same qualities also make him very efficient and strangely likable.<br />After receiving his new appearance, Parker goes straight back to work in planning an armoured truck heist. He has some misgivings about the job because it involves someone he has never worked with before, but this is just another contingency for him to plan around. Indeed, it appears that Parker has been built with no reverse gear installed. Once a course of action has been planned, it's full steam ahead and as obstacles rise up, as they inevitably do in this caper, he deals with them head on, scarcely breaking stride.<br />This is the second Parker book, following his appearance in The Hunter and is a thoroughly enjoyable story. The no-nonsense attitude of Parker, whether it's going ahead with a plan or casually shooting someone in the ankle makes for very entertaining, if a little cold-blooded, reading.	2002-05-30

(Severn House Crime)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Whodunit Worth Reading	This is a well constructed whodunit that contains a group of suspects who are all given a motive to kill the victim, Tom Harrison. Tom shared his large family home with his 40 year old son and family. He also shared it, rather unwillingly, with 4 ex-prisoners who are being assisted back into society by his son's generosity. Tom meets his untimely demise the night after announcing that he was going to sell the house, which would force everyone to look elsewhere to live.<br />The investigating officer on the case is Detective Inspector Percy Peach and his specialty is to get his suspects off balance and then keep them that way through his in-your-face interviewing technique. It's during these scenes that the lighter moments shine through, something that is rather unexpected during a murder investigation.<br />As with all good whodunits, there are plenty of suspects with lots of reasons for wanting someone dead. The investigation is light on technical details but heavy on the characters themselves. I'm happy to say I didn't pick the murderer, but then I am a bit of a dill when it comes to things like that.<br />For traditional English crime aficionados who appreciate a touch of levity in the course of proceedings, this Percy Peach book should fill the bill.	2002-05-28

This book continues the development of Merci's character as she advances through the ranks of the sheriff's department.<br />The case facing Merci is a difficult one for her because, once again, it involves a sheriff's deputy, bringing back all the mistakes she made investigating a fellow cop in the past. Archie Wildcraft and his wife are shot in the early hours of the morning. Archie's wife, Gwen is killed and Archie is critically wounded. Merci has to work out whether the shooting was an attempted double homicide, or an attempted murder suicide. A third option of whether the scene was set up to look like a murder suicide can not be ruled out either. Merci continues to prove that she is a very thorough and capable investigator as she unravels the facts from the misleading evidence.<br />Although she's a good investigator and has a strong personality, she is constantly reminded of her past that affects how she deals with the present. It's because of the continual references back to the earlier books that I would strongly recommend reading them before reading this one if at all possible.<br />I thought the actual investigation in this book was of lower importance compared to the development of Merci Rayborn. The Focus seemed to be more on how the investigation affected her than on reaching any meaningful conclusion. Forunately, both goals were achieved. The case was closed with the important questions answered and Merci's life seems to be stabilising. I can see her character developing even further in future books.	2002-05-27

He's also an ex-cellmate of John Dortmunder's who has just been released from prison and unexpectedly shows up on Dortmunder's doorstep to ask him to help to recover some of the loot he had stashed away before going away. He'd buried it in a coffin, behind a library, in a small town almost 30 years ago. The problem is, the town and the surrounding valley have since been flooded under 50 feet of water to form a reservoir.<br />As an ideas man, Dortmunder's specialty is to come up with brilliant plans but this time he's faced with a perplexing conundrum. How do you sneak into a reservoir that is off-limits to the public, find a box buried in ground that is also underwater? Well, one thing's for sure, if John Dortmunder and his gang is involved, it won't go without a hitch and the results will be hilarious.<br />The crew backing up from previous books are the ever reliable Andy Kelp, Tiny Bulcher who's starting to seem almost human now, driving specialist Stan Murch, Murch's Mom and Dortmunder's better half, May. May seems to be playing a more important role in each successive outing and is a fine foil for Dortmunder doom and gloom attitude.<br />This is an unusual Dortmunder book because it is at least twice as long as any of the previous entries in the series. This serves to give Dortmunder room to come up with even more brilliant plans. It also allows us to get to know the regular cast in much greater depth. For example, we finally find out what Murch's Mom's first name is in this book. Westlake also manages to introduce us to a few more offbeat characters that complement the regular mob nicely.<br />As usual, Donald Westlake has given us a riotous caper that is simply a joy to read. In order to fully understand each character's idiosyncrasies I would recommend reading the earlier books first, an enjoyable task in itself, although it's not absolutely necessary. There are numerous references to earlier capers, but these only serveto give the reader the feeling of being an insider to the gang, the references don't spoil any plots.	2002-05-22

This meeting establishes for us the dislike for one another these two have. From the moment this meeting finishes, the action begins and doesn't let up.<br />We follow Rachel, who works for the NRO a government agency responsible for handling sensitive information. After a rushed meeting with none other than the President, she finds herself winging her way north to Milne Island inside the Arctic Circle. She is then faced with what could best be described as the greatest discovery in earth's history.<br />Just as the reader is getting over this whirlwind opening, the tone takes a sinister turn and Rachel, along with a couple of scientists find themselves fighting for their lives. Meanwhile, tensions are no less charged back in Washington with political powerbrokers hard at work trying to control the media while keeping one eye on the events far to their north.<br />One small annoying aspect of the book was Dan Brown's insistence on endlessly drawing out the big earth-shattering revelations. Rather than come straight out and tell us what all the fuss is about, he put us through a big song and dance routine time and again until I felt like putting my hands into the pages of the book and throttling it out of the book. It became a tad frustrating after the fifth or sixth time it happened. It went something along the lines of, \\"So, why was I summoned here so urgently?\\" and the answer would invariably be \\"Perhaps I should show you, if you would just walk this way.\\" I'd much prefer to be told and then walk that way.<br />Apart from this minor gripe, I think this is a very entertaining thriller that makes good use of the latest stealth technology, presented in a believable and enjoyable story.	2002-05-20
1539129:US	47964988	RMF5IO0LV9X3C	0399148450	627668908	Widow's Walk: A Spenser Novel (Spenser Mysteries)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Don�t Expect To Be Challenged	This may not be the best entry of the Spenser series, but it does serve to while away the hours in amused comfort, happy in the knowledge that Spenser's still out there in all his brash glory. There's nothing particularly deep or clever about Widow's Walk, nor does the Spenser character grow or develop, but then, they can't all be zingers, can they?<br />Spenser is called in by lawyer Rita Fiore to help prove that her client, the amazingly vacuous Mary Smith, did not murder her husband. Not an easy task when a lot of the evidence points directly at her, she has a lousy alibi and she stands to receive 10 million dollars thanks to her husband's life insurance policy.<br />As is his usual method, Spenser proceeds to ask as many questions of as many people as possible hoping to eventually discover something meaningful. This time out, it seems to take a little longer than usual with fewer results. However, his winning smile and unique questioning technique eventually sees him making enough headway to put together a mishmash of clues. I found the ending pretty unsatisfying and more confusing than anything. It was almost as if it were more important to showcase Spenser's smart-aleck verbal sparring than it was to wrap up the case for the reader.<br />Due to the large amount of dialogue and the double spaced lines, Widow's Walk is a very quick read that is probably best used to put your brain into neutral for a few hours. Those who have read the earlier Spenser books should forgive Parker this one, those who haven't would probably be best served in going back to try a few of the earlier books first.	2002-05-19

Alternatively, for those with stronger constitutions, the warning should be more along the lines of ensuring that you've got some time up your sleeve because this one's going to hook you and hold on tight. Mo Hayder has produced a stunningly grisly chiller that is as gripping as it is stomach churning.<br />D.I. Jack Caffery is the new recruit to the Area Major Investigation Pool (AMIP) team, which is the Met's crack murder investigation unit. He's thrown in at the deep end when five mutilated bodies are discovered, buried at a work site. It's only during the autopsy that Caffery finds out just how grim the case is likely to become after a rather shocking discovery.<br />Although he's young, Caffery is a driven and at times desperate detective who manages to remain unphased no matter what is thrown at him. He is also haunted by his own demons in his past, continually blaming himself for his own perceived shortcomings. He is a strong protagonist who is made all the more likable for his faults, both real and imagined. It's his driven nature that controls the frantic pace that the investigation maintains and compelled me to keep the pages turning as quickly as I could.<br />A short word on the shocking nature of the book to which I alluded in the opening paragraph. This refers to the detailed descriptions of the mutilated bodies, and the actions and feelings of the psychopath responsible. While not enough to give you nightmares, they were still sufficient to turn my stomach ever so slightly squeamish. In an era of some really bad bad-guys, Hayder has produced one who's right up there near the top of the sicko list.<br />I found this to be a wonderfully compelling story. Just when I felt that I had a pretty good handle on where it was headed, it suddenly threw me for a loop with a clever change of direction. It containsa well-constructed plot that clicked seamlessly into place and a strong protagonist to hold it all together.	2002-05-15

It's certain that this was no frenzied attack and it's also certain that the killer will eventually strike again. So unorthodox methods are required to stop him.<br />Roy Prescott is such an unorthodox method. He specialises in tracking down particularly hard to find criminals and brings them to justice. This justice is not usually within the limits of the law. Once Prescott begins to hunt, the tempo of the story immediately lifts as you sense that the game is afoot. We are treated to a series of confrontation scenes where the action is intense, punctuated by periods of relative inactivity as both men recover and prepare for the next sortie. It turns into a thrilling game of attack and counterattack.<br />Thomas Perry has virtually created a new sub-genre of his own, starting with the Jane Whitefield books and through Death Benefits and Pursuit. He has been specialising in books that depend on a person trying to disappear while the pursuers use all their considerable ingenuity to track them down. In this case, we witness a man-hunter at work as he alternately flushes and ambushes his prey. The tension is greatly increased because the hunted is not without significant survival skills and is very capable of switching from the role of the hunted into the hunter in the blink of an eye.<br />I found this to be a very enjoyable thriller thanks to the evenness of the contest. Told alternately from the perspective of both men, we are allowed into the minds of both men.	2002-05-09

Before reading the book, it would be wise to brush up on your Aussie slang, lest you get left behind. A quick test is provided at the end of this review to see if you're up to it.<br />In case you want to brave it without fortifying yourself with the lingo, err...language, here's a rundown as to what the book's about. Fair dinkum!<br />It's 1990 and the city of Melbourne is making a bid for the 1996 Olympic Games, and things are looking very promising. As far as the Bid Committee is concerned, they're a shoo-in, with only one possible cloud on the horizon. They want to ensure that the aboriginal people are on board when the IOC delegates hit town. So Murray Whelan is enlisted to keep things quiet on the aboriginal front. A simple job as far as he's concerned, it should be money for jam and then back to his job as advisor to the Minister for Water Supply.<br />And so it was until a young aboriginal athlete is bashed to death, and pretty soon, the whole bid starts to become jeopardised. As fast as Murray tries to fix the problems, the more they seem to crop up with the problems becoming more outlandish and, at times, amusing.<br />As we all know, the Melbourne bid for the 1996 Olympic Games failed and this is a humorous suggestion as to a contributing factor to it's failure.<br />Oh yes, and here's my test to see how hard or easy it will be to understand the language: \\"Take a squiz at this book, she's a real corker, fair dinkum. You'd be a real drongo to miss it and probably about as popular as a blowie at a barbie .So garn, give it a burl.\\"	2002-05-08

It would seem that Matt Scudder bought his ticket to the boneyard when he was instrumental in putting away James Leo Motley for aggravated assault. It turns out that Motley is rather psychotic and tends to hold a grudge before violently acting on it. And now that he's out of prison, Scudder's on top of his hit list, as is just about anyone remotely friendly to him.<br />In between trips to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, Scudder desperately tries to convince the police that Motley is a deranged killer and is responsible for a few of the latest deaths around town. Motley, however, is clever enough to provide no provable evidence for Scudder to give the police. So in the end, it looks as though it will have to come down to a man on man confrontation.<br />Apart from being worried about being murdered by a psychopath, Scudder is also working hard on not taking a drink. This is something he works at throughout the book and is very important to his character's development.<br />Scudder is a very complex character who appears to be finally getting some sort of grip on his life. Although appearing to bumble his way through some situations he is able to stand up during the important moments. This is quite a good thriller that occasionally loses momentum while attending AA meetings.	2002-05-06

The weather serves to act as a mirror of the mood of the local police force after they discover a body out on the bay.<br />We are introduced to Detective John Cardinal who, we learn, had been obsessed with a number of cases of missing youths. Cardinal was sure the cases were related and could turn out to be more than just missing persons. His superiors disagreed and ended up taking him off the cases. When a body is found, it looks as though it could be one of the missing people, so Cardinal is rushed back onto the case again. The greatest fear of the Algonquin Police Department could actually be reality - they may have a serial killer in the city.<br />When Cardinal is reassigned to work the homicide, he is also given a new partner. Lise Delorme has come straight from Special Operations to help out on the case and, unknown to Cardinal, is secretly investigating him thinking he may have been tipping off a known criminal in return for payoffs.<br />Around halfway through the book we are introduced to the killer and get an insight into his world. The pace of the book suddenly steps up a notch as the two storylines begin to run in parallel to one another, comparing Cardinal's progress in the investigation with the actual focus of his attention.<br />Tension is heightened by allowing us to be privy to the killer's identity, particularly when he takes a new victim. The case then turns into a race against time.<br />I found this to be an excellent thriller combining a tight storyline and methodical detective work with a strong sub-plot that threatens to unravel the whole investigation. The uncertainty provided by this sub-plot was very effective in creating doubt in the reader's mind as to what the outcome could possibly be.	2002-05-02

Quite simply, this is the best thriller I've read so far this year, and actually, very possibly last year too. This is an honest to goodness thought provoking situation that has been presented in a riveting way and totally captured my imagination. It was the perfect case of posing the question, \\"What would you do if this happened to you?\\"<br />When Dr Frederick (Ricky) Starks receives a letter on his 53rd birthday, he has no idea of the implications the message contained inside will have on his life. The anonymous writer, who signed the letter Rumplestiltskin, proposes that Ricky must play a game. In this game Ricky must either commit suicide or work out who Rumplestiltskin is. He has 15 days to achieve either of these objectives and if he fails, a family member will be chosen at random and destroyed. It's a fascinating scenario to open what turns out to be a very nicely constructed book.<br />To make things even more interesting, Ricky is helped out with clues as to who it was that he wronged in the past that caused this act of revenge. He is also allowed to ask three questions over the 15 days. To make things difficult, however, he keeps getting object lessons in how serious Rumplestiltskin is with his game. What Ricky finds becoming increasingly clear is that nothing can be taken at face value and his life, as he always accepted it, would very likely be changed for good by this experience.<br />I found this to be one of those page-turners that you just fly through, yet on the other hand keep trying to slow yourself down to try to savour every word. Although it's the first book of John Katzenbach's that I have read, it definitely won't be the last.	2002-04-30

But anyone known as The Ghost is going to be difficult to find. Enter Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs. Although The Ghost is on the run, he is also hunting down the latest boatload of illegal immigrants that he has personally brought to the US. For some reason he is trying to eliminate them all.<br />Rhyme teams up with a very interesting character in Sonny Li, a Chinese policeman who is also chasing The Ghost. Sonny adds a tremendous off-beat perspective to the investigation that is very refreshing.<br />One of the most interesting aspects of the book was in following the movements of two families of Chinese immigrants as they try to blend in to life in their new country. All the fears and uncertainties of living in a new country, combined with the fear of possibly being hunted down themselves manages to build the tension and gives you the feeling that confrontation will be inevitable.<br />Once again, Lincoln and Amelia are hard at it, gathering evidence and solving crimes with their own unique brand of teamwork. The funny thing is, although they are brilliant at what they do, neither of them are particularly likable characters. I find that I'm beginning to find it difficult to feel a great deal of affinity towards either because of their cold, defensive and downright rude attitudes to other people, colleagues and enemies alike.<br />Rhyme's home is now set up as a fully functioning forensic laboratory complete with experts in each particularly field to man it. Maybe it's because we're up to our 4th Lincoln Rhyme book, but the forensic part of the book is starting to feel a little mechanical and anti-climactic. That being said, the addition of the Chinese people and their customs has served to keep the story fresh and interesting.	2002-04-24

In this case, during the testing phase in which the virus is to be delivered to the test subjects via mosquitoes, some escape the test chamber, beginning a chain reaction of human devastation.<br />The saviour of the world comes in the form of two people who are seeking vengeance after their lives are touched by the creators of the new bio-weapon. The first is Stacey Richardson whose husband was a microbiologist working on a military installation. She wants answers after her husband is murdered but his body has been set up to look as though he committed suicide. The second is Cris Cunningham, an ex-marine and Gulf War hero who now carries a devastating virus thanks to an American-made bio-weapon used by the enemy. He's after vengeance, but is hampered by a serious drinking problem.<br />The action really takes off after a series of suspicious events in east Texas which lead Stacey and Cris to return to the scene of the disastrous test. In Cris' former life, he was a hobo, catching rides on passing freight trains and it's this means of transportation that they use as they chase a group of renegade killers who have gotten their hands on a batch of the deadly virus.<br />This is the classic underdog scenario where people who have been terribly wronged by those with power take matters into their own hands and fight back against the odds. Throw in a few off-beat characters and an unusual chase sequence and you've got a non-stop thriller that provides for very entertaining reading.	2002-04-23

Although the occupants are an order of nuns who have taken a vow of silence, they manage to let John know that in return for not turning him into the police, they would make use of his specialist skills. They want him to rescue a young nun who was taken from the convent by her father and is held on the top floor of a 76-storey building.<br />Dortmunder's flair for getting himself into and out of impossible situations are highlighted again as he attempts to breach the defences of a building that seems as impenetrable as any well guarded fortress can be. The ever-changing motley crew that he works with is made to seem even more motley by the inclusion of the skirt chasing (but never catching) Wilbur Howey. Tiny Bulcher is again along for the ride in all his menacing glory as are two regulars Andy Kelp and Stan Murch.<br />It's the humorous ways in which Dortmunder deals with setbacks that gives the book it's charm. Interest is added by limiting the field of play to one building. How to get in, save the girl and then out again is the problem he faces.<br />This is yet another satisfyingly entertaining entry in the Dortmunder series that proves this time that he has a caring side, or maybe it's just his guilty, greedy side rearing it's head again. Whichever it is, it's a pleasure to see it.	2002-04-19

Paul Brenner, from The General's Daughter, is back and is called out of retirement to go back to Vietnam to perform a vaguely described mission for his former bosses at CID. As a veteran, Vietnam is the last place in the world he wants to go, however curiosity eventually overcomes his misgivings and he agrees to the mission.<br />Starting at Saigon, Brenner proceeds to accomplish two missions, one official and the other personal. He makes contact with Susan Weber who is more than she appears. He also relives many moments from the days during the war, exorcising some old demons along the way. From Saigon he heads north, up country, visiting old battlegrounds and lending great insight to us, the reader, into what life was like as an American GI in Vietnam.<br />I found this book to be a fascinating and informative adventure story. With so much travelling done by Brenner, there is no time for it to become slow and boring. The actual reason for his mission to Vietnam eventually becomes of secondary importance as I got caught up in the country and it's meaning to Brenner. By the end, it really made no difference to me what the final outcome was, I was satisfied by the journey however it turned out.<br />This book is obviously of special importance to Demille and feels as though it's a kind of homage to Vietnam and the people of both sides who fought there. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, appreciated the humour in which it was told and respect the emotion that it evokes. I fell richer for the experience of having read it.	2002-04-17

Unfortunately, it's still all bad. From the master of sticky situations and the brilliant, yet doomed to failure plans to overcome them, comes another Westlake farce highlighting the incredibly unlucky Dortmunder.<br />John inadvertently steals a large and very important ruby and sapphire ring that had in turn, just been stolen before it was to be given to Turkey. The resulting manhunt and shaking down of every known criminal in New York has not only the NYPD and the FBI on his tail, but also every known criminal in New York wants a piece of him too. So the question is, how can Dortmunder evade the police, the Feds, some terrorists and the entire criminal element of New York, and still somehow come up smelling of roses with a cleared name? How indeed!<br />In an ironic twist, compared to his adventures in The Hot Rock where he couldn't get hold of a valuable jewel no matter how ingenious the plan, Dortmunder know finds himself racking his brain trying to get rid of a similarly valuable jewel - safely, anyway.<br />Once again, Westlake provides a humorous story where, if anything can go wrong then it will. The predicament that Dortmunder finds himself in is typical of his unfortunate run of luck and is the reason that these books are so enjoyable.	2002-04-14

And the horror he inflicted in the past resumes, but this time he seems to be homing in on Maggie.<br />Kava has turned up the horror level and preys heavily on the reader's insecurities. It seems that no-one is safe from Stucky.<br />The portrayal of Maggie O'Dell has been fleshed out in this book and we really get a solid feel for what makes her tick. We are given a greater understanding of what she has gone through in the past, and so, can understand why she appears so belligerent and closed to other people. She is becoming a much more likable character through the baring of her soul and fears, giving us even more reason to be terrified of the evil Albert Stucky.<br />This is right up the alley of anyone who loves the honest to goodness psychological thriller-type books complete with totally deranged psychopathic killer. It is strongly recommended that you read A Perfect Evil first (it's a cracking good read, too) in order to get to know the characters and their backgrounds a little better.	2002-04-08

It's uniqueness comes from the poetry of sixteenth century poet John Donne.<br />Cowan Frayne is a killer with an unhealthy obsession with the works of John Donne. He murders and sets up his murder scenes based on the poet's works and on the poet's life. The poetry holds the key as to his motive as well as giving clues to the next target. Also hidden in his complex messages to the police are clues as to his final goal. But figuring out which poem to look at and the meaning behind it is not nearly as easy as it sounds.<br />Heading the investigation is Inspector John Underwood who appears to be very intuitive and a capable leader. However, as seems to be the case with many protagonists, his marriage is crumbling and he is distracted as a result. This distraction soon turns into obsession, leaving his sergeant, Alison Dexter to take charge. Dexter, while a good detective, is mostly concerned with furthering her own career and makes many of her decisions on this basis, also hampering the investigation somewhat.<br />This book appears to be the first of a series and I'm sure we'll be in for further character development further down the track.<br />With the killer working at breakneck speed (pardon the pun), and the local police department in somewhat of an uproar, there's rarely a dull moment for the reader. The poetry aspect was a fascinating inclusion that was (fortunately) translated for those less literary readers (me). It's the first of what I hope will be many books from Ed O'Connor. Highly recommended.	2002-04-08

Barely thinking, Tom dived in to save the man. He later realises that he knows the man he saved as Danny Miller. In fact, it was his expert testimony that helped to convict Danny, who was 10 years old at the time, of murder.<br />So, was it fate or coincidence that their paths should cross again in such dramatic circumstances?<br />It turns out that Danny is very keen to talk to Tom about the crime he was charged and convicted for. He blames Tom for convincing the jury of his guilt. The rest of the book then deals with the circumstances leading up to the murder, what Danny was like as a child and how he dealt with his childhood incarceration.<br />Ultimately, the truth about the murder is revealed. However, the journey towards this destination is not a particularly eventful one. Apart from Danny's admissions towards the end of the book, there was not a lot that grabbed my attention.	2002-04-04

Tom Drummond and his daughter, Tally, seemed to have it all until their family holiday in Tuscany when they were touched by tragedy. From the heights of joy and contentment they were plunged, disbelieving into a world of shock and deep depression. They then have to help each other pull themselves out again and get their lives back to normal somehow.<br />Alan Titchmarsh presents a wonderful story that can almost be termed a fairy tale. It provides the reader an opportunity to almost completely escape into his world as the story unfolds around you. As you would expect from the presenter of Gardener's World and Ground Force, he adds a smattering of gardening references extolling the virtues of enjoying a nice garden. The main character, Tom, even erects a garden shed, a la Ground Force (although it takes him 3 days and not the requisite 2).<br />For pure entertainment and escapism value, this is a nice story that gives the reader a feeling of contentment upon finishing.	2002-03-29

Once she figures out how she got there, she focuses her attention on working on a way to get out.<br />This is an oftentimes light-hearted mystery that revolves around Sam's kidnapping, escape and her attempts to work out who the perpetrators were. Many of the scenes are on the set of a television drama that is in the process of being filmed and is where Sam is working as a stand-in for the leading lady. The characters encountered on set provide many amusing moments as the actors' egos duke it out, trying to maintain their superiority over the hired help.<br />My favourite scene, and one that I can easily relate to, occurs when Sam and her friend, Tom, venture into an Ikea store with a great deal of trepidation. Their fear of venturing of the marked paths and becoming lost forever, and indignation that the store doesn't contain a bar (and their means of remedying the situation) had me in stitches.<br />This is a very enjoyable book that is just right for anyone who prefers their female protagonists to be strong, fearless and capable, yet feminine to the core. It's also ideal for anyone who enjoys their mysteries to be sprinkled with a healthy dose of humour.	2002-03-27

That is until his former colleague and lover, the beautiful Katixa, locates him and puts a lucrative proposition to him. They need to disappear along with the 5 million francs that she has stolen.<br />In the early stages, the story is convoluted with numerous flashback sequences serving to set the scene and give us an idea of how ruthless these main characters can be. It also gives us an idea of what a big part in this story trust is going to have to play.<br />Pascual and Katixa have to leave Barcelona, pick up the money from where it's hidden and then, somehow, smuggle it out of the country. It's a hard enough task at the best of times, but Pascual finds that his past is starting to catch up with him. He is a marked man and his pursuers are zeroing in on him, causing him to go to ground while still trying to organise his passage out of Spain.<br />This is a very good story of intrigue and deception, with no character above suspicion of double cross. When dealing with spies, thieves and murderers and in possession of a lot of money, you have to have eyes in the back of your head. From a slowish start, this story builds in momentum and provides a satisfying conclusion.	2002-03-24

The local sheriff's office, headed by Nick Morelli, is hopelessly out of its depth in coping with the murders of young boys who are being snatched off the streets with alarming ease. The MO of killer is very familiar to the officers involved in the case. The trouble is, the man who was convicted of those murders has already been executed.<br />So now the sheriff and his men have to work out whether they've got a copycat on their hands, or is it the same killer who has now resurfaced - and they've convicted and executed the wrong man.<br />To help out Morelli, FBI profiler Maggie O'Dell is assigned to the case. O'Dell is just coming off a case where she actually witnessed the killer committing murders. In fact, he forced her to watch, so she's carrying plenty of emotional baggage.<br />This is a very good thriller which manages to give the reader plenty of clues as to the identity of the killer, yet makes it ambiguous enough to cast doubt. Just to make things interesting there is a continuous note of sexual tension growing between ladies-man, stud-muffin Morelli and Agent O'Dell, whose marriage was in trouble anyway.<br />While it's not exactly packed with surprises, this is still a very entertaining book that definitely left the way open for future books to pick up. As a matter of fact, the ending is fascinating enough to compel me to come back to read her next book.	2002-03-23

Their father is a judge of very high standing within his Mississippi community, and he is dying. Before Ray arrives, his father dies, leaving Ray to discover the body. While alone in the house with his dead father, he also makes another discovery which turns his life upside down.  From this point the story could have gone in one of two directions. We could have been treated to a &#34;What would you do if&#34; scenario with an accompanying roller-coaster ride of spine tingling thrills and an intriguing ending in a finale that was completely unexpected. Alas, this is not the case. In fact, it all gets rather mundane with no real memorable moments or startling events.  Although it's written in the unmistakable Grisham style making it an easy-reading story, it's rather like a poorly made wine. The plotline promises so much, yet is thin and disappointing. It leaves the palate quickly with no lingering aftertaste and ends up being a pretty forgettable experience.  And, by the way, who stole the ending?	2002-03-20

A small town in upstate New York is in complete uproar when two young girls go missing in what appears to be a kidnapping and, if history is any guide, will become a homicide. It looks like the work of a serial offender. To add a little bit of poignancy to the story, one of the police officers to be working the case is Rouge Kendall, whose twin sister was a victim of this exact scenario 15 years ago. We then follow the story from two points of focus. The first follows the investigators trying to solve the case and find the girls. The second is from the girls' point of view and we get to experience their fear and confusion over what has happened to them.<br />My reaction to this book surprised me a little. My feelings for the characters were mixed, ranging from annoyance to outrage and disgust; Carol O'Connell managed to winkle them all out of me. I thought I knew where the story was headed and how it was going to finish but, as it turned out, I was so far off base it wasn't funny.<br />It's pleasing to find a story that can continue to provoke thought long after you've closed it on the last page. This book certainly provided that for me.	2002-03-18

It looks even more likely that the killer is the man that Caroline Mabry confronted but had to let get away during a drug bust gone bad.<br />Caroline Mabry and Alan Dupree are the two main protagonists and are both detectives with the Spokane Police Department. They share a past that is slowly revealed to us as they become more involved with the case, and this begins to affect the way they carry out their investigations.<br />This is Walter's debut novel and is a psychological thriller that starts out very well with an action packed and dramatic opening, snappy dialogue carrying plenty of humorous exchanges. But then the story gradually gets bogged down in the middle as the main characters all become very introspective. I had the feeling that we were in suspended animation for a while, waiting for someone to yell \\"action\\". However the pace does pick up again as things fall into place and set the scene for a thrilling and somewhat surprising ending.<br />A highlight of the book for me comes from the description of the two profilers whose dislike for each other provides plenty of funny scenes. Their egos and obvious distraction from the case while compiling data for their respective next books add a touch of comic farce to the story.<br />I found this an entertaining book that toyed with the emotions, dark enough to provide a substantial, thought-provoking thriller, yet light enough to provide plenty of amusing moments.	2002-03-13

While exploring, a boy discovers a human skeleton that, in all likelihood had been put there over 50 years ago. Was the person murdered or was it an accident? Will it be possible to solve such an old case?<br />The man chosen for the job is DI Alan Banks. He's been out of favour with his superiors, prompting his selection for what sees to be a hopeless, dead-end job. But, through determination, perseverance and help from local sergeant, Annie Cabbot, he makes slow progress.<br />Peter Robinson alternates between the present and the past in an effective narration of the story. By doing this, we are treated to both the lead up and the aftermath of a time surround by turmoil. As Inspector Banks uncovers clues and chases up leads, we are taken back to when it all took place and get to witness every detail first hand. It really is a technique that works extraordinarily well.<br />As far as police procedurals go, this ranks very highly with pieces of the puzzle revealing a more and more tragic story, leading right up to the consequences played out in the climactic present-day scenes. This is definitely a book to put on your must-read list, particularly if you are a fan of well-constructed mysteries.	2002-03-10

Anna Pigeon is ably assisted in her investigation by Frederick Stanton, a quirky and very likable FBI agent. He and Anna make a good team, working companionably together, trading light-hearted comments and generally complementing each other very nicely. <br />All in all, Ill Wind is a very enjoyable mystery incorporating vivid images of the surrounding land that is very pleasing to the mind's eye.	2002-03-09

In the course of her testing she is returned some results that are incompatible with what she expects. In fact, it looks like she has uncovered the work of a serial killer. When she notifies her superior of the strange results, she is immediately removed from her position and a frightening chain of events begin which places her in extreme danger.<br />Meanwhile, we cut to a murder scene where a woman has been brutally tortured and raped before being allowed to bleed to death. It appears to us that a team of investigators are gathering forensic evidence in preparation to investigate the murder. However, while the team is actually gathering the evidence, they are not law enforcement officers and they won't be investigating anything. They are actually covering up the work of the murderer, but why?<br />The killer is revealed to us fairly early on, so the mystery isn't so much who the killer is as, why is he being protected. This knowledge of the killer's identity gives a new dimension to the serial killer storyline compared to other books which invariably reveal the identity of the killer in the last few pages, yet he is no less a monster to us because of this.<br />Burn Factor is an edge-of-the seat thriller that is somehow fascinating yet repulsive at the same time. It's fascinating to find out how this sick, sadistic madman is going to be beaten, as I'm sure you understand, he must. Repulsive both in his method of murder and due to the fact that people are aware of his crimes, yet allow him to carry on.<br />The faint of heart and easily disgusted should probably steer clear, however if you're a fan of the psychological thriller complete with bloody descriptions, you shouldn't miss this.	2002-03-04

Twilly has always had a problem managing his anger, and watching Stoat's thoughtless act just makes him mad as hell. And when Twilly's mad, people just have to be taught a lesson.<br />From this improbable scenario we are led on a journey that ranges from madcap to wryly amusing. Scarcely hidden beneath the humorous façade lies a serious commentary on the ecological fragility of Florida. Palmer Stoat is a political lobbyist and is instrumental in the approval for redevelopment of Toad Island, an act that will destroy the environment and wipe out all native wildlife. Of course, now that Twilly's on Stoat's tail, the redevelopment is sure to run less than smoothly.<br />This is another very entertaining effort from Carl Hiaasen, made even more so by the reappearance of Clinton Tyree, the former governor who has fully embraced nature and is now known as \\"Skink\\". Of all Hiaasen's characters, Tyree is the most enjoyable purely for the knowledge that when he's around, the unorthodox is bound to happen.<br />From an unusual beginning and amusing middle we arrive at a very clever ending that can best be described as containing the epitome of poetic justice. For all Hiaasen fans, Sick Puppy should not fail to disappoint.	2002-03-02

Hell To Pay focuses on Strange's devotion to the black youth living in the projects of Washington. He is determined to give them every possible chance to make something of themselves by building self-esteem and confidence.<br />Furthering the youth theme and, in a way, counterbalancing all his good work, are the two cases that Strange and Quinn work on throughout the book. The first involves a fourteen year old prostitute and their attempts to get her off the streets and back home to her family. The second is the investigation of the murder of a child. This becomes a much more emotional case that turns personal, with Strange walking a moral tightrope.<br />Once again, Pelecanos has delivered a powerful story that graphically portrays the mean streets and dangerous characters of modern day society. Although relentlessly illustrating the everyday tragedy surrounding us all, there is at least an underlying tone of hope.	2002-02-26

The first is Darren Rough, a paedophile who has recently been released from prison, much to Rebuses indignation and disgust. The second is Cary Oakes, a murderer who has been in prison in the US and is being released on the proviso that he return home to Edinburgh. As if this isn't enough to keep him busy, the 19 year old son of an old school friend has gone missing and Rebus is asked to help find him.<br />The main theme of this book is paedophilia and it attempts to highlight how many people are affected by it. So many of the main characters are haunted by incidents from their past and their actions today seem to be dictated by what happened to them so long ago. This includes Rebus himself who is still a troubled soul, although not due to paedophilia I hasten to add. It's nice to see, though, that he appears to have found a manner of peace and meaning to his work.<br />I found this to be one of the best Inspector Rebus books that I've read yet. This books sits more in the thriller category that the police procedural. The psychological mind games played by Oakes ensure a gripping mood leading up to a shattering climax. A definite must-read for all Rebus fans.	2002-02-25

His latest job has taken him to the supposedly sleepy town of Maddox, Missouri. He unknowingly bumps into a hired killer minutes before a hit takes place. Also caught up in the murder is a policeman who is shot and wounded. Both the cop and the killer remember Pellam and want to find him, though for obviously very different reasons.<br />Because a policeman was injured the local police department is very keen that Pellam comes forward as a witness and they become very aggressive when he claims that he didn&#8217;t see anything. The killer has assumed that he left behind a witness to his crime, and so takes it upon himself to eliminate the danger.<br />This early Jeffery Deaver provides a nice little thriller with a few surprises thron in, yet there is nothing that really grabs you and distinguishes it from the many other books in the genre.	2002-02-24

They're friends who were having a late dinner together. Merrill Liberty si stabbed in the neck after seeing Tor Peterson collapse to the footpath. When the police arrive on the scene, they have to work out two things about the deaths: who died first, and; was one person murdered or both.<br />April Woo returns in this New York City police mystery. She has just started at a new precinct after her promotion to sergeant and is finding her new fellow officers less than welcoming. Her ex-partner and would-be love interest, Mike Sanchez has been assigned to the murder case as a special investigator and joins April, sho is heading the investigation, in trying to solve it. What a coincidence!<br />April and Mike are under constant pressure to solve the case because the murdered woman's husband is Rick Liberty, a former pro-footballer, and the murdered man was one of the richest men in America. Clues prove hard to come by and their job isn't made any easier when apparent mistake are made by the medical examiner while performing an autopsy on the bodies.<br />To keep things interesting, the ongoing love / hate relationship between April and Mike enters a new phase, adding a whole new level of unease and tension to the case.<br />April Woo finds herself in a constant identity battle being fought on two fronts. The first is with herself as she tries to overcome her Chinese instincts that dictate that, as a Chinese woman, she should remain subservient. If she is to be a successful New York City cop she must overcome this. The second is with her fellow officers who clearly don't think a Chinese woman has what it takes to lead murder investigations.<br />The plot is pretty standard fare, but for those who have met April Woo before, it is interesting to see her character develop. It's quite an enjoyable addition to the April Woo series.	2002-02-21

It's an edge-of-the seat chase involving a ruthless assassin, Michael Chambers, his prey who is suffering amnesia, Michael's wife, Laura who suffers from agoraphobia and the FBI.<br />Lauren Chambers thinks she knows her husband, but when he fails to come home after a skiing trip with his buddies, she begins to have her doubts. He seems to have vanished from the face of the earth, and this doesn't sit well with the agoraphobic doctor. To top off her insecurities, she begins to get the feeling that she's being followed. After visiting the Sheriff's department to report Michael missing, she attends a Neighbourhood Watch meeting and meets a private investigator who agrees to help her find her husband.<br />Meanwhile we follow Michael's plight as he wakes up in hospital, not knowing who is, where he is or how he got there. He is also unaware of how he happened to have been shot in the leg. All he knows for sure is that he doesn't want to hang around for the police to come and interview him. So he makes himself scarce with, not only the police, but also the FBI hot on his trail.<br />From this beginning, I was hooked and just had to keep reading to find out what the heck was going on. No-one seemed to be who they said they were; no-one could be trusted. Enemies were everywhere and all intent on tracking down the elusive Harper Payne. Oh yes, that's right, just who is Harper Payne anyway.<br />This is a superb book of cat and mouse that had me guessing right from the opening chapter. It's recommended for all those who love the world of acronyms - you know FBI, CIA, NSA, etc.	2002-02-04

From the opening sentence this book captured me and refused to let go. C.J. Box has produced an exciting debut book and introduces us to Joe Pickett and his family.<br />Joe Pickett is an incorruptible game warden in the wilds of Wyoming who is drawn into a dangerous situation after a man who has been shot stumbles into his backyard before dying from his wounds. The strange thing about the man is that he was carrying a cooler that had obviously contained animals of some kind, but they had escaped when the man had collapsed. Joe begins to investigate, trying to answer a few questions, such as: who shot him; what was in the cooler; why did the man choose his backyard. As he begins to investigate it becomes obvious that someone is working against him, trying to stop him from digging further.<br />Another strong character is Sheridan, Joe's eight-year-old daughter. Quite often, authors have difficulty writing down to this age, giving them too much maturity making them an unbelievable character. This isn't the case here. Sheridan has an important role to play, yet she is given fears and beliefs that are common to her age group. This combined with believable reactions to stressful situations gives her role immense credibility.<br />This story contains a bit of everything, a good intriguing puzzle, a beautiful and well-described setting, a strong, yet endearingly flawed lead character and an ecological dilemma. There's just enough of each factor to tie up into a very enjoyable book.	2002-02-03

During winter, the sun won't come up for eight months; they are completely alone to carry on their research. Many of them have done it before, so are not too disturbed at the prospect of being cut-off from the rest of the world, enduring the eight-month night. Until the killings start.<br />Not long after one of the scientists makes a significant, and possibly very profitable, discovery, members of the Amundsen-Scott Research Base begin to mysteriously disappear before being found dead. Is it an accident, suicide or something far more sinister? Unfortunately, for Jed Lewis, the new arrival on the base, all evidence seems to suggest that he's the murderer. In order to clear his name, he is compelled to find out just who is causing the mayhem.<br />This book had me wholly engrossed, both with the fascinating detail regarding survival in Antarctica and at the prospect of being cooped up for eight months with a killer. As more and more members of the tiny community are picked off, everyone's fears begin to get manipulated and rationality flies out the window. It's a chilling book in more ways than one.	2002-01-25

Both are ex-cops, but there the similarities end. Strange is in his 50's, is a private investigator and black, Quinn is in his late 20's, works in a second-hand bookstore and is white. This book is as much a commentary on racial tensions in today's society as it is a well-crafted thriller.<br />Strange and Quinn meet after Strange is hired to investigate the shooting of an off-duty black police officer by another policeman. The other policeman was Quinn. The two team up because Quinn would also like to know the truth as to what really happened that night, and is also keen to prove that he is not a racist.<br />A subplot involving a drug-dealing father and son team and their dealings with their suppliers and distributors keeps pace with the main story and inevitably mixes together in a happy union creating a sizzling finale of revenge and violence.<br />Once again, Pelecanos' characters are heavily influenced by music and have definite ideas on what is \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". The use of music is a big indicator of the personalities of each character and is a very clever and unique means of characterisation.<br />Unlike some of Pelecanos' earlier characters, I found both Strange and Quinn to be strong, capable and (to a point) moral. Overall, they are likable men. This has led me to look forward to more books involving them. Right As Rain is a compelling mystery containing all the elements that has made Pelecanos books so popular: violence, drugs, music...and Washington D.C.	2002-01-21

They are shocked when they stumble upon poachers who are hunting the apes, but who are not afraid to turn their guns on humans.<br />This book deals with the dwindling numbers of endangered species and man's indifference to whether they live or die. In particular, the orang-utan is highlighted. It's a battle between Alison Farleigh who is desperate to stamp out poachers, trappers and other enemies to animals, and a couple of brothers who have made it their lives work to capture wild animals no matter the cost.<br />Once again James Hall portrays his bad guys as just about the lowest, most demented scum of the earth, yet smart enough to keep getting away with their evil deeds. Thorn, Hall's recurring laid-back alternative-living hero, plays a minor role as the backup for Alison. It seems that his main role in this book is to get the living bejeezus repeatedly beaten out of him.<br />It's an action-packed thriller interspersed with more sensitive moments when the story is told from a young orang-utan's perspective. There are no real surprising twists to the story, yet it remained compelling from start to finish. Any book that highlights the plight of the many endangered species of animals around the world is a worthwhile book.	2002-01-15

He's trying to pick his life up again using contacts he made in prison. The fact that he isn't allowed to work as a PI, own a gun and is still on parole doesn't deter him in the slightest. He is also carrying a bounty on his head after making some enemies in prison. There seems to be no end of takers willing to try to cash in.<br />The job that Joe is pursuing is an investigation into the disappearance of an accountant to a local mafia boss. On top of that, the trucks used by the family to smuggle electronic goods, keep getting hit and destroyed. Joe offers his service to find the accountant and solve the problem. The problem with offering himself for the job, however, is that he has knowingly walked into a pit of vipers and must try to keep one step ahead of the game to survive.<br />Joe occasionally shows a touch of remorse before killing someone, but whether it's because he is taking a life or because of the hassle in having to clean up afterwards is never made clear. He is a character who is totally loyal to friends and family, yet deadly ruthless to his enemies.<br />The actual storyline is compelling, if dark and desperate. From the first page, I was drawn in and hooked so the pages simply flew by. It's a hectic, tension-filled story that doesn't fail to entertain.	2002-01-11

Valentine is an expert in spotting a hustler and his talents are in great demand by casinos all over the country.<br />A particularly perplexing case sees Valentine leave the comforts of home to head for Las Vegas, not Tony's favourite city. The casino security staff knows that a man is cheating at blackjack, but they don't know how and it's for this reason that he's been called in to take a look. Things start going wrong the moment he hits town. He receives a death threat, a dealer from the casino (and suspect in his case) goes missing, and low-lifes from his past begin showing up.<br />Swain has managed to hit upon the winning combination of an interesting subject and a likable protagonist making it a very enjoyable book to read. I found that reading about the intricacies of gambling cheats and how to spot them was fascinating and was very nicely woven into the plot making me want to read more.<br />We are gradually familiarised with the past of Tony Valentine and, in so doing, learn what makes him tick and what ideals are important to him. It becomes very easy to like him and empathise with his character.<br />This is a very worthwhile mystery with a few twists to keep you on your toes. The pace is fast, the characters are likeable and the ending is satisfying. I'm looking forward to reading the next Tony Valentine mystery.	2002-01-08

Haunting, dark and mysterious. It's a tourist attraction that lures thousands every year. But it has also been used as a killing ground. A girl is found dead at a group of rocks known as The Nine Virgins. Even more disturbing is that it appears that her body has been arranged to look as though she is dancing.<br />This is Stephen Booth's second book following on from Black Dog, and revisits Ben Cooper and Diane Fry. Apart from the mystery, this books concentrates on delving deeper into the characters introduced in the first book. The relationship between Ben and Diane is continually developed, as are the secrets they appear to be hiding. At some points, the murder case takes a secondary role to the characterisations. Because of this character development, I would recommend reading Black Dog before this book.<br />It takes a while to really get going, as with many police investigations, but pretty soon things start coming together. A nicely woven mystery is unravelled with a few surprises, both pleasant and unpleasant, revealed along the way.<br />The setting of the book is once again a powerful factor in setting the mood of the story, which is not what I would term upbeat. It always feels dangerous, dark and menacing - just like a good murder mystery should.	2002-01-01

Cheesy, ridiculous dialogue, impossible escapes that cheat death by millimetres, a cool, suave almost super-human he-man hero, and a rollicking adventure that keeps your eyes glued to the pages.<br />Once again, Cussler delivers a fanciful adventure that shows off Dirk Pitt and Al Giodino's finest attributes. They come up against yet another evil (some may even say fiendish) megalomaniac who is intent on world domination and will allow nothing and no one to stand in his way.<br />There are a couple of historical tie-ins at the beginning of the book that set the scene for some big revelations at the end, rounding out a very entertaining story that will leave Pitt fans thirsting for more. The usual cameo by Cussler is played with gusto and comes far in earlier than in previous books. I get the feeling that Dirk Pitt's starting to get a little bit suspicious of this Clive Cussler character and his habit of turning up all over the world.<br />Plenty of new inventions for the NUMA boys to play with, plus a few tantalising theories are put forward which would indeed make the world a better place if only they were true. And the ending? Well, let's just say the ending is nothing short of unbelievable.	2001-12-29

This time he's called onto the set of a television show to act as bodyguard to the star, and America's sweetheart, Jill Joyce. Unfortunately, she's also a drunk, incredibly difficult to work with, and determined to bed every man within a 5-mile radius.<br />But when Spenser's on the job it's professionalism all the way which makes for a very fiery employer / employee relationship. It also makes for some most amusing situations and gives ample opportunity for Spenser to display his flair for detective work. The relationship between Spenser and Susan is comfortable, as ever, and between Spenser and Hawk as solid as a rock.<br />The sanctuary of a Spenser book is always a welcome haven for weary readers with the pace of the book high and the pages turning quickly. Light entertainment at it's best; if you're after mystery with a liberal dash of humour then you're in for a real treat here.	2001-12-16

It is the nature of the foul-ups and the brilliant changes of plan that make the Dortmunder series so enjoyable.<br />This time Dortmunder and his mixed-bag crew are planning to steal a bank. That's right, not rob a bank, but actually, physically, steal a bank.<br />As you can imagine, to achieve such an ambitious task takes a fair bit of planning not to mention luck. Dortmunder is a master planner, so they've got that bit covered, unfortunately the luck side of the equation is a tad skinny, and this is where the laughs are provided.<br />Donald Westlake is a master of farce, and Bank Shot certainly doesn't disappoint. This is a great diversion with an interesting caper brought to us by likable, amusing characters.	2001-11-16

But the disturbing thing is that the way in which the murders are being carried out closely resembles the murders described in each author's book. Fiona Campbell, a geographical profiler who occasionally works with the police, happens to be involved with a thriller-writer. Together they alternately believe and then discount the possibility that he may be on the list of future victims.<br />To add interest for the reader, and realism to the story, Fiona is inundated with work. We, the readers benefit from this by being kept bust keeping up with developments in, not one but three cases. This was a great device for maintaining the pace while allowing the story to unfold on a natural timeframe.<br />While a little predictable towards the end, Killing the Shadows still provides many heart stopping moments, a few nose-wrinkling descriptions and plenty of entertainment that kept me engrossed from the opening scene. If you like chillers about serial killers and the profiling undertaken to track them down, then you're going to love this book.	2001-11-14

He's an ex-SWAT team member and hostage negotiator, who has semi-retired to a small Californian town where he is now Chief of Police. He's trying to live the quiet life, when the exact situation he's trying to escape comes along and parks itself on his doorstep.<br />To top off the pressure of negotiating a hostage crisis, outside influences are added to really turn the heat up, providing the reader with a truly spine tingling scenario. It also proves that there is more than one way to be held hostage. By piling one crisis on top of the next, the reader is given an intriguing ride.<br />Robert Crais does a terrific job of humanising the main characters in this book, making it more than just a simple hostage negotiation story. I couldn't help but feel an affinity with Talley, particularly when he was forced to make decisions based on his personal life. What he would do to give himself a win-win outcome was a fascinating aspect of the book.<br />Although I was disappointed that Elvis Cole was put on hold for another year, the originality and suspense of this book more than made up for it.	2001-11-12

Sure she was beautiful, but she was also deeply troubled and, quite possibly, dangerous.<br />As well as being packed full of mystery and intrigue, we are also treated to a fascinating insight into the processes involved in producing a sculpture. Being someone who doesn't have an artistic bone in his body, I found it very interesting to get an idea of how it's possibly done.<br />Anyway, back to the story. Ross Marteau finds himself being drawn deeper and deeper under the spell woven by two beautiful sisters, Celeste and Leda. He falls in love with one and is fascinated by the other while he is preparing her sculpture. Through their webs of lies and half-truths he gets himself into a situation that he realises will quite possibly change his life for good.<br />Up until the last few pages, this is a run-of-the-mill story that keeps you guessing as to how it's going to end. But no matter how many guesses you take, David Lindsey provides an ending that you would never have expected. Quite frankly, it blew me away. It's not very often that I'm caught by surprise when reading a book. This ending did that to me and had me reading it bug-eyed in disbelief.	2001-10-23

The result, I feel, is a rather disjointed tale that fails to live up to it's early promise.<br />The story begins in England, spoken from the perspective of Claire Fleetwood, a forensic photographer who has just witnessed a murder. The victim was a young girl that Claire had been fond of who was a devoted gardener. At this point we are given many comparisons between gardening and the use of blood and bone, and our own mortality. We are even treated to the promise of suspense to come, thanks to Claire possibly being called as a witness in the murder case.<br />Suddenly, the story takes a turn and Claire is invited to join an expedition through India and Tibet in search of a rare, almost mythical, green poppy. OK then, you think, the story is now an adventure and we're going to be treated to a trek through the wilds of the Himalayas.<br />But no! We are then transported back 100 years as Claire begins a search into her family's past. During this part of the book, all momentum is lost and we seem to tread water while a background story is recounted in excruciating detail. What probably could have been told in 4 or 5 pages takes well over 100 and added little to the main plot.<br />I found this to be a book that I really had to work hard over. The reveals toward the end were implied rather than stated obviously, which I found annoying. Read this for the interesting discussions and observations on human mortality rather than for an electrifying mystery.	2001-10-22

He's there to as military attaché to the German Legation, but he is also embittered by the deaths of his brother and father. Andrea Aspinall has led a sheltered life in London, but she is a skilled mathematician who speaks Portuguese and has been sent to Lisbon as a spy.<br />Lisbon during the end of the Second World War is a hotbed of spies. German or Allied, it doesn't matter, everyone's watching everyone else and information is passed back and forth. The race is on to produce the first atomic bomb and it's in Lisbon that deals are being made to provide the funding for research. For Andrea, she witnesses acts of violence firsthand for the first time, and takes with her, secrets which are to stay with her for the rest of her life.<br />From the tension of wartime Lisbon, we cut to the late 1960's and early 1970's and the focus is back on Andrea and Karl. We're provided with a thrilling yet draining ending to their story.<br />This is a spy novel that is full of intrigue, double-dealings and mystery. We are introduced to, and then given intimate knowledge of, the two main characters. The detailed characterisation is a real feature of this story; we are left in no doubt what motivates each character. But more than just a spy story, it's a love story that tells of impossibly difficult decisions that the clandestine life imposes. It's an epic story of intrigue that keeps delivering.	2001-10-04

Butch finds himself faced with challenge after challenge, both professional and personal. <br />On the professional front, cases are being assigned priority in the DA's office based on their political appeal rather on their prosecutorial merits. A police cover-up is being rushed through the system, much to Butch's disgust. And a man faces the death penalty for a crime that he probably didn't commit.<br />The problems on the personal side are just as worrying for Butch. Lucy, his 17 year-old daughter is ditching school and choosing to hang out at the local soup kitchen, helping the homeless. Marlene has just become independently wealthy and uses this newfound wealth to go on outlandish buying sprees by day and drinking binges by night.<br />Quite a good deal of the book deals with the political aspects of Butch's position as Chief Assistant District Attorney. This doesn't exactly make for edge-of-the-seat thrill a minute drama. Between dwelling on the psychological problems faced by Butch, Marlene and Lucy, there is not a lot of time left to actually expand on the mystery side of the plot, that is, who is the bum-slasher. As a result, the bum-slasher was virtually revealed as an afterthought and just as quickly, dismissed.<br />This really is an update of the story so far of a day in the lives of Butch Karp and family.

Without this previous experience, a lot of Red Light will be very confusing and would probably ruin your enjoyment of both books.<br />Red Light sees Merci Rayborn investigate two murders that were committed 30 years apart. The victims were both prostitutes, but apart from that they don't really seem to be related. Her investigation severely tests her relationship with her boyfriend, Mike McNally, and brings to light a few dirty secrets that were buried by the sheriffs department three decades ago.<br />Merci is not a particularly likable character, but she does have qualities that are very admirable. Her fierce determination to see justice done, no matter who gets hurt, seems to override just about every one of her emotions. The only exceptions to this are her love for her son and father, and the dominance of Hess' memory in her mind.<br />While I found this to be an interesting story with a well-constructed mystery to be solved, it never really reached any exciting moments as The Blue Hour had. Too often we were forced to witness Merci's self-doubts and continual dwelling over the past. For me, these moments only served to interrupt the more interesting investigative processes without really adding much value to the story.	2001-10-02

And indeed, the suspicions are well founded. Umberto Alvarez, who lost his wife and two children in a railway crossing accident, has been seeking (and exacting) revenge ever since. These derailments, however, are only the precursor to his ultimate goal of bringing the company responsible to its knees. He has a plan to switch his focus to a passenger train, and not just any passenger train but the new F-A-S-T Track train.<br />Peter Tyler is an ex-homicide cop, now contracted to the NTSB to investigate a murder that has occurred on a freight train. Nell Priest works for the company that owns the train on which the murder occurred and she has been brought in too. These two join forces in tracking down what happened on the train and who murdered whom. It's from this beginning that they find themselves on Alvarez's trail and heading into more than they bargained for.<br />This is the set-up of what could potentially have been a real seat-of-the-pants manhunt-cum-thriller and it is for the first 100 pages or so. Unfortunately, just as the action begins to hot up, a very unlikely love affair dilutes the action. Too often this aspect of the story took the focus off the important plot points of the book, making it an annoying distraction rather than an asset to the story. For a book that started so promisingly, I was left at the end ruing what might have been.	2001-09-27

When someone starts shooting his stable mates and makes an attempt on him, his owners decide that it's time to bring in the big guns. Enter Spenser, imported from Boston down to Georgia to try to weave his magic.<br />When he arrives, he realises that things don't add up. The horses that were shot aren't particularly valuable, no-one appears overly concerned that the shooter will strike again, and the family who hired him are, quite frankly, full of weirdos.<br />Once again we are treated to a mystery that is investigated Spenser-style, which is to say, humorously, capably and never, ever dully. Ever quick with the snappy line, Spenser is always in control and although at times it seems that the investigation is going nowhere, you find that you're having so much fun you don't really mind.	2001-09-25

The difference here is that the occupation of the protagonist is an heir hunter. A what? Nick Merchant is a private investigator, but he specialises in tracking down heirs to estates and matches them up, taking a percentage of the estate as a fee. It's this aspect that gives this story it's uniqueness and added appeal.<br />When Nick and his partner, Alex Moreno, find out about an estate that contains assets in excess of twenty-two million dollars, they think this could be the payday they've dreamt of. As with all things that seem too good to be true, there has to be a problem, and in this case, competition from the opposition is the least of Nick's worries - only he doesn't know that. The deceased was in the FBI's witness protection program, and they're pretty keen for things to remain nice and quiet. Producing heirs to the estate would not be desirable. On top of that, there appears to be an unknown group of killers who use a far more permanent means of keeping things quiet.<br />This is a face-paced story that takes place on both coasts of America as well as places in between, Germany and Switzerland. Nick and Alex make a very likable couple who work well together with none of the sexual tension other authors seem to feel is necessary when using a male / female combination.<br />It's a first-class thriller that reminds me of the best work produced by the likes of Thomas Perry.	2001-09-23

Unfortunately for Rebus the chase doesnt end well, although it has an even worse ending for the me he was chasing. A suicide soon after is linked to the original case and Rebus is soon chasing down clues and digging up dirt. When hes warned off the case by influential men from both inside and outside the police force, his resolve is hardened and he redoubles his efforts, convinced that he must be onto something pretty big.<br />Just what it was he was on to was a little hard to decipher. Corruption in government departments is the bone that he latches onto and then he finds that hes up against some pretty powerful customers. His job is on the line which means the world to him because as he points out, without his job, hes nothing.<br />We get a very candid look into Rebuses life outside of the police force and realise that hes not doing too well at this point. His realisation that he may have a drinking problem is highlighted by the admission that when he tries to sleep sober he is haunted by nightmares, so he ensures he has a few drinks before bed each night. There is also a disturbing reference to suicide in the book and the fact that Rebus has given it some thought was indicative of his current frame of mind.	2001-09-21

Not only is he dealing with the feelings of the opposite sex towards quite emotional issues, his main character is also a troubled soul, having lost her father when she was young, her mother to alcoholism and her sister to an unknown kidnapper. On top of that he deals with some pretty major issues such as rape and child abuse. Although, it's a big task, he has presented his character in a believable and interesting fashion and, to my mind, pulls it off.<br />Jordan Glass is a photojournalist who does a lot of travelling around the world. While she is Hong Kong, she visits an art gallery and finds herself face-to-face with what appears to be a painting of her. It is actually her twin sister, who has been missing for around eighteen months, presumed dead. The chilling aspect of the painting for Jordan is that the subject is supposed to be sleeping, but looks very much dead.<br />Jordan immediately notifies the FBI and has them reopen her sister's case. She travels back to the United States and manages to convince the FBI agents that she should be allowed to take an active part in the investigation. The hunt begins for the artist and the women that are his subjects, for Jordan's sister is only one of many missing women who have turned up on canvas.<br />All in all Dead Sleep is an exciting, smart-paced book mixing a thriller scenario with aspects of the typical police procedural. I did find myself having to deal with a couple of small quibbles, such as the photojournalist outsmarting the entire FBI when it comes to investigation and psychoanalysis. However, they were minor compared to the entertainment provided by another imaginative story courtesy of Mr Iles.	2001-09-17

This is a terrific novel filled with suspense and tensions that are on a slow-boil and which inevitably explodes into violence.<br />A young white man is found dead in the woods on what is acknowledged as the land of Jehiel Flood. Jehiel is a black man and it's because of this that he is accused of the murder and undergoes racial abuse and personal attacks from the townsfolk. This is an account of a situation that just keeps getting more and more tense. It's a suspense novel of the highest quality and deals with the issue of racism in considerable detail.<br />Samuel Bradley relates the story. He is a young constable helps carry out the investigation into the murder. Although legally a white man, he is considered a \\"bleached\\" Negro. This means that he is third-generation white because his great-grandmother was a Negro, but through generations of inter-racial breeding, he was deemed to be white. This legal aspect however is irrelevant to the locals who still consider him black and overly sympathetic with Jehiel Flood and his family.<br />The outrage I felt over the injustices described in the book bear testament to the storytelling ability displayed by Heffernan. Although I was aware that it was only a story, the knowledge that this sort of thing was not particularly uncommon was always in the back of my mind. Heffernan doesn't waste a word in this extraordinary book.	2001-09-13

But not only the inside story in the field, also a look at the day-to-day dealings from headquarters.<br />We follow his story from the unbelievable moment he is told that he's been accepted into the FBI and then into the elite Hostage Rescue Team (HRT). It's in this unit that he was involved in some of the FBI's most well known hostage situations and has been awarded the FBI's Medal of Bravery. Whitcomb's account reads like any best-selling thriller, the only difference being that this is real life. You can track the author's fast learning curve that takes him very rapidly from a raw recruit to a seasoned veteran. But it's not only the action that the author saw that really makes a mark. The amount of training that this unit goes through is truly phenomenal, and gives you an amazing insight into just how dedicated these men must truly be.<br />We get a unique inside view on events surrounding such high profile and high-pressure situations as Ruby Ridge and Waco and even the atrocities he witnessed towards the end of the Kosovo conflict. This gives us a fascinating insider's view of what goes on inside the FBI as well as the toll, both emotional and physical, that it takes on the agents. A brilliant and fascinating read for anyone interested in true crime, action stories and the workings of the FBI.	2001-09-12

The emerald in question is a religious icon, owned by a small African nation. A neighbouring African nation believes it's theirs and they want it back, so they hire John Dortmunder for the job of retrieving it. John Dortmunder is a master thief and has a knack for planning, but can't do it all himself, so he needs to call on others for their expertise. This is when the fun really begins.<br />What starts out as a simple case of robbery quickly develops into a comedy of errors as unforeseen circumstance follows plain bad luck. John Dortmunder and his men become determined to succeed at their task, which leads to a series of events ranging from amusing to farcical.<br />The offbeat characters portrayed in the book add an extra dimension of humour and helps create an upbeat atmosphere throughout. There's a car nut who, of course, is their getaway driver, a gentle and possibly just a bit loopy (toot-toot) model train lover, a Casanova-type pretty boy and a stock standard right-hand-man. All of them thoroughly professional yet, sort of oozing a not-quite-right feeling about them.<br />We're treated to a light-hearted caper in and around New York City in the book that introduces John Dortmunder to us. You can't help but like these rogues as they stumble from bad situation to worse. It's an amusing comedy that should have you smiling as you read the last page.	2001-09-07

It's in this setting that a 15-year-old girl, Laura Vernon, has gone missing only to be found later, murdered. She is from a wealthy family who are new to the district, and so are known as `comers-in' by the locals, meaning they will consequently be treated as outsiders. It is because of this that the locals are not particularly helpful when questioned by the police.<br />The beginning of the book is very reminiscent of A Place of Execution by Val McDermid. In both books a young girl is missing from a small rural community, the locals are not particularly helpful with the police and the detectives working on the case are young with their eyes cast to furthering their career.<br />Mystery not only surrounds the murder of Laura Vernon, many of the integral characters in the book are harbouring secrets. The main character, DC Ben Cooper is dealing with his mother's schizophrenia, his new partner DC Diane Fry has just arrived in Edendale and has brought personal problems of her own. Laura Vernon's parents are both harbouring secrets that they are keen not to let out and Harry Dickenson, the man who found Laura, is being very close-lipped as well. Even Laura Vernon herself was leading a secret life that would have shocked her parents had they found out.<br />The surrounding Derbyshire countryside of the beautiful Peak District is described with exceptional clarity giving us an insight into countryside that must be simply breathtaking to behold. Although not being overly dwelt on, scene after scene is given a wonderful backdrop of the surrounding land, which gave me a strong sense of actually being there.<br />The local townsfolk are wonderfully portrayed with the standouts being the three old friends, Harry, Sam and Wilford who amuse each other and the reader with their wry observations of the police to one another. The mood of the story lifts each time one of these men is involved and at times, stole each scene they were involved in.<br />The length of this review is testament to my enjoyment of this book. I'm usually a 3-paragraph per review man. A quick overview and my impressions usually suffice. This book moved me more than most and my feeling of satisfaction has been reflected here. I strongly recommend you read this book, if you're after a terrific police procedural I don't think you'll be disappointed.	2001-09-06

Due to the colour of Smokey's skin and the period this is set, the racial issues dealt with are bordering on explosive. This is a remarkable work of fiction that integrates a factual event, that being the days leading up to the assassination of Martin Luther King, jr. It captures the tensions of the day with remarkable clarity and gives us an insight into how the black community of Memphis may have been affected.<br />The actual mystery part of the story involves a white woman, Laura Hathaway, who walks into Smokey's office one day, demanding to know why her mother would leave Smokey a bequest of $10,000 in her will. Although Smokey doesn't know her or her mother, he has always wondered about a mysterious benefactor who anonymously donated the same amount of money to him ten years ago. Laura decides to hire Smokey to find out about her family background, what secrets they were hiding and how he is involved in it. The results are shocking for the two of them.<br />This is a private investigator story with a difference; thanks to the time it is set and the fact that the protagonist is black. These two unique factors presents hurdles not faced by the majority of private investigators we read about these days. It's a powerful debut novel that has introduced us to a particularly likable, ethical character. Nelscott told us a great deal about the background of Smokey Dalton, making us sympathetic to his feelings and reactions, yet when I finished the book, I felt as though I wanted to learn more.	2001-09-04

Disbelief that he has caused her death and fear that he may be caught. It is this fear plus a growing rage that drives him for the rest of the book. His first action is to calm himself and then he disposes of the body by rolling it into a lake. As he is walking from the water's edge, he receives the nasty shock that he's not alone, a woman and her 9 year old niece are also at the reserve. In a panic, he hurries off, but not before allowing the woman to get a good look at his face. Once again he agonises over the fact that he's been seen at the crime scene and can be identified. His solution is to eliminate the witnesses and so he sets off trying to track them down.<br />As night falls, the man begins his hunt and the tension slowly begins to build. Patricia Carlon effectively piles on the suspense and leaves us in no doubt that the hunter is verging on the edge of madness. As he gets closer and closer to his quarry, his rage increases with every minor setback, making him even more dangerous.<br />Patricia Carlon has captured the confused and panicked thought processes that may go through a person's mind after a violent act. She also gets us inside the man's head, causing us to realise that he will stop at nothing. Each scene is set up perfectly to achieve maximum suspense.<br />If you enjoy the mind numbing terror that comes with the fear of the unknown, strangers at the window on a dark and stormy night, this will help keep you awake. It was written and set in the 1960's and is a terrific example of an honest to goodness thriller that doesn't rely on the blood and gore scenes that are popular today.	2001-09-02

By now, Stephanie's exploits are pretty well legendary, as are the laughs that you get from each page. And once again you're in for a nice comfortable read with plenty of laughs and head shaking moments. It's nice to see characters from previous books carried over to this one, plus a few new characters are picked up along the way.<BR>As usual, life's far from sane in Evanovich's Trenton, New Jersey. Cars still have a short life expectancy, failure to appears are just as difficult for Stephanie to catch. In this case it's the virtually blind and deaf octogenarian Eddie DeChooch. It would be a nice surprise for Stephanie to actually catch someone the first time she tries, but I guess that wouldn't be anywhere near as funny. It's nice to see that Stephanie's finally starting to get some on a regular basis, another part of her life that's described in excruciatingly funny detail.<BR>I recommend you read the previous books in the series before you read this one, otherwise you will be somewhat bewildered by the shenanigans of this book, but that should be an enjoyable task in itself. Just make sure you're not eating or drinking while reading, things could get a bit ugly.	2001-08-30

She makes her living butchering and dressing meat for the local hunters. She is shot and killed by police, no one knows why and no one knows why she was shot so many times with over two hundred rounds fired. It's about the effect that her death has on some of the townsfolk of Quillifarkeag and their efforts to get their own kind of justice. That's the gist of the story. But it's remarkably well hidden as each plot point is drawn out with frequent asides and anecdotes. As each character is either introduced or reintroduced we are put through this bewildering, rambling type of tale. Many times these ramblings turn out to have absolutely nothing to do with the actual story and only serve to distract you from the story you're trying to follow. I found this a very frustrating book to read. Every time I thought the story was going to progress, I was sidetracked into some other irrelevant story that may have been happening at the same time, or may have happened years ago. All in all, it's a potentially simple story told in a very convoluted fashion.	2001-08-29

The letters are correspondence between a reclusive author and his agent. The agent wants to sell the letters, given their highly collectable appeal; the author desperately wants to stop her. The farce begins when Bernie breaks into the agent's room, but can't locate the letters. Instead, he locates her dead body that is lying in bed after she has been stabbed in the heart. Bernie is arrested but soon released and is back in his bookstore, only to be visited by a series of people determined to get their hands on the letters and believe Bernie can help them. Although filled with the trademark Lawrence Block humour and snappy dialogue, this book doesn't quite contain the edginess of previous Burglar books. The scenario of Bernie illegally entering a room that later proves to contain a corpse has been played in the earlier books. A new concept would have been refreshing. If you haven't read any of the Bernie Rhodenbarr mysteries, you will probably find the story quite amusing and entertaining - and it is. If, however you have read a number of the books in the series, you'll find that it's all getting a bit repetitive.	2001-08-27

Bernie and Carolyn spend the weekend in a New England guesthouse, which attempts to replicate an authentic old English manor. When guests begin showing up murdered, it's Bernie who plays the part of Hercule Poirot or, if you like, Philip Marlowe, as he gathers the clues, which will hopefully lead him to the murderer before too many more guests are knocked off. Being a guesthouse, there are suspects aplenty delivering us ample opportunity to figure out the mystery ourselves. If mystery fans will be delighted by this book, then fans of the British crime story will be even more so. Combining the wit and humour of Lawrence Block with the traditional murder mystery creates a deadly weekend, though presented in a light and breezy manner.	2001-08-24

He is also a drug dealer who has just been arrested, charged and sentenced to serve seven years in a federal prison. This book documents the last day of freedom for Marty, how he feels about his coming ordeal, the feeling of hopelessness, regret and anger. We also meet his two best friends, Frank and Jacob and the relationship they share with each other and Monty. <br />A feeling of impending doom dominates the story, thanks to Montys impending incarceration. Every plan and every activity that is usually taken for granted, now has much greater meaning to Monty, now that he realises that all that is about to be taken from him. Its a story of three men who are forced to take stock of their lives and none of them really like what they see.<br />A little word of warning, if you are expecting a mystery story, it isnt. This is more a character study, but it is one that is very well done and left me wanting more. Its a fast read that covers a lot of emotional territory. This is a wonderful debut novel that I highly recommend.	2001-08-22

He needs a job in his line of expertise, but realises that there are many people in his same predicament. His solution is to narrow the odds in his favour by eliminating the competition, literally. He places an ad in a trade magazine in order to collect resumes of people in a similar situation to him. Then, anyone he decides has better qualifications than his is marked for elimination.<br />This chilling story describes the desperation that drives an apparently normal middle-aged man with a wife and grown children to embark on a killing spree. We're taken along for the ride as he tries to justify to himself the need for these murders to take place, his agony of guilt after each one, but then, frighteningly, his ability to overcome the guilt before planning the next one. Indeed, he begins to pride himself on picking up a new skill! As Burke goes from one victim to another, he depersonalises what he is doing by using his victim's initials when referring to them rather than their names. <br />Although this is fiction, it seems an altogether likely scenario of the thought patterns of the real-life serial killers, and the unbelievable justifications for their murders. This is a frightening story in the absolute cold-bloodedness of the murders by a man who, in all outward appearances, comes across as a very gentle man.	2001-08-21

The discussion between Bernie and Carolyn over the sexual preference of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone is priceless. This is a sometimes-confusing mystery involving a series of events that sees Bernie burgle an apartment, return the booty and then re-enter the place to plant evidence after finding a corpse in the bathroom. Bernie sets out to work out who committed the murder, plus who committed a burglary that he's been mistakenly charged with. This is a most entertaining mystery that continues to keep you thinking, while providing plenty of smiles along the way.	2001-08-19

The drug was supposed to help combat skin cancer by eliminating skin pigment, unfortunately when given to Freddie it not only eliminated Freddie's skin, but also the rest of him, rendering him invisible. An invisible burglar, the possibilities are endless. But so are the problems. Freddie and his girlfriend, Peg, are chased by various people who all have the same idea, harnessing his invisibility for their own evil plans. <br />Thanks to Westlake's great ability with putting together great caper stories, the subplots are amusing and quite entertaining, but when you get to the end you get the feeling that the potential has not been reached. Although not an uproariously funny book, its tone is light and the humour is constant, at times subtle and usually quite clever.<br />If it's light reading you're after and prefer entertainment over finding a deeper meaning of life, I think you'll enjoy this book. A good example of the humour of Donald Westlake can be found in a surgeon general's warning on the inside front flap stating that \\"Reading Donald E. Westlake may lead to shortness of breath, prolonged chortles, outbreaks of hysterical laughter, and sudden, drop-dead surprises.\\"	2001-08-17

(Milan Jacovich Mysteries)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Milan is the Man	Mary Soderberg walks back into Milan Jacovich's life when she asks him to help out her boyfriend, the man she left him for, when he is the main suspect in the murder of a high profile television reporter. Milan finds that he still can't resist Mary's pleas and puts himself in what proves to be quite an awkward situation. Milan has to put professionalism ahead of his personal feelings when he agrees to take on the case because, although he hates the man who stole Mary away from him, he is, after all, taking his money to help try to prove his innocence.<br />As far as private investigator series go, the Milan Jacovich is proving to be a very strong and involving one. Milan is a continually developing character that is consistently interesting and likable. For fans of private investigator books, this is a very worthwhile series and this particular episode doesn't let it down.	2001-08-15

One of them is an FBI agent and her fiancé; the other is a fellow journalist and her lover. Josh Weinstein, the FBI agent enlists John Menden, the lover to take an undercover role to bring the killer to justice. What makes this difficult is the suspect is an ex-FBI agent who now heads a very successful security agency and is surrounded by both heavily armed employees and a patrolled, virtually impregnable fortress. <br />While the idea is good one, vengeance for the death of a loved one, the execution was just a little sloppy. The pretext that was used to penetrate the fortress was just a little too unbelievable for my liking. That's just a minor quibble on my part though and once I accepted that Mendon was in, I got on with enjoying the tension of a mole working undercover 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you enjoy this kind of slow boiling suspense story, then I think you'll enjoy \\"The Triggerman's Dance\\".	2001-08-14

The faculty board employs Spenser to investigate the allegation and report to them. As soon as he begins to dig, he receives a warning to back off or he will be killed. Although the threat was delivered in the nicest, most charming way, it only prompts him to dig harder and this brings the ever-reliable Hawk onto the case.<br />I was particularly amused at the outrage expressed by Spenser when he discovered the paltry sum his would-be assassins were being paid to take him out. What an insult, such a blow to the ego. You feel that Spenser and Hawk are always in control of the situation, no matter how dire or what the odds are. Not very realistic, true, but hey, its very entertaining and thats what counts. The original sharp tongued, smooth and competent private investigator with the faithful sidekick/partner, Spenser books are always great reading and this is no exception.	2001-08-10

Mary Crow and her two friends Alex and Joan are getting away from it all for the weekend by returning to Mary's childhood home. No sooner do they reach their destination than they're attacked by a deranged backwoodsman who kidnaps one of the women. The story then takes on a hunted becomes the hunter, who in turn is also being hunted, line, for while Mary is chasing the kidnapper, she is also being stalked by another man who is intent on exacting a revenge of his own.<br />This is Sallie Bissell's debut novel and it is one of the most suspenseful books I have read in a long time. As the story was nearing the climax, I actually realised that I was holding my breath and reading it out of the corner of my eye (a bit like not wanting to watch the scary parts of a movie, I suppose). This book is highly recommended, no I'll go further than that, it's one of the best suspense novels I've read in the last 5 years (there, now you've got to read it, don't you).	2001-08-09

The main concentration is on the preparation and presentation of radio shows, and the detail to this end is quite deep. If you were interested in the workings of early radio show then I think you would find this book to be compulsive reading.<br />Due to the great detail provided in describing the radio side of the story, something had to be neglected and in this case it turned out to be the mystery. Any progress made by Jordan Ten Eyck / Jack Dulaney in solving the disappearance of two men was made with wild hunches based on very little evidence which always happened to yield results. I found this \\"luck\\" very unlikely and found myself growing increasingly frustrated with that aspect of the story. Rather than expecting a mystery, expect a story of the day to day running of a radio studio and it's importance to the cultural growth of America during the Second World War.	2001-08-07

There are about 5 different threads of storylines that are gradually woven together tighter and tighter until something just has to give. And when it does, the effects are devastating.<br />It's New York City, 1981 and the racial tensions between the Arabs and the Jews are simmering. A plot is being hatched and put into place by a small Arab group to start a holy war by bombing the Jewish part of town. Separate to this, yet delicately connected are a couple of Mexican brothers who have been arrested and charged with murdering an undercover officer during a drug bust. This is where Deputy D.A. Butch Karp comes into the picture, he's interested in getting a conviction, you see. Marlene Ciampi, Butch's wife is a private detective, specialising in protecting abused women and is also tenuously drawn into the picture after an Arab girl flees the family home. Now just add a murder or two, stir and let the fun begin.	2001-08-03

It looks as though the person responsible is J.J. Fielding, an embezzler on the run after ripping off a drug cartel to the tune of around $400 million. From here things start to get complicated. On Fielding's trail is a hired killer, Hal, who also happens to be a homicidal maniac with a particularly gruesome (and just a little unbelievable) method of murdering his victims. And on his trail is the FBI who decides to use Hannah as bait to lure and capture Hal.<br />Hal, the inevitable psychopathic assassin, is provided as yet another seemingly unstoppable cold-blooded killer who, you just know, will eventually confront Hannah. Apart from a few scenes that stretched the bounds of belief just a little too far for my liking, the book was very entertaining. Once again James Hall has produced a fast-paced book that urges you to keep reading as the climax is brought to its peak.	2001-08-01

Unfortunately, he is interrupted during the attempt and the documents disappear. When murdered bodies begin showing up along with mysterious visitors, both threatening and friendly, Bernie finds himself drawn into a mystery whose origins come from an unknown European country.<br />While it had its amusing moments, I thought the plot became very convoluted and was bogged down by a bewildering number of characters. I was also a little disappointed with the explanation for the murders and for the interest in the object that Bernie was meant to steal. All in all, it felt a bit anti-climactic.<br />Humorous references are made to Sue Graftons Kinsey Milhone series throughout the book with Block making up names for a new book that had supposedly just been released. I is for Claudius was my favourite title.	2001-07-30

Bernie Rhodenbarr is hard at work one night knocking over a house in which, he's assured, he'll find a leather-bound box. Problem 1, the box isn't there. Problem 2, the police catch him in the act. Problem 3, there's a dead body in the house, which is found by the police. Was he set up or was his luck just really bad on this job? In order to prove his innocence Bernie has to find out who committed the murder while staying ahead of the law.<br />This is a great idea for a different slant on mystery protagonists. It's not every story that you find yourself on the side of the burglar, so I found this book very refreshing indeed. Bernie commits crimes as a living does essentially a reprehensible job, but you can't help but like the guy. And as an investigator he's not too bad either. This is a very good mystery that has certainly prompted me to read other books in the series.	2001-07-28

Warshawski, possibly the toughest female private investigator in the game. She is hired by an influential businessman to find his son and his son's girlfriend. It doesn't take long before she finds the son dead, the man who hired her wasn't whom he said he was, and she's had the proverbial beaten out of her as a warning to drop the case. V.I. is another one of those private investigators that, once hired, will stop at nothing to solve the case. Although she's told by her original client that he no longer requires her services, she persists like a dog with a bone, determined to see the case through to it's conclusion.<br />The setting is Chicago and it's summer, so we're given a lot of speculation on how the Cubs are going to fare that year. Now, I'm from Australia, but even I know that the season's only going to end in disappointment...again. (No offence sports fans).<br />This is another enjoyable private investigator book with a good, hard as nails protagonist. I have no problem recommending this to anyone who enjoys the Robert Parker \\"Spenser\\" series or the Robert Crais \\"Elvis Cole\\" series.	2001-07-26

That's not to say I didn't enjoy the first book I read - I did, but as I get to know Milan better, he's becoming like an old friend and I've felt comfortable slipping back into Cleveland to visit him again. \\"So why should I read this book?\\" you ask. Well, if you like a good private investigator mystery with little violence, only a bit of swearing (Milan Frowns on it) and interesting, believable characters, I think you'll enjoy this book.<br />Milan is hired by a beautiful young heiress to find her boyfriend, a middle-aged artist who has also disappeared with $18,000 that she loaned him. When Milan starts asking around, he finds that the guy he's looking for is a hustler and there are quite a few people in town that would also like to get their hands on him. The Cleveland art scene, or more specifically the ceramic art scene, comes under the spotlight as Milan conducts his investigation.<br />By the way, as Les Roberts goes to great pains to explain, Milan Jacovich is pronounced (MY-lan Yacovich), so make sure you get the pronunciation right.	2001-07-25

I thought it contained a good mix of action and character interaction (you can sense the \\"but\\" coming, can't you?)...but...from the moment a dead body was discovered, rather than take off on a thrilling romp, the story seemed to fizzle into a directionless meander. <br />The main character, Michael Garrick, ran around like a chook with it's head cut off confronting everyone with accusations of guilt which, naturally, they denied, getting us nowhere and making me wonder what the point was. Some books suffer from information overload, this one suffered from information deprivation, yet it took over 400 pages to not tell us anything. I guess the lack of information was meant to build the tension, but it caused my interest gradually leak out until I really didn't care what the outcome was.	2001-07-23

The murder is that of a local black woman known by her neighbours as \\"Mad Annie\\". She was an alcoholic who also suffered from Tourette's syndrome and was the victim of her neighbours hate and derision because she was different. Although her death appeared to be accidental, one neighbour isn't convinced and begins a quest that almost costs her marriage, her sanity and, certainly, her job.<br />This is not a cheery, happy-go-lucky, breezy mystery full of feel-good moments. Some pretty polarising issues are highlighted in the telling of this story. Racism, animal cruelty, child and spousal abuse and ignorance towards mental illness are all dealt with. It's a provocative mystery that examines the darker human failings that most of us would prefer to ignore by pretending they don't exist, and no apologies are made.<br />On top of the social commentary is a very well put together mystery with a long list of possible suspects. Like all good mysteries, the murderer could be just about anyone and isn't revealed until right at the end. The twists in the case are typical Walters as we're fed information, one tantalising piece at a time.	2001-07-19

Then an anonymous email arrives which suggests that, just possibly, she's still alive. To add to the intrigue, the murder case is reopened and Beck is now the FBI's main suspect. The action takes off when Beck becomes a fugitive and is not only pursued by the police, but also by a bunch of thugs intent on silencing him for good - and how on earth do those blokes come into it?. All the while, he tries to meet up with the mystery correspondent, not an easy task when it seems his every move is monitored.<br />I found this to be one of those books that seems a lot shorter than it actually is because the action is non-stop, you barely have time to get over one near miss when you're confronted with some other danger or a new piece of the puzzle is put into place. It's a compelling book thanks to the mystery surrounding the death of Elizabeth Back, wife of David Beck. This was one of the more enjoyable books I've read this year and rate it very highly purely on its ability to entertain.	2001-07-19

It's a rough, tough world out there and it's brought to life for us in each of his books and this one is as close to reality as any of his previous books. It's a gritty book with occasional scenes of extreme violence, populated with characters that have become tired with life and just about totally worn down through their hard living in a hard world.<br />Set in the 90s, Shame the Devil features the characters in Pelecanos' three previous books, updates their lives for us and puts them through one final tough experience. It's probably necessary to have read the three previous books to gain a full understanding of all that's mentioned during this story. Old characters are revisited along with parts of their story, reminders of previous books and I should imagine some of these references would be lost if Shame the Devil were the first Pelecanos that you've read.	2001-07-17

Milan makes for an interesting protagonist. He's an ex-footballer; ex-policeman turned private investigator living in Cleveland, Ohio. While he's big and impressive in bearing, I wouldn't call him an overtly macho man, giving his character the extra bit of credence required in private investigator books, I believe.<br />In this particular case, Milan is asked, or more correctly, ordered by a mafia boss, to help a friend's wife in her mayoral election campaign. She is running for mayor in a small lakeside community. But Milan wonders what could possibly command the mafia's interest in a small, out of the way town. Like all stories involving election campaigns, whether big or small, political intrigue is the order of the day and the tactics can get dirty. Luckily, Milan has a cool head on his shoulders, and also the size to intimidate most opponents, ensuring there's rarely a dull moment when he's around.<br />I enjoyed this book, purely because the main protagonist is a very refreshing character and I'll be on the lookout for the other books in the series. Residents of Cleveland and surrounding areas would find an extra incentive to read the series because Roberts does go into quite a bit of detail when describing the city, while not exactly adding much to the story, I didn't feel as though it compromised it either.	2001-07-13

Dimitri Karras and Marcus Clay are featured again, as in King Suckerman, but Nick Stefanos (both the older and younger) make appearances. To avoid confusion, it is highly recommended that before reading this book you try reading a couple of Pelecanos' earlier books, particularly The Big Blowdown and King Suckerman which are the earlier of this particular series.<br />In this book, a drug car smashes and bursts into flames outside Marcus Cray's Real Right record store. Someone waiting outside the record store walks over to the car and takes a pillowcase filled with money out of the burning car. When the local gang-leader, and owner of the money, finds out about the theft of his dough, he's not very happy and seeks to regain his money. Dimitri and Marcus are drawn into this fight because of their proximity to the original accident.<br />Once again, the mood of the book is set by the use of street talk by the characters, the description of the music they listen to, and the ongoing NCAA basketball tournament of the day. As with all Pelecanos books, the drug culture is strongly featured and appears to have gripped Dimitri pretty tightly now. This is the third of a series of four books, with the fourth title being Shame the Devil.	2001-07-10

His secretary calls him one night after her husband has been shot at outside the home of renowned author Buck Weldon. Saxon agrees to look into it and it becomes apparent that the target of the attack was most likely Buck Weldon himself. It wasn't the first attempt on his life, which prompts Saxon to investigate further. Also prompting him to investigate further is Buck's beautiful daughter, for whom Saxon has fallen utterly and hopelessly in love.<br />This book is somewhat reminiscent of the Elvis Cole books by Robert Crais, although Saxon is not quite as pithy in his dealings with clients, nor as cool. The story moves at a good pace, but it contained no real surprises. Those that were meant to be earth-shattering revelations were telegraphed and I easily figured them out long before they happened. All in all this is a quite enjoyable book, yet didn't contain anything that made it stand out from the many other private investigator books out there.	2001-07-08

After coming out of the war a hero, Karras, along with his childhood friend Joe Recevo, finds himself drifting along, occasionally providing muscle for the Mafia in their protection rackets. When Karras makes the mistake of showing leniency towards one of his boss's \\"clients\\", it's inevitable that he has to be taught a (painful) lesson. The story is ultimately a commentary on how the two friends deal with the different directions their lives have taken, particularly when their paths cross again.<br />The mood of the time and place are captured with remarkable vividness. Even the street noises are described in such a way that it almost feels as if we are there watching the drama unfold in front of us. I feel this is the defining novel for George Pelecanos and a must read for Pelecanos fans. I can't recommend it highly enough without appearing to gush, so I'll just say that it's a fantastic piece of American literature that manages to capture the 40's very nicely.	2001-07-05

A wealthy politician, Will Trona, who trained him in all aspects of life, particularly in awareness of self and respect of others, and employed him as his driver and bodyguard, adopted him. When Will is murdered, the greatest influence in Joe's life is gone, leaving him feeling guilty for letting his father down and driven for revenge.<br />In Joe Trona, T. Jefferson Parker has created an amazingly complex character, who while essentially gentle, is capable of great violence. He is painfully aware of his appearance and its effect on others, yet has overcome his embarrassment and shame and is an extremely strong person because of it. He was the kind of lead character who is easy to like and become involved with, in the hope that he \\"wins\\".<br />The story, while essentially a simple one involving a sons' need for revenge, was made much more interesting by the colourful characters and the intrigue with which they were involved.	2001-07-03

I probably never would have continued on through the series if I had have read this one first. It is easily the weakest of the Stefano books. It lacks direction for a good 90% of the book and only really starts to hot up for the finale and the reveals. Like the other books, Nick Stefano and his friends indulge in mind-blowing quantities of both alcohol and marijuana. Unfortunately, the focus was mostly on these excesses rather than trying to solve the problem at hand, which was to find a former co-worker who appeared to have been kidnapped.<br />For completeness sake, by all means read this book, but really, it isn't necessary before going on to the next in the series, Nick's Trip, which I felt was a more enjoyable and entertaining story.	2001-07-01

The reason for this is that aspects of the murder make it appear that a terrorist group was responsible and Rebus's previous SAS experience would come in handy. The investigation takes him from his home base to the villages of rural Scotland and across to Belfast and back again.<br />Throughout the book, the Catholic versus Protestant problem is continually raised, comparing Scotland to the Troubles in Northern Ireland and suggesting that the same uprising could be imminent. While the characters were discussing terrorist organisations there were enough three letter acronyms being bandied about to make me think I might have stumbled into a Microsoft manual.<br />Once again we are treated to the bare bones of Edinburgh's back streets and dingy estates that have fallen into ruin. Rebus is as inscrutable and removed from his fellow officers as ever, yet, at least for me, he is becoming more and more likable. I feel this series is getting more and more enjoyable with every book I read, this one is no exception.	2001-06-28

The only person who seems to laugh at his jokes is me.<br />This time, Elvis is hunting down a priceless book called the Hagakure for a very wealthy businessman. As usual, the man Elvis is working for annoys Elvis and so he goads him mercilessly with witty repartee and cornball humour (impressing his client no end). Once the investigation begins the trail leads to the Japanese mafia, also known as the Yakuza. Joe Pike makes his appearance from this point on (what Elvis Cole mystery would be complete without him?) and together they try to track down the missing book.<br />As far as detective novels go, the Elvis Cole series continues to entertain. The humour of Elvis' narration mixed with the action and drama ensures that the story breezes along and never fails to entertain. There are some twists and turns toward the end of the book that help add some spice to the mystery and gave it an ending that I wasn't really expecting.	2001-06-27

All the action takes place amidst a heaping helping of all three \\"pleasures\\". King Suckerman is set in the late 70s and really focuses closely on the drug scene in and around Washington DC. To describe it, I would say it's Cheech and Chong meets Reservoir Dogs.<br />Cheech and Chong because everyone seems to be stoned, getting stoned or looking to get stoned. As a result, I just couldn't take the characters all that seriously, even those with murderous intent. Reservoir Dogs because, at times, the violence was very graphic, the bad guys took no prisoners and the undercurrent of menace was constant.<br />It's an unusual book in that there really is no obvious lead character. Dimitri Karras is the nearest thing to the lead. He is a deadbeat who gets by dealing pot and playing pickup basketball games.<br />The pace is frenetic, there's definitely never a dull moment, mayhem abounds and there's a nice little cameo by Nick Stefanos for all the insiders who have read \\"Nick's Trip\\". I enjoyed it, it was very entertaining.	2001-06-25

It introduces us to Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro and their private investigation business in their hometown of Boston. The Boston we get to see, though, is the lower working class and slum areas of town. This is a hardboiled thriller to the core. Patrick Kenzie is haunted by memories of his abusive father; Angie Gennaro is married to an abusive husband. Together they have a fantastic chemistry in which they can virtually read each other's minds.<br />Kenzie and Gennaro are hired by a local Senator to find a black cleaning woman who was in his employ until she disappeared with some important documents. The case is simple, find the woman and return the documents. The woman is found, but from this point on, things start to go wrong, and it's clear that Kenzie and Gennaro haven't been told the whole story. They soon find themselves caught up in a gangland war where survival is looking less and less likely.<br />The dialogue is witty and sharp, the story is very well paced and the characters are very believable and all too real-life. I have read all the other Kenzie-Gennaro books before this one (shame on me for reading this out of order) and rate it very highly in comparison. In actual fact, it would have been of great benefit if I had have read this book first as it puts into perspective events that occur in the later books.	2001-06-23

Not only had the salesperson disappeared, but also, so had a significant payout, $12 million to be exact.<br />Once they hit the road, the thrill of the chase really takes hold. Thomas Perry gives us a very interesting insight into what it takes to try to find someone who doesn't wish to be found. This is in stark contrast to his Jane Whitefield series in which we come at the problem from the side of the person trying to evade capture.<br />Apart from a small lull in the action upon arriving in New Hampshire, the book was compelling reading with problem after problem needing to be solved. As it turned out, the small lull in New Hampshire was just an opportunity for me to get my breath back before the real fireworks began.	2001-06-22

If Nick had a small drinking problem in \\"Nick's Trip\\", it's developed nicely into full-blown alcoholism by this book. It was while on a bender one night that Nick passes out in a public park, only to be wakened in the early hours by a man being shot to death and dumped in the water. Due to some strange feeling of guilt or responsibility over the murder, Nick feels he should investigate what went on.<br />Once again George Pelecanos has produced a typically hard-bitten look at the seedier parts of Washington D.C. and paints the picture of a lonely man who can't seem to quite get his act together. The big development in this book is that Nick picks up a partner, a fellow private investigator who doesn't smoke and doesn't drink. He is probably the perfect foil for Nick's excesses, but he is a bit of an enigma with some closely guarded secrets about his personal life.<br />Just a word of warning while you are reading this book. Don't get too close to the pages or you'll run the risk of waking up the next morning with a doozy of a hangover, the Old Grand Dad and Bud does get a bit of a workout.	2001-06-19

The housework went out the window, the gardening was forgotten, I just had to find out who was committing these murders and how they were going to be stopped.<br />Other people have written excellent plot outlines in their reviews so I won't waste your time by repeating them here. Suffice it to say that if you enjoy a good psychological thriller with plenty of suspects, you'll enjoy this book.	2001-06-18

Nick Stefanos is a private eye who helps make ends meet by working behind the bar at a place called the Spot. An old buddy from school tracks him down and asks him to find his wife. While working the case we are continually taken back to Nick's youth as he remembers old friends and family. The storyline lurches from chapter to chapter. One minute he's working on the case in search of a missing woman, the next he's running down leads about a murdered friend leaving us to make the necessary mental adjustments.<br />Nick's a hard-drinking, hard-smoking bloke who's marching to the beat of his own drummer.  This is not a light hearted romp, rather, we trudge through the seedier parts of town with a character who tends to fit right in. The method of chasing up leads seems to be an endless series of visits to bars throughout the D.C. area with a necessary shot and a beer at each. You've got to be prepared to accept that Nick Stefanos has many faults and weaknesses and is not your average private investigator. Oh, by the way, even with all his faults, I still found the story quite enjoyable.	2001-06-15

Simply put, it's a FAQ manual for runners.<br />One small problem with this format is, there is only one question and answer addressed per topic, so the information imparted is very specialised. To counter this, the book covers a wide range of topics from beginning running to marathon training, to injuries, to advice for young and older runners.<br />I would recommend this book to the beginner / inexperienced runner. Those who have been running for some time would very likely have come across most of this information before. If you're looking for a repository that contains a great deal of accumulated knowledge that can be accessed easily, here it is.	2001-06-14

For that reason I'm only giving it three stars - I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, it just wasn't quite as good as some of the other books in the series. The snappy dialogue from Elvis is still evident and the humour is constant, as usual, it just seemed to take a while for something to happen.<br />Elvis is hired by a young woman whose fiancé is a plainclothes police officer and she suspects that he may be getting himself into some sort of trouble. At first it seems that the young policeman is cheating on his girlfriend, but then it slowly becomes clear that something more sinister is happening. With the help of the ultra-capable Joe Pike, Elvis finds himself caught between the LAPD and a street gang who are intent on stopping him.<br />Like I implied earlier, Elvis Cole is Elvis Cole and ya gotta love him. It just didn't grab me the way the others have and I didn't race through it like I did the others.	2001-06-13

This is the first Robert Parker book I've read, so I'm not going to try to make that comparison. Instead, I will give you my impression as an out-and-out newcomer. There was one word that kept flashing through my head as I was reading this book. That word was \\"lightweight\\".<br />The mystery, involving two murders never really became intriguing enough for me to care who committed them. The story never gathered any momentum nor reached any heights. Rather than building up suspense and reaching some thrilling conclusion that had me on the edge of my seat, the story just petered out. No high point to speak of.<br />Sunny appears to be a Stephanie Plum character - only capable and with more boring friends. The shtick with the dog struck me as too cutesy. I'd call this a good beach book, a nice quick read to kill some time.	2001-06-11

He has managed to tie in characters from all his other books. Terry McCaleb from Blood Work, Harry Bosch, the protagonist of 6 other books and Jack McEvoy from The Poet. He makes mention of the incident from which he was serving a suspension in The Last Coyote. Not only that, the assistant prosecuting attorney in the ongoing court case makes a reappearance after being introduced in Angel's Flight. Just for fun, see if you can spot the passing reference to a character in Connelly's other stand alone book, Void Moon.<br />On top of everything else, Michael Connelly delivers yet another powerful thriller, combining McCaleb's profiling skills with the dark figure of Harry Bosch. Two stories are intertwined as Bosch is involved with a high profile court case, and McCaleb investigates a murder. I feel we're treated to the best of all worlds through the combination of all of Connelly's main protagonists.<br />If you're a dyed-in-the-wool Michael Connelly fan, this book will bring back fond memories of his previous works. If it's the first Michael Connelly book you've read, I think you'll find your curiosity sufficiently aroused to go back and read the earlier stuff.	2001-06-08

He became disillusioned and packed it all in after telling a witness to lie on the stand in order to get an innocent man acquitted. Now he's being asked to return to court in a special case, but this time as the prosecutor. The accused is the chief deputy district attorney, Marshall Goodwin, and he has been charged with conspiring to murder his wife.<br />We end up getting two cases for the price of one, with Antonelli being asked to defend the wife of an old friend, immediately the first case is decided. Quick as a flash he changes hats from prosecutor, back to his familiar role as defense attorney. From this point on, the plot changes from a straightforward case to one of intrigue with suspects being thrown up left, right and centre.<br />For a book written about and largely being set in, one trial or another, we seem to move at breakneck speed (unlike the judicial process it represents). By this I mean that we don't get bogged down by irrelevant side stories or observations. Everything is nicely tied in to the case at hand which keeps things nice and tight. The story moves along seamlessly as each case unfolds and I found it a very entertaining courtroom drama.	2001-06-06

Alcoholic, thief, street-bum and occasional prostitute, Lorraine plumbs the depths of humanity after seemingly having it all. She has reached this point after a promising career in the police force, reaching the rank of lieutenant with two bravery commendations, the wife of an up-and-coming lawyer and the mother of two small girls.<br />While trying to straighten herself out, Lorraine manages to escape from a killer, making her a valuable witness in a serial killer investigation. Because of who she has become, she doesn't come forward to the police, preferring instead to use her almost forgotten police skills to track the man down. With limited resources, money and hold over her alcoholism, an investigation of sorts is conducted.<br />This is a dark and sometimes depressing book with little hope on the horizon for Lorraine Page. As a protagonist, Lorraine is a hard character to warm to. I think you just have to accept that she's a tough character who will occasionally succumb to her demons. It's these character flaws that make this an interesting story although, at times the going does get a little heavy as we wade through the morass of her life.	2001-06-04

They don't like the RICO Act which essentially says that anyone with prior knowledge of a crime is deemed to be as guilty of the crime as the person who perpetrated it. They're keen to find a way to get the act overturned and this is the solution they have come up with.<br />The two main protagonists are a couple of friends who had met at prep-school. Mickey Alo from New Jersey is the son of a mafia boss who will take over from his father when he dies and Ryan Bolt who lives in California and is an award-winning writer / executive producer. Ryan becomes involved with Mickey after being asked to do a documentary on his candidate. Things turn sour between the two ex-friends which ultimately casts them as enemies in the story. From this point on we are treated to two storylines, a presidential campaign in full swing, and a deadly hunt where only violence is the sure outcome.<br />The action is fast-paced and I felt compelled to keep reading long into the night. If you enjoy books about the supposed behind the scenes action of a presidential race mixed with a bit of mob involvement and can handle a bit of violence, I think you'll enjoy this book.	2001-05-31

His search takes him to small-town Connecticut where, once he finds Karen and her son, finds himself in the middle of problems involving the Mafia.<br />Pithy comment follows dry-witted humour in another very enjoyable detective story with the irrepressible Elvis Cole in control. For the first two chapters I found that I was chuckling to myself at least once per page as Elvis met the self-centered, big-shot director client, Peter Alan Nelsen. Although the humour doesn't continue at this pace, a light-hearted feel is maintained throughout the whole book. If you like your detective stories slightly on the humorous side with just a little bit of danger thrown in for spice, then this book (and all the Elvis Cole books) are just perfect.<br />Although this book is part of an ongoing series, it isn't really necessary to read it in the order that it was written. While the main characters are the same (Elvis and Joe Pike), previous plots aren't divulged.	2001-05-29

Perhaps one of these stories can motivate you to greater achievements too.	2001-05-26

Three of the men are life-long buddies, one is an acquaintance - an outsider. A shooting accident while out hunting sees the outsider shot dead.  The local sheriff is not inclined to believe that the shooting was an accident because the facts don't match the story.  The story is told from the perspective of one of the three friends, Walter Frampton. He is a lawyer and is drawn into it both on a professional and personal level. He begins to realise that he didn't know his friends as well as he thought. <br />Once the excitement of the hunting accident passes, we seem to meander from scene to scene without achieving much. There is a side-story which doesn't have any bearing on the matter at hand and, ultimately does not resolve itself. Plotting for his next novel, perhaps? While interesting it loses momentum midway through, consequently my interest began to wane, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library, rather than bought it.	2001-05-25

The officer in charge of the investigation is a young Inspector named George Bennett. It is early in Bennett's career, so this could be a make or break case for him. Because of this, he is determined to find out what really happened, leading us on a relentless pursuit of the truth. Unfortunately, the villagers of Scardale are not very forthcoming when it comes to information, almost to the point where it seems they don't want the girl found.<br />This is an extremely intriguing plot that relentlessly drew me in as evidence slowly came to light. I found myself guessing first one conclusion, then another and still found room for another twist in the tale.	2001-05-23

You find that you get the urge to rush off to the nearest used bookstore in your lunch break to begin your search. <br />I think the Chapter listing 1,001 Collectible Books is a great idea and, as well as providing valuable suggestions on what to collect, is a handy reading list when it comes to the finest works in each genre.	2001-05-22

We go from there to an uneasy feeling that not everything's as it should be. Then things start to get slightly skewed with the protagonists feeling just a little nervous. They don't know exactly what's wrong, but something's not right. Finally, all hell breaks loose and you are left with no doubt that you have just passed into Stephen King's realm, and through all the unreality, you still get the faint glimmer that this impossible situation just could be possible. We're faced with aliens in the woods, a possible threat to humanity and average guys who, on the surface, aren't really equipped for the fight. <br />You will probably want to read this book if: - You're a Stephen King fan who really enjoyed The Tommyknockers. - You want to read a new explanation for all of those supposed UFO sightings over the years. -You enjoy epic, save-the-world stories that, let's face it, could never happen - could they?<br />You probably won't want to read this book if: - You didn't enjoy The Tommyknockers. - You like the action at a sustained fast-pace. The book does tend to lose momentum mid-way through. - You have a thing about profanity.<br />Although the story is rather formulaic, this formula is the reason I read Stephen King books.	2001-05-21

Farm life is tough. The people who live on farms have to be tougher or they won't survive. I felt John Grisham captured this observation beautifully.<br />We look at cotton farming in Arkansas in the 1950s during harvest. We experience the many different apprehensions involved with this season. That of hiring hill folk and the Mexicans, what the weather will do, whether the price will be high or low, will the Cardinals have a winning season.<br />The big strength of this book is the way the characters are brought to life so wonderfully. We experience their joys over simple pleasures such as sitting on the verandah listening to baseball, the loneliness of farm-life, despair of ever finishing harvest, wariness of the strangers employed, intermingled with the acceptance of the life they lead.<br />Sure it's not what you'd normally expect from a Grisham book and yes, we're not glued to our seats with heart-hammering courtroom drama, but so what? We experience the drama of racing to bring the crop in, the troubles that come from mixing people of different backgrounds together, and life on the land as it was in the 1950s.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough for anyone who enjoys looking back on simpler times.	2001-05-13

Harry Bosch isn't so sure. He finds a connection between the dead cop and the importation of a new designer drug called black ice which is coming from Mexico. His investigation, which for the most part is unauthorised, takes him from his home turf in LA, down to the US - Mexico border.<br />This is the second Harry Bosch book, following on from The Black Echo, and Harry Bosch is proving to be a real rebel in the LAPD. The action comes thick and fast when Harry's on the trail, and no stone is left unturned, either legally or otherwise. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the hard-boiled police procedural genre.	2001-05-13

Dead (Stone Barrington)	Books	1	5	8	N	N	Stone's Lost His Impact	As a long-time Stuart Woods fan, it's really disappointing to do this review, but then, for the last few Stone Barrington books I've felt pretty let down. Stone has developed into a parody of a hero. The coolness, the irresistableness of this character have grown to laughable proportions. Only problem is, the book's not a comedy.<br />For what it's worth the storyline is as follows: Stone comes to the rescue of his old flame, Arrington. Her husband has been murdered and she has been fingered as the killer. Stone signs on as her attorney and unofficial investigator. As an aside, Stone is being stalked by Dolce, the woman he left at the altar in Venice in order to take on the case.<br />This book is a mindless, lightweight mystery that attempts to pack in every Hollywood cliche possible at the expense of providing any real story. All the women are rich and beautiful and prepared to throw themselves at Stone, who obliges by bedding the lot of them. I can't recall a single character who reacted to a situation in a way that was remotely believable.<br />It's a shame that a talented author such as Stuart Woods should waste his time producing stuff like this. Although I get the feeling he didn't spend that much time. Take me back to the time he wrote &quot;Chiefs&quot; and New York Dead&quot;.	2001-05-10

Her parents, after realising she was missing, begin the search for her, largely without the help of the authorities.<br />This is not the best work of Jeffery Deaver, however, if you enjoy psychological thrillers, you should enjoy this. One must be prepared to accept the power of speech and suggestion as a weapon. After a fast-paced opening, the story goes a bit flat midway through, with some reminiscing between the parents and a bit of meaningless rambling. Also, for some inexplicable reason, the kidnapper begins contacting witnesses, the parents and the police under the guise of an FBI agent.<br />I got the feeling that Jeffery Deaver was still honing his story-telling techniques with this book. A little of Deaver's forensic descriptions a la Lincoln Rhyme creeps in at one point, but is only given minor attention. While the basic storyline was plausible enough, we were asked to suspend belief in quite a few key scenes.	2001-05-08

Because the first victims found are black women, the investigation, conducted by Harry's father, is hampered first by indifference and then later by intolerance, with mob violence taking over at one point.<br />Although times were tough, through the eyes of young Harry Crane, life was good, and simple pleasures, such as drinking a cold bottle of Coca-Cola, were relished. Throughout the book there remains an undercurrent of menace while revisiting the good old days. There's a killer on the loose and someone, or something, is living down in The Bottoms.	2001-05-07

We learn a great deal about techniques used in searching for bodies, a skill I'm not expecting to need, but interesting nonetheless. Following a daring escape by the serial killer responsible for those corpses, the story goes into simmer-mode. Tension builds as the killer begins to let Irene know that she's in his sights. The big questions are, when will the killer strike, and how?<br />If you've followed Irene Kelly up to this point, I'm sure you'll enjoy reading her latest adventure. If you're meeting her for the first time, hold on tight because life with Irene is anything but boring.	2001-05-06

Some people write books, some people tell stories and a select few can totally capture your imagination. With a fluid, easy style, William Gay, in his debut novel, falls into the last category. Set in Tennessee in the 1940s, I was transported to a time and place I've never been, yet it felt so familiar. I definitely want more of the same. Keep 'em coming please.	2001-05-05

Rather than hide the killer until the last moment, we are fed clue after clue and if you're good enough (I wasn't) you should be able to work out who done it.<br />As well as being an excellent mystery which had me guessing until all was revealed, it was also a sometimes poignant commentary on how we might deal with loss - both through death and separation.<br />I urge anyone who loves a good mystery to try to solve it before the author makes the revelation.	2001-05-04

Once again the forensic detail is just amazing as the brilliant criminalist sifts through minute pieces of evidence in the hope of tracking down a would-be killer.<br />After beginning with a seemingly straightforward case with an obviously guilty suspect, thanks to forensic science, things become a little less cut and dried. Soon, we're led on a chase with twists and surprises in the plot that hit you from out of the blue.	2001-05-04

This time he's trying to solve the murder of a local MP's wife. He comes up against the usual brick walls put up by superior officers on the way to solving the case, but in this book for the first time, he seems to have made a friend in the force in young DS Brian Holmes.<br />I'm finding the Insector John Rebus books even more enjoyable since the newer, mellow John Rebus has been developed.<br />A wonderful British police procedural full of wit and glint-in-the-eye humour.	2001-03-14

She is an up-and-coming deputy sheriff with designs on the top job. He's been brought out of retirement, going through chemotherapy, and has seen it all.<br />While developing a complete character picture, we are also treated to a compelling mystery that had me guessing right to the end.	2001-03-05
