Set in Cloisterham, a cathedral town, Dickens's final novel, unfinished, introduces two elements unusual for Dickens--opium-eating and the church.  In the opening scene, John Jasper, music teacher and soloist in the cathedral choir, awakens from an opium trance in a flat with two other semi-conscious men and their supplier, an old woman named Puffer, and then hurries off to daily vespers.<br /><br />Jasper, aged twenty-six, is the uncle and guardian of Edwin Drood, only a few years younger. Drood has been the fianc&eacute; of Rosa Bud for most of his life, an arrangement made by his and Rosa's deceased fathers to honor their friendship, and the wedding is expected within the year.  Jasper, Rosa's music teacher, is secretly in love with her, though she finds him repellent.<br /><br />When two orphans, Helena and Neville Landless, arrive in Cloisterham, Helena and Rosa become friends, and Neville finds himself strongly attracted to the lovely Rosa.  Ultimately, the hot-tempered Neville and Drood have a terrible argument in which Neville threatens Drood before leaving town on a walking trip.  Drood vanishes the same day.  Apprehended on his trip, Neville is questioned about Drood's disappearance, and Jasper accuses him of murder.<br /><br />Tightly organized to this point, the novel shows Jasper himself to be a prime suspect, someone who could have engineered the evidence against Neville, but Dickens unexpectedly introduces some new characters at this point--the mysterious Dick Datchery and Tartar, an old friend of Rev. Mr. Crisparkle, minor canon at the cathedral.  Puffer, the opium woman, is reintroduced and appears set to play a greater role, since she solicits  information from the semi-conscious Jasper and secretly follows him.  This is the halfway point in the projected novel, and Dickens clearly planned to develop these new (or reintroduced) characters to deepen the mystery.<br /><br />More modern in many ways than his previous novels, the characters here are not simple stereotypes--some are good people who have real flaws and make mistakes.  Dickens's tying of Jasper to the church choir, where he was a soloist, suggests some examination of the theme of hypocrisy, in which the good Mr. Crisparkle would be Jasper's antithesis.  The opium scenes, vividly drawn, carry the unusual suggestion that opium leads to a kind of intoxication similar to that of alcohol, and Dicken does not use these scenes to offer dire warnings about the drug--at least at this point.  Especially intriguing because it is unfinished, this novel continues to fascinate mystery lovers and literary scholars more than a century after its first publication. n Mary Whipplepeople who have real flaws and make mistakes.

Originally written in draft form around the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Ha Jin's novel recreates those tumultuous times and the forces which built up and exploded in student protest--the stifling of true inquiry and creativity, institutionalized adherence to old-style, hard line bureaucracy, and an all-powerful state which manipulates every aspect of a person's destiny, from education and career path to place of residency and choice of spouse. With candor and a sense of immediacy, Ha Jin illuminates the pressures and frustrations of Chinese academic life, as seen by Jian Wan, studying for his Ph.D. entrance exams in literature, and by Prof. Yang, his mentor and academic advisor.<br /><br />When Prof. Yang, who is also Jian Wan's future father-in-law, suffers a serious stroke, Jian Wan is the one who must tend him in the hospital. Half-crazed and irrational, Prof. Yang has moments of lucidity in which he speaks urgently to Jian and offers heartfelt advice, but most often Jian finds him singing songs from his childhood, recalling nightmarish events from the long-buried past, and reliving conversations and recent events which have dramatically affected both his personal relationships and his career.<br /><br />As Jian listens to Prof. Yang, he finds himself examining his own life and goals with a more critical and discerning eye, becoming more and more disillusioned by the injustices he sees all around him, both within the academic community and in the countryside, where poverty is still rampant, the people are utterly powerless, and life is a hopeless search for a way out.<br /><br />Filled with fascinating insights into the nature of life in a totalitarian state, the novel is both moving and enlightening, though it is sometimes didactic. In clear, efficient prose which avoids all frills and flourishes, Jian tells his story in the first person. The scope expands as the maunderings of Prof. Yang, along with his symbolic stories and recollections, reveal the history of the Chinese Revolution in personal terms.<br /><br />Numerous aphorisms constantly remind the reader of the universality of the characters' observations and of the author's themes: \\"We're all automatons without a soul,\\" \\"Intellect makes life insufferable. It's better to be an ordinary man working honorably with your hands,\\" \\"As a scholar, you're just a piece of meat on a chopping board,\\" and \\"I want to take my fate in my own hands...I want to be a knife instead of a piece of meat.\\"  The dramatic conclusion, full of ironies, is a bit preachy in its message, but few will fail to be moved by scenes from the Tiananmen Square massacre, which provides dramatic and powerful imagery of a China which will \\"devour her children to sustain herself.

Jean, a sixty-four-year-old spinster, is working her final job as a house-sitter before she retires, tending the lovely, large Walden Manor, not far from Bath.  The owners, who will be in Europe from January through August, have locked certain rooms, attested to the inventory, and established rules governing what can and cannot be done on the premises.  Knowing this is her last job, Jean decides to flout the rules, living as if she were truly the lady of the manor, opening locked rooms, the wine cellar and freezer, and the family's personal spaces. Within a week, she has invited her \\"son\\" Michael to move in, and he has brought with him the pregnant Steph, who is about to give birth.  Bonding into a close-knit \\"family,\\" these social outcasts make themselves at home--for the first time in their lives.<br /><br />Jean, writing a first person narrative at the end of her stay, instantly creates suspense when she reveals that there are \\"only eleven more days,\\" and that she \\"does not plan to offer excuses for what we have done.\\"  Through flashbacks, we come to know her family background, learning of her childhood, her psychological and emotional abuse, her dysfunctional relationship with her demanding Mother, and her need for closeness.  Michael, her \\"son,\\" now \\"working\\" as a thief, is similarly needy, having survived an equally horrific childhood.  Steph, the third lost soul, is an abused teenager--pregnant, rejected, and homeless.<br /><br />The characters, though off-beat when taken separately, become absurd when they start behaving as a family.  Living apart from society's rules, they begin acting to protect themselves and their lifestyle at Walden Manor.  Jean speaks for all when she says, \\"I would do anything, absolutely anything, to keep us all together,\\" and the reader has reason to believe her.<br /><br />As the characters' self-protective actions become more extreme, the novel changes from suspenseful psychological horror to the blackest of black-humored farce--some of the darkest humor I've read since Molly Keane's Time After Time.  Joss has filled the novel with minute descriptions of her odd characters in the novel's early pages, creating chilling suspense while stimulating reader empathy with the characters.  In the second half of the novel, however, the reader realizes that these characters are more than just \\"odd,\\" as they engage in increasingly outrageous scenes.  The pace accelerates, and the author's mordant humor is fully unleashed.<br /><br />Coincidences, ironies, understatements, and absurdity combine as Joss guides the novel into that twilight zone between genuine suspense and genuine humor, keeping the reader smiling from the tenterhooks.

Controversial in her own country during apartheid, Nobel Prize-winner Nadine Gordimer frequently found her novels suppressed because of her close identification with and support of majority rule. Her sense of empathy with the black underclass is revealed here in \\"City of the Dead, City of the Living,\\" a short story set in a poor, black neighborhood. Gordimer's own reading of it, with her pregnant pauses and phrasing, bring it to life in ways impossible to imagine through reading alone.<br /><br />Samson Moreke and his wife Nanike live in a small house occupied by up to eleven people. Additional relatives sometimes sleep on the sofa if they need temporary lodging. When their cousin brings a fugitive, a man who has blown up a police station, they agree to hide him for a few days. The young man, an African Nationalist, soon tries to inspire the uninvolved Samson, the sole support of a family of seven, to be more active. When the man stays longer than expected, forcing Samson and Nanike to hide inside, pretending to be away so that no one will visit, Nanike becomes fearful and takes action.<br /><br />Gordimer recreates the crowded conditions of the house and neighborhood through highly detailed physical descriptions, at the same time that she also conveys the social milieu in which Samson and Nanike live, with the local shebeen just across the street. Nanike's inability to understand her own actions, along with their consequences, reveals her ingrained subservience and lack of understanding of the freedom movements going on around her.<br /><br />In \\"Termitary,\\" a white mother hires three exterminators to find a nest of termites which has undermined the floor of the living room. The mother is totally responsible for the maintenance of the house, and as her children avidly watch the men work, they learn that the men must find the queen, who is responsible for the entire population of the termitary. The parallels between the life of the queen and the mother become obvious as details of the family dynamics, the mother's responsibilities, and the secret life of the termitary unfold.<br /><br />Gordimer's realism and her ability to convey big ideas in subtle and graceful prose are especially obvious in these stories, both of which are moving tales of domestic life in which mothers, black and white, are characters who take action.

Anxious to leave Japan to discover his unknown father, he takes a job in the kitchen of a Japanese freighter, where he has to defend himself against racial slurs during his trip to the U.S.  Jumping overboard to escape, he swims ashore to swampy Tupelo Island, off the coast of Georgia, hoping eventually to make his way to the City of Brotherly Love.<br /><br />Tupelo is the site of Thanatopsis, an artists' colony similar to the McDowell Colony, and Ruth Dershowitz, a writer in residence there, refuses to believe the stories circulated by the ship and by INS that Hiro is a dangerous criminal and potential murderer.  When she discovers him, she begins feeding him and protecting him against the yahoos who are trying to apprehend him.<br /><br />Boyle uses this absurd scenario to create farce-like humor, satirizing the characters' inherent prejudices and their unrealistic goals and expectations.  Hiro must protect himself against INS, a trigger-happy lunatic assisting INS, a posse of rednecks engaged in the chase, and even some of the residents of Thantopsis, the name of which is a black-humored reference to the Greek word for \\"death.\\"  Ruth, who is having an affair with the wealthy son of the founder of Thanatopsis, sees Hiro as the possible subject for a story, and she is outraged when a movie star-like writer, who once studied with her, arrives to steal Ruth's thunder by flirting with the men, giving a reading that the residents love, and sneering at Ruth.<br /><br />Boyle's dark humor is delicious, and his pointed satire of the writers' colony, in particular, is priceless--the egos, the homage expected by established writers, the ceremony of the readings, the ritual of \\"silent table\\" vs. the \\"convivial table\\" at breakfast, the esoteric nature of some of the research subjects, and even the goofing off by the \\"artists.\\"  Hiro's only exposure to American society--the residents of Thanatopsis, the wealthy benefactors who have built compounds on the island, the impoverished rednecks and blacks who live off the land, and the INS and police officers who chase and arrest him--is obviously skewed, and his miscommunications and misunderstandings, even with Ruth, are both poignant and hilarious.<br /><br />Filled with unexpected plot twists, brilliant and unique imagery, and ironies which evolve from the conflict between romantic dreams and sometimes harsh reality, the novel looks sharply at the characters' lives and inherent values and offers a sardonic wink. n  Mary Whippleety--the residents of Thanatopsis, the wealthy benefactors who have built compounds on the island, the impoverished rednecks and blacks who live off the land, and the INS and police officers who chase and arrest him--is obviously skewed, and his miscommunications and misunderstandings, even with Ruth, are both poignant and hilarious.

The world of Carrie Bell, a 23-year-old Wisconsin native, changes forever when she witnesses Mike Mayer's dive from Clausen's Pier, a dive which results in his broken neck, quadriplegia, and long rehab. Mike has been her love for eight years, and though the intensity of her early relationship has palled, she has been unable to decide how, or even whether, to call off her engagement. Lovingly remaining at Mike's side during the crucial early months of his recuperation, Carrie wonders, \\"How much do we owe the people we love?\\" as she tries to distinguish between love and friendship and the limitations and obligations of each.<br /><br />Packer's naturalistic style puts the minutiae of the daily lives of Carrie, Mike, their friends, and families under a microscope. We learn, for example, even the smallest details of Carrie's compulsive sewing (how to make a spaghetti strap, why she uses a Bernina sewing machine and Butterick pattern), the exacting therapy a spinal cord injury patient undergoes, some of the cherished traditions of Madison (Paddle and Portage Day at the lakes), and even some of Carrie's memories of friend Jamie from third grade.<br /><br />Packer is equally precise about what the characters are thinking, feeling, wondering, and concluding so that the reader need never search beneath the surface for hidden meanings or subtleties. (\\"We were alone together, and also alone within ourselves.\\" \\"[Carrie went] from guilt to remorse to relief to exhilaration [as she drove to New York].\\" \\"You do what you do. Not without consequences for other people.\\")<br /><br />The subject of spinal cord injuries arouses powerful feelings in the reader and makes us confront our personal moralities as we consider how we ourselves might behave in similar circumstances, and Packer is remarkable in her ability to illuminate these issues. Some readers may feel shortchanged by the conclusion of this book and question how much control Carrie ultimately exercises over her life--does she decide her future or merely let it happen? But Packer's presentation of her character reinforces the belief that little is to be gained by second-guessing someone else's choices.

Axel Vander tells us from the opening of this sensitive and tension-filled study of identity that he is not who he says he is. A respected scholar and professor at a California college, Vander is recognized for his thoughtful philosophical papers and books, especially on the nature of identity. Just before he leaves for a conference on Nietzsche in Turin, however, he receives a letter from a young woman in Antwerp, questioning his own identity and asking to meet with him. As the novel unfolds, we come to know more about the \\"real\\" Axel Vander and more about his mysterious correspondent, the emotionally disturbed Cass Cleave.<br /><br />Like Banville's narrators in other novels, the elderly Axel Vander of Shroud is unreliable and often dishonest, self-concerned but not self-aware. Consummately venal, he blithely takes advantage of whatever circumstances arise. Cass Cleave, the daughter of Alexander Cleave, the narrator of Banville's previous novel, Eclipse, has visions and seizures, and Vander regards her as mad, but she and Vander develop a relationship of almost religious significance. He is depraved and amoral, and she is a sick, avenging angel.<br /><br />In Turin, where she joins Axel, Cass sees religious symbolism in common events, finding an ordinary breakfast a form of communion. Artworks, especially crucifixion scenes by artists from the various settings in which the novel takes place (Cranach, Bosch, Memling, and Van Eyck in the Low Countries; and Tintoretto, Mantegna, and Bellini in Italy) further develop the symbolism. Always present in the background, of course, is the Shroud of Turin, which may be the real burial cloth of Jesus--or may not be. Parallels and contrasts between Vander and Jesus abound.<br /><br />Banville's novel is intense, highly compressed in its development of overlapping themes, and filled with suspense, both real and intellectual. Every plot detail expands his themes of identity and selfhood, and our desire to be remembered after our deaths. Banville's prose is exquisite, creating mystery by introducing details at a snail's pace, conveying attitude, and acutely observing sensuous details and physical reactions. He juxtaposes unlikely events from different times to convey information, providing voluptuous descriptions which contain both an idea and its antithesis simultaneously.

Always concerned with issues of class, social injustice, and employment, Dickens shows in Hard Times, written in 1854, a broader concern with the philosophies and economic movements which underlie those issues. Three parallel story lines reflect a broad cross-section of society and its thinking.<br /><br />Mr. Thomas Gradgrind runs a school founded upon the principles of rationalism, a belief in the importance of facts, the antithesis of romantic \\"fancy\\" and imagination.  Basically a good man, he denies the importance of emotion--for himself, his children, and his students.  Only Student #20, Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus clown, fails to conform to his notions, and in a hilarious, satiric scene at the beginning of the novel, Dickens shows the absurdity of Gradgrind's teachings.<br /><br />Gradgrind's friend, Mr. Bounderby, is a banker and factory owner, aged fifty, who claims to have risen from the gutter to his present lofty position through hard work. Bounderby treats the employees of his Coketown factory as machines, rather than as humans, and his eventual marriage to the teenaged Louisa Gradgrind is seen by both as a marriage of \\"tangible fact,\\" having nothing to do with affection.<br /><br />The third story line involves Stephen Blackpool, a worker in Bounderby's factory, trapped in a marriage to an alcoholic who periodically appears and extorts money from him.  Stephen is in love with Rachael, an adoring factory worker, but his appeal to Bounderby for help in ending his marriage is met with cold, rational pronouncements.  Shortly after, Bounderby fires Stephen \\"for a novelty,\\" forcing him to seek employment elsewhere.<br /><br />As the story lines overlap and intersect, often with consummate irony, Dickens keeps a light enough hand to prevent the story from becoming a polemic, though his criticism of hypocrisy, corruption, and \\"progress\\" at the expense of humanity is clear.  His humor, often dark, keeps the plot moving, and several of his characters, which are often caricatures, do grow and change.  Characteristically, Dickens uses names symbolically-Gradgrind grinds the emotions from his graduates, hires Mr. M'Choakumchild as a teacher, and lives at Stone Lodge.  Mr. Bounderby proves to be a bounder.  Some of the circus performers, like Sissy, live at Pegasus Arms.<br /><br />The dramatic conclusion, which involves the pursuit of an innocent character widely believed to have committed a robbery, draws all the themes together, showing the parallels, contrasts, and ironies which connect these characters, regardless of their social level.  Less epic in plot than some of Dickens's other novels, Hard Times provides an intimate look at a changing economy and an important commentary on the philosophies of the times.

One of the priests or ordinands within a small, remote, High Church seminary must have committed a murder, or two, or three. Commander Adam Dalgliesh, who spent several summers at St. Anselm's as a boy, returns to investigate the death of the young son of an extremely wealthy man, and in short order, additional deaths occur.<br /><br />A Rogier van der Weyden altarpiece, a treasure trove of ecclesiastical silver, Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and other priceless art objects owned by the about-to-be-closed seminary, provide a possible financial motive for murder, while an incestuous relationship, a secret marriage, a paralyzing fear of the future, and even pedophilia by a much-loved priest are among the psychological motives.<br /><br />Politeness and \\"civilized\\" behavior play a greater role here than they do in many, more \\"modern\\" mysteries. There is no graphic sex, no profanity, and no scenes of violence--just the effects of the violence. We see the priests and ordinands only within their circumscribed lives, and there are no scenes that suggest that any of them have any sense of humor or any real need for fun. Although James conveys enough psychological astuteness that her characters do not feel flat, there are at least eight or ten who could have committed the murder and for whom very substantial background information is given.<br /><br />The reader must follow all of them, along with an equally large number of red herrings, for four hundred pages before the plot is resolved, somewhat anticlimactically. That, combined with maddeningly detailed, physical descriptions of the rooms of the seminary, made this a four-star experience for me, rather than five-star. Mary Whipple	2005-10-03

As much fun to read as any book by Redmond O'Hanlon or Gerald Durrell, A Primate's Memoir is funny, irreverent, and full of adventure, while also being a serious scientific study of the savanna baboons of Kenya. Sapolsky's goal is to determine the relationship of baboon stress levels to their overall health over a period of years.<br /><br />A neuroscientist, he observes the social hierarchy and interactions of his baboon group, guesses which individuals appear to be most stressed or most relaxed and then checks their hormones and blood chemistry, not an easy procedure, given his clever and not always co-operative population. Sapolsky, who works alone, must first outwit the baboon, use a blowgun to dart him, follow and wait for him to become unconscious, and then carry him half a mile or more to his portable lab facilities, where he then draws blood and does measurements. The baboons, of course, react to stress the way humans do.<br /><br />The title of A Primate's Memoir is deliberately ambiguous--it is both Sapolsky's memoir and that of his baboon population, and his experiences and interactions with the outside world are remarkably similar to theirs. Leaving the relative safety of the game reserves and hitchhiking into dangerous territories during his \\"down time,\\" Sapolsky describes his travels with enthusiasm, impeccable timing, and great, self-deprecating humor, subtly selecting details which show how similarly he and his baboon population deal with their worlds' uncertainties. Kenya is experiencing civil unrest and corruption; Uganda has just deposed Idi Amin; the Sudan is in the midst of a long civil war; the border of Zaire is under siege; and the Somalis refuse to accept any borders at all, stealing lands and property wherever they go--all dangerous and stressful atmospheres for their populations and for visitors like the author.<br /><br />Sapolsky is a great story teller, however, equally entertaining in presenting both his adventures and his research, his world and that of his baboons. While life may be \\"nasty, brutish, and short,\\" Sapolsky shows us it's a lot more fun if one keeps a sense of humor--and a lot less stressful. Mary Whippleearch, his world and that of his baboons.

Its selection by Oprah has guaranteed its popular success as a novel.<br /><br />The above statements should not be regarded as negatives, however. Drowning Ruth is a terrific read! The author is precise and careful about building her suspense with excruciating slowness. She has created intriguing characters--at heart, not all that different from you and me--characters who are confronted with difficult problems to solve, some of which are not of their own making and some of which are the unexpected results of desperate decisions made in the long ago past. Her alternations of point of view help to give breadth and depth to the conflicts within the main characters, while the fragmentary memories which Ruth contributes add to both the mystery and the sense of dread.<br /><br />Although Schwarz ably illustrates the restricted roles into which women had to adapt themselves during the period, the mores which applied to \\"good girls,\\" and the limited choices open to them, the lack of liberation is so natural a part of her story that her novel and its complications are by no means part of a liberation manifesto.

This book, however, is so different in its focus and execution that one wonders what Alexie's motivation was in publishing it. The main character is despicable--and obviously mentally ill. He brutalizes the most innocent of victims, shocking the reader with murders which could not be more loathsome in their graphic detail. This violence is gratuitous. We are given no understanding of the man or his motivation.<br /><br />Some might argue that because he was stolen from his Indian mother and given to whites to raise that he never felt part of either the white or Indian worlds, and that this is his justification, if not his motivation. But he was an infant when this kidnapping happened, however disgraceful it was, and his adoptive parents were loving ones. It's the old Nature vs. Nurture theme, and Alexie seems to be saying here that Nurture counts for less than nothing if it takes place in a white environment.<br /><br />Perhaps Alexie is trying to turn the tables by having an Indian exact the kind of gratuitous violence against the white world that has been exacted against Native Americans. If that is the case, he has confused the issue by having his killer be part of neither culture, with no social values from either culture infusing his actions. And if Alexie's point is that other Indians are justified in feeling like his killer, one wonders why his depiction of Indian life in Reservation Blues, for example, is so bleak and why his main characters there escape to the white world, \\"[singing] together...with the shadow horses....a song of mourning that would become a song of celebration.\\" Mary Whipple	2005-10-03

Neither realistic nor magical, Jha creates a whole new realm here, the world that exists between dream and nightmare, and between imagination and memory, which all of us inhabit for most of our everyday lives. Motifs (a crow, a red dress, a brown dog, a house with a balcony that looks like a frown) appear and reappear throughout the three different sections, with each part recreating the inner world of a different character.<br /><br />In the first section, Amir, a young man who has been injured by a tram, is nursed back to health by Rima, a young woman who brings him back to her apartment, gets him a doctor, and makes sure that all his needs are met so that he can recuperate in peace. In the second section, Mala, a young newspaper reporter, has gone to a distant village to investigate the death of a child, who has drowned in a canal after being raped. The final section returns to the city where a neighborhood has suffered a rash of suicides. A young child is worried that her parents might kill themselves and confides in a friend, who promises to follow her father and mother.<br /><br />Two italicized prologues and a brief conclusion summarize the novel thematically, while the first person narratives illustrate the sensual responses of Amir, Mala, and the child to what is going on around them and provide insights into their emotional states. The novel requires the reader to form hypotheses about what is happening and how the characters connect, with the author confirming the connections and the meaning of the novel in the conclusion, which draws all the visual details and motifs together.<br /><br />Jha emphasizes the process by which we all bring order and \\"sense\\" to our lives, how we live our dreams, and how we deal with our fears and our memories. The reader must be committed to letting this impressionistic novel unwind, accepting the mysteries that exist, as they do in our own lives, without worrying about the characters or the direction of the \\"plot.\\" The author fills in any blanks at the end. Unique in its approach and fascinating in its construction, this novel captures the essence of its characters' lives and connects directly with the reader's own inner life.

Dunant is a real pro, subtly using every trick in the book to create a psychological novel of intense suspense, a novel that succeeds beautifully in keeping the reader involved, on edge, and dying to find out, first, what is happening to Anna, and second, what is real. The main character, Anna, resembles many other single women about to turn forty, and she is a woman with whom most readers will empathize, even if they find her domestic history to be a bit unusual.<br /><br />As she yearns for love and excitement, reveals her vulnerabilities, and shares her fears, all of which play their part in the mystery that develops during her one week vacation in Italy, Dunant ratchets up the suspense--we can imagine and share Anna's plight because she reflects our own insecurities. The fact that she does not return to her loved ones on time, and is considered missing, coincides with our own worst fears, while the fact that neither we nor Anna are sure about what is real and what is fantasy parallels the neurotic daydreams and nightmares everyone shares.<br /><br />Dunant tantalizes the reader by presenting two parallel explanations for what happens on Anna's vacation. As Anna tells us about her past relationships and the birth of her daughter Lily, now six years old, along with two other, very different relationships which may or may not be occurring in Italy while she is \\"missing,\\" Dunant provides just enough information to allow the reader to jump to conclusions, often incorrect, about what's going on. At the same time, she increases the suspense by having Anna's friend Estella describe the chilling effects of Anna's absence on Lily and the rest of the household back in England.<br /><br />As the novel races to its conclusion, most readers will probably race along, too, unwilling to take a break till it's finished and the outcome known. It is only after the fact, when we \\"recollect in tranquility,\\" that the true sense of Dunant's achievement can be appreciated--she has manipulated us like marionettes, and we have loved every minute of it.

Despite the off-putting title and its suggestion that this is another heavy, depressing story, this is a very funny novel. It is also very thoughtful, thought-provoking, and beautifully constructed. A Mumbai apartment building serves as the setting, a true microcosm of life in Mumbai at large, but a limited enough context for the reader to be able to see the problems as soluble and to appreciate the day-to-day lives of its inhabitants.<br /><br />Vishnu, an alcoholic who inhabits the stairwell on the ground floor, dreams of his mother, his love for Padmini, a prostitute, and the Hindi myths which have given color and meaning to his life, as he lies dying. But he is a colossal problem for his petty and contentious neighbors--Mrs. Pathak tries to figure out how he can be cleaned up and hidden before her gossipy friends come for a card party, Mrs. Asrani hates waste and wonders whether she really needs to leave tea for him after all, Mr. Asrani and Mr. Pathak argue about who will pay for the ambulance to take Vishnu away.<br /><br />While life among these residents of the first floor is centered on the most basic aspects of life, the residents of the upper floors have the financial resources to be able to worry about \\"higher\\" concerns. The Jalal family, on the second floor, are Muslims at odds with the Hindi society in which they live, Mrs. Jalal devout, while Mr. Jalal is still searching for answers. On the top floor is Mr. Taneja, whose ascetic life takes on new meaning when he does good works, finds a swami, and discovers the peace of meditation. The symbolism of the floors takes on additional meaning through Vishnu's visions.<br /><br />In many ways this resembles a grand chorus from a huge and wonderful comic opera, with all the inhabitants of the building singing at once. And underneath all the voices wailing about their personal concerns is the insistent bass of Vishnu as he prepares to die. Dealing with the most basic aspects of religion, love, and human kindness in a city setting which challenges its inhabitants to the limit, Suri creates a warm, funny, and very human drama of a every man's search for meaning in life.

A novel of enormous reach, Coe attempts to give epic significance to the 1970's in Birmingham, England. Abandoning the extremely tight, limited focus he employed in The House of Sleep, Coe here employs a huge cast of characters, eight or ten of them teenagers (somewhat difficult to keep track of because they are not yet fully formed or unique), along with their parents and their parents' lovers, their brothers and sisters and the brothers' and sisters' lovers, and their teachers and some of their lovers.<br /><br />Starting with a meeting in 2003 between the adult children of some of the characters from the 1970's, the novel switches back and forth in time through several different points of view, offering insights about what has happened in the interim. The teenagers' lives are depicted in minute detail as they work on school magazines, collect new rock albums, create their own bands, score with girlfriends, and do all the superficial things teenagers do the world over, told from the well-developed, if not particularly compelling, perspective of the `70's.<br /><br />Coe can be very funny, and his view of teenage life is often amusing, but the teenagers also reveal their intolerance of differences, their casual cruelty, doubts about religion, ignorance of the political system, and general insulation from the forces which are shaping their world. Their parents' lives are completely separate from their children's, dealing with union vs. management issues, Labour vs. Tory political goals, a stagnant economy, resentment over immigration, IRA activity, some anti-semitism, and a belief that their dreams probably will not come true. These huge and important themes seem a bit jarring when juxtaposed against the superficial, day-to-day activities of the teenagers who are the main characters.<br /><br />Coe has enormous, very obvious talents, but this book feels fragmented, with too many characters pursuing too many different ends, the ultimate goal seeming to be the recreation of the entire sociopolitical history of 1970's Birmingham. At the end of 400+ pages of this book, Coe himself states that a second volume will continue this story, perhaps the author's acknowledgment that his reach has exceeded his grasp with this one.

In the taut, staccato style reminiscent of Raymond Chandler or John D. MacDonald, Lee Child presents his eighth Jack Reacher novel, a police procedural with a difference: Reacher is an MP, an army Major at Fort Bird, North Carolina, obedient to a different set of rules and objectives. Recently transferred from Panama to be MP Executive Officer, Reacher must immediately investigate the death of a two-star general who has died in a seedy, nearby motel, presumably with a prostitute. His briefcase, containing the agenda for a top-secret conference in California, has disappeared, and when Reacher and his aide, Lt. Summer, go to break the news to the general's wife, they find her dead, too, bludgeoned to death with a crowbar within hours of the general's death.<br /><br />With almost military precision, dramatic complications unfold, and Reacher soon finds himself facing two new deaths, one of which is a gruesome butchering which takes place on the base. Ordered by superiors to cover up the murder by calling it a \\"training accident,\\" Reacher and his aide investigate surreptitiously, soon discovering that his MP XO counterparts at twenty more bases throughout the world have also been newly appointed to their positions, all of them on or around December 29. Obvious questions arise about who is pulling the strings, who has the power to transfer so many MPs to new posts, and why someone would want to do so.<br /><br />Child is a meticulous writer whose plot follows a strict chronological order and moves at a breath-taking pace, with one dramatic scene following hard on the heels of another. Reacher and his aide Summer are not fully developed characters, but they do not need to be as they struggle to learn who is controlling the grisly chess game which has resulted in four deaths. The action is resolved in an extravagant grand finale, with twists and turns and spectacular surprises. Though the ending resolves the disparate threads, it may also be a disappointment to some readers, since the premise behind the plot and the motivation which led to the murders, when finally revealed, seems too unrealistic to justify the murderous extremes to which \\"the enemy\\" has gone. Though Child is brilliant in creating an exciting story packed with action, the final pages feel cynical and reveal a view of humanity that is grim.

Written in 1892, when Ibsen was a mature playwright, this tension-filled play focuses on an older man's fear that he will be replaced by the younger generation before he has been able to reconcile his professional success with his personal sacrifices. Halvard Solness is a Master Builder who once built churches and towers but who now builds only houses. Arrogant, manipulative, and often paranoid, there is little he will not do to control outcomes.<br /><br />When Hilde Wangel suddenly knocks on his door, the younger generation arrives. Exuberant and flirtatious, Hilde reminds Halvard that exactly ten years ago, when she was the twelve-year-old daughter of a client, he called her his little princess and promised to buy her a kingdom. Ingratiating herself with Halvard, Hilde listens as he reveals his accumulated guilt, his fear of godly retribution, and his simultaneous belief that he is one of the \\"special people\\" who can bring his desires to fruition through the summoning of demons, \\"called 'luck' by others.\\" Hilde, believing she can free him creatively, urges the acrophobic Halvard to place a wreath at the top of the tower on the house he has built for his wife-a symbolic celebration of a new kind of life through Hilde, building castles in the air.<br /><br />The characters, though full of passion, are not always realistic. Their psychological grounding seems uncertain, and their behavior does not seem to flow out of a sense of personal unity. Halvard believes that certain people can make direct connections with him and read his mind. He also believes that that his success has occurred because years ago he made a bargain with demons which resulted in the loss of everything he and his wife held dear-he is successful, but guilty. Though he has rejected religion, he is tormented by the need for retribution. Hilde, for her part, became obsessed with Halvard at the age of twelve, and she believes that now, after ten years, they can build castles together.<br /><br />Ibsen's dark vision here seems to combine classical tragedy with a belief in the Nordic spirit world and in the newly evolving psychoscience of Freud. Often considered Ibsen's masterpiece, the play is powerful to watch, but eerie and unsettling--its pessimistic message equivocal--and one concludes the play not knowing how much free will Ibsen believes men really have and what kind of spirit world he thinks may control it.

Robert Merivel, who has studied to be a physician, is appointed, ironically, to be veterinarian for the spaniels of King Charles II, who has recently been restored to the throne following the death of Oliver Cromwell. Merivel enjoys the gaiety and frivolity of court life, and, a bit of a fool, he entertains the king. The king's decision to placate one of his lovers by marrying off his favorite mistress to Robert Merivel, spells the beginning of the end for Merivel's tenuous fortunes. Warned not to fall in love with his wife, Celia Clemence, since the king intends to continue seeing her, Merivel cannot help himself, and he is cast out, losing not only the king's affection, but also his house and, of course his wife.<br /><br />Joining a group of men who work at an asylum for the insane, Merivel learns that there are deeper concerns in life than the hedonism of his life at court, and he develops genuine affection for several of the kindly Quaker men with whom he works. When he transgresses the society's rules, however, he is cast out from there, too, ending up in London at the time of the Great Plague and eventually the Great London Fire.<br /><br />Painting vivid pictures of Merivel's life--at court, at the asylum in Whittlesea, and in the neighborhoods of London--author Rose Tremain brings the age, its customs, its science, and its social structure to life. The years of 1664 - 1666 are especially difficult, and as Merivel lives through the horrors of the Plague and the panic of the Great Fire, which Tremain recreates with the drama they deserve, the reader can see Merivel becoming less a fool and more a human. Like the restoration of the king to the throne, Merivel's \\"restoration\\" to dignity takes place after a period of dark reflection and self-examination, and both Merivel and the country learn from their travails.<br /><br />Tremain develops Merivel's personal transformation with sensitivity, finesse, and much ironic humor, and when, at last, he is noticed again by the court, his understanding of himself and his role in the world is far more profound than it was before. Depicting the personal and the philosophical turmoils of these early Restoration years with a historian's eye for detail and a detached observer's sense of wit, Tremain illustrates the contradictions of this period realistically and often with dark humor. A fine historical novel, Restoration transcends its period, offering observations, themes, and lessons for the present day.

Nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for The Between, and recipient of the 2002 American Book Award for another horror novel, The Living Blood, Tananarive Due is an accomplished juggler of the real and supernatural, able to weave a spell which makes readers willingly suspend their disbelief.  Here Due adds historical elements to the supernatural, telling the tale of a young R&B singer, who finds herself irrevocably tied to rag-time composer/pianist Joplin and his ghost.<br /><br />Seriously injured by Joplin's ancient piano, which mysteriously fell on her when she was ten, Phoenix Small, at twenty, is on the verge of a major music career when she suddenly starts seeing and hearing Joplin's ghost--a man in her apartment, a voice calling to her, and Joplin's music appearing in her own computer music program.  She gives piano concerts of Joplin's lost music while asleep and believes that \\"Joplin was the only person who could teach her what she needed to know.\\"<br /><br />Due gracefully alternates Joplin's sad, turn-of-the-century biography with Phoenix's present music world, a time of gangsta rap and rock, showing the efforts of black musicians in both periods to give voice to the black experience.  Due is particularly sensitive in evoking the life of Joplin, beginning the novel with a wrenching account of his final days as a crippled and mentally disturbed syphilitic at Bellevue.  Her ability to pack her descriptions with lively sense impressions brings the music world alive in both periods, and the characters, even the minor ones, live and breathe, adding to the the supernatural suspense.  Love stories for both Joplin and Phoenix, unabashedly sexual, reveal their passion for life and the ability of love to color their music.<br /><br />As Phoenix mysteriously channels more and more of Joplin's lost music, including his first opera, believed to have been burned, she finds it dominating her own music and her career, and as Joplin's love story takes tragic turns, Phoenix, too, finds her own love story and her family life becoming dramatically affected.  Joplin's piano, the one item which connects the real world of Joplin with that of Phoenix, takes on a life of its own, and as the tension builds to a dramatic confrontation between Phoenix and her ghost, the piano plays a key role.<br /><br />Filled with fascinating historical detail about the life and times of Scott Joplin, from the turn of the century until Joplin's death in 1917, this exciting, sure-to-be-popular novel finely captures the status of black music at two different periods.

This is a real treat to read, with a wonderfully appropriate grand finale which depends on surprise! A unique and suspenseful twist on the traditional murder mystery, this novel is based on the real-life character of Lord Lucan, who in 1974 killed his children's nanny by mistake instead of killing his wife. Though he vanished and has never been found, many have suspected that he has been housed and hidden over the years by a series of aristocratic friends.<br /><br />In this satiric approach to the true-crime genre, Spark gives us wacky, off-the-wall characters--including two men who claim to be the \\"real\\" Lord Lucan. Adding to the dramatic mix are variety of aristocratic \\"aiders and abettors\\" who have protected and financially supported Lucan for twenty-five years, a psychiatrist who was once a phony stigmatic but who is now treating both \\"Lord Lucans,\\" and several former acquaintances who now want Lucan caught, not because they believe that murder is wrong, but because times have changed--\\"Lucky Lucan failed to show up [for questioning], which was really lowering our standards....he was a very great bore.\\"<br /><br />Satiric and mordantly critical of aristocratic pretension, this is vintage Spark. Her plotting is tight, with no loose ends and no digressions, and her selection of details is exquisitely careful and controlled. Her themes and motifs, especially those of blood as it relates to both crime and breeding, are so intricately connected to all the characters and the plot, that it is difficult to discuss them without giving away the clever plot twists. And Spark does all this in less than two hundred pages. It is impossible not to read this at a gallop to find out what happens--while smiling the whole time at Spark's wry wit.

A series of vignettes, rather than a structured novel, House on Mango Street is Sandra Cisneros's semi-autobiographical account of growing up Chicana in a poor area of Chicago. Esperanza Cordero, at age eleven, has already discovered that being able to communicate in English is a key to worldly success, and she has begun recording stories of her neighborhood, friends, and everyday life, hoping one day to become a writer. Recreating one year of her life, she vividly depicts the children's fierce loyalties to each other, their alienation from mainstream society, and their goals in life, sadly limited by the culture and its low expectations for girls and women.<br /><br />Maintaining a childish innocence, Esperanza's first person account reveals her growing awareness of alternatives to her Mango Street existence. She is saddened that her friend Sally, an abused child, never escapes, marrying very early (\\"in a state where children can marry before they have finished eighth grade\\"). Alicia, an older, highly motivated friend, however, works to achieve an education and spends long hours traveling to and from school so that she can move beyond Mango Street. Her prescient Aunt Lupe tells Esperanza to \\"Keep writing. It will keep you free,\\" and a psychic tells her that she must work hard and write so that she can \\"come back for those who cannot make it out on their own.\\"<br /><br />Dealing with everyday issues of maturity, a growing awareness of her own sexuality, and her resentment of a world which does not value women, Esperanza is an astute observer, telling stories filled with the humor, wonder, and sometimes heartbreak. As she tells about innocently riding in a stolen car; about the death of her friend Marin's boyfriend whose Mexican parents will never hear of his death because no one knows where to find them; about being assaulted while waiting for her friend Sally, who never answers her pleas for help; about Mamacita, who never leaves her apartment because she is cannot communicate in English; and about her own mother's inability to travel on public transportation because she is afraid, she recreates Mango Street with all its limitations--and excitements.<br /><br />Like a red balloon which wants to escape its anchor, Esperanza dreams of having a better home, a better life, and greater opportunities. \\"I have decided not to grow up tame,\\" she says, but she is firmly anchored to Mango Street through her experiences, and these, she discovers ironically, will eventually become the source material for her writing.

One of Ellis's most unusual novels, Fairy Tale is simultaneously bizarre and darkly humorous, intensely realistic and also fantastic, and magical but absurd, a combination certain to intrigue lovers of fine writing and keep them reading with fascination.  Seventeen-year-old Eloise and her lover Simon have moved to a small country cottage in Wales where they are in touch with the flowers, birds, and the natural world, all beautifully described by Ellis.  With tongue-in-cheek humor, Ellis describes the influence on Eloise of an older woman known as \\"Moonbird,\\" with her ideas of a \\"woman's mission,\\" which has resulted in Eloise's self-conscious awareness of the lovely, madonna-like scene she creates as she hand sews nightdresses and petticoats to sell in a shop in the nearby market town.  Simon works as a carpenter.<br /><br />From the opening paragraph with its references to \\"watchers,\\" Ellis establishes a sense of mystery, and as the action evolves, and Eloise is visited by her ditzy mother Clare and her mother's more realistic friend Miriam, who come to investigate strange goings-on at the cottage, the reader gradually realizes that Eloise is being courted by magical spirits in the form of four men who pay a series of visits to her.<br /><br />Ellis's trademark humor is revealed especially through scenes in which the silly Clare and the realistic Miriam try to understand and rationalize what is going on, and the reader gradually  suspects that the house is haunted and that the men-in-suits have a special destiny in mind for Eloise.  In Part II, when Eloise suddenly appears with a baby, who lives in a rush-lined, ancient cradle and never cries, the magic and its power become even more haunting.<br /><br />Black magic and white magic combine with religious themes as Eloise, Clare, and the other residents of this strange cottage come to grips with the unknown and how to deal with it--if at all.  What makes Ellis's novel so unusual, is that in this novel the reader is also confronted with the reverse question--how do the supernatural beings themselves deal with reality?  Ellis's suggestion of the dependency of the fairy spirits on humans is unique, to say the least.

When the huge Union Army of General William Tecumseh Sherman burned its way from Atlanta to the Carolinas in 1864 - 1865, it was accompanied by a motley group of freed slaves, entrepreneurs, the dispossessed wives and children of landowners, and even a few turncoats, all of whom saw this army as their protection from the hostile unknown.  E. L. Doctorow, in his absorbing novel about this march, focuses on the marchers themselves--their varied interests, conflicts, fears, and goals--creating a powerful and panoramic vision of how civilians, as well as soldiers, responded to the devastation of this terrible war.<br /><br />Through a series of dramatic vignettes, Doctorow reveals the characters' family lives and stimulates reader interest.  Mattie Jameson, the wife of a cruel slaveowner, has closed her eyes to the horrors of slavery, but when her estate is burned, her husband killed, and her 14- and 15-year-old sons conscripted to fight for the Confederacy, she has nowhere else to go.  Pearl, whom Mattie describes as \\"that horrible child,\\" is the mulatto child of her husband John Jameson and one of his slaves, and Pearl, too, becomes a marcher, disguised at a drummer boy.<br /><br />Emily Thompson, the elegant daughter of a Georgia Supreme Court Justice, helps Dr. Wrede Sartorius, a Union regimental surgeon, renowned \\"for removing a leg in twelve seconds [without anesthesia].  An arm took only nine.\\" Two turncoats, the devious Arly and the naïve Will, serve as the primary comic relief, opportunistically trading uniforms to suit their circumstances.<br /><br />Real people mix with fictional characters, giving life to the narrative and a sense of immediacy to the action.  General Sherman--\\"Uncle Billy,\\" to the troops--is the unifying element of the novel, and he comes to life, his own family suffering as much personal hardship as the families he meets on the march.  Cameos of Ulysses S. Grant and Abraham Lincoln enhance the conclusion of the novel, and even Coalhouse Walker makes an appearance.  The cast of characters is fluid, with some characters disappearing during the narrative, as they would in reality.  Doctorow's eye for detail and ability to convey sense impressions--a severed leg so heavy it has to be carried by two people, or a soldier catching an enemy on his bayonet and being unable to shake it free--create both an atmosphere and the harsh realities of war.<br /><br />Focusing on the march itself, Doctorow explores  broad themes--the human costs of this war and its aftermath throughout the South:  the thousands of displaced people, the loss of traditional ways of life, the economic disasters, the cultural shocks, the lack of opportunities for freed slaves, and their need to be taught how to be free.

Essentially a \\"character\\" study of  politics in Albany, New York, this fascinating novel  focuses on postwar politics in 1945, flashes back to 1921, when the Democrats seized control of Albany from the Republicans, and harks back still earlier to the circumstances that led them to lose control to the Republicans at the turn of the century.  Many of the same families are still running the party machine, serving as city officials and hobnobbing with national leaders, and readers familiar with Kennedy's previous novels will recognize the names.<br /><br />Roscoe Owen Conway, Secretary of the Albany Democratic Party, his friend and party financier Elisha Fitzgibbon, and consummate pol Patsy McCall have all grown up together, and together they manage the Albany political scene, planning the upcoming 1945 mayoral election while trying to help the party recapture the Governor's office.  Roscoe, the son of three-time mayor Felix Conway, is the brother of Oswald Brian Conway (O. B.), the chief of police, while Bindy McCall, brother of Patsy McCall, runs the brothels, gambling, and liquor supplies.  Elisha Fitzgibbon is the father of Alex Fitzgibbon, the youthful mayor of Albany who left office to serve his country in World War II.  Among them the three politicos and their families control just about every aspect of life in their city.<br /><br />When Elisha dies suddenly and a private autopsy suggests his suicide, the political machine suppresses the results, and Roscoe and Patsy investigate their friend Elisha's private life.  As the investigation progresses, all the relationships and interrelationships of these men unfold, along with the effects their private lives exert on their public behavior.  Broadening the political scope to include the peripheral roles of Albany natives Jimmy Walker, Legs Diamond, and former resident and Presidential candidate Al Smith, Kennedy shows Albany's political machine practicing the abuses, trickery, image-making, and sometimes illegal \\"damage control\\" through which it maintains power.  The city gradually comes to life on all levels and becomes a paradigm for unscrupulous, big city politics.<br /><br />The author's ability to recreate the postwar setting, his vibrantly colorful scenes (including a play-by-play of a cockfight), his darkly hilarious descriptions of political \\"fund-raising,\\" and his unforgettable dialogue and repartee bring life to this fascinating story.  Short, one-page fables, tall stories, or dreams, inserted between sections, reveal Roscoe's character, while Kennedy's use of flashbacks fills in historical background and broadens the scope.

(3.5 stars) Gill's novels are always fun because they incorporate aspects of Irish life not usually included in mystery stories--eel-fishing, secret Catholic societies, literary history, the serious business of salmon-fishing and fly-tying, and in this case, the breeding of race horses.  One of the least known of the seventeen mysteries in the Peter McGarr series, this 1986 mystery begins with the death of Fionnuala Walton, whose PhD in genetics and doctorate in veterinary medicine have made her the formidable director of Greenore Eugenics, a horse farm trying to develop a \\"super sire,\\" a horse so powerful that he will sire champion after champion, regardless of whether the mare is of champion quality.<br /><br />The several suspects in her murder reflect interconnections and relationships almost as complex as the horse breeding charts in the farm's offices:  Siobhan and Machala, Fionnuala's sisters and partners in the breeding farm;  Deirdre Walton, Fionnuala's niece and possible heir;  Tom Daugherty, son of Fionnuala's former fianc&eacute;, and manager of Greenore Eugenics;  his brother, Dan Daugherty, Jr., the fianc&eacute; of Deirdre Walton;  and Mna Daugherty, the woman whom Dan Daugherty, Sr. married instead of Fionnuala.  The Daughertys have acquired 480 acres of farm land from Fionnuala, land which originally belonged to the Daugherty family.<br /><br />Det. Supt. Peter McGarr of the Garda Siochana is called from his vacation to investigate Fionnuala's death.  Since McGarr's wife Noreen is the daughter of another a well-known horse breeder, he asks her to stay, incognito, at the B&B run by Mna Daugherty to find out about the Daugherty family and its work while he investigates the Waltons.  As is always the case with McGarr, justice is what is important, even if that means bending the rules, and McGarr is not above using his fists to inspire truth-telling.<br /><br />This mystery, more complex than some of Gill's other efforts, differs in many other respects, too.  Noreen, McGarr's always devoted wife, begins to question her marriage.  McGarr himself lacks the wry wit and playfulness here which are trademarks in his other novels, and the humor, which usually evolves from the interactions of McGarr and his quirky staff, never develops since McGarr is working almost alone here.  Because much of the important action has taken place in the past, it is told about, rather than illustrated, slowing down the plot.  The ending does resolve the complex mystery, but Gill has written himself into a corner--some important issues are raised but left unresolved, leaving the reader to wonder about the future. n Mary Whippletoo.

Resembling both McEwan's Atonement and Frayn's Spies in its plot, this 1953 novel, recently reprinted, tells of a pre-adolescent's naive meddling in the love lives of elders, with disastrous results. Set in the summer of 1900, when the hopes and dreams for the century were as yet untarnished by two world wars and subsequent horrors, this novel is quietly elegant in style, its emotional upheavals restrained, and its 12-year-old main character, Leo Colston, so earnest, hopeful, and curious about life that the reader cannot help but be moved by his innocence.<br /><br />Leo's summer visit to a friend at Brandham Hall introduces him to the landed gentry, the privileges they have assumed, and the strict social behaviors which guide their everyday lives. Bored and wanting to be helpful when his friend falls ill, Leo agrees to be a messenger carrying letters between Marian, his host's sister, and Ted Burgess, her secret love, a farmer living nearby. Catastrophe is inevitable--and devastating to Leo. In descriptive and nuanced prose, Hartley evokes the heat of summer and the emotional conflicts it heightens, the intensity rising along with the temperature. Magic spells, creatures of the zodiac, and mythology create an overlay of (chaste) paganism for Leo's perceptions, while widening the scope of Hartley's focus and providing innumerable parallels and symbols for the reader.<br /><br />The emotional impact of the climax is tremendous, heightened by the author's use of three perspectives--Leo Colston as a man in his 60's, permanently damaged by events when he was 12; Leo as a 12-year-old, wrestling with new issues of class, social obligation, friendship, morality, and love, while inadvertently causing a disaster; and the reader himself, for whom hindsight and knowledge of history create powerful ironies as he views these events and the way of life they represent. Some readers have commented on Leo's unrealistic innocence in matters of sex, even as a 12-year-old, but this may be a function of age. For those of us who can remember life without TV and the computer, it is not so far-fetched to imagine a life in which \\"mass communication\\" meant the telegraph and in which \\"spooning\\" was an adults-only secret.

In an unnamed country (similar to Norway) during World War II, a German sympathizer lures local men and the town's twelve soldiers into the forest long enough for the Germans to take the town. They occupy the home of the mayor as a sign of their power and commandeer the local coal mine. Mayor Orden has never before been a brave or very forceful man, but he is not a fool, and while he tries to keep order in the town, as the Germans demand, he refuses to use the power of his office to betray the ideals of his people. Soon the locals begin to sabotage everything the Germans can use to prolong the war.<br /><br />The narrative is dramatic, full of conversation and containing minimal description, which gives it the feeling of a simple morality tale. Steinbeck depicts the German soldiers, at first, as almost bumbling--organized, to be sure, but basically human, showing footsoldiers getting homesick, seeking understanding of the orders they must fulfill, complaining about the weather, and wondering if their mail will arrive on time. Gradually, as Berlin exerts more and more pressure to take out the coal, the German occupiers must impose more drastic measures. Local resistance becomes more violent in response: soldiers disappear and are found dead in snowbanks, small explosions blow up rail lines, and the miners have \\"accidents\\" which prevent the coal from being removed. Even the arrest of Mayor Orden and Doctor Winter cannot force the citizens to give in to tyranny.<br /><br />Though the novel was published in 1942 expressly for \\"propaganda\\" in Europe's occupied countries (where it was quickly translated and disseminated secretly), it is a good story which transcends its original purpose and, as a result, it continues to find an audience. The depiction of the Germans as ordinary but flawed humans--\\"herd men who win the battles\\"--rather than as terrifying monsters, makes their defeat seem possible. Depicting the townspeople as resourceful but ordinary--\\"free men who win the wars\\"--rather than as heroes, makes their resistance seem a natural, and victory seem possible.<br /><br />Though the characters are shallow, Mayor Orden does grow and change, and his references to Plato's defense of Aristotle in a crucial conversation with Doctor Winter put the relationship of the individual to authority into a wider context. Simple, direct, concise, and humane, this may be the most effective piece of mass propaganda ever written.

Child's Play, an early tour de force, showcases Australian author David Malouf's remarkable versatility and his focus on ideas and themes. Taking us into the mind of a terrorist/assassin as he waits to commit a murder, Malouf shows him to be a \\"normal\\" person with the same thoughts and reactions to the world around him as everyone else. Malouf keeps us at a distance from the killer, however, restricting the killer's consciousness to his sense impressions about the world around him, his remembrances and warm feelings toward his childhood and family, his everyday life, and his philosophical musings about his predestined relationship with his chosen victim.<br /><br />Though this novella was probably considered shocking when it was written in 1982, its impact has been lessened to the point of insignificance by recent events. The reader is given no clue about what has made this man a terrorist or what his ultimate purpose might be, and Malouf provides no sense of significance or context for what otherwise appears to be a motiveless killing by an intelligent and sensitive man. The assassin is, in many ways, like a child playing a very deadly game.<br /><br />Malouf uses a similar technique in The Bread of Time to Come, also known as Fly Away Peter, though this novella is more emotionally involving than Child's Play. Here the main character, Jim Saddler, the opposite of the assassin in many ways, also seems detached from his life and also naïve. A young man whose chief pleasure is acting as a guide at a bird sanctuary in coastal Queensland, he has been protected from many of life's cruel realities by Australia's physical isolation from the wider world. This changes when he finds himself, along with his employer/friend Ashley Crowther, fighting in France during World War I.<br /><br />From the opening scene, which sets up dramatic contrasts between a bird and a biplane, Malouf emphasizes the contrasts between the \\"civilized\\" and \\"natural\\" worlds and between the Garden of Eden of the bird sanctuary, and the violence and killing of war. Jim's discoveries about life and about himself are straightforward and are enhanced by the author's use of repetitions, a great deal of symbolism, and numerous contrasts: Even during war, Jim sees migrating birds.<br /><br />In both books, Malouf presents dense imagery of sights, sounds, and smells; lovely vignettes about country life; and characters who seem both intelligent and sensitive. The \\"civilized\\" world of Europe is, in both cases, seen to be fraught with violence and random cruelty. The Bread of Time to Come, however, reveals a character who comes to realizations about his place in the universe. The terrorist in Child's Play has no world view.

Set in the present day in mainland China, this first novel is charming, warmly humorous, and often touching in its focus on several families in the small town of Shaoyang as they weather the cultural turmoil which is taking place. The goals of the young have changed, and many people in the cities are experimenting with capitalism. The firebrands of the past are now elderly people living simple, often deprived, lives, and the destruction which occurred during the Cultural Revolution is now recognized and acknowledged as unfortunate. People are coping with the closure of factories, general unemployment, unsatisfying work on farms, and the pollution of rivers and waterways.<br /><br />Hill endows what might have been a bleak setting with much humor. When Da Shan returns to the town after being away for seven years, for example, his reunion with his mother reflects the relationships of mothers and sons across all cultures and time, sounding as much like a Borscht Belt Jewish Mother skit as a domestic interchange in rural China. The petty quarrels, jealousies, resentments, longings, and hopes for the future, which are only hinted at in Chinese-written books such as Wild Swans, Waiting, and Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, are explicit here, further adding to the sense of common humanity which makes Hill's characters so understandable. While this may make the novel \\"less Chinese,\\" it allows for greater reader identification.<br /><br />Much of Hill's effectiveness stems from his selection of powerful visual details, rather than his use of pretty words. The polluted river, for example, shines with \\"pale gray smudges where plastic bags have drowned,\\" while an ancient temple is inhabited by nuns who can no longer read some of the Chinese characters in their books. I did find several fairly explicit sex scenes to be jarring, out of character with the warmth, light humor, and restraint throughout much of the book, and inconsistent with its formal, almost operatic structure. In addition, a harshness creeps into the end of the book and may be a warning to the reader that nothing may be taken for granted in this country, despite our desire to think the people are \\"just like us.\\" Hill's ambitious novel contains many delights and augurs a promising future.

Gleefully combining the raucous humor of absurdity with slyly subtle wordplay and caustic satire, Greene entertains on every level, poking fun at British intelligence-gathering services during the Cold War. Setting the novel in the flamboyant atmosphere of pre-revolutionary Havana, where virtually anything can be had at a price, Greene establishes his contrasts and ironies early, creating a hilarious set piece which satirizes both the British government's never-satisfied desire for secrets about foreign political movements and their belief that the most banal of activities constitute threats to national security.<br /><br />Ex-patriot James Wormold is a mild-mannered, marginal businessman and vacuum cleaner salesman, whose spoiled teenage daughter sees herself as part of the equestrian and country club set. Approached by MI6 in a public restroom, Wormold finds himself unwillingly recruited to be \\"our man in Havana,\\" a role which will reward him handsomely for information and allow him some much-needed financial breathing room.<br /><br />Encouraged to recruit other agents to provide more information (and earn even more money), he chooses names at random from the country club membership list and fabricates personas for them, featuring them in fictionalized little dramas which he churns out and forwards to his \\"handlers.\\" Always careful to fulfill their expectations exactly, Wormold becomes a more and more important \\"spy,\\" his stories become more creative, his \\"enemies\\" find him and his \\"agents\\" to be dangerous, and his friends and the real people whose names were used as fictional agents begin to turn up dead.<br /><br />Skewering British intelligence for being such willing dupes of a vacuum cleaner salesman who never wanted to be an agent in the first place, Greene betrays both his familiarity with the inner workings of the intelligence service, of which he was once a member, and his rejection of Cold War politics. In a conclusion which will satisfy everyone who has ever become impatient with political maneuvering, Greene carries the absurdities of power to their limits, orchestrating a grand finale which shows British politicians at their most venal--and most ridiculous.

Ostensibly the illustrated story of Hippolyte Webb's search for an island which has disappeared from the maps, it is also a tribute to the spirit of adventure, the power of imagination, and the stick-to-it-iveness which sometimes makes dreams come true. Webb, the former owner of a travel magazine and voyager to remote and unlikely places, is also a collector of antique maps and atlases. Seeing the Aurora Islands halfway between the Falklands and South Georgia Island on old maps from the 18th century, but missing from later maps, he decides to try to find them, using equipment from the period.<br /><br />Hodgson's writing is lighthearted and often very funny, making what must have been a tremendous amount of research seem perfectly natural to an iconoclast like Hippolyte, with his eclectic interests and resistance to convention. Her collages of drawings, maps, charts, and letters from Hippolyte, written on an old typewriter, are so much fun that I pored over them, looking at every detail, and I had to work hard to restrain myself from rushing ahead to see what new delights were waiting just a few pages ahead. And Hippolyte himself is an irresistible character--truly romantic and a little flaky, to be sure, but conscientious and concerned enough with the details of his journey that even the most pedantic among us will empathize.<br /><br />Sailors, naturalists, archaeologists, geographers, engineers, historians accustomed to research using primary sources, and others grounded in the reality of the here and now should find the book a delightful escape. Those whose spirit of adventure sometimes propels them out of this world and into that of dreams, imagination, and new possibilities will find it positively magical. And those who dabble in writing and drawing and wish we had more talent will be positively green-eyed at Hodgson's ability to do both so well.  Mary Whipple	2005-09-23

This final novel in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy of the southwest brings together the themes McCarthy has developed throughout the trilogy. In the first novel, All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy stresses the romanticism of John Grady Cole, who runs away to become a cowboy, suffers a heart-breaking loss at love, and returns, sadder and perhaps wiser, to find solace in the solitude of his work on the plains.<br /><br />Times are changing as the 20th century progresses, however, and the independent life of ranchers is threatened. In The Crossing, a far darker novel which takes place a few years later, Billy Parham, another young man, takes off with his brother, crossing the border into Mexico, to explore its older traditions and ways of life. Cities of the Plain, with Biblical suggestions in the title, brings young John Grady Cole and the older Billy Parham together, as they work on the McGovern ranch in Texas in the 1950s. The wilderness is disappearing, cities are encroaching, and an army base may take their land.<br /><br />Focusing less on the harshness of ranch life than in past novels, McCarthy here concentrates more on character, in this case, that of John Grady Cole, who falls in love with a prostitute from Juarez and wants to bring her across the border to his way of life. Billy Parham counsels him against marrying her, but John Grady is determined to wrest her away from Eduardo, her manager, and give her the peace that she has never known. Life is harsh, however, and outcomes are bleak for dreamers and altruists. John Grady soon finds himself engaged in a struggle with Eduardo which is vicious and unrelenting, a metaphorical struggle between honor and evil, and between civilized values and the \\"justice\\" of tooth and claw, hope and desperation, and acceptance of change and adherence to the past.<br /><br />McCarthy's gorgeous descriptions of this vanishing way of life on the ranch are as effective here as they are in the other novels in the trilogy, though they seem to be presented nostalgically. Times are changing, and the \\"old man,\\" the ranch owner, is now becoming senile. Civilization is drawing closer, and John Grady, the cowboy, uses taxis instead of horses when he is in a hurry to travel. As McCarthy draws the reader into John Grady's story, the reader knows that the struggle between him and Eduardo is a mythic struggle, and s/he also knows what the likely outcome will be. The elegance with which the ending is drawn, however, gives both potency and poignancy to McCarthy's message. Mary Whipplethough they seem to be presented nostalgically.

The symbolism of the floors takes on additional meaning through Vishnu's visions.<br /><br />In many ways this resembles a grand chorus from a huge and wonderful comic opera, with all the inhabitants of the building singing at once. And underneath all the voices wailing about their personal concerns is the insistent bass of Vishnu as he prepares to die. Dealing with the most basic aspects of religion, love, and human kindness in a city setting which challenges its inhabitants to the limit, Suri creates a warm, funny, and very human drama of a every man's search for meaning in life.

Winner of the Obie Award in 1975, Lanford Wilson's play details the excavation of Jasker Field by archaeologists as they try to solve some of the mysteries of Native American temple mounds from 700 - 1000 A. D. This is frantic work, as a nearby lake is rising, and a planned interstate, under construction, is scheduled to bury the site. Wilson creates a cauldron of emotions by housing all the principals in a farmhouse belonging to Mr. Jasker, whose son Chad enthusiastically awaits the arrival of the interstate and the expansion of the lake, which will give him valuable \\"waterfront property.\\"<br /><br />As traces of civilization are uncovered at the dig, followed soon after by the discovery of artifacts and bones, the tensions inside the house grow. Each of the main characters has problems--a previous emotional breakdown, a pregnancy, the unwanted attentions of Chad Jasker, a divorce and loss of personal direction, alcoholism, irresponsibility, and professional stress--and the viewer cannot help but make comparisons between the seemingly structured lives of the mound builders and the chaos in the lives of their present investigators. The \\"resolution\\" to the drama proves to be far more \\"uncivilized\\" than anything the early civilization might have contemplated.<br /><br />The intensely confessional atmosphere inside the farmhouse, as the characters reveal their problems and conflicts, requires that actors play their parts with subtlety to avoid stereotyping and melodrama. The weakest character in the play is, unfortunately, the important character of Jean Loggins, gynecologist-wife of one of the lead archaeologists, who tries to help D. K. Erikson, an alcoholic and insecure writer who is the sister of the project director, resting at the farmhouse to \\"dry out.\\" Loggins, unfortunately, is so fraught with her own problems that it is impossible to imagine her as a hard-driving medical school graduate with a specialty career, and this limits the realism and increases the melodrama. D. K., however, is a tough woman who views life with a cynical realism, and her gradual transition from angry recluse to a more \\"civilized\\" persona is a key aspect to the drama.<br /><br />Dealing with the age-old conflict between preservation and progress, which is still at issue thirty years later, Wilson shows that the strong traditions and culture of the mound builders--their civilization--have much of value to offer modern man living in a more multicultural and chaotic world.

When John Proctor says these words to his wife Elizabeth at the conclusion of this play, he has faced accusations of being in league with the Devil and is ready to face consequences meted out by the religious tribunal he has faced. Though he has sinned by committing adultery with Abigail Williams, he believes the witchcraft trials which have ultimately consumed him to be the result of human, rather than godly, forces. Playwright Arthur Miller sets the scene for this action in an Overture explaining the theocracy which controlled Salem. Powerful clergymen, some more rigid in their interpretations of Scripture than others, \\"protected\\" citizens by enforcing conformity with the church's teachings.<br /><br />Through detailed character sketches inserted into the structure of the play, Miller broadens the realism, and when a group of hysterical young women makes accusations of witchcraft, resulting ultimately in the deaths of nineteen of their fellow-citizens, Miller has prepared his audience to accept the trials and the behavior of the characters as plausible. His straightforward prose, use of homely details, and simple sentence structure (despite its archaic tone) further add to the realism. When the affair between John Proctor and Abigail Williams, who precipitates and then promotes the hysteria among the young \\"afflicted\\" girls, is revealed within the play, the modern reader is given a \\"hook\\" with which to identify with characters and situations which might otherwise feel foreign.<br /><br />Miller's play is a powerful revelation of themes involving mass hysteria, fear of the unknown, and a belief in the essential evil hidden within the hearts of men. As the accused are required to prove their innocence, questions regarding the role of individualism within this society, its intolerance of differences, its justice as defined by the state and by clergymen who differ, and the hysteria which grows from repression all surface within the dramatic action, leading to an intensity of feeling rare in modern theater. When John Proctor is faced with a choice of telling the truth and being sentenced to death or lying and being saved, the ironies of the play are fully revealed.<br /><br />Written in 1952, slightly before the McCarthy era, Miller's depiction of these trials presages the McCarthy hearings and illustrates his belief that the fear of Communism is the equivalent of fear of the Devil in colonial times. Miller, however, has selected facts which illustrate his point of view and his themes, making no pretense of accuracy regarding the witchcraft trials themselves. In reality, Abigail Williams was eleven, and John Proctor was sixty, quite different from the dramatic circumstances here. Mary Whipplesity of feeling rare in modern theater.

This terrifying, bone-chilling novel does not depend on mere events, no matter how horrific, for its stunning effects. Dorrestein is much too clever a writer for that. Instead, she recreates with great psychological astuteness the inner workings of main character Ellen Van Bemmel's mind, revealing her memories from the age of twelve to adulthood in a seemingly random sequence, as Ellen allows herself first to remember, and later accept, the unimaginable trauma she has experienced as a child.<br /><br />This trauma is made even more dramatic for the reader because it contrasts so starkly with lovely vignettes of the large, happy family we admire and feel part of in the beginning of the book. Ellen's siblings--sister Billie, brother Kester, and Michael, nicknamed Carlos-- are in every way delightful, normal children, experiencing the same joys and humorous adventures that most readers will have experienced, with parents who are so in love they can hardly keep their hands off each other. It is easy to admire, and even envy, such a family.<br /><br />And then the idyll abruptly ends, and we don't know exactly how or why. Slowly, inexorably, details are revealed which put Ellen's current life into perspective. A 37-year-old single woman, recently divorced and pregnant as a result of a brief encounter, Ellen has purchased the house where disaster long ago struck her family, and there she awaits the birth of her baby and thinks about the past.<br /><br />Dorrestein is the consummate literary juggler here as she throws Ellen's innumerable memories, partial memories, and suspicions into the air of her story and manages to keep them all suspended until the heart-stopping, breath-taking conclusion. I'm sure many readers will feel compelled to keep reading this book well into the night--the agony of finding out the details so slowly is more than some of us are willing to bear. A most delicious horror story, especially memorable because Ellen seems so like ourselves.  Mary Whippleary Whipple <br />	2005-09-23

The first seventy pages of this huge, eloquent, and multi-layered novel require the reader's patience--it is not always clear, at first, who the characters are or exactly what they are doing. But patience is gloriously rewarded as the cadences of the characters' speech, with its street slang, odd syntax, natural poetry, and homespun aphorisms, combine with vibrant details of their everyday lives and eventually bring these \\"ordinary\\" folks to life in Dublin in 1915.<br /><br />On the eve of the Easter Rebellion, we meet Jim Mack and Doyler Doyle, two teenage boys who are trying to sort out who they are, emotionally, politically, and sexually. They get no help from home, where their fathers relive their memories of fighting for the British during the Boer War and where sex and the facts of life are never even hinted at. They get no help from their priests, who severely punish confessions of \\"the solitary sin,\\" while sometimes fondling their students. Secret revolutionary societies troll for members, and priests sometimes help them. Neither boy has close friends his own age. As naïve Jim gravitates toward the more street-wise Doyler, their friendship blossoms, they rejoice in each other's company, and they begin to try on roles for the future--Doyler finding an outlet with Irish rebels, and Jim considering a priestly vocation.<br /><br />It quickly becomes clear to the reader that this will be a gay coming-of-age story within the broader context of the Irish rebellion, and these two stories mesh seamlessly, with many obvious parallels. Quietly, without beating any drums or making any polemical statements, O'Neill allows his characters to discover their feelings for each other and their inborn nature, even as the political rebellion takes shape. O'Neill's characters are who they are, and he respects them and the reader too much to use them simply to prove a point. The parallels he draws between them and some of the famous leaders of the Irish rebellion, such as Roger Casement, and between them and the Sacred Band of Thebes are incidental to the story, though they do give a broader context to the gay relationship.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this engrossing novel was with the character of MacMurrough, an older \\"mentor\\" to both boys. MacMurrough is a sexual predator, at least at the beginning, a man guilty of violent rape in a graphic early scene which made me cringe.

Mary Renault's great historical novel of Theseus begins when he is a young man in Troizen, a well-bred youth who has never known his father's identity. When, with the help of the gods, he succeeds in lifting a stone to reclaim his father's sword, Theseus discovers that he is the son of Aigeus, King of Athens. On his way to Athens to meet him, Theseus arrives in Eleusis, where after wrestling the king in a fight to the death, he finds himself, unexpectedly, the King of Eleusis. Later, in Athens, when fourteen young men and women are chosen by lot to become bull-dancers in Crete, fulfilling a tribute demanded by the King of Crete, Theseus listens to his god and joins the group, never knowing if he will survive to return to his father.<br /><br />Renault tells the story of Theseus as if Theseus were a real person, not a mythical character, using history, archaeology, and a deep understanding of the cultures of the period to place Theseus in a realistic context. Her descriptions of the lifting of the stone, the wrestling match in Eleusis, Theseus's arrival at the palace in Athens, and especially his experiences in becoming a bull dancer bring the period vibrantly to life in ways consistent with the historical record. Theseus's devotion to the god Poseidon, to whom he prays throughout his journey, reflects his appreciation of his own smallness in relation to the gods, and his honoring of the gods unique to the kingdoms he visits show how the Greek religion gradually incorporated increasing numbers of gods and goddesses to explain the increasingly complex mysteries of life faced by Greek citizens.<br /><br />Renault never fails to treat Theseus, his religion and culture, and the traditions of the countries in which he travels with the dignity they would have inspired in their own period. She never patronizes either her characters or her readers, writing with elegance and a fine appreciation for the details of daily life, the art of the period, and the pantheon of gods thought to control men's destinies. Whether Theseus was a real man whose strength and reputation grew to mythical proportions, as Renault illustrates, or whether he was, in fact, a mythical character whom she places in a realistic context in ancient Greece is less important than the fact that she creates a plausible life for this monumental character. Few, if any, other authors are so successful in recreating an entire era, its people, its beliefs, and its culture. Mary Whippleds thought to control men's destinies.

This is a \\"western\\" which gallops to life, and the reader feels the grit, smells the dust, and agonizes with desperate characters as they are tossed every which way, not by their own deliberate decisions so much as by the unpredictability of their Australian frontier existence.<br /><br />Ned Kelly, the Jesse James of Australia, becomes human here, not a monstrous blackguard so much as a man who is forced to make impossible choices. In this tale, which purports to be the hand-written autobiography he wants to leave for his baby daughter, we follow his childhood in poverty, his reluctant \\"apprenticeship\\" to the villainous Harry Powers, his cruel imprisonment by corrupt authorities, and his attempts to stay out of trouble upon his release. The judicial system's attack on his mother, however, becomes the catalyst for Ned's life in crime, a life which the reader understands could have been completely different, had authorities simply shown more compassion.<br /><br />Carey is masterful in using small details to show contrasts and to make the big picture come alive. A new pair of soft boots achieves almost mystical significance--the ecstasy of their acquisition contrasting with the strength achieved through their sacrifice. \\"Fresh bread and jam...barley and mutton soup,\\" served to Ned in jail, provide poignant contrast to the poorer, leaner fare on the farm. And a red silk dress becomes a symbol for corruption in one context and love in another.<br /><br />A vigorous and uncompromising vision of wilderness life and death, the novel is also the sensitive portrayal of a young man forced to make impossible decisions to save and protect his family. It is also a passionate love story told with a warmth and sympathy that is all the more poignant for its contrast with the murder and death which accompany it. Satisfying and rewarding on all levels.

Tarquin Winot, the speaker of this wickedly entertaining novel, is an artist, a dedicated gourmet, and a brilliant and thoughtful philosopher. He is also an intolerant and arrogant snob who foists his lofty opinions upon the reader as he travels from Portsmouth to southern France. In sometimes long-winded sentences, Winot comments on effete subjects, such as the erotics of dislike, the aesthetics of absence, and his disinterest in the idea of interest, while simultaneously creating deliciously sensuous descriptions of the perfect bouillabaise, lamb with apricots, or pike in beurre blanc.<br /><br />Winot is so waspishly nasty, so full of condescension, and so unsympathetic a character that I almost gave up on him and the book, thinking both too rarefied to be interesting. Then the author \\"hooked\\" me with a few details that made me think that Winot might not be all he seemed to be--that he might be far more fascinating than I had previously suspected. As Winot takes the reader through a series of elaborate seasonal menus, he casually drops hints about his past, piquing the reader's interest and inspiring him/her to figure out exactly what kind of man Winot is and what, exactly, he has done. This strange, unwinding backstory becomes the compelling \\"plot.\\"<br /><br />Carefully crafted and (ultimately) coherent, this novel of intrigue is a delight to read, filled with sumptuous imagery, wickedly dark humor, and a series of mysteries that depend on the reader's ability to read between the lines and draw conclusions.

Author Danticat introduces her story of Haitian immigrants and the lives they have escaped in Haiti with the story of Ka, a young sculptress whose parents think of her as a \\"good angel,\\" her name also associated symbolically with the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Ka is in Florida with her father to deliver a powerfully rendered sculpture to a Haitian TV actress. Ka's father, who served as the model for the sculpture, however, destroys it, confessing tearfully that he is not the man his daughter has always believed him to be, and admitting that the disfiguring scar on his face was not the result of torture in a Haitian prison. He was \\"the hunter,\\" he says, and \\"not the prey,\\" one of the \\"dew breakers,\\" or torturers, who as part of the Tonton Macoutes, committed political assassinations and inflicted unimaginable tortures on orders of dictators Francois Duvalier and his son \\"Baby Doc\\" between 1957-86.<br /><br />In a series of episodes which resemble short stories more than a novel in form, Danticat illuminates the lives of approximately a dozen Haitian immigrants as they remember this traumatic period \\"back home.\\" As the \\"novel\\" alternates between past and present, it is told from disparate points of view--those of Ka's mother and father, a young man visiting Haiti after ten years to see his blinded aunt, a wedding seamstress in New York, a Haitian-American reporter investigating a possible \\"dew-breaker,\\" a man remembering a Haitian friend's long-ago disappearance as he awaits his son's birth in New York, and a popular Haitian preacher whose arrest affects lives for many years.<br /><br />The novel gains much of its power from the horrors of vividly described torture and the overwhelming fear engendered by the Tonton Macoute militia. By calling up such emotionally charged memories and presenting them in a series of episodes, the author can let the personal stories unfold without having to order events so that they lead to a grand climax. What distinguishes this \\"novel\\" from a short story collection, however, is the repeating motifs that appear throughout these seemingly separate episodes (a man's widow's peak, a woman's fear of cemeteries, for example), and by the end of the novel the connections among all the characters become obvious.

With echoes of Edgar Allan Poe, this 1902 novel continues to delight mystery-lovers. Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of Sir Henry Baskerville, an American who has inherited it upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles. The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night-one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.<br /><br />Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor. The lecherous Baskerville, in pursuit, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\" The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.<br /><br />In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall. Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.<br /><br />Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader). By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of interest to Holmes.<br /><br />Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise. The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate. Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre.

When he first meets Charles Strickland, a London stockbroker, the young narrator of this novel thinks of him as \\"good, honest, dull, and plain.\\" When Strickland suddenly abandons his wife and children and takes off for Paris, however, the narrator decides he is a cad. Though he has had no training, Strickland has decided to become an artist, a drive so strong that he is willing to sacrifice everything toward that end. Anti-social, and feeling no obligation to observe even the smallest social decencies, Strickland becomes increasingly boorish as he practices his art. Eventually, he makes his way to Tahiti, where he \\"marries,\\" moves to a remote cottage, and spends the rest of his life devoted to his art.<br /><br />Basing the novel loosely on the life of Paul Gauguin, Maugham creates an involving and often exciting story. His narrator is a writer who feels impelled to set down his memories of his early interactions with Strickland in London and Paris after Strickland's death and posthumous success. Because the narrator never saw Strickland after he left Paris, he depends on his meetings with a ship captain and a woman in Papeete for information about Strickland after Strickland arrived in Tahiti. The ship captain is described as a story-teller who may be spinning tall tales, a constant reminder to the reader that this is fiction, and not a biography of Gauguin.<br /><br />By depicting Strickland as a \\"dull, plain\\" man suddenly gripped by an obsession so overwhelming that nothing else matters to him, Maugham involves the reader in his actions, which even the narrator claims not to understand. The least convincing aspect of Strickland's characterization is the narrator's observation that Strickland is completely indifferent to his wife of seventeen years and his children. No confrontation between Strickland and his wife appears, and one wonders if perhaps Maugham found himself unable to depict such an abandonment realistically. The story moves quickly, however, and whatever is sacrificed in the characterization is more than recouped in the plot and its development.<br /><br />Straightforward in its story line, the novel is romantic in its depiction of the artist in the grip of an obsession, his subsequent abandonment of civilization and return to nature, his suffering of a long terminal illness (during which he paints his masterpiece), and the fate of this creation further develop the romantic themes. Good, old-fashioned story-telling at its best, this uncomplicated story, written in 1919, still has broad appeal.

Weird happenings within an even weirder family combine with the \\"fusty, drunken perfume of Magnolia\\" to fill this southern Gothic novel with bizarre behavior and pervasive threats of death and revenge. Forces of evil are at work, according to Charlotte Cleve, a mother of three, who believes the mysterious hanging death of her nine-year-old son Robin resulted because she changed her traditional Mother's Day celebration from noon to six o'clock on the day he died.<br /><br />Twelve years after Robin's death, his fiercely independent sister Harriet, now twelve herself, investigates the circumstances of Robin's death, bent on identifying and punishing his murderer. Bearing little resemblance to Scout, the endearing heroine of To Kill a Mockingbird, single-minded Harriet recognizes no limits and is willing to do anything, including using a gun, to accomplish her goals. Confronting ex-cons who run a crystal meth lab, ditsy great-aunts who know what's \\"right,\\" redneck children who lurk in the bushes, two snake-handling preachers, a mother who turns her house into a maze filled with piles of rotting, old newspapers, and a sister who sleeps seventeen hours a day (\\"I only get bored when I'm awake,\\" she says), Harriet takes more comfort from her plans for revenge than from traditional southern values.<br /><br />Tartt's themes of death and punishment achieve some sense of universality through her use of numerous symbols and parallels, often with animals, but these are frequently sentimental. The euthanasia of a beloved pet cat; Harriet's accidental killing of a blackbird stuck in tar, snakes handled by hillbilly preachers; and the vicious dogs of the Ratliff family haunt the narrative. The old family home is called Tribulation; Harriet's heroes are Sherlock Holmes, Harry Houdini, and Captain Scott, the explorer; and she spends much of the novel looking for a pair of red gloves given to her by her black housekeeper, whom she loves but treats with casual cruelty.<br /><br />The plot strains credulity, even for southern Gothic, and Harriet, as a twelve-year-old protagonist, is too wild and out-of-control to inspire much empathy as a character. The narrative focus of the novel gets lost, and many episodes, only peripherally related to the original search for justice, seem to become narrative ends in themselves.

Jasper Fforde has a rich imagination that moves in wacky directions, an off-the-wall sense of humor that never quits, and a deep knowledge and love of literature which give shape and substance to this hilarious \\"thing\\" he's created. Not really a mystery, sci-fi thriller, satire, or fluffy fantasy, this wild rumpus contains elements of all these but feels like a completely new genre. Fforde combines \\"real\\" people from the \\"historically challenged\\" world of his plot with characters from classic novels, adding dollops of word play, irony, literary humor, satire--and even a dodo bird--just for spice.<br /><br />With \\"real\\" characters who can stop time or travel back and forth in it, hear their own names (the names here are really terrific!) from 1000 yards away, appear in duplicate before themselves to give advice, travel inside books, and change the outcome of history, the reader journeys through Fforde's looking glass into a different and far more literary universe than the one we know. Thursday Next, a SpecOp-27 in the Literary Detective Division of Special Operations, is looking for Acheron Hades, who has stolen the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit and killed one of the characters in it, thereby changing the story forever. Thursday and the Literatecs are trying to prevent him from getting inside Jane Eyre and committing further murders.<br /><br />If you have not read Jane Eyre recently, your pleasure in this book will be greatly enhanced if you look up a brief plot summary on-line before proceeding too far--the ending of Jane Eyre as we know it is different from the ending of Jane Eyre as Thursday Next knows it, and the differences themselves become a delightful part of this plot. Though some readers seem to feel that the book would benefit from a bit of pruning in order to strengthen its conclusion, that suggestion seems to me to be too much like Acheron Hades changing Martin Chuzzlewit or Jane Eyre--if you do that, something is irreparably lost--and this book is so much fun that I'd hate to lose even a single word!

In the summer of 1938, when Leo Joachim arrives at the ironically named Camp Friend-Indeed, he brings with him a set of serious problems. He is an orphan living at an orphanage, having previously been hospitalized for some sort of terrible trauma involving the deaths of his parents. Camp is supposed to provide him with some sort of respite from the terrors he has already faced in his life. Though he is a talented violinist and a naturalist with an interest in spiders, he has no interest in baseball or any other athletic contest by which the various camp units compete for the Hartsig trophy, given to the best unit at the camp.<br /><br />Paired with Tiger, a sympathetic young man who appreciates Leo's talents and tries to ignore his differences from the other boys, Leo gets along pretty well, at first, though he remains somewhat apart from the other boys, preferring to ignore the special baseball practice and stay in the woods to observe an owl and practice his violin. When he violates some of the \\"sacred\\" camp traditions, Reese Hartsig, his counselor and the son of the camp's wealthy founder, worries that Leo may cost the Jeremiah unit the Hartsig trophy, and Reese becomes Leo's active enemy.<br /><br />As he has done in so many other novels, Tryon builds inexorable suspense. As Reese begins to promote the \\"you're with me or against me\\" mentality among the other campers in the unit, the pressures on Leo increase cruelly, and he finds himself being shunned, mocked, cast out, and placed in increasingly dangerous situations, until he is finally summoned before a kangaroo court and tried by Reese and his camp-henchmen.<br /><br />Though the characters are sometimes clich&eacute;d and the action sometimes predictable, the psychological torment of Leo is all too realistic, and most readers will recall similar nightmarish incidents from childhood. The setting in 1938 draws obvious parallels with the rise of Hitler, and Reese is clearly a \\"golden boy\\" who expects always to be part of the winning team, surrounded by yes-men. The cruel torments of Leo and his friend Fritz, the lone Jewish youth, show, within the microcosm of a boys' camp, the macrocosm of events in Europe. The climax is stunning, and while it may play on the heartstrings and be an easy way for the author to resolve the problems of Leo's torture, no reader will be disappointed by the final drama.<br /><br />Though this is not a psychological horror story on the level of Tryon's The Other, or even Harvest Home, it is a well-drawn novel of suspense which will appeal especially to young adults.

This bittersweet novel is as fresh and charming today as it was when originally published in 1976. Telling the story of Raman, a conscientious sign-painter, who is trying to lead a rational life, the novel is filled with busy neighborhood life and gossip, the alternating rhythms and sounds of the city from morning till night, and the pungent smells and tantalizing flavors of home cooking, as Narayan portrays everyday life in Malgudi. The city is growing and changing, as its inhabitants try to carve out some individual successes within the juggernaut of \\"progress.\\"<br /><br />Raman, a college graduate, brings a sense of professionalism to his sign-painting, taking pride in his calligraphy and trying to create exactly the right sign, artistically, for each client. Living with his aged aunt, a devout, traditional woman whose days are spent running the house and tending to her nephew's needs and whose evenings are spent at the temple listening to the old stories and praying, Raman prefers a rational approach to life. Then he meets Daisy. A young woman devoted to improving the lives of women and the standard of living of the country through strict family planning, Daisy becomes his biggest customer, commissioning signs for all the family planning clinics she helps establish through the city and outlying rural areas. Ram soon finds his attraction to Daisy more powerful than this desire to remain \\"rational.\\"<br /><br />Narayan is a master of domestic scenes, presenting the major and minor conflicts of family life through the different points of view of the participants. Respect for his characters and a good-humored (and often humorous) presentation of their issues give warmth to his scenes and allow the reader to feel real empathy with the characters. Raman's belief in his own rational enlightenment and his simultaneous vulnerability to Daisy's manipulations provide the author with unlimited opportunities for dramatic irony.<br /><br />Scenes between Ram and his devout, elderly aunt provide a glimpse of the conflicts between old and new India, in addition to the generational conflicts every family faces between its young and its old. Scenes between Ram and Daisy reflect the changes in the role of women in society, as women become more assertive and liberated. Though he is presented as a unique, individualized character, Ram, the painter of signs, is, in a sense, Everyman, facing his coming-of-age as all men before him have done in cultures around the world.

In the taut, staccato style reminiscent of Raymond Chandler or John D. MacDonald, Lee Child presents his eighth Jack Reacher novel, a police procedural with a difference: Reacher is an MP, an army Major at Fort Bird, North Carolina, obedient to a different set of rules and objectives. Recently transferred from Panama to be MP Executive Officer, Reacher must immediately investigate the death of a two-star general who has died in a seedy, nearby motel, presumably with a prostitute. His briefcase, containing the agenda for a top-secret conference in California, has disappeared, and when Reacher and his aide, Lt. Summer, go to break the news to the general's wife, they find her dead, too, bludgeoned to death with a crowbar within hours of the general's death.<br /><br />With almost military precision, dramatic complications unfold, and Reacher soon finds himself facing two new deaths, one of which is a gruesome butchering which takes place on the base. Ordered by superiors to cover up the murder by calling it a \\"training accident,\\" Reacher and his aide investigate surreptitiously, soon discovering that his MP XO counterparts at twenty more bases throughout the world have also been newly appointed to their positions, all of them on or around December 29. Obvious questions arise about who is pulling the strings, who has the power to transfer so many MPs to new posts, and why someone would want to do so.<br /><br />Child is a meticulous writer whose plot follows a strict chronological order and moves at a breath-taking pace, with one dramatic scene following hard on the heels of another. Reacher and his aide Summer are not fully developed characters, but they do not need to be as they struggle to learn who is controlling the grisly chess game which has resulted in four deaths. The action is resolved in an extravagant grand finale, with twists and turns and spectacular surprises.<br /><br />Though the ending resolves the disparate threads, it may also be a disappointment to some readers, since the premise behind the plot and the motivation which led to the murders, when finally revealed, seems too unrealistic to justify the murderous extremes to which \\"the enemy\\" has gone. Though Child is brilliant in creating an exciting story packed with action, the final pages feel cynical and reveal a view of humanity that is grim.

With his face altered by plastic surgery, he is accompanied by Dr. Einstein, with whom he plans to set up an operating room in the house so the doctor can give new faces to criminals. The only normal person in the family is Mortimer, a drama critic who hates plays, engaged to marry Elaine, the innocent daughter of the minister next door. Mortimer is particularly upset by Jonathan's return--\\"the most detestable, vicious, venomous form of animal life I ever knew.\\"<br /><br />The frantic action, the ironies, the comic routines, and the dramatic surprises all center around two bodies, hidden at various times in the window seat of the living room, and the reactions to them by the various people within the household.

Much of the play involves sight gags, contretemps, and weird characters behaving outrageously.

In the author's \\"Prelude in a Saloon,\\" published as the preface of this trilogy, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist William Kennedy portrays himself as Daniel Quinn, nephew of Billy Phelan (of Billy Phelan's Greatest Game) and grandson of Francis Phelan (of Ironweed), as he begins an interview with an old gangster who worked closely with Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond (of Legs). With tongue-in-cheek humor, Quinn/Kennedy reveals how his writing career began and how he came to know the main characters of this trio of books set in Depression-era Albany, New York.<br /><br />Legs, set in 1930 - 1931, is a fictional biography of Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond, thief/bootlegger/murderer, a man who lived the high life and who double-crossed and cheated his way to success, controlling speakeasies, illegal alcohol, real estate, and gambling, a man who survived eleven bullets in three separate assassination attempts before finally being brought down. An uncomplicated but well-written and often violent novel, Legs sets the scene for Billy Phelan's Greatest Game and Ironweed, both set in 1938. (4 stars)<br /><br />Billy Phelan's Greatest Game is far more sophisticated, with more fully drawn characters, well-developed suspense, and themes dealing with fathers and sons and their values--intergenerational problems which reveal the changing morality of Depression-era Albany. Billy Phelan, part-time bookie and small-time card player and gambler is asked to monitor the activities of one of his fellow-card players, suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of Charlie MacCall, son and nephew of the two men running the political machine of Albany. Remaining true to his own values, Billy is surprised when his father Francis Phelan, who has just reappeared after abandoning the family twenty-two years before, suggests cooperating.

Telling the story of Luca Turin, a French scientist who, in the mid-1990s, developed a revolutionary new theory about how we smell, Chandler Burr focuses on the evolution of the theory and why it has not led to a Nobel Prize. Turin, a controversial researcher, posited (and believes he proved) that scent is not determined by the body's ability to recognize the shape of molecules, the accepted explanation of smell. Instead, he believes that vibrations of electrons are recognized by a kind of \\"spectroscope\\" in our noses--that atoms with the same vibrations have the same smell even when they come from different elements.<br /><br />Burr details Turin's experiments and his successful (he believes) searches for proof through the late 1990s. But he also describes Turin's unsuccessful attempts to be published in prestigious scientific magazines, his battles royal with other researchers, some of whom have rejected his ideas without reading his papers, and his disappointments with the \\"Big Boys,\\" the world's seven biggest makers of perfumes, who would benefit directly if Turin were correct. Ultimately, Burr concludes that the scientific community and its attitudes toward Turin reflect their \\"scientific corruption, corruption in the most mundane and systemic [sense].\\"<br /><br />For whatever reasons, Burr is unsuccessful in getting opposing scientists to discuss Turin's vibration theory in relation to their belief in a molecule's shape as a determinant of smell, and he ultimately presents a book that is biased in favor of Turin's work. By the end of the book, Burr has clearly abandoned any sense of impartiality and become a supporter of Turin. He inserts an Author's Note three-quarters of the way into the book to justify his inability to present an alternative viewpoint, concluding that scientific rejection of Turin's theory is the result of \\"vested self-interest and bad science.\\"<br /><br />Turin is clearly a difficult man, however, and his attitudes, reflected in humorous and sarcastic comments about other scientists and their ideas, may well have contributed to his lack of acceptance. Though one of his supporters praises him for being the first person to apply quantum mechanics to a physical problem, he also indicates that Turin's biggest flaw is his impatience. (In fact, Turin has already abandoned this work, moving on to a new project studying energy storage in cells.)

Published in 1939, the same year that James Joyce published Finnegan's Wake, this novel was lauded in its day by Joyce himself, Samuel Beckett, and Graham Greene. A wild concoction involving a completely disjointed narrative, multiple points of view, farce, satire, and parody, this \\"novel\\" offers any student of Irish literature unlimited subject matter--and equally unlimited laughs. In this unique experiment with point of view, author Brian O'Nolan has used a pseudonym, Flann O'Brien, to tell the story of the novelist/student N, who tells his own story at the same time that he is writing a book about an invented novelist (Trellis), who is himself developing another story, while Tracy, still another author, tells a cowboy story and appears in the previous narratives.<br /><br />Believing that characters should be born fully adult, one of the writers tries to keep them all together--in this case, at the Red Swan Hotel--so that he can keep track of them and keep them sober while he plans the narrative and writes and rewrites the beginning and ending of the novel. But even when the primary writer stops writing to go out with his friends, the characters of the other (invented) fictional writers continue to live on in the narrative and comment on writing. Before long, the reader is treated to essays on the nature of books vs. plays, polemics about the evils of drink, parodies of folk tales and ballads, a breathless wild west tale starring an Irish cowboy, the legends of Ireland, catalogues of sins, tales of magic and the supernatural, almanacs of folk wisdom and the cures for physical ills, and even the account of a trial--and that's just for starters.<br /><br />Totally unique, O'Brien's creation defies the conventions, both of its day and of the present, and even the most jaded reader will be astonished at the unexpected twists the narrative takes. Steeped in the traditions of the Irish story-teller, O'Brien keeps those traditions alive by creating multiple narrators to tell multiple stories simultaneously, while also skewering the very traditions of which he--and they--are a part.

When Isabel Archer, a bright and independent young American, makes her first trip to Europe in the company of her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, who lives outside of London in a 400-year-old estate, she discovers a totally different world, one which does not encourage her independent thinking or behavior and which is governed by rigid social codes. This contrast between American and European values, vividly dramatized here, is a consistent theme in James's novels, one based on his own experiences living in the US and England. In prose that is filled with rich observations about places, customs, and attitudes, James portrays Isabel's European coming-of-age, as she discovers that she must curb her intellect and independence if she is to fit into the social scheme in which she now finds herself.<br /><br />Isabel Archer, one of James's most fully drawn characters, has postponed a marriage in America for a year of travel abroad, only to discover upon her precipitate and ill-considered marriage to an American living in Florence, that it is her need to be independent that makes her marriage a disaster. Gilbert Osmond, an American art collector living in Florence, marries Isabel for the fortune she has inherited from her uncle, treating her like an object d'art which he expects to remain \\"on the shelf.\\" Madame Serena Merle, his long-time lover, is, like Osmond, an American whose venality and lack of scruples have been encouraged, if not developed, by the European milieu in which they live.<br /><br />James packs more information into one paragraph than many writers do in an entire chapter. Distanced and formal, he presents psychologically realistic characters whose behavior is a direct outgrowth of their upbringing, with their conflicts resulting from the differences between their expectations and the reality of their changed settings. The subordinate characters, Ralph Touchett, Pansy Osmond, her suitor Edward Rosier, American journalist Henrietta Stackpole, Isabel's former suitor Caspar Stackpole, and Lord Warburton, whose love of Isabel leads him to court Pansy, are as fascinating psychologically and as much a product of their own upbringing as is Isabel.<br /><br />As the setting moves from America to England, Paris, Florence, and Rome, James develops his themes, and as Isabel's life becomes more complex, her increasingly difficult and emotionally affecting choices about her life make her increasingly fascinating to the reader. James's trenchant observations about the relationship between individuals and society and about the effects of one's setting on one's behavior are enhanced by the elegance and density of his prose, making this a novel one must read slowly--and savor.

This Cartesian principle resonates throughout Gill's narrative about the violence in Northern Ireland, as he represents the many competing forces in the battle to control Northern Ireland. Catholic Provo extremists are bent upon assassinating Ian Paisley, a self-annointed Protestant minister and firebrand Loyalist intent upon establishing his own absolute right to rule Ulster. Paisley's security staff in Belfast, equally bloodthirsty and equally irrational, have their own plans for payback to the Catholic minority and their supporters in the south.<br /><br />The official governments of the two parts of Ireland have their own interests, not always consistent with those of the extremists on both sides, and the British further complicate the issue. The police of both areas operate independently, and some high officials are actively in cahoots with leaders of various factions. Into this vividly described maelstrom, comes Supt. Peter McGarr of the Garda Siochana, as he investigates the seemingly unrelated death of a rugby star.<br /><br />With the most powerful opening section Gill has ever written, this novel stands apart from the rest of the McGarr series and easily holds its own as an independent novel. Though the characters usually associated with McGarr do make some minor appearances, the narrative's strength lies not with the Garda but with the vividly portrayed characters involved in the political unrest. McGarr himself does not even appear in the novel until p. 65.<br /><br />Readers unfamiliar with the complexities of the troubles in Northern Ireland may find it a bit difficult to keep track of who's who and who's on which side, and even the participants don't always know, as people frequently cross borders and change alliances. This is a stunning novel, however, with an ending as complex as the conflicts themselves.

A special pleasure in this novel is the introduction of a wonderful, new character, Mr. Polopetsi, a man with a sad story who will undoubtedly be further developed in later novels.<br /><br />Throughout the series, plots and subplots serve primarily as vehicles for character development and the exploration of cultural values. In this novel Mma Ramotswe has a deep secret, not shared even with her husband, and she is desperate to have it remain a secret. Her house is broken into, her car is stolen, and Note Makoti, her first husband, returns to Gabarone. Mysterious goings-on occur in Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni's former house, now rented; the detective agency looks for a missing man from Zambia; and Mma Makuti finds herself receiving the attentions of a clumsy suitor. While these events may not be very exciting when regarded on a large scale, they are significant in the lives of these ordinary people trying to live their lives with dignity.<br /><br />Reading this series is like returning to a familiar neighborhood to meet old friends. In simple, direct prose and a leisurely pace, the author recreates the colorful lives of a repeating set of characters who treasure relationships, treat each other with respect, and possess inherent good sense. Full of gentle humor and much wisdom, the novel emphasizes the richness of a traditional life without including the violence, sex, or horror which fill other \\"detective\\" novels. Warm, witty, and nostalgic, this series is happy reading, and this novel is a fine addition to the series.

When eleven-year-old Daniel Sempere awakens early one morning, screaming, because he has suddenly forgotten the face of his deceased mother, his devoted father comforts him. As dawn breaks, Daniel's father, a bookseller, takes him on his first visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a secret, maze-like library which preserves books \\"no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time.\\" Each person who visits must adopt a book, guaranteeing that it will never disappear, and when Daniel sees The Shadow of the Wind, he knows it \\"had been waiting for me there for years, probably since before I was born.\\" Captivated by this book by Julian Carax, Daniel tries to find out more about its mysterious author and locate additional novels, but he discovers that some other unknown seeker is also searching for Carax's books--in order to burn them.<br /><br />Lovers of the Gothic romance will be handsomely rewarded by the action-filled plot, as a sensitive and loving young boy comes of age while trying to unravel the mysteries associated with the elusive Julian Carax. A ghostly apparition in the misty lamplight, a faceless man who seems to have an inordinate interest in Daniel, a sadistic police inspector, and an incarnation of the devil himself all materialize as Daniel begins his search for information about Carax.<br /><br />Heavy, sensual imagery creates a sense of foreboding, while night-time mists, storms, and winter cold add atmosphere to sensational scenes and coincidences. A mysterious photograph, letters which go astray, false identities, an abandoned mansion with a sobbing ghost, a matricide, an evil stepfather, thwarted love, mysterious disappearances, revenge which never dies, and murder most foul all complicate the action. The evil characters are truly villainous, Daniel and his father are truly virtuous, and the women whom Daniel and Julian Carax love are pure and true of heart.<br /><br />Though the novel offers a good escape, it is almost six hundred pages long. Extensive background information for virtually all the characters (and even a house) gives more information than the reader really needs, and many scenes could be compressed. Occasionally, the mood is broken by mild profanity and bathroom humor. This romance does achieve more relevance than some others, however, by being directly connected to the world of books, with a setting that reflects the political climate of Spain after the Civil War and World War II. The characters are memorable, if relatively uncomplicated, and the parallels between Daniel's coming-of-age and the story of Julian Carax offer some sense of universality to this otherwise sensational melodrama.

A fast-paced and witty bedroom farce of the 1930s, Present Laughter was written by Coward as a vehicle in which he himself planned to star, and it may well reflect some of the less attractive aspects of his own life. The play concerns a well-known, 40-ish actor, Gary Essendine, who is about to set off for a series of performances in Africa. Essendine enjoys all the perks of stardom, including women who can't resist him, fawning fans, and late nights of partying, followed by late mornings of undisturbed sleeping. Though he is married to Liz, they have been separated for a couple of years, and neither minds the other's dalliances, or the serial dalliances of their circle of friends.<br /><br />In the course of the play, several women \\"forget their latch keys\\" and have to spend the night at Essendine's apartment, where his secretary, valet, and housekeeper hide them to keep succeeding visitors from discovering them. One of them, Joanna, is married to Essendine's friend Henry, but she has had a long-standing affair with another friend, Morris, and she seduces Essendine in the course of the play. In the midst of all this deception, a young playwright also arrives, wanting to know if Essendine has read his play, at the same time confessing to having an obsession with Essendine himself, before he is shuttled off to the office when yet another unexpected visitor arrives.<br /><br />As is always the case with Coward, each scene sets the stage for the next scene, and the play unfolds with dramatic ease and considerable dramatic irony. The characterizations are exaggerated for comic effect, and the dialogue is witty, with many tongue-in-cheek remarks, as the all-consuming game of \\"musical beds,\\" \\"heartfelt\\" confessions, and diabolical scheming takes place. Fast pace is crucial to the action, demanding the split second appearances and disappearances of some characters as new characters enter and depart.<br /><br />Though the hijinx are distinctly sexual, the play maintains an elegance of language and an on-stage formality. The clever repartee never descends to vulgarity, and the love scenes all take place off-stage. Universal in its observations of human nature, this play is still being revived and finding audiences after more than half a century. This play and Private Lives are Coward at his best.

In this somewhat atypical Jane Austen novel, Austen abandons her precise characterization and carefully constructed plots, usually designed to illustrate specific ethical and social dilemmas, and presents a much broader, more complex picture of early nineteenth century life. Though the polite behavior of the middle and upper classes is always a focus of Austen, and this novel is no exception, she is more analytical of society as a whole here, casting a critical eye on moral issues which allow the upper class to perpetuate itself. Fanny Price, the main character, is the daughter of a genteel woman who married for love but soon found herself in poverty. When Fanny's aunt and uncle, the wealthy owners of Mansfield Park, invite Fanny alone, of all the children, to live with them, Fanny enters a new world, where she is educated, clothed, and housed, but always regarded as an \\"outsider.\\"<br /><br />Through Fanny's two cousins, Maria and Julia, Austen shows the complex interactions of the upper class as they negotiate marriages, try to maintain the family's reputation and wealth, and react to those \\"beneath\\" them socially. Fanny, having experienced both poverty and plenty, comments on what she sees, and though she lacks the witty charm of some of Austen's other characters (such as Elizabeth Bennett), she shows an intelligence and conscience lacking among her cousins. Only Edmund, the youngest of the Bertram sons, pays genuine attention to her, and her love for him is real, though secret.<br /><br />This is a darker novel than Austen's others, showing conflicts between late eighteenth century rationalism and the growing romanticism of the nineteenth century. Sir Thomas maintains his wealth through his expedient participation in the slave trade, a business that his sons Thomas and Edmund abhor. Often unfeeling toward his own family, Sir Thomas also shows cruelty toward Fanny when she rejects a marriage he has negotiated for her to a man she does not love. Cousin Maria chooses to marry Rushworth for his fortune, but she succumbs to her passion for someone else, and introduces a romantic, new sexuality into the novel. Unfortunately, Fanny, though sweet and reasonable, is also quiet and predictable, while Edmund, the only other potentially empathetic character, is naïve and often appears to be weak. Austen's light touch and quiet humor, which make her other novels vibrate with life and come to a satisfying ending, are less obvious here, and the abrupt conclusion leaves many questions unanswered.

Focusing on the life of Henry James, Colm Toibin's The Master goes beyond the usual \\"novelization\\" of someone's biography. Toibin has done a tremendous amount of research and has obviously read everything James has written, but he has so distilled this information that he actually recreates Henry James. Most remarkably, he does this while using the third person point of view to tell the story, preserving the objective tone but bringing forth characters and events so vibrant with life that Toibin's James is the man we know from his novels, letters, and journals.<br /><br />When the novel opens in 1895, James's play, Guy Domville, has been booed on its opening night. James, now fifty-two, has hoped for a career as a playwright, believing success on stage will put an end to \\"his long solitary days\\" and allow him to spend more time among actors, whom he finds fascinating. Described as \\"a great stranger...observing the world as a mere watcher from the window,\\" James is a lonely, solitary figure throughout the novel, a man unable to form a committed relationship with anyone, either male or female, sometimes wanting companionship but not closeness, and always needing solitude to work. Through flashbacks, Toibin shows how James's early upbringing may have been partly responsible for his feelings of isolation.<br /><br />When James begins writing his stories and novels, he draws inspiration from the people he knows best and the events which have affected their lives and his own. His sister Alice is the model for a child in The Turn of the Screw, his cousin Minny Temple is the inspiration for several of his most important female characters-in \\"Poor Richard,\\" Daisy Miller, and Portrait of a Lady--and his brother Wilky's wounds in the Civil War provide James with details he includes in other stories. Virtually every aspect of James's life works its way into a story, and as he gets inside the psyches of his characters through his fiction, he reveals his own psyche, his sympathies, and his personal conflicts.<br /><br />Toibin's dual focus on James's life and its embodiment in his fiction give powerful immediacy and verisimilitude to this novel, and one cannot help but feel an emotional connection to James. His connections to great families and writers whose names are well known, and to people willing to accept James completely on his own terms provide Toibin with unlimited source material.

Evoking a dark world of violence and doom from the outset, Hooper sets her debut novel in Tasmania.  Mystery, deception, and betrayal are at the heart of three stories told simultaneously. A children's tale written by 4th grade teacher Kate Byrne uses animals to tell about a 1983 murder (hence, the title); a popular novel written by Veronica Marne, the wife of Kate's lover, Thomas Marne, describes the same murder; and the on-going triangle of Kate, Veronica, and Thomas provides the day-to-day action.<br /><br />This is a lot to cover in 230 pages. In order to tell Kate's story and provide the background of her affair with Thomas Marne, Hooper must give many flashbacks while simultaneously revealing Kate's life in the classroom, her trysts with Thomas, and the perceived threats to her life. The suspense depends on the reader's seeing parallels between Kate's affair and that of the 1983 victim, Ellie Siddells, so Kate, as narrator, must also provide information about Ellie's background and her murder. The animal story is yet another level of abstraction which the reader must correlate with Kate's life.<br /><br />Though the novel is filled with dazzling descriptions and some insightful observations about childhood, the novel ultimately ends up being talky, its three stories overwhelming its characters and obscuring its focus. The narrator, Kate, dictates and talks about the action, instead of bringing it to life, and the reader never really gets to know her.<br /><br />Plot and suspense are the novel's focus at the beginning, while Kate's (undeveloped) character and her coming of age are the focus at the end, a problem which makes the author's overall purpose unclear. The quality of the writing and some gorgeous descriptive paragraphs will take your breath away, however, and perhaps leave you as anxious as I am to see what Hooper does in her next novel.

Written originally as the outline for the screenplay of the famous 1949 film of the same name, Greene sets the story in Vienna just after World War II, employing the sectors established by the conquering British, Americans, French, and Russians to provide tension, mystery, and an almost palpable aura of menace as residents and visitors alike must deal with four different governments, four sets of officials, and four collections of laws as they move throughout the city.  With massive bomb damage, the city is still emerging from devastation, with black markets selling everything from food to penicillin abound.<br /><br />Rollo Martins, the author of cowboy novels written under the name of Buck Dexter, arrives in Vienna to visit an old school friend, Harry Lime, only to find that is the day of Lime's funeral.  Investigating Lime's death, Martins learns that a neighbor saw the traffic accident that killed Lime and observed three men carrying Lime's body from the scene.  Only two of those men have been identified-the third man has vanished.  As Martins investigates, he must deal with the city's several different governments, each of which has carved out a sector.  The initial co-operation among sectors has vanished, and co-operation with the Russian sector is almost non-existent.  Wanted men use the city's sewers to escape from one sector to another, where they cannot be followed.  The investigation of Lime's death becomes more complex when an inebriated Martins is sure that he has seen Harry Lime on the street.<br /><br />By turns exciting and darkly humorous, the novel is a curiosity among Greene's entertainments, since this story was never written to be a novel at all.  Intensely visual in its descriptions and action, it lacks the characterization and thematic focus which one associates with most of Greene's work.  The novel's dialogue, rather than narrative, conveys the story, as it does in the film, and the setting in a war-torn city adds to the sense of danger and drama.  Certainly not one of Greene's \\"finished\\" novels, it is still fun to read, especially when one is familiar with the even better film of it, directed by Carol Reed and starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, and Trevor Howard.  Of particular interest to those studying writing and film-making, Greene's novella is full of wit and dark theatrics, and includes everything from a chase through the sewers to a love story.

The search for dinosaur fossils amid sandstorms and desert heat is anything but dry in this lively story of the excavation in January, 2000, of a site in the western Egyptian desert, partially excavated by Ernst Stromer in 1911, but untouched since then. Nothdurft, a professional writer, working in concert with Josh Smith, the young paleontologist who was the team leader of the January, 2000, dig, tells the stories of both the 1911 and the 2000 excavations, along with the fossil discoveries made by each group.<br /><br />Stromer, a German aristocrat and meticulous paleontologist, found the fossils of four unique, 95-million-year-old dinosaurs in Bahariya in 1911, spent twenty years analyzing them, and then supervised the fossils' installation at the Bavarian State College of Paleontology and Historical Geology in Munich. In April, 1944, everything was lost in the allied bombing of Munich. The story of Stromer's efforts, now almost forgotten, alternates with that of Smith and his group of young Ph.D's from the University of Pennsylvania, who hope to find additional fossils in the same area in January, 2000.<br /><br />Financed by a Los Angeles film company making a documentary, the crew ultimately unearths a 80 - 100 ton new dinosaur species, discovering in the process that at least two other equally gigantic dinosaur species shared space with this titan. How this desert area could support three such huge species becomes the question for the geologists on the trip, a mystery which Nothdurft imbues with immediacy and great excitement as they examine the confusing strata for clues.<br /><br />Nothdurft excels in characterizing the paleontologists and geologists so that the reader can easily imagine participating in the dig along with them. His narrative is fast-paced and full of memorable detail--depictions of Bahariya, with its 130-degree heat and its scorpions, the excitement of the young researchers as they uncover new fossils, and their puzzlement at the paradoxes which unfold. With likeable researchers, and photos and drawings which make their discoveries come alive, this is a wonderful introduction to the challenges of on-site research, the scientific methods of the crew, and the respect with which they regard the past.

Ignoring the conventions of time, this playful \\"message play\\" follows one family from the days of the glaciers and dinosaurs to a post-apocalyptic, modern world. George Antrobus, the inventor of the wheel, and Maggie, his wife, the inventor of the apron, have two children, Gladys and Henry (whose previous name was Cain). The bossy father, domestic and subservient mother, aggressive and dangerous son, and innocent daughter interact, often humorously, onstage and are also seen through the viewpoint of Sabina, the flirtatious maid. As the play progresses through the eras, Wilder raises questions about civilization and values. George, by Act II, is convinced that the world is made for pleasure and power, but by the final act, after a world cataclysm, the family confronts what is truly important in their lives.<br /><br />A pet dinosaur and a wooly mammoth, the Boardwalk of New Jersey and the Miss America contest, the fraternal Order of Mammals (of which George is President), and the attempted seduction of George and his fellow Mammals by predatory women all add to the visual appeal of this production. Though the play pretends to be traditional in its dramatic structure, it takes liberties with the audience as the various actors step out of character to address the audience, as does the director. At one point Sabina refuses to play a scene, summarizing it for the audience as the director and George plead with her.<br /><br />First produced in 1942, the play reflects Wilder's fear that the war then engulfing the world might truly be a war for the future of civilization. His conclusion, which highlights the values of western philosophers, such as Spinoza, Aristotle, and Plato, also reflects his religious beliefs and his belief in the enduring values of (western) literature. \\"We've come a long way--we're learning,\\" he says, hopefully, but he also reminds us that \\"the end of this play isn't written yet.\\" Creative and original in its day, the play represents a major moment in American theater.

This farcical look at marriage, first produced in 1930, starred the author, Noel Coward, and the legendary Gertrude Lawrence. The play's recent revivals in London and New York, however, attest to its incisive wit and its razor-sharp social observation, both of which transcend the 1930s setting and give continuing life and relevance to the play.<br /><br />Elyot Chase, five years divorced, has just married a young bride, Sybil, with whom he is on his honeymoon at a French seaside resort. His former wife, Amanda Prynne, has also just remarried, and, coincidentally, she and Victor, her new husband, are also honeymooning--in the room next door. Inevitably, Elyot and Amanda rediscover each other on their adjoining balconies, find themselves drawn to each other, and abandon their new spouses at the resort to run away together to Paris.<br /><br />The major action of the play shows us the relationship of Elyot and Amanda in Paris as they try to sustain their rekindled love and avoid the pitfalls that destroyed their original marriage. Both are passionate, uninhibited, live-in-the-moment people, and both have married very traditional, predictable, and conformist new spouses. When Sybil and Victor eventually discover the lovers, who, by now, are fighting and even engaging in fisticuffs, Coward makes his point about the nature of relationships, their fragility and/or what makes them endure.<br /><br />Though the play is set in the 1930s, Coward so accurately captures human traits and behavior that the play is still delighting audiences today. In his opening scene, for example, he shows Sybil subjecting new husband Elyot to a mood-killing interrogation about his former wife. He then turns this scene on its head by showing Victor interrogating Amanda about her honeymoon with Elyot, showing the two new spouses to be identical to each other--and completely opposite to Elyot and Amanda. The scenes in Paris, in which Elyot and Amanda, their passion rekindled, try to keep their roiling anger under control are hilarious, and when they eventually resort to slapping and dish-throwing, the elegant verbal duels and clever repartee we have seen till now change the play into a more visually exciting and more farcical experience.<br /><br />The ending of the play is not really a resolution, but it does confirm Coward's theme that though opposites may attract in the short term, this kind of attraction may not be as powerful as the attraction between like characters, which, however, can change instantly when familiarity breeds contempt. Sardonic and sometimes a bit cynical, the play artfully captures the vicissitudes of a wild, passionate relationship and provides insights into its inner workings.

Paul Theroux writing on autopilot is still better than many other authors at the top of their form. His well-known ability to describe a place or person in just a few perfect words, his creation of believable characters with clear motivations, his ironic detachment as these same characters mess up their lives, and his depiction of a writer's battle with the demons of his craft are among his many brilliant qualities, all on vibrant display here.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, this novel was a disappointment to me. Set in a 3rd-rate hotel in Honolulu, it has the characters and setting of a novel (and is called a novel on the cover), but it is so lacking in any sort of unifying plot, that it's not even possible to write a plot summary. The huge cast of characters has only one thing in common--they all live and/or work at the Hotel Honolulu. While some characters are complete enough that they could have been worked into a wonderful collection of short stories, others are seen only in tiny, three- or four-page vignettes and add nothing significant.<br /><br />Like the author, the narrator is a writer who has had a failed marriage and difficult divorce in England and who has come to Hawaii hoping to escape his bad memories and the pressures of the writing life. He likes Hawaii \\"because it [is] a void\\"--almost no one recognizes his name, and those who do have not read his books. He works as the manager of the Hotel Honolulu.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this fragmented book is shockingly mean-spirited in tone, going way beyond good-humored satire, and demeaning almost every aspect of Hawaii, its people, and its culture, while also taking pokes at some American icons. Virtually every woman in the book either is or has been a prostitute. All are dimwits. Even the narrator's wife is the product of a one-night stand between a Honolulu prostitute and John F. Kennedy, a man she supposedly never recognized in this most Democratic state. Hawaiian/Filipino girls are depicted as fair game, sexually, for their fathers, uncles, brothers, and other relatives.<br /><br />Hawaiians who speak pidgin among themselves are mocked and their language derided. When he uses Hawaiian words, Theroux sometimes deliberately misspells them. Fellow-author Stephen King also takes a hit here, Theroux saying, \\"it takes only a modest talent to write about misery.\\" In a particularly low blow, he comments on King's near-fatal accident by saying, \\"Gross reality [the accident] overwhelms his puerile and implausible fantasies.\\" This novel may have its virtues, but modesty, tolerance, and good taste are not among them.

In the title song, her choice of accompaniments--the low whistle, the electric bass, and drums--creates such an insistent beat and ominous background that when she plaintively sings of being \\"washed up on a distant shore,\\" the reader's sympathies are fully engaged.<br /><br />All of the songs here are laments, tragic narratives, or songs of hard work and the hope of survival, and all are in minor keys. Though some songs are in faster tempos and may have syncopations, these are not \\"uptempo\\" in mood. Casey stresses the displacement of the Irish, the poverty, and the need to \\"stay strong.\\" In various songs she emphasizes a life \\"full of hope but prone to grief,\\" states that \\"them that works hardest are the least provided,\\" and says, \\"We won't worry about the government, worry about the way to go.\\" \\"The Ballad of Tim Evans\\" tells about a man executed for murdering his wife and child, though he was innocent. \\"The Four Loom Weaver\\" tells of having \\"nowt to eat...I feel in my heart I'll soon starve.\\" And both \\"Distant Shore\\" and \\"Bata is Bothar\\" deal with the unhappiness of immigration.<br /><br />Casey's voice is at its most versatile in \\"Lord MacDonald's,\\" sung in Gaelic, as in rapid tempo her voice lightly dances up and down her range in a song with few pauses, the Gaelic refrain combining with drums for dramatic power. In the unusual love song \\"Quiet of the Night,\\" a mournful tune with a double bass, she becomes a person who decides to stay strong, a woman who \\"love[s] you in my heart because you let me be,\\" a particularly affecting concertina solo adding to the drama.

Pete Dexter's noir fiction brings California in the 1950s to dark and sinister life, as he presents two grim, but ironically humorous plots. Miller Packard, a police sergeant with an eye for easy cash, is a man who enjoys high stakes golf games and does not hesitate to associate with questionable playing partners and opponents when he's \\"on his game.\\" Packard is called to investigate a brutal double murder and rape aboard a boat in Newport Beach, a crime which echoes throughout the novel when he becomes involved with the young widow of the murdered man.<br /><br />Alternating with the story of Packard, his investigations, and his love life is the story of Lionel Walk, known as Train, an 18-year-old black caddy at the exclusive Brookline Country Club. Conscientious and anxious to do a good job, Train is at the mercy of the world, a young man with a good heart who never seems to catch a break, and Dexter is particularly effective in bringing him to life.<br /><br />Although Dexter remains faithful to the third person narrative, he tailors his language and points of view to the specific plots he is developing. The action at the golf courses involving Train's life is told from a caddy's-eye view and is described in a deceptively plain-spoken and ungrammatical style. The story line involving Packard is related in more grammatical terms, though Packard is earthy and often uncritical in his observations. The club members' rampant bigotry, casual cruelty, disrespect, and complete disregard for the feelings of the all-black caddy staff and grounds crew are reflected in scenes involving both Train and Packard, with vividly realized dialogue which stings and insults.<br /><br />Golfers will enjoy the lively accounts of games in which money changes hands, along with colorful descriptions of dress, mannerisms, and players' temperaments. A very fat player in pastel golf pants is described as having thighs that look like \\"children hiding in the curtains\\" when he walks. Exaggeration, absurdity, irony, and black humor fill every page. At times exciting, suspenseful, and darkly humorous, this novel is also brutal, violent, and pessimistic.<br /><br />Though Train and Packard both profit when their lives come together, no reader will be surprised by the outcome. As the author has made abundantly clear, the world is a \\"hungry place...and whatever kind of thing you is, there's something out there that likes to eat it.\\" Despite the fine writing, lively dialogue, unique descriptions, and oddball characters, some readers may be put off by this bleak view of life and human nature.

The Anglo-Welsh patriarch of an old family is dying in Llanelys, and his children and their spouses gather at the estate to await the end. Rose, the Irish wife of the oldest son Henry, is the sensible mother of twins who has worked to restore the estate and its gardens, make it a home, and, through her cooking, provide a sense of family warmth. In sardonic contrast to her is Angela, the oh-so-upperclass wife of the second son Michael, who looks down on Rose and everyone else not of the family's \\"class\\" and breeding. Arriving sometime later is the only daughter, Ermyn, young, schoolgirlish, and disturbed. Severely repressed and often ignored, she looks for answers in exotic religious expression, and like the sin eater of Welsh legend, believes she can take upon herself the sins of the Captain and the family.<br /><br />Ellis wields language like a rapier, skewering family members for their caste-conscious concern with their \\"blood,\\" and showing with mordant humor their deliberate separation from the community. The family is changing, if Rose, daughter of an Irish veterinarian, is any indication, just as Llanelys, now a tourist destination, has changed. But though the family may deserve to be satirized for its meaningless rituals, the local population is not exempt from Ellis's dissection, either. Phyllis, the caretaker for the Captain, saves the best of the family's food to feed her fat grandson, and he steals liquor and makes lewd, sexual overtures to Rose and Ermyn. Other townspeople mock the family, show their rudeness, and even break their windows.<br /><br />Stunning imagery, delicious turns of phrase, and lively dialogue make the narrative sparkle. The hands of Rose's small twins are described as \\"so delicate and fine they felt like broken toothpicks in little silk bags,\\" while the sea is \\"smooth and wrinkle-free, like the face of a saint or a psychopath.\\" Blood is carried as a motif throughout, and references to old Welsh legends connect the family with the past and offer dire portents of the future. Despite the harshness Ellis exhibits toward some of her characters, the reader develops empathy toward Rose and understands that poor Ermyn needs more emotional help than she is likely to get, but Ellis never allows the reader to get comfortable with this family's world. She shows that just as the sin eater cannot take on the sins of others, life has no guarantees of happy endings. Mary Whipplethe past and offer dire portents of the future.

The turbulent years of the early Reformation are the focus of this novel of ideas written by four young people who call themselves, jointly, \\"Luther Blissett.\\" Thomas Muntzer, a leader of the Anabaptists, believes that Martin Luther has become too close to the prince bishops, from whom he accepts protection, to be an effective leader. Gustav Metzger, the speaker, is one of Muntzer's followers, accompanying him during the trauma of the Peasants' Revolt (1524 - 26), which Luther opposes, and serving as an on-the-scene observer. When the revolt fails, villages are leveled, the rebels are put to the sword, and many of the leaders of the revolt are arrested, tortured, and then beheaded.<br /><br />The revolt fails, in part, because of a spy named Qoelet (Q), whose diaries and letters to Cardinal Gianpietro Carafa, reveal his duplicitous actions. As the Anabaptist speaker escapes from one bloody crisis after another, changing his name whenever he changes locations, Q tries to track him down and to counteract the increasingly dangerous effects of Protestantism. Each of the speaker's failures is related to Q's countermoves, as the speaker travels throughout Germany to Switzerland and the Low Countries, following the spread of ideas. Twenty-five years after surviving the Peasants' Revolt and vicious reprisals against the Reformation everywhere he travels, the speaker, now known as Tiziano Rinato (Titian), arrives in Venice with the financing he needs to distribute \\"heretical\\" pamphlets. He and Q finally meet for a showdown.<br /><br />The author's casual, slangy style, filled with profanities, conveys the frustration and trauma of these four-hundred-year old events in a language with which the contemporary reader can easily identify. United primarily through the beliefs of the Reformation, the novel is episodic and not particularly suspenseful because the tension between the speaker and Q is not strong. These men do not know each other, and neither the reader nor the speaker can see Q's maneuverings until after the fact.<br /><br />The complex events of the early Reformation have shaped the intellectual and historical destinies of western civilization, and the novel reflects this complexity, with the narrative alternating from 1555 to 1517 and from 1538 to 1527, and back. The reader must create his/her own timeline, though the events within each episode are clear. Filled with exciting, hair's-breadth escapes from disaster, fascinating and memorable depictions of (real) historical characters, insightfully presented intellectual conflicts, and dramatic events coming fast and furiously for over seven hundred pages, the novel is a rewarding adventure for the reader with a serious interest in the Reformation.

The first seventy pages of this huge, eloquent, and multi-layered novel require the reader's patience--it is not always clear, at first, who the characters are or exactly what they are doing. But patience is gloriously rewarded as the cadences of the characters' speech, with its street slang, odd syntax, natural poetry, and homespun aphorisms, combine with vibrant details of their everyday lives and eventually bring these \\"ordinary\\" folks to life in Dublin in 1915.<br /><br />On the eve of the Easter Rebellion, we meet Jim Mack and Doyler Doyle, two teenage boys who are trying to sort out who they are, emotionally, politically, and sexually. They get no help from home, where their fathers relive their memories of fighting for the British during the Boer War and where sex and the facts of life are never even hinted at. They get no help from their priests, who severely punish confessions of \\"the solitary sin,\\" while sometimes fondling their students. Secret revolutionary societies troll for members, and priests sometimes help them. Neither boy has close friends his own age. As naïve Jim gravitates toward the more street-wise Doyler, their friendship blossoms, they rejoice in each other's company, and they begin to try on roles for the future--Doyler finding an outlet with Irish rebels, and Jim considering a priestly vocation.<br /><br />It quickly becomes clear to the reader that this will be a gay coming-of-age story within the broader context of the Irish rebellion, and these two stories mesh seamlessly, with many obvious parallels. Quietly, without beating any drums or making any polemical statements, O'Neill allows his characters to discover their feelings for each other and their inborn nature, even as the political rebellion takes shape. O'Neill's characters are who they are, and he respects them and the reader too much to use them simply to prove a point. The parallels he draws between them and some of the famous leaders of the Irish rebellion, such as Roger Casement, and between them and the Sacred Band of Thebes are incidental to the story, though they do give a broader context to the gay relationship.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this engrossing novel was with the character of MacMurrough, an older \\"mentor\\" to both boys. MacMurrough is a sexual predator, at least at the beginning, a man guilty of violent rape in a graphic early scene which made me cringe. The fact that he is later depicted sympathetically, and to some extent heroically, remains a problem for me, an anomaly in what is otherwise a beautifully wrought novel.

The Feast of Love is a little like a multi-course meal, with a tongue-in-cheek appetizer to get you going immediately; some light, amusing scenes to work up your appetite for the main course; some real meat to the themes and major conflicts, which provide nourishment for the soul; and a sweet conclusion to make you satisfied and happy. I loved it.<br /><br />Baxter begins his novel as a character within the story, an insomniac writer named Charlie, who is walking late at night when he meets Bradley, another insomniac, on a park bench. When Bradley tells him how he should title his book, comments on a proposed opening sentence, and suggests the subject, \\"Charlie,\\" amusingly, follows his advice. As we learn of Bradley's love troubles, along with those of a wide variety of other characters of different ages and backgrounds, we gain clear insight into their personalities and motivations. Ultimately, we know not only who they are but what love is, not only for them but for ourselves--love in its most universal definitions and dimensions.<br /><br />Baxter wears his significant literary talents lightly, presenting scenes that often perplex their participants while the reader looks on with ironic, sometimes amused, detachment. But the reader empathizes with the characters at the same time that s/he observes them. Chloe,a young, punkish teenager who loves Oscar, a skinny former junkie, is a particularly memorable character--so finely and sympathetically drawn that many parents (and other fogies) may see teenage romance in an entirely new way. An elderly couple longing for their son, who has disappeared, shows the depths of parental love and provides a perfect, complete foil to Chloe and Oscar. Bradley and his wives, along with the lovers for whom they leave him, further illuminate the complexities of love and relationships, a reason some have described this book as a modern retelling of A Midsummer Night's Dream.<br /><br />Though some reviewers have called this novel \\"hilarious,\\" that term suggests a frivolity and superficiality that do not exist here. Instead, I found the book poignant, sometimes sad, and very moving--a view of love which communicates directly with the reader's heart.

Klaus Felsen, forced to work for the Nazi SS near the end of World War II, is sent to Portugal to buy as much wolfram (tungsten) as he can get, to be used in the manufacture of armor-piercing weapons. He is also responsible for privately smuggling out a great deal of German gold and some stolen art when it appears that Germany will lose the war, a job made more palatable when he realizes that he and his partners can profit greatly in the years after the war if they are careful to avoid discovery.<br /><br />All these details come into play when a young Portuguese girl, seemingly unconnected with any of this, is found murdered fifty years later in contemporary Lisbon. Inspector Ze Coelho is assigned to solve the mystery of her death, a death which eventually reverberates throughout Lisbon society, the &eacute;migr&eacute; population, the police department, the federal Justice department, political parties past and present, and even the foundations of the present government.<br /><br />If all this seems like a lot to take on, it is. Although the book is beautifully written with fully developed, imperfect, and quirky characters one grows to like and understand, fine and vivid description, and a fast-paced plot with something happening all the time, ultimately it is difficult to make all the connections required by the fifty year chronology of the plot. Although I worked hard at this, and thought I had succeeded as I approached the conclusion, the last twenty pages had me reviewing and revising everything I had previously observed about the possible motivations of the main characters. Surprising twists are expected in mysteries. This one takes complexity to new levels. Mary Whipple	2005-09-20

If you've never read an Irish novel, you'll love this book for its ability to distill the essence of the land and its people. If you love opera, melodrama, or soap opera, you'll love it for the passionate intensity of the characters. If you love language and poetry, you'll love it for its rich trove of vivid images. But if you are looking for a new vision of life in the Irish countryside, a set of characters different from the typical, devoutly family-oriented, self-sacrificing farm family, and a poetic style which is not described in terms of Joyce, Hopkins, Thomas, or Yeats, you may be a bit disappointed. It's an  enjoyable book, and it's full of passion, but it's not unique.<br /><br />When Mick Bugler arrives in the small town of his ancestors to claim his inheritance, his nearest neighbors are Joseph Brennan and his sister Breege. An expansive Australian with an insensitivity to his neighbor's deeply felt commitments to his farm, Mick invites the enmity which develops when he opportunistically pre-empts the fields Joe has rented over a long period of time and challenges him regarding ownership of land. The resentments come to a head when Joe senses and moves to prevent a relationship between Mick and Breege. Joe's history of mental instability, the arrival of Mick's possessive and almost equally unstable fiance, a jealous and meddlesome Crock, and a breakdown by Breege presage deep tragedies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is little recognition by Joe, Breege, or the townspeople here that they have any responsibility for or control over the ultimate outcome.  At the end of the book, all are still as irrationally motivated as they were at the beginning. None have taken charge of their lives, and there is no sense that anyone has learned anything significant. O'Brien could have used her setting and characters to more noble effect--raising this sad story to real significance, rather than just dramatic effect.

When Minnie Powell, a resident of a Dublin tenement, makes this ironic statement to Donal Davoren, who is visiting his friend Seumas Shields, she is assuming that this poet-visitor is an IRA gunman, in hiding. It is 1920, and the Irish battle for independence has begun. Minnie, Seumas, and the other residents of the tenement all side with the rebels, and while Donal never says that he is with the IRA, neither does he work very hard to convince the residents otherwise.<br /><br />Seumas, on the other hand, is actively involved with the rebels, using his work as a peddler of second-hand goods to make connections and carry information. Gunfire is constant at night, bombs go off, innocent citizens are killed, and the police raid neighborhood houses. During a disturbance that night, Minnie takes a bag of bombs, left under the bed by one of Seumas's friends, into her own room to protect Donal, to whom she is attracted, only to face the police in a raid.<br /><br />The first of Sean O'Casey's \\"Dublin Trilogy\\" to be produced (followed by Juno and the Paycock in 1924 and The Plough and the Stars in 1926), this 1923 play is the work of a gifted but still inexperienced playwright. Walking the tight line between the absurd/satiric and the violent/tragic, the play has lovely dialogue but relatively little action onstage. Visitors come and go in Shields's tenement room, but most of the play consists of witty remarks, poetic commentary, and the dialogue of daily life--until gunfire breaks out in the street.<br /><br />O'Casey establishes obvious contrasts between the poetry of Davoren and the grim reality of the \\"revolution,\\" between the elegantly poetic statements of the always-sleepy Shields and the brutality of the police, between the love which Minnie offers and the political hatreds which dominate their lives, and between the men who engage in the chess game of rebellion and the women who often make the sacrifices.

Author DeWitt performs scholarly acrobatics in this unique and energetic novel which never flags--and certainly never bores! Although DeWitt incorporates many esoteric subjects here--Japanese language, Greek verbs, Icelandic verse, Fourier's analysis, Arabic, astrophysics, and tournament chess, bridge, and piquet, among other things--she does this so entertainingly that they enhance, rather than obscure, the human story at the heart of the novel, even for readers like me with little interest in many of these subjects.<br /><br />Sybilla is the hard-working, single mother of Ludo, a 6-year-old genius who gobbles up even the most complicated subjects, seemingly overnight. Despite his precocity, however, Ludo is a very engaging and in many ways, typical, child, and the relationship between mother and son is mutually warm, respectful, and endearingly protective. Both Sybilla and Ludo are fans of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, and this forms the framework of the novel when Ludo decides to test seven fascinating and brilliant men Sybilla has known to see which, if any, of them might be his unknown father.<br /><br />This book has everything. It is funny and sad and disarming and challenging--simultaneously amusing and poignant, and thought-provoking. The many layers which emerge as Ludo engages in his quest should keep readers, critics, and book clubs intrigued and entertained for years. But the book is at heart an absorbing human story--of identity, of aspirations and achievement, and, ultimately, of the love and connection which makes our personal journeys worthwhile.

Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1997, this novel fulfills Pulitzer's requirement that this prize go to a book which studies the social, political, and MORAL conditions of the people.  Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer fulfills those requirements well, and gracefully, though it is not a grand novel or one in which the reader will become emotionally involved with the characters and plot.<br /><br />The novel is a parable, a relatively short narrative with a moral lesson about American dreams and their importance, even when the implementation of these dreams fails.  Martin Dressler, living near the turn of the century, is a shopkeeper's son who dreams of becoming a giant of industry.  Like many other immigrants, he believes that if you dream high enough and work hard enough, that you will succeed.  Unlike many others of his day, however, Martin recognizes the need of an entrepreneur to create and sell new dreams to the public, one of the reasons for his success.  Bubbles burst, however, usually because of pride, and Martin is not immune to these changes of fortune.<br /><br />The narrative pacing is quick, the plot is not complex, and the author's style is simple.  The reader never really identifies with Martin or feels that his character develops beyond the few traits which illustrate the message of the book. \\"Message novels\\" are notoriously difficult for adults to enjoy, but Millhauser wants us to think about the American dream itself more closely, and he does this through the beautifully written, fast-paced story of success and failure.

In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate.<br /><br />When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to a much older widower, Henry Wilcox, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"<br /><br />Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's staid pronouncements and failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims. When a young clerk finds himself out of his bank job as a result of something Henry has said, Henry refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.<br /><br />Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on others. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, must try to educate a close-minded dolt like Henry, but she achieves only limited success. Later, his belief that Helen reflects negatively upon himself and his family inspires a disaster with far-reaching consequences.<br /><br />Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry.  With the action centered around the Wilcox home at Howard's End, the reader realizes that the estate is a microcosm for the conflicts of the nation.<br /><br />This edition, thoroughly annotated, is the definitive critical edition containing resource material and an explication of references.

Imagine, for a moment, that western civilization not only did not evolve as we know it today, but that, in fact, it never existed at all. This intriguing speculation is the underlying premise of a novel which forces the reader to rethink all the assumptions with which we habitually evaluate the past--the \\"givens\\" through which we interpret events. Robinson presupposes that virtually all the inhabitants of Europe were wiped out by a plague in the fourteenth century and the continent left uninhabited. But this was not the end of the world, nor was it the end of learning and \\"progress.\\" Life continued, but all the intellectual developments arose out of the Muslim states, China, India, and eventually the North America of the Native Americans.<br /><br />Alternating workman-like prose with prose \\"poems\\" and, occasionally, stories and legends, Robinson crafts a fast-paced history of a different world, creating two characters who appear and reappear in different incarnations from 783 a. H. (after Hegira), roughly the late 14th century, to the present day. Keeping basically the same personalities, regardless of their incarnations, Bold Bardash (Bihari, Bistami, Butterfly, Bahram, etc.) and Kyu (Kokila, Kya, Katima, Kheim, etc.) travel through time, experiencing life under the Mongols, Indians, early Chinese emperors, Muslim leaders, and Japanese sailors during their discovery of the New World.<br /><br />Some episodes are much more vivid, and ultimately more enlightening, than others, and as the cultures are brought to life, along with their different views of man's place in the universe, Robinson shows how the desire to impose one's own religion or beliefs on the outside world is the basis of some of the cruelest violence throughout history. Ultimately, the Great War, lasting sixty-seven years and costing one billion lives, pits the rulers of Dar al-Islam against the Travancori League (India), China, and the Hodenosaunee League (Native America).<br /><br />While it is intriguing to contemplate alternative history, Robinson's goal--the alternative history of the entire world for the past six hundred years is an enormous subject, one which, because of its breadth and scope seems to lose focus and pace as the book progresses. And while the reincarnations of Bold and Kyu help to bridge many gaps and avoid some problems of character development, the device becomes a bit tired by the end. Still, in showing us how all aspects of our current knowledge might have developed in other societies if western civilization had not existed, Robinson goes a long way toward reducing intellectual arrogance and increasing empathy for other cultures. Despite the book's limitations, Robinson succeeds in creating an alternative history which offers much food for thought and considerable narrative excitement.

It is 334 B.C., and Memnon of Rhodes, a mercenary, has been appointed Governor of Lower Asia by King Darius of Persia. Memnon's mission is to prevent Alexander the Great of Macedon from taking the important Persian city of Halicarnassus as easily as he has taken other Persian cities in his southward march through Asia Minor. With vivid sense imagery and a keen eye for detail, Doherty brings color and drama to the maneuvering by both sides as they get ready for the siege of Halicarnassus, a city of strategic importance, which overlooks the Aegean and the Greek islands.<br /><br />Using primary sources for much of his research, Doherty recreates the story of this ferocious and bloody battle. Ignoring the lofty, epic rhetoric of classic battles, he chooses instead a conversational tone, creating a sense of urgency and rapid movement in the narrative which matches the speed and drama of the action. His research, however serious it might be, is fully integrated into an exciting story, not imposed upon it, and gives a sense of harsh reality to events. His characters on both sides are memorable despite their large number, and his stunning descriptions of costume, customs, weaponry, and the frenzy of battle keep the reader almost breathless with anticipation.<br /><br />While the battle rages, both sides try to decipher a mysterious manuscript by Pythias, the architect of the walls around Halicarnassus, in which he supposedly reveals a secret weakness in the walls and the location of a treasure. Scribes and cryptographers work non-stop, the breaking of the code providing an underlying motive for a series of murders which take place within the battle drama. The murder mystery adds intrigue and excitement to the historical setting, but it is the siege itself, and the details of the war, which really bring the narrative to life. Catapults turning men and horses into torches, and the euthanasia of wounded men and horses convey the brutality of warfare, while the formality of movements and the parades of warriors in battle dress show the choreography within this brutality. In this testament of one of Alexander's most ferocious battles, the reader sees that though he can be brutal and quixotic, \\"Alexander has a genius. He seems to have been touched by fortune.\\" Mary Whippleof movements and the parades of warriors in battle dress show the choreography within this brutality.

Set in the summer of 1900, when the hopes and dreams for the century were as yet untarnished by two world wars and subsequent horrors, this novel is quietly elegant in style, its emotional upheavals restrained, and its 12-year-old main character, Leo Colston, so earnest, hopeful, and curious about life that the reader cannot help but be moved by his innocence.<br /><br />Leo's summer visit to a friend at Brandham Hall introduces him to the landed gentry, the privileges they have assumed, and the strict social behaviors which guide their everyday lives. Bored and wanting to be helpful when his friend falls ill, Leo agrees to be a messenger carrying letters between Marian, his host's sister, and Ted Burgess, her secret love, a farmer living nearby. Catastrophe is inevitable--and devastating to Leo. In descriptive and nuanced prose, Hartley evokes the heat of summer and the emotional conflicts it heightens, the intensity rising along with the temperature. Magic spells, creatures of the zodiac, and mythology create an overlay of (chaste) paganism for Leo's perceptions, while widening the scope of Hartley's focus and providing innumerable parallels and symbols for the reader.<br /><br />The emotional impact of the climax is tremendous, heightened by the author's use of three perspectives--Leo Colston as a man in his 60's, permanently damaged by events when he was 12; Leo as a 12-year-old, wrestling with new issues of class, social obligation, friendship, morality, and love, while inadvertently causing a disaster; and the reader himself, for whom hindsight and knowledge of history create powerful ironies as he views these events and the way of life they represent. Some readers have commented on Leo's unrealistic innocence in matters of sex, even as a 12-year-old, but this may be a function of age. For those of us who can remember life without TV and the computer, it is not so far-fetched to imagine a life in which \\"mass communication\\" meant the telegraph and in which \\"spooning\\" was an adults-only secret.

This is a quintessentially British mystery, old-fashioned, and reminiscent in plot style to Agatha Christie, with a murder and all the action taking place inside a closed community. One of the priests or ordinands within a small, remote, High Church seminary must have committed a murder, or two, or three. Commander Adam Dalgliesh, who spent several summers at St. Anselm's as a boy, returns to investigate the death of the young son of an extremely wealthy man, and in short order, additional deaths occur.<br /><br />A Rogier van der Weyden altarpiece, a treasure trove of ecclesiastical silver, Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and other priceless art objects owned by the about-to-be-closed seminary, provide a possible financial motive for murder, while an incestuous relationship, a secret marriage, a paralyzing fear of the future, and even pedophilia by a much-loved priest are among the psychological motives.<br /><br />Politeness and \\"civilized\\" behavior play a greater role here than they do in many, more \\"modern\\" mysteries. There is no graphic sex, no profanity, and no scenes of violence--just the effects of the violence. We see the priests and ordinands only within their circumscribed lives, and there are no scenes that suggest that any of them have any sense of humor or any real need for fun. Although James conveys enough psychological astuteness that her characters do not feel flat, there are at least eight or ten who could have committed the murder and for whom very substantial background information is given.<br /><br />The reader must follow all of them, along with an equally large number of red herrings, for four hundred pages before the plot is resolved, somewhat anticlimactically. That, combined with maddeningly detailed, physical descriptions of the rooms of the seminary, made this a four-star experience for me, rather than five-star.  Mary Whipple	2005-09-19

In this stunning play, set in a holding room Vichy, France, in 1942, Arthur Miller introduces nine men who have been picked up on suspicion that they are Jews or Jewish sympathizers. As they are called, one by one, to be interrogated by Nazi officials before being released or put on the thirty-car freight train waiting at the station, they reveal their thinking, their rationalizations for having been picked up, and their belief that this is all a big mistake. A German major involved in the interrogations also begins to question his own role, reminding his colleague, a professor in charge of carrying out Nazi racial policies, that he is a \\"line officer,\\" not trained for his role.<br /><br />Waiting to be questioned are an actor, a waiter, a businessman, a psychoanalyst, a Marxist railroad worker, a gypsy, an ancient Hasid, a fourteen-year-old boy, and an Austrian prince. As they talk and begin to share bits of information, Miller examines the tendency of ordinary men, who are often victims, to become immobilized when faced with \\"an atrocity...that is inconceivable,\\" to refuse to believe that such behavior can possibly happen in a civilized world. At the same time, he also examines those others, the Nazis and their collaborators in France, who serve an ideology, not mankind, those who subordinate themselves so completely to an abstract concept that they believe \\"there are no persons anymore.\\"<br /><br />As the truth about the waiting train and its destination slowly emerges, the sense of dread becomes palpable. The psychoanalyst, trying to rouse people to overpower the single guard on duty, cannot make his fellow captives understand that it is their belief that the world is essentially rational that keeps them from acting, and that the Nazis count on this belief. Pivotal to the action is von Berg, the young Austrian prince, a Christian who left his property and thousand-year-old heritage to escape to France, a man whose heart is in the right place but who does not understand that he himself must accept complicity in the rise of the Nazis.<br /><br />Beautifully paced, the play is an unusually sophisticated treatment of this subject. Miller does not see events purely in black and white, showing instead that everyone creates his own reality to keep from accepting the unthinkable. Written in 1964, while Miller was representing the New York Herald Tribune at the Frankfurt war crimes trials of officials from Auschwitz/Birkenau, this play is Miller's creative reaction to the atrocities he has heard first-hand--and one of his most powerful plays.

Though these words are spoken by a priest, they could have been spoken by any of the bored and guilt-ridden characters of this novel, all of whom are at loose ends, uncertain whether their lives have any meaning at all to anyone. Bernard Leverson, a music examiner, is bored with his wife, telling her, \\"After twenty years of marriage, you feel as if you're the same sex.\\" She, in turn, is having a tepid affair with a neighbor, engaging in \\"the humdrum routine of deceiving their partners, not out of love but boredom.\\"<br /><br />The Leversons' fourteen-year-old son, craving genuine feeling and communication, instead sees indifference and seeks excitement in shop-lifting and misbehavior. Nuns in the local convent and priests at the local church perform the routine requirements of their vocations, sometimes without genuine feelings of commitment. Other characters atone for \\"sins\\" committed long in the past, wasting their present lives in the fruitless search for personal absolution.<br /><br />Winner of the 1965 Miles Franklin Award for Best Australian Novel of the Year, The Slow Natives is Thea Astley at her most thoughtful and complex. In compressed language and sparkling dialogue, she explores the meaning of love in all its permutations, along with the \\"sin\\" and \\"guilt\\" so often associated with it. Unique and witty descriptions abound: A monsignor's soul, \\"doily-neat, had scalloped edges of predictable pattern\\"; two men lunching at an inn notice the dining room \\"filled up with crustaceans--varnished hard-jawed mums and small-bit farmers coated with the same malty staleness\\"; and one woman, annoyed at another, snaps, \\"You know what they used to call [you] at school? Alma Martyr!\\"<br /><br />As her characters interact and overlap, affecting each other's lives, though not necessarily inspiring their love, Astley evokes genuine feeling for them, allowing her readers to empathize with them. The humor for which she is so often lauded is subordinated here--she does not poke fun at these sad, often earnest, and very \\"normal\\" people.

When John Proctor says these words to his wife Elizabeth at the conclusion of this play, he has faced accusations of being in league with the Devil and is ready to face consequences meted out by the religious tribunal he has faced. Though he has sinned by committing adultery with Abigail Williams, he believes the witchcraft trials which have ultimately consumed him to be the result of human, rather than godly, forces. Playwright Arthur Miller sets the scene for this action in an Overture explaining the theocracy which controlled Salem. Powerful clergymen, some more rigid in their interpretations of Scripture than others, \\"protected\\" citizens by enforcing conformity with the church's teachings.<br /><br />Through detailed character sketches inserted into the structure of the play, Miller broadens the realism, and when a group of hysterical young women makes accusations of witchcraft, resulting ultimately in the deaths of nineteen of their fellow-citizens, Miller has prepared his audience to accept the trials and the behavior of the characters as plausible. His straightforward prose, use of homely details, and simple sentence structure (despite its archaic tone) further add to the realism. When the affair between John Proctor and Abigail Williams, who precipitates and then promotes the hysteria among the young \\"afflicted\\" girls, is revealed within the play, the modern reader is given a \\"hook\\" with which to identify with characters and situations which might otherwise feel foreign.<br /><br />Miller's play is a powerful revelation of themes involving mass hysteria, fear of the unknown, and a belief in the essential evil hidden within the hearts of men. As the accused are required to prove their innocence, questions regarding the role of individualism within this society, its intolerance of differences, its justice as defined by the state and by clergymen who differ, and the hysteria which grows from repression all surface within the dramatic action, leading to an intensity of feeling rare in modern theater. When John Proctor is faced with a choice of telling the truth and being sentenced to death or lying and being saved, the ironies of the play are fully revealed.<br /><br />Written in 1952, slightly before the McCarthy era, Miller's depiction of these trials presages the McCarthy hearings and illustrates his belief that the fear of Communism is the equivalent of fear of the Devil in colonial times. Miller, however, has selected facts which illustrate his point of view and his themes, making no pretense of accuracy regarding the witchcraft trials themselves.

The Body Artist is one of the strangest--and most seductive--books I've read in a long time, a \\"ghost story\\" with a character who is described as if he were real, and whom the main character believes to be real, and who may, in fact, be real--but who may also be a figment of imagination. Events which are described as real may be fantasies, and even the relationships the main character has or has had with people who seem to be real may, in fact, be colored by wishful thinking. Ultimately, even the linear progression of the narrative itself is called into question since, DeLillo tells us, \\"Past, present, and future are not amenities of language.\\"<br /><br />The story begins with the intimately described minutiae of breakfast, as a couple, married just a short time, gets ready for the day. We learn that it takes two cycles on the toaster to get the bread the right color, that the cup is his and the paper is hers, that a blue jay comes to the bird feeder, that she puts soya on her cereal and that it smells like feet. When Rey Robles, the husband, dies later that day (something we know from the beginning), the world of the wife, Lauren Hartke, changes from one of communication and an outward focus to a world of grief and an inward focus. When she discovers a stranger living on the third floor of her rented house, we aren't sure whether he is real or whether he materializes to show Lauren's unresolved feelings about her loss and the depth of her trauma. The stranger, dubbed Mr. Tuttle, is handicapped, unable to understand or communicate in language in any traditional way.<br /><br />Fascinating in its focus on internal action, the reader must ultimately just accept the story for what it is while enjoying the glories of the meticulous prose, the acutely felt portrait of a woman grieving, the suggested symbolism in birds and nature, and the author's depiction of the ambiguities and uncertainties of life and time. This is a work which uses language in new ways, ultimately even calling into question the use of language itself to make sense of the world. Like Lauren, DeLillo himself is a performance artist.

T. S. Eliot's bleak vision of the future doesn't even begin to include the gloomy prognostications revealed in this book. That terrorists will either acquire or develop biological weapons capable of destroying all human life is not just a possibility, it's a probability, as Preston makes abundantly clear in this update on biological weapons development. This book is the ultimate wake-up call. Even if you want to sleep after reading this, you may not be able to.<br /><br />Of the several biological weapons which have been under development in the past twenty-five years, smallpox is by far the most lethal and contagious, and irresponsible scientists have genetically engineered it in the past few years to make vaccination useless against it. Antidotes are unknown because humans are the only hosts for smallpox, and there is no way to run a test study of their efficacy. Preston points out, \\"It has taken the world twenty years to reach roughly fifty million cases of AIDS. [A single case of smallpox in an unprotected population] can reach that point in ten to twenty weeks.\\"<br /><br />A massive research and development program for weapons grade smallpox and plague, along with the MIRV missiles and warheads to deliver them abroad, continued, unknown and unmonitored, in the Soviet Union for twenty years after smallpox was officially eradicated in 1978. The whereabouts of the twenty tons of \\"hot,\\" genetically altered smallpox are currently unknown. According to a defecting Russian scientist, even the Soviet researchers do not know where it went, but \\"they think it went to North Korea.\\" Iran and Iraq are also believed to have \\"benefited\\" from this research and to have ongoing, active bioweapons research programs.<br /><br />Preston's focus on the people who are actively fighting potential biological terrorism in this country gives a human face to this frightening prospect, while his descriptions of the individuals who fought for their lives in the world's last cases of smallpox make the horror an all too vivid reality. His analysis of the anthrax outbreak last year, and the delivery systems which make possible such outbreaks of anthrax, Ebola, and plague are enlightening. Forcing the reader to acknowledge the reality of a new kind of war, one more lethal and uncontrollable than ever before in history, Preston illuminates the tenuous nature of human life in the twenty-first century.

One would hope a book written about race relations thirty years ago would be irrelevant and possibly dated today. Unfortunately, Keneally's stunning indictment of turn-of-the-century racism, in this case that of Anglo settlers towards Australia's native aborigines, remains vibrant and powerful, even after these many years. Literally timeless in its message and articulate and graceful in its execution, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith could have been written about many minorities subjugated during many periods in many different countries.<br /><br />The basic story is not unique. Half aborigine and half Anglo, Jimmie Blacksmith grows up in aborigine culture. Because he is light-skinned, however, he is able to obtain jobs on white landholdings more readily than other aborigines, and there he is exposed to Anglo culture--with all its stated, good intentions, but its sometimes patronizing attitudes and selfish goals. After being worked hard and cheated from his earnings repeatedly, Jimmie snaps, visiting on his former employers the kind of fatal \\"justice\\" which has so often been dealt to the aborigines. As vigilantes and police join forces to apprehend Jimmie, we see all the conflicting attitudes toward life and justice which undermine the creation of a unified, fair society.<br /><br />The throbbing drumbeat of Jimmie's chants and Keneally's insistent narrative pace combine with our revulsion toward Jimmie's actions, to catch us up in the emotions of both the pursuers and the pursued. Our understanding of Jimmie and our empathy with him make us long for his redemption at the same time that we are anxious for justice to take place. Keneally's resolution is brilliant, fittingly combining the best elements of both of Jimmie's worlds. This is a wonderful novel which deals with a complex and sensitive subject without polemics or convenient, easy solutions, and it's as relevant today as it was when it was written.

Writing in the style of hard-boiled mystery writers such as Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett, Bradbury sets his story in Venice, California, in 1949, presenting as his main character a 27-year-old struggling writer, much like himself. Returning to Venice late one night on the last trolley from Los Angeles, he finds himself alone in the car, except for a mysterious, alcohol-fumed vagrant, who whispers in his ear, \\"Death is a lonely business.\\" Convinced that he has met \\"Death's friend,\\" the speaker gets \\"chicken skin,\\" which gets worse when, upon arriving in Venice, he glances into an old canal and discovers, inside an abandoned lion cage, a body bobbing up and down on the tides.<br /><br />The city of Venice in 1949 is a place for the down-and-out, its pier and amusement park crumbling, its rollercoaster lying on its side \\"like the bones of a vast dinosaur,\\" old animal cages abandoned in the canals and filled with fish, and the oil pumps looking like \\"great pterodactyls\\" as they creak and groan. Inhabited by \\"the lonelies,\\" old people with no futures, Venice is a dark and dismal place in those final days before the pier is demolished. Bradbury's hypnotic descriptions of this decrepitude provide dramatic contrasts with the young speaker who still has hopes, dreams, and a future.<br /><br />With veteran detective Elmo Crumley as his mentor, the speaker tries to save lives and outwit a mysterious stalker, as more and more sad, old people meet their deaths. Hollywood performers, an opera singer, a lady who once raised canaries, a tarot card reader, an inept barber who knew Scott Joplin, and the owner of an old cinema all contribute to the color, atmosphere, and action in this unusual story of people and places which have outlived their usefulness.<br /><br />Bradbury's writing, as always, is witty, descriptive, imaginative, and atmospheric. These separate elements do not seem to jell into a coherent whole, however. The speaker and Crumley are supposed to be \\"hard-boiled,\\" but their genuine tenderness and naivete work at cross-purposes with the sometimes gruesome deaths they investigate. Unlike the classic detectives, they seem to care more about the sad, old residents than they do about catching the killer.<br /><br />Elements of the supernatural impinge upon the realism, and the reader is not always sure whether strange events should be taken literally or figuratively. When the killer is finally identified, it's almost an anti-climax, since s/he is less developed and far less interesting than the victims. Ultimately, it's the inherent \\"niceness\\" of Bradbury's characters and his clear belief in life's hopefulness which work to undermine the drama and fear engendered by the bizarre murders.

The bloody Siege of Krishnapur in 1857 is the pivot around which the action revolves in this Booker Award-winning novel by J. G. Farrell, but Farrell's focus is less on Krishnapur and the siege than it is on the attitudes and beliefs of the English colonizers who made that siege an inevitability. He puts these empire-builders under the microscope, then skewers their arrogant and superior attitudes with the rapier of his wit, subjecting them to satire and juxtaposing them and their narrowly focused lives against the realities of the world around them. Remarkably, he does this with enough subtlety that we can recognize his characters as individuals, rather than total stereotypes, at the same time that we see their absurdity and recognize the damage they have done in their zeal to spread their \\"superior\\" culture.<br /><br />From the opening pages, Farrell builds suspense as the English colony ignores reports of unrest in Barrackpur, Berhampur, and Meerut. The flirtations of the single women, the amorous attentions of the young men, the boorish and insensitive behavior of the officials, the gossipy whispering of their wives, and the unrelenting efforts to maintain the same society they enjoyed at home--with tea parties, poetry readings, and dances--all attest to their degree of isolation from the world around them.<br /><br />When violence breaks out in Krishnapur and all the inhabitants take refuge in the colonial Residence, Farrell turns it into a microcosm which illuminates their misplaced values and goals as they interact with each other and face dangers from without--and from within. The siege continues for more than three months, with bloodshed, disease, starvation, lack of water and medicine, and the summer weather taking their toll.<br /><br />Farrell's dark humor is unparalleled. Using irony, understatement, and a sense of the absurd, he conveys his disapproval of colonialism without resorting to the harshness of polemics. By concentrating exclusively on the English in the Residence and not on India's local population (ironically reflecting the approach of the colonizers themselves), he makes their behavior appear ridiculous in its own right, rather than ridiculous in comparison to other cultures. Mr. Rayne, the Opium Agent, calls the sale of opium, \\"progress.\\" The Padre cannot understand why the Bible was originally written in an obscure language like Hebrew, rather than English, which is \\"spoken in every corner of every continent.\\" A dying man offering up his last, heartfelt prayer is told by the Magistrate, \\"Yes, yes, to be sure, don't worry about it.\\" The heads from a collection of small sculptures of the \\"great minds of Europe\\" are used as deadly explosives when shot becomes scarce.<br /><br />Through his precise imagery, his acute eye for memorable and revealing details, his unerring ear for dialogue, his ability to maintain pace and suspense, and his humor, Farrell creates a historical novel with the enduring qualities which make it as relevant today as it was when published thirty years ago.

Alice Thomas Ellis is a constantly surprising author with seemingly unlimited talents, one who carefully tailors her style to her subject matter. Completely confident and controlled, she has no need to show off all her skills in every novel, and it is only by reading many of them that one notices her remarkable versatility and truly appreciates the magnitude of her individual talents. In this novel she subordinates her always sparkling dialogue to the main character's ironic interior monologues and a more thoughtful analysis of her themes, the relationship between love, death, and God. In the process she creates a sad and confused character with whom the reader develops enormous sympathy.<br /><br />Margaret is a young woman planning her wedding to a much older, very boring man whom she does not love, \\"someone who meant to [her] as little as his mother's dog,\\" believing that she \\"deserved nothing better.\\" Very gradually, the author reveals Margaret's past in Egypt six months before, a time in which she fell in love irrevocably with someone she \\"loved more than [her] immortal soul.\\" Now she is back in England, under the control of her mother, who had controlled her life \\"until about half a year ago, when I so briefly lived my own [life]and...destroyed it.\\" Her mother's friend Lili, a free spirit married to an artist, becomes the first person who offers Margaret a more positive and pro-active view of life, if only she will accept the \\"truths\\" Lili has gleaned during her own chaotic life.<br /><br />Clothing imagery pervades the novel, with Lili believing, metaphorically, that \\"clothes are the person,\\" while Margaret wonders if the elderly have minds like old wardrobes, \\"stuffed to overflowing with useless memories,\\" which they can take out and look at and question. As clothing, both real and symbolic, is discussed in relation to the wedding, the associated memories come out of the \\"wardrobe\\" and reveal the characters' attitudes toward life, love, and even the grace of God. As Margaret's sojourn in Egypt is more fully revealed through her own memories, the reader becomes acutely aware of the contrasts between her naïve view of the world and that of her mother and her mother's friends, who while equally naïve in many respects, are also less thoughtful.

Gary Kinder's spell-binding story of the search for the SS Central America, a sidewheel steamer which left Panama in 1857 and went down in the Atlantic while carrying gold from California (then valued at over $2 million), is actually three narratives, all of them fascinating.  First person accounts by some of the survivors tell of the ship's journey, the hurricane which suddenly arose in the Atlantic, and the frantic efforts of crew and passengers to keep the engines fired and the ship afloat.  Touching love stories revealed in these accounts give human faces to the drama, as women and children were put into lifeboats while their husbands stayed with the ship.<br /><br />These survivor accounts alternate with the account of the life of young Tommy Thompson, a phenomenally inventive child who grew up in Ohio, studied engineering, became fascinated by the challenges of underwater engineering, and eventually worked for famed treasure hunter Mel Fisher, learning what kinds of equipment were needed, but then unavailable, to explore the depths.  In the early 1980s, Thompson, more interested in research than in treasure, decided to search for the SS Central America, with the backing of a group he convinced to underwrite his expedition.  As the ship was thought to be in eight thousand feet of water, deeper than had ever been explored, Thompson would succeed only if he could design the necessary equipment.<br /><br />The third story is of the search for the ship itself, a search which had two false starts before the site was finally located.  Kinder develops almost unbearable tension as he describes how Thompson has to fend off rivals who were \\"treasure hunters,\\" rather than scientists.  Thompson's experimentation with equipment, the comprehensive documentation of the site through photographs and film, the legal battles for the rights to the salvage, and the final recovery of \\"treasure\\" ranging from gold bars and coins to beautifully preserved suitcases of clothing are vividly portrayed.<br /><br />A book with appeal to historians, engineers, marine scientists, adventurers, and all who pursue dreams, Kinder brings the entire recovery process to life, honoring the efforts and heroism of the Central America's Captain Herndon, the indomitable spirit of Thompson as he developed unique robots and equipment to explore the ocean at depths of over a mile, and the scientific commitment, rather than treasure-hunting, which inspired Thompson, his crew, and his backers, the Columbus-America Discovery Group.  Gripping, and filled with the wonder of discovery, this is non-fiction at its most exciting best.

When the Germans finally retreated from Belarus in the summer of 1944, almost twelve hundred Jewish survivors of the Holocaust shocked the world by materializing from the forest where they had lived in hiding during the German occupation. Tuvia, Asael, and Zus Bielski, three brothers, had managed to establish a well-organized community in the forest which lasted for almost three years, protecting hundreds of Jewish citizens while wreaking havoc on their German occupiers. Author Peter Duffy places this extraordinary story of survival in context by describing the Bielskis' lives and achievements, quoting from Tuvia Bielski's previously unknown journal, and revealing the sociopolitical history, including the anti-Semitism, of Belarus, a region south of Lithuania.<br /><br />In establishing their forest community, open to all Jews, the Bielskis had to fight \\"wars\\" on four fronts: the immediate threat from the Germans and the local police; the danger from local peasants and collaborators; the suspicions of Soviet partisans who questioned whether the Bielskis were sufficiently dedicated to their cause; and most of all, internal dissension. This was no \\"utopian community of enlightened democratic and egalitarian governance,\\" and many readers may cringe at the extremes to which the leadership occasionally resorted in order to eliminate dissension.<br /><br />At its height, the forest village consisted of long, camouflaged dugouts for sleeping, a large kitchen, mill, bakery, bathhouse, tannery, school, jail, theater, and two medical facilities. Tailors, seamstresses, shoemakers, watchmakers, carpenters, mechanics, and experts in demolition provided the 1200-member community with necessary skills, and about sixty cows and thirty horses provided food and transportation. Many of the men served as part of the armed contingent which secured food and engaged in sabotage and the murder of Germans officials.<br /><br />By concentrating on one family and its life during the war, Duffy creates a powerful documentary about Jewish life. Breaking the narrative into six-month installments, he details the progress of the war throughout the region, relentlessly revealing cold statistics--the thousands of people killed in a single ghetto in a single day. As the numbers mount, the reader's horror at the immense scale of the genocide grows, the victims' utter helplessness becomes obvious, and the reader's amazement at the Bielskis' achievement increases. None of the Bielski brothers ever received public recognition for these heroic efforts, and Duffy's attempts to rectify this historical omission by telling their story will resonate with readers.

Jasper Fforde has a rich imagination that moves in wacky directions, an off-the-wall sense of humor that never quits, and a deep knowledge and love of literature which give shape and substance to this hilarious \\"thing\\" he's created. Not really a mystery, sci-fi thriller, satire, or fluffy fantasy, this wild rumpus contains elements of all these but feels like a completely new genre. Fforde combines \\"real\\" people from the \\"historically challenged\\" world of his plot with characters from classic novels, adding dollops of word play, irony, literary humor, satire--and even a dodo bird--just for spice.<br /><br />With \\"real\\" characters who can stop time or travel back and forth in it, hear their own names (the names here are really terrific!) from 1000 yards away, appear in duplicate before themselves to give advice, travel inside books, and change the outcome of history, the reader journeys through Fforde's looking glass into a different and far more literary universe than the one we know. Thursday Next, a SpecOp-27 in the Literary Detective Division of Special Operations, is looking for Acheron Hades, who has stolen the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit and killed one of the characters in it, thereby changing the story forever. Thursday and the Literatecs are trying to prevent him from getting inside Jane Eyre and committing further murders.<br /><br />If you have not read Jane Eyre recently, your pleasure in this book will be greatly enhanced if you look up a brief plot summary on-line before proceeding too far--the ending of Jane Eyre as we know it is different from the ending of Jane Eyre as Thursday Next knows it, and the differences themselves become a delightful part of this plot. Though some readers seem to feel that the book would benefit from a bit of pruning in order to strengthen its conclusion, that suggestion seems to me to be too much like Acheron Hades changing Martin Chuzzlewit or Jane Eyre--if you do that, something is irreparably lost--and this book is so much fun that I'd hate to lose even a single word!

These were the strange last words spoken by Helen Stoner's twin sister Julia as she lay, collapsed and dying, just two weeks before her wedding. Helen has approached Sherlock Holmes because her stepfather, Grimesby Roylott, owner of a decrepit old manse, has moved her into her sister's room just a month before her own wedding, saying her own room needs \\"repairs.\\" Now some of the strange, night-time events which mystified her sister just before her death are occurring again. Strange, low whistles occurring around 3:00 a.m., Roylott's baboon and cheetah prowling freely in the dark, a band of gypsies camping on the property, and mysterious clangings have left Helen terrified.<br /><br />The appearance of Roylott at Holmes's Baker Street residence, where he threatens Holmes physically and bends a fire poker in half to show his strength, make Holmes even more determined to help Helen to protect herself from this maniac. After Watson and Holmes gain admittance to Helen's quarters one night, they make additional observations--a bell pull which is not attached to any wiring, a new ventilator, a sound like a steam valve, and a bed that is anchored to the floor. How could all these weird observations be related \\"the speckled band\\"?<br /><br />As always, the melodrama of events is set into sharp relief by Holmes's rational deductions. Doyle's well known ability to build suspense by capitalizing on the fears of his characters (and his readers), his use of vivid dialogue, his imaginative descriptions, and the quick pace of the action make this story compelling reading. The real mystery is not who killed Julia Stoner (and threatens Helen), but how the murder took place, and in this respect \\"Speckled Band\\" is one of Doyle's most elaborately constructed and most fascinating stories. Reputed to have been Doyle's own favorite story, it is the only mystery which Doyle himself adapted successfully for the stage. Mary Whipple	2005-09-19

Maurice Shadbolt, a New Zealander, has written a stirring novel of the mid-19th century wars there between the indigenous Maori and the British army and colonists who were determined to deprive them of their land and heritage. In fast-paced prose and thoroughly involving scenes of both warfare and domestic life among the Maori, Shadbolt recreates the tragic and bloody battles which took the lives of thousands of British and countless numbers of outgunned and outmanned Maori.<br /><br />Shadbolt is terrific in recreating scenes in which the war strategies and ensuing battles of the real Maori leader Titokowaru come horrifically to life. Through the eyes of Kimball Bent, also a real person, we see the body count rise, feel the privations and hardships of the Maori, understand the ferocity of the British officers, long for the safety of innocent wives and children, and sympathize with the Maori fight for self-preservation. Bent, an American from Maine, was dragooned by the British and defected both to help the Maori and to wreak his vengeance against sadistic British officers.<br /><br />What seems so strange to me (especially after just completing Potiki by the Maori writer Patricia Grace) is that, except when they are warring, the Maori here feel like caricatures. I almost gave up on the book in the first 50 pages or so because it seemed so Monty Pythonesque--Maori wearing black suits and bowler hats, carrying walking sticks, and using British slang and obscenities, all the while muttering wry and sardonic comments on history, religion, and the current state of affairs a la John Cleese. While there probably were some Maori who did become acculturated by the British, the satirical attitude with which they are depicted as a group just doesn't seem to jibe with the respect one feels for them in the face of their desperation and the years-long dedication with which they faced their foes in warfare.

For Mma Ramotswe, people and their relationships are paramount, and she believes that these relationships are facilitated by Botswana's traditional code of behavior, with its customs of greetings, sitting down together, drinking bush tea, and casually talking around a subject, rather than addressing it aggressively.<br /><br />Life is a rich, full, and happy experience for Mma Ramotswe, who can find out everything she wants to know from her broad network of family and friends.

Their objective, like that of their parents, is the ouster of the British, who have been mandated by the UN to set up a Jewish homeland. Though the children enjoy \\"spying\\" and see themselves as glorious heroes, their plans of attack are distinctly childish.<br /><br />When Proffi finds himself drawn to Sgt. Stephen Dunlop, a gentle, shy British soldier from Canterbury, who wants to learn Hebrew and to teach Proffi English, Proffi justifies this friendship as his chance to probe for information for his own \\"secret DOD agency.\\" Declared by his friends Ben Hur and Chita Reznik to be a \\"lowdown traitor\\" when this relationship is discovered, Proffi feels isolated, at a crossroads in his life.<br /><br />Jerusalem is under constant curfews, the British are searching houses for weapons, his parents are involved in an underground movement, and he himself is beginning to become interested in girls--at least in Yardena, the nineteen-year-old sister of Ben Hur. As we come to know her, the people of the neighborhood, and the people important to Proffi, such as Mr. Gihon, his teacher, we see Proffi's knowledge and insights to be those of a twelve-year-old child whose belief in a bright future is absolute.<br /><br />The powerful, often poetic language of this coming-of-age novel, along with its lively humor and warm understanding of human nature, make this an unforgettable novel of great universality. Told by an adult narrator who accurately captures Proffi's youthful viewpoint, the novel paints a picture of a loving, scholarly family seeking peace and knowledge, even as they actively try to expel \\"perfidious Albion.\\" As we watch their interchanges with each other, with Proffi, and with British soldiers, we see them as decent people who want to be left in peace in a homeland of their own, to recover from the traumas of the Holocaust.<br /><br />Filled with gorgeous sense impressions and images (the description of the father's library is stunning), the novel draws in the reader with its contagious warmth and good humor.

Sherman Alexie is a fantastically gifted writer, and Reservation Blues and his short stories are recognized as masterpieces. This book, however, is so different in its focus and execution that one wonders what Alexie's motivation was in publishing it. The main character is despicable--and obviously mentally ill. He brutalizes the most innocent of victims, shocking the reader with murders which could not be more loathsome in their graphic detail. This violence is gratuitous. We are given no understanding of the man or his motivation.<br /><br />Some might argue that because he was stolen from his Indian mother and given to whites to raise that he never felt part of either the white or Indian worlds, and that this is his justification, if not his motivation. But he was an infant when this kidnapping happened, however disgraceful it was, and his adoptive parents were loving ones. It's the old Nature vs. Nurture theme, and Alexie seems to be saying here that Nurture counts for less than nothing if it takes place in a white environment.<br /><br />Perhaps Alexie is trying to turn the tables by having an Indian exact the kind of gratuitous violence against the white world that has been exacted against Native Americans. If that is the case, he has confused the issue by having his killer be part of neither culture, with no social values from either culture infusing his actions. And if Alexie's point is that other Indians are justified in feeling like his killer, one wonders why his depiction of Indian life in Reservation Blues, for example, is so bleak and why his main characters there escape to the white world, \\"[singing] together...with the shadow horses....a song of mourning that would become a song of celebration.\\"  Mary Whipple	2005-09-19

Mike has been her love for eight years, and though the intensity of her early relationship has palled, she has been unable to decide how, or even whether, to call off her engagement. Lovingly remaining at Mike's side during the crucial early months of his recuperation, Carrie wonders, \\"How much do we owe the people we love?\\" as she tries to distinguish between love and friendship and the limitations and obligations of each.<br /><br />Packer's naturalistic style puts the minutiae of the daily lives of Carrie, Mike, their friends, and families under a microscope. We learn, for example, even the smallest details of Carrie's compulsive sewing (how to make a spaghetti strap, why she uses a Bernina sewing machine and Butterick pattern), the exacting therapy a spinal cord injury patient undergoes, some of the cherished traditions of Madison (Paddle and Portage Day at the lakes), and even some of Carrie's memories of friend Jamie from third grade.<br /><br />Packer is equally precise about what the characters are thinking, feeling, wondering, and concluding so that the reader need never search beneath the surface for hidden meanings or subtleties. (\\"We were alone together, and also alone within ourselves.\\" \\"[Carrie went] from guilt to remorse to relief to exhilaration [as she drove to New York].\\" \\"You do what you do. Not without consequences for other people.\\")<br /><br />The subject of spinal cord injuries arouses powerful feelings in the reader and makes us confront our personal moralities as we consider how we ourselves might behave in similar circumstances, and Packer is remarkable in her ability to illuminate these issues. Some readers may feel shortchanged by the conclusion of this book and question how much control Carrie ultimately exercises over her life--does she decide her future or merely let it happen?

In this inventive and unconventional narrative, Barnes turns the old fiction-writing maxim, \\"Don't tell about something, recreate it,\\" on its head, choosing not to recreate anything at all. Instead, his three main characters address the reader in soliloquies, each telling his version of events that have happened in the past and leaving it up to the reader to decide what really happened.<br /><br />Stuart, stodgy and predictable, was briefly married to Gillian before dashing Oliver stole her away. Ten years have passed, Stuart has remarried, divorced, become financially successful in the U.S., and returned to England. Oliver and Gillian are still married, the parents of two daughters. As their lives once again intertwine, many of the old tensions revive, along with some new tensions, the result of the characters' changes in ten years.<br /><br />Barnes's characters are vivid, and their speeches to the audience are both dramatic and real. One can easily see how the various characters would interpret events differently, and that aspect of the book is fun to read. There are numerous disadvantages to Barnes's approach, however. The characters are independent of the reader, isolated not only from the reader but from each other, and they feel like actors on a stage who have not invited anyone in to share their lives. The reader's role becomes that of an observer or a judge, deciding not only what happened but what will happen in the future.

Poaching, patronage, a general ripoff mentality, and collusion between park rangers, politicians, blackmarketeers, and smugglers, were so interconnected and seemingly so ineradicable that the department resembled a many-headed hydra.<br /><br />Tribal rivalries within Kenya, a porous border through which Somalian thieves made forays, and a lack of agreement between Kenya and neighboring African countries about the best way to conserve animals made this one of the most daunting management challenges imaginable.<br /><br />In prose that is as direct and to the point (and sometimes as self-congratulatory) as he is, Leakey tells how he set up and managed a multimilliondollar corporation in a country in which everyone wants a piece of the pie, usually under the table.<br /><br />As Leakey tells of cleaning up the department and conserving the elephants, the reader also learns about the economics of the ivory trade, the tug-of-war between immediate political realities and long-term goals, the role of the World Bank in African development, and the politicking involved in deciding what is an endangered species under the U.N.'s Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It's a fascinating tale, equally intriguing to the lover of wildlife, the student of management, and the East African history buff. Mary Whippleanagement, and the East African history buff.

Publishing this novel in 1978, Greene says in his autobiography (Ways of Escape, pp. 256 - 257) that he had actually started it ten years earlier, abandoning it when his friend and former colleague, Kim Philby, defected to Russia. He did not want this book to be considered a roman a clef. Like Philby, Maurice Castle, the main character in this novel, is a double agent, and Greene goes to great pains to bring him to life and try to make his inevitable defection to Russia believable. Having earlier lived in South Africa, Castle had fallen in love with Sarah, an African woman. Another double agent had helped her escape from South Africa so she and Castle could be married. Now living in England with Sarah and their son, Castle continues to provide information to the Russians as payback for the help he received years before.<br /><br />The cloak-and-dagger intrigue here is rooted in the Cold War, and Greene's own sympathies with the Communists, well known, are noticeable throughout the novel. When a leak is suspected in Castle's section of British intelligence, a secret plan is devised to eliminate the culprit quietly to avoid another Philby-type embarrassment to the government. It is of only minor consequence to the higher-ups that they kill Davis, an innocent man. The Russian' rush to \\"save\\" Castle, whose work for them has really been of only minor importance, seems more like wishful thinking than reality. Codes created from duplicate copies of old books, messages left in a hollow tree, and warning signals made with rings of the telephone now seem to belong to an age much earlier than the mere 24 years which have evolved since the book's publication.<br /><br />Castle is well drawn, for the most part, though he seems a rather clumsy agent-about-to-defect, someone who, though supposedly devoted to his wife and child, has not thought far enough ahead to guarantee their ultimate safety and happiness. Sarah, unfortunately, is an undifferentiated, flat character, and Castle's devotion to her must be accepted, rather than felt, thereby limiting the impact of the ending. Parts of the book are very moving, and Castle is often a sympathetic character, but I thought the book lacked the philosophical and structural tightness of his earlier, more famous novels.

Often regarded as Conrad's masterwork, Nostromo is also Conrad's darkest novel, filled with betrayals at all levels and offering little hope for man's redemption. A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins. All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them. Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.<br /><br />When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits. Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work. Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.<br /><br />In contrast to these \\"unrealized\\" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences. Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word. Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself. Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, spends her time helping others.<br /><br />When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, Conrad provides a bleak commentary on idealism and human nature. The conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, reveals Conrad's darkest self and offers little hope of change and even less hope for man's redemption. Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

Written originally as the outline for the screenplay of the famous 1949 film of the same name, Greene sets the story in Vienna just after World War II, employing the sectors established by the conquering British, Americans, French, and Russians to provide tension, mystery, and an almost palpable aura of menace as residents and visitors alike must deal with four different governments, four sets of officials, and four collections of laws as they move throughout the city.  With massive bomb damage, the city is still emerging from devastation, with black markets selling everything from food to penicillin abound.<br /><br />Rollo Martins, the author of cowboy novels written under the name of Buck Dexter, arrives in Vienna to visit an old school friend, Harry Lime, only to find that is the day of Lime's funeral.  Investigating Lime's death, Martins learns that a neighbor saw the traffic accident that killed Lime and observed three men carrying Lime's body from the scene.  Only two of those men have been identified-the third man has vanished.<br /><br />As Martins investigates, he must deal with the city's several different governments, each of which has carved out a sector.  The initial co-operation among sectors has vanished, and co-operation with the Russian sector is almost non-existent.  Wanted men use the city's sewers to escape from one sector to another, where they cannot be followed.  The investigation of Lime's death becomes more complex when an inebriated Martins is sure that he has seen Harry Lime on the street.<br /><br />By turns exciting and darkly humorous, the novel is a curiosity among Greene's entertainments, since this story was never written to be a novel at all.  Intensely visual in its descriptions and action, it lacks the characterization and thematic focus which one associates with most of Greene's work.  The novel's dialogue, rather than narrative, conveys the story, as it does in the film, and the setting in a war-torn city adds to the sense of danger and drama.  Certainly not one of Greene's \\"finished\\" novels, it is still fun to read, especially when one is familiar with the even better film of it, directed by Carol Reed and starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, and Trevor Howard.  Of particular interest to those studying writing and film-making, Greene's novella is full of wit and dark theatrics, and includes everything from a chase through the sewers to a love story.

Though this book is only of average length, it has the feel of a big family saga, so completely does McEwan delve into the consciousness of his main characters as they attempt to cope with the long-term repercussions of a \\"crime\\" committed by a Briony Tallis, a naïve 13-year-old with a \\"controlling demon.\\" Briony's \\"wish for a harmonious, organised world denie[s] her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing,\\" so it is doubly ironic that her attempt to \\"fix\\" what she sees as wrongdoing involving her sister and Robbie Turner, a childhood friend, becomes, in itself, a wrongdoing, one she feels compelled to deny and for which she will eventually attempt to atone.<br /><br />Opening the novel in 1935, McEwan creates an intense, edgy, and almost claustrophobic mood. England is on the brink of war; Briony, a budding writer, is on the edge of adolescence; her newly graduated sister Cecilia is thinking of her future life; and Robbie is about to start medical school. The summer is unusually hot. Troubled young cousins have arrived because their parents are on the verge of divorce; Briony's mother is suffering from migraines; her father is \\"away,\\" working for the government; her adored brother Leon and a friend have arrived from Cambridge; and Briony, an \\"almost only child,\\" with a hypersensitive imagination, finds her world threatened.<br /><br />Step by step, McEwan leads his characters to disaster, each individual action and misstep simple, explainable, and logical. The engaged reader sees numerous dramatic ironies and waits for everything to snap. When Briony finally commits her long-foreshadowed \\"crime,\\" the results are cataclysmic, and the world, as they know it, ends for several characters.<br /><br />Giving depth to his themes of truth, justice, honesty, guilt and innocence, and punishment and atonement, McEwan uses shifting points of view and an extended time frame. Part I is Briony's. In Part II, five years after the crime, Robbie, now a footsoldier retreating from the French countryside to Dunkirk, continues the same themes, seeing the crimes of war, not only between the combatants but against civilians and, at Dunkirk, by the Brits against each other. In Part III, Briony, atoning for her earlier crime by working as a student nurse, rather than studying to be a writer, brings the past and present together, tending the casualties of war. The ending takes place in 1999, at her 77th birthday party.<br /><br />This is a totally absorbing, fully developed novel, the kind one always yearns for and so rarely finds. The characters, the atmosphere, the lush descriptions, the sensitively treated themes, the intriguing and unusual plot, and the rare entr&eacute;e into the mind of a writer, both Briony and McEwan, give this novel a fascination few others achieve. It's hard to put this one down.

The atmosphere of the early 1940's in a small town outside London becomes the setting for this novel as Stephen Wheatley, now in his mid-60's and living abroad, is drawn back to his childhood home by the \\"sweet and luring reek\\" of privet, a scent which evokes memories of his twelfth year, when he naively \\"spied\\" on his neighborhood from inside privet bushes with his friend Keith Hayward. Announcing one day that his mother is a German spy, Keith \\"crosses the frontier into another country altogether,\\" and the boys begin dangerous meddling in real lives, manipulating events which they do not fully understand.<br /><br />Huge, personal costs to others result from their meddling and still puzzle Stephen fifty years later. As he tries to retrieve memories, make necessary connections between events, and put his personal demons to rest, he is a sympathetic figure, and the reader both understands his curiosity as a child-spy and observes with ironic detachment and adult judgment the unfolding disasters he provokes.<br /><br />Frayn is in full control of his material here, recreating the rather matter-of-fact atmosphere of a suburban London neighborhood during the war--the errant bombing of a neighborhood house and killing of an old woman, the blackouts and alarms, the separated families, the rigid social distinctions, and the indifference toward those of lower class. His depiction of the child's motivation is flawless, the adult Stephen's confusion is plausible, and the dramatic ironies for the reader continue to the end.<br /><br />Many readers have complained about the ending, and I confess that I, too, was startled, at first, by the last twenty pages. As I started thinking about why Frayn would choose this ending, however, I began to think that perhaps, with all the secrets and spying that take place in the novel, he wanted one final irony--to show that the reader, too, is a kind of spy, a voyeur observing what takes place in the novel and jumping to false conclusions based on partial knowledge, no better than the characters. If that's the case, he certainly gets the last laugh. Mary Whipplesions based on partial knowledge, no better than the characters. If that's the case, he certainly gets the last laugh.

From her childhood though her arranged marriage twenty-five years later, author Narayan shares her own memories, recalling the foods which made them rich and vivid.<br /><br />Filled with sense impressions, her earliest years are characterized by memories of Raju, the milkman who milked Tiger, his cow, on demand; Chinnapan, who set up his iron and ironing board under one of their trees and kept the iron hot by loading it with coals he picked up in his bare hands; and Jaya, his wife, whose face was bright yellow from the turmeric paste she habitually applied. In school Narayan and her friends would barter their lunches, trading back and forth in the currency of their mothers' specialties. Holidays and vacations were filled with memories of pungent family feasts.<br /><br />During her college years in India, she applied surreptitiously to Mount Holyoke College for a fellowship and won it, only to run into significant opposition from her family. Her uncle suggested that if she, who had never cooked a full meal, could cook a vegetarian feast like those her mother cooked for the extended family, and have them like it, she might go. She did, and she went. Two years later, she won a scholarship to graduate school at Memphis State, this time cooking up a feast for potential donors in the U.S. in order to raise some of the extra money she needed. Later she would learn to cook traditional foods for her husband in the traditional ways.<br /><br />Narayan's memoir is charming and sensitive, both to the cultural differences between South Asia and the United States, and to the realities of family life in both places. Through food she bridges the differences between our cultures and makes day-to-day life in each place understandable and accessible to people of other backgrounds.

Robert Merivel, who has studied to be a physician, is appointed, ironically, to be veterinarian for the spaniels of King Charles II, who has recently been restored to the throne following the death of Oliver Cromwell. Merivel enjoys the gaiety and frivolity of court life, and, a bit of a fool, he entertains the king. The king's decision to placate one of his lovers by marrying off his favorite mistress to Robert Merivel, spells the beginning of the end for Merivel's tenuous fortunes. Warned not to fall in love with his wife, Celia Clemence, since the king intends to continue seeing her, Merivel cannot help himself, and he is cast out, losing not only the king's affection, but also his house and, of course his wife.<br /><br />Joining a group of men who work at an asylum for the insane, Merivel learns that there are deeper concerns in life than the hedonism of his life at court, and he develops genuine affection for several of the kindly Quaker men with whom he works. When he transgresses the society's rules, however, he is cast out from there, too, ending up in London at the time of the Great Plague and eventually the Great London Fire.<br /><br />Painting vivid pictures of Merivel's life--at court, at the asylum in Whittlesea, and in the neighborhoods of London--author Rose Tremain brings the age, its customs, its science, and its social structure to life. The years of 1664 - 1666 are especially difficult, and as Merivel lives through the horrors of the Plague and the panic of the Great Fire, which Tremain recreates with the drama they deserve, the reader can see Merivel becoming less a fool and more a human. Like the restoration of the king to the throne, Merivel's \\"restoration\\" to dignity takes place after a period of dark reflection and self-examination, and both Merivel and the country learn from their travails.<br /><br />Tremain develops Merivel's personal transformation with sensitivity, finesse, and much ironic humor, and when, at last, he is noticed again by the court, his understanding of himself and his role in the world is far more profound than it was before. Depicting the personal and the philosophical turmoils of these early Restoration years with a historian's eye for detail and a detached observer's sense of wit, Tremain illustrates the contradictions of this period realistically and often with dark humor. A fine historical novel, Restoration transcends its period, offering observations, themes, and lessons for the present day.

Melvyn Bragg's The Soldier's Return is the memorable and poignant story of Sam Richardson, a young man from rural England who has fought in the Burma campaign in World War II and who then returns home to a world totally different from the world he has left--everyone and everything has changed.<br /><br />Sam has seen such atrocity that he is now harder and less willing to show a soft side. His son Joe, now five, doesn't know him. His wife has been successful working two modest jobs and does not want to give them up. Sam has been exposed to the outside world, a world which has shown him how limited his future is in the socially inflexible world of Wigton, while his wife Ellen, in contrast, has been supported by the friendships, traditions, and familiarity of this community, where she knows everyone.<br /><br />The tensions within the family and within individual characters grow and boil over, as stiff-upper-lip-ishness comes into conflict with the human need to communicate and share, creating real drama and intensity. Bragg's written dialogue is completely natural, and his descriptions and his narrative style are simple, as is his choice of vocabulary. The reader will have no trouble following the various threads of the story while learning much about Cumbria, post-World War II social upheavals, and the kinds of personal problems that may have been typical for many other young soldiers.

Stating that \\"nothing of the original prairie remain[s],\\" Proulx presents the Texas Panhandle through the eyes of 25-year-old Bob Dollar, a newcomer, who sees railroad tracks, grain elevators, drive-in restaurants, \\"welcome to\\" signs with mottoes, a plywood Jesus, irrigation rigs, condensation tanks, fences, \\"the raw material of human use,\\" and not incidentally, long, gray hog farms, with their effluent lagoons in the rear, the stench overpowering the grasslands for miles around.<br /><br />Hired by Global Pork Rind to find the acreage needed for additional hog farms, Bob ingratiates himself with the townsfolk of the Panhandle town of Woolybucket, posing as a buyer of land for luxury housing. His meetings with cutely named townsfolk--Francis Scott Keister, Tater and Ace Crouch, Jerky Baum, Pecan Flagg, Blowy Cluck, Coolbroth Fronk, and Waldo Beautyrooms--and his discovery of their stories constitute the loose primary plot of this novel, which more closely resembles a quirky collection of short stories than a fully developed novel. \\"Eccentricities were valued and cultivated\\" here, but none of these earthy folk are eccentric enough to want more hog farms.<br /><br />Proulx raises some big issues here, such as the alarming depletion of the water table in the Panhandle, the pollution from oil fields and chemical plants, and the illnesses associated with proximity to hog farms, but she keeps her narrative from becoming polemical by weaving these into other threads about windmill-building, quilting, cock-fighting, social life in the local diner, and plans for the upcoming Barbwire Festival. She keeps things light and amusing, using the eccentricities of her characters and the setting to spice up her narrative about their not-very-exciting lives.<br /><br />Proulx is a real pro in controlling the pace of the novel. Whenever it starts to bog down or threaten to become dull, she gives us a new, outrageous name or an amusing digression (like the one about a lightbulb cemetery), or references to Bob's uncle's collection of \\"art plastic,\\" or the visit of Bob's ex-con friend who, with some friends, made a recording of flatulent \\"Rock Hits From Prison.\\" All these save the novel from being prairie-flat, as Bob tries to save his job without hurting the people he meets.

Heaven's Edge is unique--it is not a romance, not a war chronicle, not a religious allegory, not a plea for ecological responsibility, and not science fiction, though it contains elements of all these genre. Marc, a young college graduate from London, has returned to an unnamed island, much like the author's island of Sri Lanka, on a mission to connect with his father's memory. His father, a military pilot, left the family in England when Marc was a very young child and returned to the island where he died while on a mission. Marc's doting grandfather, who raised him, never understood what drove his son to return to the very island he himself had escaped.<br /><br />The novel opens with Marc's arrival at the island by boat, and Gunesekera quickly establishes the mood and the themes of freedom and repression, and past and present, as the boatman, upon his arrival, releases two flying fish, accidentally netted during the trip. The island is under military control, and the hotel where Marc stays strictly limits his movements.<br /><br />In an intensely romantic scene, Marc escapes the stultifying restrictions one day and meets Uva, a young woman who is trying to repopulate the forest with native birds and animals, all of which have disappeared during the long war. When Marc is suddenly rendered unconscious and Uva disappears from his life, the mood changes instantly from romance to surreality, as Marc finds himself in captivity, enduring a regimented life more akin to science fiction than the heights of romance. Mind-numbing violence, brutally perpetrated by the military to remove any question of free thought and independent activity in the population, is the only constant in the lives of the characters, as Gunesekera explores our need to remain connected to our pasts and the ways in which our futures are outgrowths of our pasts. The graphically described violence further sets into sharp relief themes of personal identity, the desire for beauty, and the need to protect and preserve the natural world.<br /><br />Sometimes enigmatic and even a bit preachy, the novel is at once magical and nightmarish, full of myth and allegory at the same time that it offers haunting, cautionary tales about the past and the use of violence to change the present and affect the future. Echoes of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, the fall of man, legends about peacocks and leopards, and episodes telling the importance of love and respect pervade the novel, giving it immense color and depth.  Clearly a pacifist, Gunesekera says, \\"The art of killing cannot be our finest achievement...Nothing is inevitable.\\" But Gunesekera does not believe in being completely passive or non-violent when faced with true threats to life. \\"Sometimes you have to sacrifice your innocence to protect this world,\\" he says. In this memorable novel with its stunning depictions of nature, especially birds and butterflies as they try to survive the depredations of man, he makes a powerful, ecological and political statement, presenting characters who try to create gardens of their own out of the decimated gardens of their pasts.

Winning an incredible twenty-one of his twenty-two races, he was only a few inches away from having a perfect record, losing that one race \\"by a nose.\\" Horse of the Year in 1954, Native Dancer was an unprecedented choice to grace the cover of Time magazine in May, 1954, just before he retired from racing as a four-year-old.<br /><br />Author John Eisenberg reports here on the horse, the stable, and all the individuals who were part of his illustrious career, explaining the circumstances which made Native Dancer the darling of the country. Seen by more race fans than any other racehorse in history, thanks to America's recent discovery of the joys of television, he stood out visually from the pack and became \\"America's first matinee idol.\\" When he began racing in 1952, World War II had been over for only a few years, and the fifties were a decade in which \\"institutions were to be admired, not challenged.\\" Americans \\"saw their country as wealthy and invincible,\\" and Native Dancer became a symbol of this power. He was, in fact, so big and so powerful that when he ran, \\"you could draw a horizontal straight line from his airborne back feet to the tips of his forelegs,\\" his stride measuring an incredible twenty-nine feet.<br /><br />Having thoroughly researched every conceivable aspect of his story, Eisenberg writes with the journalistic brio of a true lover of horse-racing, and makes the horse, his stupendous bursts of speed out of the pack in the final seconds of his races, and the people surrounding him live again. Through newspaper accounts, photographs, step-by-step reconstructions of the races, interviews with the participants and their heirs, and personal stories by people who remember the horse and his quirks, he turns back the clock to a simpler era and recreates the spirit of the fifties when all the world looked bright. Though Native Dancer was never as lovable as Seabiscuit (and, in fact, once bit off the finger of someone he did not trust), he was a huge and positive presence, an immensely powerful racer who had a tremendous desire to win and the intelligence to know how hard he had to work to accomplish that win.

The Naylors' niece Lois is nineteen, a bored young woman without goals, impatient to get on with the job of finding a husband so that she can fulfill her apparent destiny. Her cousin Laurence, an Oxford student who would rather be in Italy or France, also has little to do, a condition he shares with a married couple, Francie and Hugo Montmorency, who visit friends like the Naylors regularly, having no home of their own.<br /><br />A British army unit is garrisoned nearby to protect their loyal subjects-and, not incidentally, provide a ready source of young men for garden parties and tennis matches. With an acute eye for detail, ironic detachment, and a sometimes caustic wit, Bowen reconstructs the lives of these aristocrats. One comments that it would be \\"the greatest pity if we were to become a republic and all these lovely troops taken away.\\" Laurence remarks cynically that he would like to be present when \\"this house burns and we should all be so careful not to notice.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Bowen's prose remains formal and detached. When Lois and a young soldier begin to think they are in love, there are no passionate scenes--both are a product of their time and upbringing, and kisses are reserved for the engagement. When nearby estates are attacked, the Naylors simply change their schedules and limit their travel. Bowen's book has the ring of truth--she herself was part of the Ango-Irish tradition in County Cork, and she wrote the book in 1929, when the revolution was still fresh. Though she puts an iconoclastic spin on attitudes and values, she offers no apologies, preferring to present the facts, create the scenes, and allow the reader to judge for himself/herself whether Ireland was better off before or after The Troubles.

Art lovers, and particularly Vermeer lovers, have had two \\"Vermeer novels\\" available for the past few years, Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier and Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland.  Both are short, both are well written, both involve a hypnotizingly seductive Vermeer painting, and both tell of the influence of the painting on the lives of the main characters.  As for which is better, that may be a matter of taste, though Girl with the Pearl Earring has had the lion's share of publicity, especially after the production of the film.  Many readers will be interested in reading both novels.<br /><br />In Girl With A Pearl Earring, author Chevalier focuses her literary microscope on Griet, a maid in the Vermeer household who becomes an assistant to the painter. Griet is a young woman who maintains her integrity despite the turbulence and social pressures to which she is subjected in the household. Life in Delft and in this family during the time of the painting is replete with petty jealousies, economic pressures, class distinctions, religious differences, and political and social uncertainty, and Griet has to navigate her way through this milieu. It is through her character and domestic situation that one comes to know Vermeer and his painting.<br /><br />The second Vermeer novel, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, on the other hand, is not a \\"character novel.\\" Here the author does not concentrate on one character or even the painting as an end in itself. Instead, Vreeland takes a broader, more global view, using the history of a hitherto undiscovered Vermeer painting to work backward from the present to the painting's inception in Delft. The \\"story\\" here is a careful tracing of themes--the relationship between personal love and responsibility to mankind in general, the role of art in the lives of ordinary people, and what constitutes lasting value both in art and in human interactions. In seven or eight chapters we see how the painting has affected the lives of its various owners.<br /><br />Ultimately, comparing these beautifully wrought novels is like comparing pearl earrings to hyacinths. Both are gorgeous; each is unique. Girl with the Pearl Earring is more accessible and more popular, while Girl in Hyacinth Blue is more complex and literary.  Lovers of Vermeer are encouraged to read both--and enjoy.

This completely frank, thought-provoking, and often wryly humorous account of life in Berlin before the fall of the Wall will go straight to your heart with its fascinating stories and tales from both sides of the Divided City. With poignancy and warmth, the author creates believable characters who adhere to their own truths, not necessarily the expectations of the reader. The personable, unnamed speaker in this first person narrative is a writer trying to create the story of a man \\"caught in a back-and-forth motion over the Wall, like a soccer goalie in an instant replay, always taking the same dive to miss the same ball.\\"<br /><br />Virtually all the Berliners we meet here--from both East and West--are in the same situation as the unfortunate goalie, as they, too, go back and forth, repeatedly mistaking the moves of people from the other \\"side,\\" misinterpreting signals, and often, in their ignorance, failing to \\"get it.\\"<br /><br />The author provides an amazingly complete, though somewhat sanitized, picture of the Wall-jumpers--not those poor souls who were brutally machine-gunned by Wall guards, but people like the speaker who come and go across the Wall with relative impunity because they do not call attention to themselves. And Schneider is quick to point out that most of the East Berliners are fairly satisfied with their lives, which are depicted with much warmth, as families and friends spend a great deal of time with each other, undistracted by the responsibilities of \\"freedom.\\"<br /><br />The fascinating philosophical discussions and personal revelations that occur among friends from both sides may sweep away your preconceptions about life in Berlin, as they did mine, and you may find yourself reevaluating your thinking about society and politics in general, and about Germany, in particular.

In his longest novel, written in 1970, Nobel Prize-winning author Patrick White examines the question of an artist's creativity, where it comes from, whether it can be controlled, and what obligations, if any, accompany it. As he traces the life of Hurtle Duffield from the age of four until his death as an elderly (and successful) avant-garde artist, we see Duffield always as somehow different from his peers. The son of a laundress and a bottle collector, Hurtle is from birth inspired, painting large images on walls as a toddler, but he recognizes at an early age that \\"people look down at their plates if you said something was 'beautiful.'\\" To provide him with opportunities which will allow his genius to flourish, his parents sell him to the wealthy family for which his mother works when he is four years old.<br /><br />As a member of the Courtney family, Hurtle travels and becomes educated, though he continues to see rather than think. For him, the usual emotional traumas of adolescence are accompanied by unique questions of his identity, both because of his two families and also because of his view of the world. Not religious, he sees God as the Great Vivisector, and men treating each other as animals, slaughtering each other in war. When he himself goes off to war and returns to find that the family has gone in separate directions, he devotes himself, once again, to his art, using women who love him as vehicles for his own self-expression and behaving as a vivisector himself. About his painting of one model, White says \\"[Hurtle] disemboweled her while she was still alive.\\" As time passes, Hurtle continues to search for love, inspiration, self-expression, and some sort of balance in his life between his immense need to paint, his desire for personal connection, and his simultaneous need to be alone.<br /><br />White's prose style is direct and concise, elegantly simple, and easy to understand. He uses colloquial speech--words like \\"smoodge,\\" \\"sook,\\" \\"slommacky,\\" and \\"mumped,\\" which must be understood from context--and reveals character and action through dialogue. The novel is old-fashioned, using a straight chronological narrative with no complex flashbacks, and it is somewhat romantic in its plot elements, despite its serious thematic development. The biggest problem for the reader is that the main character is not very likable, nor does he inspire a great deal of empathy--a difficult character to live with for approximately six hundred pages--and I'm not sure how typical he is of the artists he is supposed to represent.

As much fun to read as any book by Redmond O'Hanlon or Gerald Durrell, A Primate's Memoir is funny, irreverent, and full of adventure, while also being a serious scientific study of the savanna baboons of Kenya. Sapolsky's goal is to determine the relationship of baboon stress levels to their overall health over a period of years. A neuroscientist, he observes the social hierarchy and interactions of his baboon group, guesses which individuals appear to be most stressed or most relaxed and then checks their hormones and blood chemistry, not an easy procedure, given his clever and not always co-operative population. Sapolsky, who works alone, must first outwit the baboon, use a blowgun to dart him, follow and wait for him to become unconscious, and then carry him half a mile or more to his portable lab facilities, where he then draws blood and does measurements. The baboons, of course, react to stress the way humans do.<br /><br />The title of A Primate's Memoir is deliberately ambiguous--it is both Sapolsky's memoir and that of his baboon population, and his experiences and interactions with the outside world are remarkably similar to theirs. Leaving the relative safety of the game reserves and hitchhiking into dangerous territories during his \\"down time,\\" Sapolsky describes his travels with enthusiasm, impeccable timing, and great, self-deprecating humor, subtly selecting details which show how similarly he and his baboon population deal with their worlds' uncertainties. Kenya is experiencing civil unrest and corruption; Uganda has just deposed Idi Amin; the Sudan is in the midst of a long civil war; the border of Zaire is under siege; and the Somalis refuse to accept any borders at all, stealing lands and property wherever they go--all dangerous and stressful atmospheres for their populations and for visitors like the author.<br /><br />Sapolsky is a great story teller, however, equally entertaining in presenting both his adventures and his research, his world and that of his baboons. While life may be \\"nasty, brutish, and short,\\" Sapolsky shows us it's a lot more fun if one keeps a sense of humor--and a lot less stressful. Mary Whippleld and that of his baboons.

This powerful and richly atmospheric novel, a classic in Spain for the past fifteen years but only now translated into English, captures the love of an old man for his land and for the village in which he and his ancestors were born. It is also a study of the inexorable effects of time and the pressures it exerts on isolated communities and the human inhabitants who lack direct connection with a wider world. Told from the point of view of the elderly Andres, the last remaining inhabitant of a crumbling village in the Pyrenees, the novel details his physical and emotional deterioration as he observes the parallel collapse of the town, \\"whole buildings kneeling like cattle,\\" the village itself a mangled and sad \\"unburied corpse.\\"<br /><br />As the novel opens, Andres tells us that this is the last day of his life, describing what the men approaching from the nearest town will discover when they come to Ainielle for the first time in ten years. Gradually, Andres reveals the history of the village and of his own family, capturing his own desolation and possible madness. His confrontations with ghosts--of his mother, his three children, and wife Sabina--slowly reveal his life as a family man, along with his disappointments, his sometimes self-defeating behavior, and his never-ending desire to keep alive the village in which his ancestors worked the land. He knows that when he dies, any remaining vestiges of the village and its way of life will disappear from the earth.<br /><br />Andres's memories and his confrontations with ghosts add color, variety, and a sense of drama to what would otherwise be an interior monologue, showing the conflict between Andres and the forces of change. His preparations for his own death and description of the images the approaching visitors will see on their arrival constitute the quiet climax. The imagery is breath-taking. Realistic and grounded in the stark reality of farm life in a poor, nearly dead village, the nature imagery reveals parallels between the inner forces which have driven Andres to become the last human in Ainielle, and the passage of time and the seasons--deep snow, the rushing water of spring, and the falling poplar leaves, which he sees as \\"the yellow rain.\\"<br /><br />A haunting memorial to those people who are incapable of accepting the changes of time, the novel forces the reader to consider those values and aspects of the past which are lost from our heritage when the memories and experiences of the elderly are not preserved, when old villages disappear, and when future generations do not care.

Nominated for the Booker Prize in 2000, English Passengers is, on the surface, a picaresque adventure of sailors going to Tasmania, but it is also the vivid, sorrowful drama of the extermination of the aborigines there.  With a cast of characters engaged in all manner of mischief during their voyage from the Isle of Man to Tasmania, this engaging and thoughtful novel uses nineteen different voices, four of them major characters, incorporating personal memoirs and/or letters which provide depth and interest. Through the wide variety of characters and their attitudes and beliefs, the seemingly incompatible plot lines, both comic and tragic, come to life and provide focus for the ship's meanderings.<br /><br />Illiam Quillian Kewley, the irrepressible ship captain from the Isle of Man, is always just a heartbeat away from apprehension by authorities. Rev. Geoffrey Wilson, his Bible-thumping passenger, believes that a literal interpretation of Genesis puts the Garden of Eden in Tasmania, and he's about to prove it. Dr. Thomas Potter, another passenger, is a phlebotomist who believes that his own success is proof of his high position on the chain of being, with the Manx crewmen far below him, and the aborigines just a step up from the apes. Peevay, a minimally educated aborigine with whom the reader greatly identifies, is a foil to show how the tunnel-visioned, British colonial/missionary spirit produces everything but \\"improvement\\" for the aborigines. The story and setting are further fleshed out with entries from Tasmanian colonial governors, landowners, schoolmasters, prison inspectors, prison superintendents, and their wives.<br /><br />As the characters come alive, interact, brawl, and otherwise reveal the colonial and philosophical attitudes of their day, the novel's broad scope and action are alternately very dramatic and very funny.  Finely constructed and thoroughly enjoyable, the journey and explorations around the island would have been easier to visualize if the publishers had included a map of Tasmania.  Not a book to be read in dribs and drabs, this book benefits from being read in big chunks to keep the action and all the characters in focus and to allow the scenes to develop fully in all their humor and drama.  Also recommended for those who are interested in Tasmania: Peter Conrad's Behind the Mountain: Return to Tasmania (ISBN 0671705733), a stunning memoir and excellent source of information about the island, including maps.

Barker herself once described this as a novel of \\"cornball perversion,\\" and no one who reads it will ever dispute that. Filled with the weirdest group of gonzo characters ever assembled, it includes Ronny, a homeless man whose real name is Jim; Jim, a hairless man whose real name is Ronny and who works spraying weed killer along the roads; Luke, a photographer of pornography who smells like fish; and Lily, a violent and rebellious teenager who suffers from a clotting disorder and worships The Head. And if these characters were not already bizarre enough, Barker also opens the Pandora's box of their not-in-the-textbook psyches to the reader--showing them to be even more off-the-wall than we had ever dreamed.<br /><br />Providing fertile ground for all the aberrations to flourish, the author sets the characters in a remote seaside resort/nudist colony during the off-season, with additional forays to a nearby boar farm, the Lost and Found Department of the London Underground, and a bat cave in Sumatra, where a character we know only from her letters is searching for a hairy hominid with no big toes. Obviously, not your granny's novel.<br /><br />Wide Open is like nothing you've ever read before-absolutely original, sometimes wacky, sometimes poignant, sometimes violent, and always fascinating. The fluidity of Barker's prose keeps the reader zipping along, despite the fact that we can't always tell when she's putting us on, aren't always sure what's going on, and often suspect there are deep themes here if only we could catch our breaths long enough to figure them out.

Gill's novels are always fun because they revolve around aspects of Irish life not usually incorporated into mystery stories--eel-fishing, secret Catholic societies, literary history, and in this case, the serious business of salmon-fishing and fly-tying. Well drawn repeating characters, lyrical descriptions of Ireland's rural charms, pitch-perfect vernacular and syntax, big dollops of humor, and a graceful incorporation of the mythology and history which infuses Irish culture intrigue the reader on levels other than plot.<br /><br />This novel reflects all of these characteristics to some degree, but the mystery at the heart of this novel is thinner and less complex than in some of Gill's other novels. Focusing on the death of famed salmon-fisherman Nellie Millar in Donegal's Owenea River, Gill employs a limited cast of characters, each of whom has a reason to resent and or even kill Nellie, who is a former lover of Supt. Peter McGarr of the Garda Siochana. McGarr (now suspended) and his wife Noreen, along with acting Supt. Hugh Ward and his former lover, Det. Ruthie Bresnahan, find themselves helping unofficially in the investigation of Nellie's death and lending moral support to Nellie's bereft father.<br /><br />The usually intense and idiosyncratic behavior of McGarr and his staff, which so often animates Gill's novels and keeps the reader involved and intrigued, is absent here. The wild nights and fights, the circumventions of the law to achieve a greater good, and the threats to the safety of McGarr, his staff, and their families, which usually keep the reader on edge, are missing. Though written in beautiful prose, this plot is more formulaic--and the characters' more predictable--than is customary for Gill. It's fun to read, but not Gill's best.  Mary Whipple	2005-09-14

Often regarded as Conrad's masterwork, Nostromo is also Conrad's darkest novel, filled with betrayals at all levels and offering little hope for man's redemption. A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins. All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them. Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.<br /><br />When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits. Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work. Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.<br /><br />In contrast to these \\"unrealized\\" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences. Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word. Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself. Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, spends her time helping others.<br /><br />When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, Conrad provides a bleak commentary on idealism and human nature. The conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, reveals Conrad's darkest self and offers little hope of change and even less hope for man's redemption. Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

Written as a \\"play for voices\\" for the BBC, this work was originally performed in 1954, with Richard Burton as the First Voice, connecting all thirty-three characters--men, women, and small children. Depicting one full day in the life of Llareggub, a small town in Wales, Thomas shows its motley residents as they awaken, perform their daily tasks, socialize and gossip, and daydream about the past that might have been and the future that may yet offer hope. As is always the case with Thomas, the \\"play\\" is full of alliteration and various kinds of rhyme, with nouns and adjectives used as verbs to convey action and sense impressions simultaneously. A wry humor (Try reading the name of the town backwards, for example) and an honesty of feeling make the work engaging for the reader and charmingly illustrative of a time and place now gone.<br /><br />Individual characters come alive through their own voices and through the gossip of others, spread by the postman and by neighbors. When night falls and the residents retire, their additional losses and disappointments, along with their escapes into dreams, are given voice and poignancy. Polly Garter, with her numerous children by numerous fathers, dreams of Willie Weasel, a very small man who was the love of her life. Captain Cat, the blind bell-ringer, thinks of all the sailors he knew who died at sea and Mr. Pugh dreams of poisoning his wife.<br /><br />Simple songs add to the realism and the sense of character and place. An elegiac song by Polly Garter, as she remembers Willie and compares him to her other lovers, conveys an almost palpable sadness and makes Polly one of the most memorable characters. A humorous singing game by children adds to the realism, and young Gwenny's song to three very young boys is full of cheeky humor. Filled with the hurly-burly of everyday life in a small town in 1950s Wales, this and A Child's Christmas in Wales are among Thomas's most beloved works.  Mary Whipple	2005-09-14

With this opening, which firmly establishes the wry tone of this delicious comedy/satire, Alice Thomas Ellis instantly draws the reader into a hilarious send-up of the Greek legend of Phaedra, while simultaneously poking fun at the lives of would-be writers.  Claudia Bohannon, who has spent her life being the perfect English housewife, suddenly finds herself inexplicably drawn to her handsome stepson Philip, who looks and sounds like a younger version of his father but who is far more sensitive of her feelings.  Convincing herself that she is desperately in love with him and that he is hiding his feelings out of respect for her and his father, Claudia sets in motion a domestic comedy which gives a new meaning to the word \\"irony.\\"<br /><br />Her best friend Sylvie, to whom she confesses that she is in love (but not with whom), becomes the sounding board for both Claudia and her husband Charles.  At the same time, Sylvie's daughter Evvie, Claudia's god-daughter, decides to write a romance novel about the lives of the people in the small town where they all live.  Every trite character and plot twist and every possible clich&eacute; of writing finds its way into Evvie's novel, which unfolds simultaneously with the love story of Claudia, adding literary humor to the dramatic ironies within Ellis's novel.  As Evvie further develops her thinly disguised characters, her manipulations of the lives of the characters within Ellis's novel, for the sake of her own novel, add further complications and ironies.<br /><br />The novel is not simply a farce, however.

Written with passion and fury, this novel is as unrelenting as a nightmare--you can't break out of it once you are in it, and you are compelled to see it through to the end. On the surface, it is a murder mystery and investigation, but at its heart, it's a bleak case study of a community which has died since its manufacturing industries shut down and the supports for its local economy collapsed. Everything which gave dignity, meaning, and focus to the hardscrabble lives of the inhabitants is gone. In the middle of a hot, dry summer in this community in the Dust Bowl, Ronny Lawton's no 'count father disappears, and Ronny, no Boy Scout himself, is generally assumed to be his killer.<br /><br />Collins sets up the framework for his themes from the outset. The main character, Bill, is the grandson of a man who made his fortune selling ice, and later manufacturing refrigerators. Bill is working haphazardly for the local newspaper and living in the basement of the family mansion because it's the coolest area of the house during these brutally hot days. He is recovering from a breakdown and hospitalization following his father's suicide.<br /><br />Ronny Lawton, to whom he is drawn, at first, as a newsman, is in many ways his opposite, though they share the bond of having lost their mothers and having had cruel fathers. Ronny lives in a shack and works at Denny's, where he takes pride in his designation as Employee of the Month. Except for Bill, who believes Ronny may be innocent, everyone--the local police, the FBI, the newpaper owner, and the claque of women at the local hairdressing salon--needs to find Ronny guilty to regain control of their lives. As the spirit of frontier justice grows and the need for a scapegoat becomes more pressing, Bill and Ronny both become caught up in the out-of-control spiral which soon engulfs them both.<br /><br />The pace of the novel is unrelenting. The small-town dialogue is realistic, filled with petty resentments and jealousies. The prose is vivid, full of heavy, occasionally \\"purple,\\" descriptions. The pathetic setting of a community which has lost every reason for being, and the hopelessness of the lives of its inhabitants, made obsolescent by the decline of manufacturing, make this a bleak reading experience. Collins's humor, however, saves it from bathos, and the psychological credibility of the characters and the excitement of the plot make this a book that I found impossible to put down. It's easy to see why it was a Booker nominee.  Mary Whipplef heavy, occasionally \\"purple,\\" descriptions.

A mother's agonized attempt to help to her 19-year-old daughter Norah, a drop-out who now begs on a street corner with a sign saying \\"Goodness\\" around her neck, provides the framework for Shields's thoughtful and sensitive look at women's roles and the juggling acts they sometimes require. Reta Winters, a successful writer, believes at first that by writing a bright, perky novel about \\"lost children and goodness and going home,\\" she will be \\"remaking the untenable world through the nib of a pen.\\" But real life--and Shields's real novel--are, of course, much more complex than that.<br /><br />Despite the support of her two younger and very caring daughters, her empathetic husband, her friends, and Danielle Westerman, the French feminist whose books she has translated, Kate nevertheless discovers that trying to help a child who will not be helped is a terrible loneliness to bear: \\"I need to know I'm not alone in what I apprehend, this awful incompleteness that has been alive inside me all this time.\\" Evaluating her life as a wife, writer, friend, mother, and, increasingly, feminist, Kate allows us to share her inner life, both as it is revealed in her writing and as she wrestles with Norah's \\"hibernation\\" on the street corner.<br /><br />Filled with dazzling images (an idea that has \\"popped out of the ground like the rounded snout of a crocus on a cold lawn\\" ; women who have been \\"sent over to the side pocket of the snooker table and made to disappear\\"), this Shields novel is more meditative than many of her other novels. \\"I've been trying to focus my thoughts on the immensity, rather than the particular,\\" Kate/Shields says. As she inspires the reader to share this immensity, she provides insights into the essence of who we are and who we might become.  Mary Whipple	2005-09-13

When India Ophuls finds the body of her father, his throat slashed by his Kashmiri chauffeur, Shalimar the Clown, she and the police believe the death to be connected to terrorism.  Max Ophuls, \\"the Resistance hero, the philosopher prince, the billionaire power-broker, the maker of the world\\" was also \\"America's best loved, then most scandalous Ambassador to India.\\"  Though Max has been US counter-terrorism chief recently, his assassination by Shalimar the Clown, we learn, has been an act of pure, personal revenge, unrelated to terrorist organizations.<br /><br />Through an extended flashback, Rushdie recreates the love story of Shalimar, a tightrope walker, and Boonyi Kaul, a dancer and acrobat, in a troupe from Pachigam, a small Kashmiri village where both Muslims and Hindus live and work together peacefully and govern the town together.  Shalimar and Boonyi fall deeply in love at fourteen and marry soon after, but several years later, Boonyi has an affair with Ambassador Max Ophuls, and her abandonment of her husband turns the enraged Shalimar into a potential assassin, who swears revenge upon everyone involved in the affair.<br /><br />The continuing story of Boonyi and Shalimar becomes an allegory for the history of Kashmir, its Hindu/Muslim conflicts and its political India/Pakistan conflicts, as young Muslim men including Shalimar, respond to the teachings of the \\"iron mullahs\\" with their fundamentalist messages.  Incorporating local mythology, legend, and traditional story-telling, Rushdie sheds light on the actions of the main characters, emphasizing the traditional beliefs which underlie much of their behavior.  Dreams, visions, and prophecies give warnings of disasters to come.  Boonyi's relationship with Max becomes the story of betrayal by a powerful American, and Max's Jewish background, which is emphasized, injects fundamentalist hatred of Jews into the controlling allegory.<br /><br />Though Rushdie stresses that Shalimar assassinated Max Ophuls as an act of personal revenge, not terrorism, he nevertheless extends the allegory and symbolism from the personal to the universal.  When the focus of the novel moves from Kashmir into the broader realm of all recent world events, it begins to break down thematically.  \\"Everywhere's story is now a part of everywhere else,\\" Rushdie says.  Shalimar, for example, has trained in the Philippines with Abu Sayyaf, a group aided by Libya and Malaysia.  India Ophuls sees her father as Nelson Mandela in a dream.  The Los Angeles riots, 9/11, Rodney King, and Reginald Denny are viewed as part of interconnected violence throughout the world.  Even the 1974 murder of a nanny in England by Lord Lucan is somehow connected to Max's murder and Shalimar's personal revenge.<br /><br />Dense with imagery, legend, and local color, the novel lacks Rushdie's trademark humor, word play, puns, and clever repartee.  His characters, though layered and often complex, illustrate aspects of the historical allegory and behave in ways that advance the plot and symbolism, rather than as characters with lives of their own.  Journalistic passages, inserted within the story, give further information about the Indian army, its fight against the insurgency, and reports of fidayeen attacks and atrocities.<br /><br />A fascinating study of the Kashmiri conflict, the cultures of the area, and the growth of radical Islam, the novel conveys both the spectacular beauty and the spectacular violence of the area, offering much to think about in terms of the origins of such violence.  In his attempt to broaden the scope from Kashmir to the world stage and to show all violence as connected, however, Rushdie has stretched his themes and created a novel which often feels dogmatic. n Mary Whippleenge, not terrorism, he nevertheless extends the allegory and symbolism from the personal to the universal.

The Third Man, written originally as the outline for the screenplay of Carol Reed's famous 1949 film of the same name, is set in Vienna just after World War II, when the conquering British, Americans, French, and Russians have divided the city into four separate zones.  Residents and visitors alike must deal with four different governments, four sets of officials, four collections of laws, and four sets of mutual resentments as they try to navigate the city, and Greene uses these divisions to provide tension, mystery, and an almost palpable aura of menace to his story.<br /><br />Rollo Martins, an author of cowboy novels, arrives in Vienna to visit an old school friend, Harry Lime, only to find that he has arrived on the day of Lime's funeral. Investigating Lime's death, Martins learns that a neighbor saw the traffic accident that killed Lime and observed three men carrying Lime's body from the scene. Only two of those men have been identified--the third man has vanished.<br /><br />As Martins investigates Lime's death, the novel is by turns exciting and darkly humorous, intensely visual in its descriptions and action, but lacking the characterization and thematic focus which one associates with most of Greene's work. The story is full of wit and dark theatrics, and includes everything from a chase through the sewers to a love story.<br /><br />The Fallen Idol, an alternative title for Greene's short story \\"The Basement Room,\\" is a psychological, rather than plot-based story.  Nine-year-old Philip, who idolizes the family's butler Baines, is left with Baines and his wife while his parents go on vacation.  Baines is having an affair, and Philip innocently discloses this to his wife.<br /><br />The resulting confrontation results in an accident in which the wife ends up dead, and Philip, panicked, runs out, only to be picked up by a policeman, to whom another innocent remark conveys the idea that Baines has murdered her.  Irony and a delightfully drawn (and unusual for Greene) child's point of view make The Fallen Idol one of Greene's more twisted stories<br /><br />Both The Fallen Idol and The Third Man led to film collaborations between Greene and director Carol Reed. The Third Man was produced in 1949, just after Reed directed The Fallen Idol, both early examples of film noir.  Dark humor, elaborate ironies, and surprising twists characterize both stories and show Greene to be a master manipulator of perceptions.

Though some critics have said that this book resonates long after they have finished it, it resonates because its message is so bleak, even hopeless. And one suspects that Leigh, an Australian author, is intentionally playing with the reader here by turning \\"quest fiction\\" on its head, as she criticizes those who make a conscious decision to sacrifice the essence of humanity and compassion while despoiling Nature for profit.<br /><br />\\"Martin David,\\" which may or may not be a real name, is in search of the thylacine, a Tasmanian tiger which may be extinct. In no sense a \\"hero,\\" Martin is being highly paid by a corporation to find the last tiger and to extract its DNA, to be used to clone it.  He is so obsessed with fulfilling his mission, however, that he becomes virtually a hunting machine, referred to not by his name at all, but simply as \\"M.\\"  During days that he is not hunting, he stays with the Armstrong family, dysfunctional since the disappearance of the father, Jarrah Armstrong, and we see some niggling traces of humanity as M begins to respond to the two wonderful, resilient Armstrong children, desperately in need of his help.<br /><br />In other \\"quest fiction,\\" such as Faulkner's The Bear, the reader can easily distinguish between hunter and prey and gain some enlightenment about the role of man in the universe as the hunter's respect for his prey grows during the duration of the hunt. Here, however, the edges are blurred.  Readers can never sure whether M or the thylacine is really the hunter.  As our knowledge grows, so does our understanding of which is the more ruthless, and which, if either, triumphs during the hunt. Though the prose is brutally compelling and the sense of drama very high, the message here actually feels like a message, and it is very grim.  Most readers will conclude the novel wishing it were the M's of the world who were becoming extinct--and that, perhaps, is the author's point.  Mary Whipple	2005-09-12

Now approaching his sixtieth birthday and wanting to escape from cell phones, answering machines, the daily newspaper, and being \\"put on hold,\\" he is determined to travel from Cairo to Cape Town. He believes that the continent \\"contain[s] many untold tales and some hope and comedy and sweetness, too,\\" and that there is \\"more to Africa than misery and terror.\\"<br /><br />Traveling alone by cattle truck, \\"chicken bus,\\" bush train, matatu, rental car, ferry, and even dugout canoe, he tries to blend in as much as possible, buying clothing at secondhand stalls in public markets, carrying only one small bag, and avoiding the tourist destinations. He is an observant and insightful writer, and his descriptions of his travails are so vivid the reader can experience them vicariously. His interviews with residents are perceptive and very revealing of the political and social climate of these places, and his character sketches of Sister Alexandra from Ethiopia (a nun who \\"has loved\\") and of two charming Ethiopian traders, a father and son, who take Theroux to the Kenyan border, are delightful.<br /><br />For most of the countries of Africa, however, he has no kind words. Kenya is \\"one of the most corrupt...countries in Africa,\\" everything in Kampala, Uganda, has changed for the worse, and in Tanzania \\"there was only decline--simple linear decrepitude, and in some villages collapse.\\" At the U.S. embassy in Malawi, he finds an \\"overpaid, officious, disingenuous, blame-shifting...embassy hack\\" and, in pique, he wonders, \\"Had she, like me, been abused, terrified, stranded, harassed, cheated, bitten, flooded, insulted, exhausted, robbed, browbeaten, poisoned?\\"<br /><br />Theroux has become waspish, and it is difficult to \\"travel with\\" a man who sees himself as a hero for making the trip at all, especially after he refuses to give a half-eaten apple to a hungry child when she begs for it.

Writing this first novel from the point of view of an autistic 15-year-old, Mark Haddon takes the reader into the chaos of autism and creates a character of such empathy that many readers will begin to feel for the first time what it is like to live a life in which there are no filters to eliminate or order the millions of pieces of information that come to us through our senses every instant of the day. For the autistic person, most stimuli register with equal impact, and Christopher's teacher Siobhan, at the special school he attends, has been trying to teach him to deal with the confusing outside world more effectively. At fifteen he is on the verge of gaining some tenuous control over the mass of stimuli which often sidetrack him.<br /><br />When the dog across the street is stabbed and dies, Christopher decides to solve the mystery and write a book about it. His favorite novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, becomes his model as he investigates the crime, uncovering many secrets involving his own family in the process. Innocent and honest, he sees things logically and interprets the spoken word literally, unable to recognize the clues which would tell him if someone is being dishonest, devious, or even facetious. As he tells his story in a simple subject-verb-object sentence pattern, Christopher tries to communicate and give order to his world, and the reader can easily see how desperate he is to find some pattern which will enable him to make sense of it.<br /><br />Christopher's investigations eventually require him to make some remarkably brave decisions, and when he faces his fears and moves beyond his immediate neighborhood, the magnitude of this challenge is both dramatic and poignant. Strange places have always been traumatic for him, and he has difficulties with his emotions. \\"Feelings,\\" he says, \\"are just having a picture on the screen in your head.\\" He responds either with logic or with the anger which sometimes overwhelms him as result of fear or frustration, and the reader cannot help aching for him and empathizing with his family.<br /><br />Christopher's coming-of-age story is most unusual, if not unique, and he ends the book a much more mature 15-year-old than he was when he started. With warmth and humor, Haddon creates a fascinating main character, allowing the reader to share in his world and experience his ups and downs, his trials and successes. In providing a vivid world in which the reader participates vicariously, Haddon fulfills the most important requirements of fiction, entertaining at the same time that he broadens the reader's perspective and allows him to gain knowledge.

Katharina Blum's murder of a newspaper reporter, to which she has confessed on the opening page, is not the point of attack for a mystery story, despite that implication in many book summaries. There is too little suspense and character development to make you care much about her. Instead, Boll uses the murder and its aftermath to offer a cautionary tale about overzealous police investigators and the unfettered tabloid press--showing how the press descends on Katharina and everyone who has ever come into contact with her, twisting words, creating false impressions based upon police department leaks, casting aspersions, ruining lives, and inciting Katharina to eventual murder.<br /><br />Sound familiar? The novel may have been startling, and even controversial, when it was published in 1974, but no contemporary reader familiar with the tabloids at the supermarket checkout or with sensational talk shows conducting outrageously one-sided investigations will find this depiction of the press even slightly shocking. In fact, the methods of the press in this novel seem unrealistic, not because they are so extreme, but because they are so obvious, crude, and lacking in subtlety. Boll's novel is a product of its own time. While it may confirm that the conflict between responsible journalism and irresponsible sensationalism has a long history, it offers few useful insights for the present day.  Mary Whipple	2005-09-10

Geoffrey Firmin, the former British consul to Mexico, is a prisoner of alcoholism.  A victim of the shakes, he hears voices, talks to people who are not there, and hallucinates, though he is often able to hide the extent of his drinking.  \\"True, he might lie down in the street, but he would never reel.\\"  On The Day of the Dead in 1938, his recently divorced wife Yvonne returns to Quauhnahuac, over which two smoking volcanoes loom, to try to persuade him to reconcile.<br /><br />Coincidentally, Geoffrey's half-brother Hugh, with whom Yvonne apparently had a brief affair, also arrives that day, and the three share quarters, each hoping to recapture the past.  When they take the bus to Tomalin to a bull-riding event, they see a wounded peasant dying beside the road, the peasant's horse with the number 7 branded on its rump, a tricky pesado, and a group of vigilantes, all of whom play a role in the climax which follows.<br /><br />Rich with details, both of the external world of Quauhnahuac and the internal world of Geoffrey, the novel, first published in 1947, reflects Lowry's own experiences as an alcoholic.  Geoffrey, a fully-rounded character, knows that he must stop drinking in order to function effectively, but he is unable to function at all without drinking.  He both loves and despises Yvonne, wants to leave Mexico but wants to stay, and wants to find peace but creates chaos.<br /><br />As Lowry reconstructs this one day in Geoffrey's life, the Day of the Dead, the pervasive symbolism adds to the feeling of overpowering doom--the smoking volcanoes ready to erupt, the \\"hideous pariah dog\\" that follows Geoffrey and Yvonne to the house, a barranca (chasm) which exists beside the house and which contains a dead dog, an Indian carrying \\"the weight of the past,\\" vultures in the forest, Yvonne's release of an eagle in a cage, and sudden storms.  All add weight and intensity to this powerful story of dissolution.<br /><br />Despite the depressing subject matter and a frustrating main character who cannot or will not help himself during the novel's four hundred pages, the novel is breath-taking--elegant both in language and construction.  Carefully plotted, filled with unique imagery, and enhanced by symbolism which brings it alive on new levels, it overwhelms the reader with its impact and approaches classical tragedy as the inevitable, doom-filled events play out. Though the novel includes peripheral political issues of the day--Mexico's instability and the philosophical conflicts between fascism and socialism--it is primarily a variation on the story of the Garden of Eden and the fall of man--full, rich, dense, and rewarding, despite its pervasive sadness. n Mary Whipplecannot or will not help himself during the novel's four hundred pages, the novel is breath-taking--elegant both in language and construction.

Initially resembling an old-fashioned, hard-boiled detective story, this novel by Graham Swift becomes, as the perspective widens, an investigation of love, man's need for love, and the sacrifices we are all willing to make for love. Private detective George Webb allows the reader to \\"tag along\\" during one day of his life in 1997, talking to his readers about aspects of his life as they impinge randomly on his consciousness. Description is not a big part of George's life, and it takes the reader some time to understand all his references in this lengthy interior monologue. We don't know, at first, why Nov. 20 is a significant date to him or where he goes every other Thursday, nor do we know about his personal relationships with the women introduced at the beginning, or the reason he's buying flowers, or why he's had a woman's handbag in his possession for two years.<br /><br />As George's recollections, memories, and observations expand, however, we gradually come to know him and his past, including his relationship with his father, his own broken marriage and the circumstances surrounding it, his alienated daughter, his womanizing, the scandal which has resulted in his leaving the police force, and his decision to specialize in \\"matrimonial work.\\" We learn, too, that George's client, Mrs. Nash, is now in jail, the reasons for this unfolding even more gradually, as we come to know her, her husband Bob, and the privileged life they've led. Always, however, our opinions of these characters and their relationships are colored by George's point of view, and we, as objective observers, learn as much about them from what George does not say as we do by what he does say.<br /><br />All of George's memories are concerned with the vulnerability of people who are in love, as Swift raises questions about whether we choose the people we love, or whether we are chosen by them. Does love just happen? What makes it last? What happens to lovers who are \\"unchosen\\"? And can we love too much? Although a mystery story is not usually the framework for such a serious, philosophical analysis of love in all its permutations, Swift manages to make this work through his beautifully wrought character study of George, buffeted every which way by the loves in his life. In the lean, unemphatic prose style he first employed in Last Orders, Graham Swift presents a sensitive investigation of love with all its mysteries and ineffable sadness.

In a change of pace from his previous intricately plotted and lengthy novels, Iain Pears here writes a novella-length study of an artist painting a three-part portrait of the most famous art critic in England in the years of 1910 - 1913, a man with whom he has had a significant history over many years. The critic, William Nasmyth, has come to Houat, a small island off the Brittany coast, where the artist, Henry Morris MacAlpine, has been living in exile for several years.<br /><br />As he paints Nasmyth's portrait during the course of several days, MacAlpine addresses him about their past in London, the state of the art world and its artists during these years of post-impressionism, their mutual friends and lovers, and Nasmyth's role in the success or failure of MacAlpine's artist-friends. Sometimes angry and hostile, sometimes snide, and occasionally sentimental, MacAlpine reveals the sordid details of Nasmyth's life and ego-driven personality, which he intends to use in the portrait, a triptych--his view of Nasmyth as he was, as he is now, and as he will be.<br /><br />The artist, articulate and observant, feels totally realistic, a person we come to know, not by what he says, but by what he implies and then forces us to conclude. Nasmyth, we see, loves power, the making or breaking of artists. MacAlpine's friend Evelyn and his model Jacky are depicted realistically, and the reader, who comes to know them through MacAlpine's reminiscences about them, empathizes with them for their treatment by Nasmyth. Gradually, the reader becomes aware that MacAlpine intends to make Nasmyth pay for past crimes, and though the reader may figure out generally how the novel will conclude, Pears has saved some surprises. When the novel draws to its close, the reader feels the rightness of the conclusion.<br /><br />Because the novel is a dramatic monologue, the reader comes to know only the speaker and his point of view. No conversations with other characters exist to show how they interact with each other, and the reader never sees other characters in action. This leads to a novel which \\"tells about\\" what happens, instead of recreating it and allowing the reader to share it. The author must build suspense and tension through words, rather than through action scenes, a device which leaves the reader at arm's length. Filled with personal details which reveal the heart and soul of a struggling artist, the novel is a fascinating glimpse of the art world during the age of post-impressionism and of one artist who seeks revenge on a critic.

Two different settings and time frames--the waning days of the Third Reich in Germany and Portugal, and contemporary Portugal, with some of the same characters--allow the author to overlap both a complex historical thriller with a traditional murder mystery in unique and fascinating ways. Klaus Felsen, forced to work for the Nazi SS near the end of World War II, is sent to Portugal to buy as much wolfram (tungsten) as he can get, to be used in the manufacture of armor-piercing weapons. He is also responsible for privately smuggling out a great deal of German gold and some stolen art when it appears that Germany will lose the war, a job made more palatable when he realizes that he and his partners can profit greatly in the years after the war if they are careful to avoid discovery.<br /><br />All these details come into play when a young Portuguese girl, seemingly unconnected with any of this, is found murdered fifty years later in contemporary Lisbon. Inspector Ze Coelho is assigned to solve the mystery of her death, a death which eventually reverberates throughout Lisbon society, the &eacute;migr&eacute; population, the police department, the federal Justice department, political parties past and present, and even the foundations of the present government.<br /><br />If all this seems like a lot to take on, it is. Although the book is beautifully written with fully developed, imperfect, and quirky characters one grows to like and understand, fine and vivid description, and a fast-paced plot with something happening all the time, ultimately it is difficult to make all the connections required by the fifty year chronology of the plot. Although I worked hard at this, and thought I had succeeded as I approached the conclusion, the last twenty pages had me reviewing and revising everything I had previously observed about the possible motivations of the main characters.  Surprising twists are expected in mysteries.  This one takes complexity to new levels.  Mary Whipple	2005-09-09

Focusing on the life of Henry James, Colm Toibin's The Master goes beyond the usual \\"novelization\\" of someone's biography. Toibin has done a tremendous amount of research and has obviously read everything James has written, but he has so distilled this information that he actually recreates Henry James. Most remarkably, he does this while using the third person point of view to tell the story, preserving the objective tone but bringing forth characters and events so vibrant with life that Toibin's James is the man we know from his novels, letters, and journals.<br /><br />When the novel opens in 1895, James's play, Guy Domville, has been booed on its opening night. James, now fifty-two, has hoped for a career as a playwright, believing success on stage will put an end to \\"his long solitary days\\" and allow him to spend more time among actors, whom he finds fascinating. Described as \\"a great stranger...observing the world as a mere watcher from the window,\\" James is a lonely, solitary figure throughout the novel, a man unable to form a committed relationship with anyone, either male or female, sometimes wanting companionship but not closeness, and always needing solitude to work. Through flashbacks, Toibin shows how James's early upbringing may have been partly responsible for his feelings of isolation.<br /><br />When James begins writing his stories and novels, he draws inspiration from the people he knows best and the events which have affected their lives and his own. His sister Alice is the model for a child in The Turn of the Screw, his cousin Minny Temple is the inspiration for several of his most important female characters-in \\"Poor Richard,\\" Daisy Miller, and Portrait of a Lady--and his brother Wilky's wounds in the Civil War provide James with details he includes in other stories. Virtually every aspect of James's life works its way into a story, and as he gets inside the psyches of his characters through his fiction, he reveals his own psyche, his sympathies, and his personal conflicts.<br /><br />Toibin's dual focus on James's life and its embodiment in his fiction give powerful immediacy and verisimilitude to this novel, and one cannot help but feel an emotional connection to James. His connections to great families and writers whose names are well known, and to people willing to accept James completely on his own terms provide Toibin with unlimited source material. It is Toibin's own talents in ordering this information, bringing it to life, and revealing its importance, however, which make this masterful novel so important.  Mary Whipplesonal conflicts.

Set in summer, 1933, in the depths of the Depression, Arthur Miller's most personal and intimate play focuses on the workers in a warehouse, a grim place in which men and women work for small wages and are grateful for the work.  As Miller himself has observed, the Civil War and the Depression were the only times in American history in which the whole country was in the same boat. The warehouse, he notes, unpleasant as it was, became a grotesque sort of haven for the employees since they, at least, had jobs.  Miller's own experience working in a warehouse shows in his exceptionally realistic portrayal of the workers, men who often lose themselves in alcohol to escape reality, and women who must put up with sexual abuse and mistreatment to save their jobs.<br /><br />Focusing primarily on character, rather than plot, this intimate play illustrates a variety of characters whose dreams have been deferred or destroyed: Bert, a young boy who dreams of college;  Kenny, a young Irish immigrant with a song on his lips, poetry in his heart, and a yearning to see the sun through the begrimed windows;  Raymond, the sympathetic manager, who must ensure that the work gets done; Tommy Kelley, an alcoholic accountant who becomes almost catatonic with drink, then is \\"saved\\"; Gus, another drunk, called \\"King Kong\\" by the women in the office; Agnes, a kind hearted receptionist who bursts into tears at the sadness of the lives around her.  The subordinate characters add to the exceptionally broad view of life.<br /><br />As the characters reveal their inner lives within the warehouse, their emotional depressions become even more obvious than the economic Depression.  When Gus, who has just lost his wife, suddenly enters wearing a new coat and fancy suit, after cashing in his life insurance policy, the scene is set for his confrontation with the boss and the eventual climax.  The dramatic action, all taking place in a dreary warehouse room, reveals both the camaraderie and the tension resulting from the enforced intimacy of characters who are not always compatible.  Here Miller puts everyday life during the Depression under a microscope, a dramatic change from the broader scope and more universal themes which usually dominate his plays.  Inspired by Miller's own life, this play speaks to the heart. n Mary Whipplehe enforced intimacy of characters who are not always compatible.

When Isabel Archer, a bright and independent young American, makes her first trip to Europe in the company of her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, who lives outside of London in a 400-year-old estate, she discovers a totally different world, one which does not encourage her independent thinking or behavior and which is governed by rigid social codes. This contrast between American and European values, vividly dramatized here, is a consistent theme in James's novels, one based on his own experiences living in the US and England. In prose that is filled with rich observations about places, customs, and attitudes, James portrays Isabel's European coming-of-age, as she discovers that she must curb her intellect and independence if she is to fit into the social scene in which she now finds herself.<br /><br />Isabel Archer, one of James's most fully drawn characters, has postponed a marriage in America for a year of travel abroad, only to discover upon her precipitate and ill-considered marriage to an American living in Florence, that it is her need to be independent that makes her marriage a disaster. Gilbert Osmond, an American art collector living in Florence, marries Isabel for the fortune she has inherited from her uncle, treating her like an object d'art which he expects to remain \\"on the shelf.\\" Madame Serena Merle, his long-time lover, is, like Osmond, an American whose venality and lack of scruples have been encouraged, if not developed, by the European milieu in which they live.<br /><br />James packs more information into one paragraph than many writers do in an entire chapter. Distanced and formal, he presents psychologically realistic characters whose behavior is a direct outgrowth of their upbringing, with their conflicts resulting from the differences between their expectations and the reality of their changed settings. The subordinate characters, Ralph Touchett, Pansy Osmond, her suitor Edward Rosier, American journalist Henrietta Stackpole, Isabel's former suitor Caspar Stackpole, and Lord Warburton, whose love of Isabel leads him to court Pansy, are as fascinating psychologically and as much a product of their own upbringing as is Isabel.<br /><br />As the setting moves from America to England, Paris, Florence, and Rome, James develops his themes, and as Isabel's life becomes more complex, her increasingly difficult and emotionally affecting choices about her life make her increasingly fascinating to the reader. James's trenchant observations about the relationship between individuals and society and about the effects of one's setting on one's behavior are enhanced by the elegance and density of his prose, making this a novel one must read slowly--and savor.

This is a \\"western\\" which gallops to life, and the reader feels the grit, smells the dust, and agonizes with desperate characters as they are tossed every which way, not by their own deliberate decisions so much as by the unpredictability of their Australian frontier existence.<br /><br />Ned Kelly, the Jesse James of Australia, becomes human here, not a monstrous blackguard so much as a man who is forced to make impossible choices. In this tale, which purports to be the hand-written autobiography he wants to leave for his baby daughter, we follow his childhood in poverty, his reluctant \\"apprenticeship\\" to the villainous Harry Powers, his cruel imprisonment by corrupt authorities, and his attempts to stay out of trouble upon his release. The judicial system's attack on his mother, however, becomes the catalyst for Ned's life in crime, a life which the reader understands could have been completely different, had authorities simply shown more compassion.<br /><br />Carey is masterful in using small details to show contrasts and to make the big picture come alive. A new pair of soft boots achieves almost mystical significance--the ecstasy of their acquisition contrasting with the strength achieved through their sacrifice. \\"Fresh bread and jam...barley and mutton soup,\\" served to Ned in jail, provide poignant contrast to the poorer, leaner fare on the farm. And a red silk dress becomes a symbol for corruption in one context and love in another.<br /><br />A vigorous and uncompromising vision of wilderness life and death, the novel is also the sensitive portrayal of a young man forced to make impossible decisions to save and protect his family.  It is also a passionate love story told with a warmth and sympathy that is all the more poignant for its contrast with the murder and death which accompany it.

In his previous two novels, Fforde created a wacky, fictional universe in which \\"real world\\" characters could transport themselves into books, associate with the characters there, turn back the clock, and even change the endings. Heroine Thursday Next, has saved Jane Eyre from disaster, imprisoned Jack Schitt in Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Raven,\\" and ended the Crimean War, but she has also made enemies of some powerful criminals, one of whom has gone back in time and killed off her husband when he was just a small child. Now, pregnant, she is the only person who can remember him as an adult, and her memory is failing.<br /><br />Anxious for a rest, she decides to go with her dodo Pickwick to visit the Well of Lost Plots, where all book characters, plots, and settings reside until they are chosen for novels.<br /><br />In this most literary of Fforde's three novels, Thursday is an apprentice agent-in-training for JurisFiction, the policing agency that works inside books, her mentor and guide being Miss Havisham from Great Expectations. Living inside an unpublished crime thriller, Thursday explores the Great Library, where the Cheshire Cat is librarian, sees the workshop for backstories (some used, some not), meets generic characters (\\"human canvases without paint\\") and \\"orals\\" (nursery rhyme characters), tours available settings (high-capped mountains, arched stone bridges, ruined castles), and watches as Miss Havisham joyrides in \\"Chitty Bang Bang.\\" Holesmiths work there fixing holes in narratives, grammatacists try to prevent grammacites (gerunds) and mispeling vyruses from infecting novels, and pace-setters, moodmongers, and plot speculators work on new creations.<br /><br />As the Well considers installing the UltraWord operating system, which will expand the basic eight-plot architecture into thirty-two plots, Thursday tries to preserve the memory of Landen, fight against her enemies, and win her trial for a fiction infraction. Fforde pulls out all the stops here, creating a carnival ride through books and the creative process with surprises and delights on every page. Less plot-driven than the previous novels, this novel is episodic, with scenes ranging from a Star Wars-type bar scene to a group counseling session for the characters in Wuthering Heights.

When Eugene O'Neill wrote this play in 1940, it was so autobiographical that O'Neill requested it not be published until twenty-five years after his death.  When he died in 1953, all the other characters in the play had also died, however, and his wife allowed the play's publication in 1956.  Despite O'Neill's three previous Pulitzer Prizes and his Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936, it is this play (also a Pulitzer winner) that he regarded as his most important work, an assessment with which historians and theatre-goers universally agree.  Many (and I am one) also believe it is the greatest American play ever written.<br /><br />Long Day's Journey Into Night is a complete theatrical experience, satisfying on every level.  Recreating his own family and its interactions, O'Neill's emotional connection with the characters is obvious in the roundness of their characterizations:  there are no villains or heroes here.  James Tyrone, modeled on his father, is an actor who found the \\"perfect play,\\" resulting in years of travel performing the same role.  Permanently typecast and by now bored, James has earned a substantial salary but is considered a tightwad, unable to escape his memories of poverty.  Mary Tyrone, his wife, to whom he is devoted, traveled with him when he performed, often leaving the children with family members.  When her youngest child died in her absence, she blamed everyone for this accident.  Edmund, modeled on O'Neill himself, was born after this, but Mary never recovered, and when an incompetent doctor prescribed drugs, she became blissfully addicted.<br /><br />The two sons, Jamie and Edmund, observe the interactions of their parents, their father losing himself in alcohol, their mother constantly re-addicting herself so she can live in a world without hurt, and they interact both with both parents and with each other.  Jamie, considerably older than Edmund, regards himself as Edmund's protector, both from the outside world and from the sometimes hurtful relationships both have with their parents, who regard Jamie as a failure because of his drinking, and Edmund as a baby.  Edmund, however, has traveled the world before returning home recently with a \\"bad summer cold,\\" obviously the early stages of tuberculosis, a reality his mother refuses to recognize.  As he awaits an official diagnosis from a cut-rate doctor, Edmund tries to channel his feelings and his fears into the poems he writes.<br /><br />Though many gifted dramatists can make one or two characters come alive in a play, O'Neill does it here for all four characters, each of whom rings completely true.  Their actions and conflicts arise from within, and the viewer becomes completely caught up in the dialogue and events on stage because they are so natural, so life-like.  Though the play is about three and a half hours long, these are hours that fly by, the intensity of the family's internal conflicts totally involving, as the love underlying these conflicts and the hidden resentments which ignite them emerge at odd moments and create poignant scenes.  Ironic humor, much more obvious in the hands of outstanding stage actors than in the written script, provides relief from the powerful tensions and keeps the play from ever appearing sentimental or melodramatic.

Written in 1892, when Ibsen was a mature playwright, this tension-filled play focuses on an older man's fear that he will be replaced by the younger generation before he has been able to reconcile his professional success with his personal sacrifices.  Halvard Solness is a Master Builder who once built churches and towers but who now builds only houses.  Arrogant, manipulative, and often paranoid, there is little he will not do to control outcomes.<br /><br />When Hilde Wangel suddenly knocks on his door, the younger generation arrives.  Exuberant and flirtatious, Hilde reminds Halvard that exactly ten years ago, when she was the twelve-year-old daughter of a client, he called her his little princess and promised to buy her a kingdom.  Ingratiating herself with Halvard, Hilde listens as he reveals his accumulated guilt, his fear of godly retribution, and his simultaneous belief that he is one of the \\"special people\\" who can bring his desires to fruition through the summoning of demons, \\"called 'luck' by others.\\"  Hilde, believing she can free him creatively, urges the acrophobic Halvard to place a wreath at the top of the tower on the house he has built for his wife-a symbolic celebration of a new kind of life through Hilde, building castles in the air.<br /><br />The characters, though full of passion, are not always realistic.  Their psychological grounding seems uncertain, and their behavior does not seem to flow out of a sense of personal unity.  Halvard believes that certain people can make direct connections with him and read his mind.  He also believes that that his success has occurred because years ago he made a bargain with demons which resulted in the loss of everything he and his wife held dear-he is successful, but guilty.  Though he has rejected religion, he is tormented by the need for retribution. Hilde, for her part, became obsessed with Halvard at the age of twelve, and she believes that now, after ten years, they can build castles together.<br /><br />Ibsen's dark vision here seems to combine classical tragedy with a belief in the Nordic spirit world and in the newly evolving psychoscience of Freud.  Often considered Ibsen's masterpiece, the play is powerful to watch, but eerie and unsettling--its pessimistic message equivocal--and one concludes the play not knowing how much free will Ibsen believes men really have and what kind of spirit world he thinks may control it.

Tarquin Winot, the speaker of this wickedly entertaining novel, is an artist, a dedicated gourmet, and a brilliant and thoughtful philosopher.  He is also an intolerant and arrogant snob who foists his lofty opinions upon the reader as he travels from Portsmouth to southern France. In sometimes long-winded sentences, Winot comments on effete subjects, such as the erotics of dislike, the aesthetics of absence, and his disinterest in the idea of interest, while simultaneously creating deliciously sensuous descriptions of the perfect bouillabaise, lamb with apricots, or pike in beurre blanc.<br /><br />Winot is so waspishly nasty, so full of condescension, and so unsympathetic a character that I almost gave up on him and the book, thinking both too rarefied to be interesting.

The drug trade throughout Mexico, Latin America, and the Mediterranean come alive in this Arturo Perez-Reverte novel, quite different from his intellectual mysteries. Here he writes the \\"biography\\" of Teresa Mendoza, a young woman from Sinaloa, Mexico, who becomes the mastermind of a multimillion dollar drug empire operating from Marbella, Spain. This novel's challenge lies not in an intellectual puzzle, but in understanding the business networks Teresa builds with drug lords from Russia, Italy, Morocco, and Colombia, along with various agents of government whom she buys off. As she becomes a successful businesswoman, known as \\"The Queen of the South,\\" the suspense develops: Will she stay alive? And how?     The story begins in Mexico when Teresa is twenty-three. Uneducated but attractive, she is in love with Guero Davila, a Chicano pilot involved in shipping coca. When she suddenly receives a phone call telling her to run for her life, she does so, escaping through Mexico City into Spain, and then Morocco. Putting her knowledge of drug transportation to work by involving herself in hash-running between Morocco and Spain, she ends up with a short jail sentence but an important friendship with another inmate, Patty O'Farrell, the rebellious daughter of a wealthy Spanish family. When they are released, they set up a big-time drug trafficking business, with Teresa running the show and becoming, eventually, the person with whom everyone in the business must deal.     Teresa's story is not told in linear fashion. An unnamed speaker/narrator, presumably Perez-Reverte himself, has come to Sinaloa to investigate and describe Teresa Mendoza's life and business. Interviewing everyone with any information, he inserts himself and his interviews into the narrative. Soon the line begins to blur between fiction and fact, since some of the people he interviews, such as the three people to whom he dedicates the novel, are, in fact, real people who are included as characters in the novel. These add depth and a fine sense of realism to the novel.     Although Teresa Mendoza is not a character with whom the reader will identify, the author develops a certain amount of sympathy for her. Teresa is an entrepreneur of great intelligence, and this, combined with her ability to avoid creating any sort of trail that will implicate her legally, keeps her going in her dog-eat-dog world. The novel is episodic but fast paced, despite the sometimes unwelcome intrusions of the narrator/speaker, and Perez-Reverte succeeds in presenting a broad, intriguing picture of the business of drug smuggling and those who make it their careers.

As the author remarks early in the novel, \\"Few things were more awful than an offense against Taste.\\" Newland meets and marries May Welland, an unimaginative, shallow young woman whose upbringing has made her the perfect, inoffensive wife, one who knows how to behave and how to adhere to the \\"rules\\" of the society in which they live.<br /><br />When Newland is reintroduced to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, who has left her husband in Europe and now wants a divorce, he finds himself utterly captivated by her independence and her willingness to risk all, socially, by flouting convention. Both Ellen and Newland are products of their upbringing and their culture, however, and they resist their feelings because of their separate social obligations. Various meetings between them suggest that their feelings are far stronger than what is obvious on the surface, and the question of whether they will finally state the obvious or act on their feelings constitutes the plot.<br /><br />Wharton creates an exceptionally realistic picture of New York in the post-Civil War era, a time in which aristocrats of inherited wealth found themselves competing socially with parvenus. Her ability to show the conflict between a person's need for social acceptance and the desire for personal freedom is striking. As the various characters make their peace with their decisions--either to challenge or yield to social dictates--the novel achieves an unusual dramatic tension, subtle because of its lack of direct confrontation and powerful in its effects on individual destinies. This is, in fact, less an \\"age of innocence\\" than it is an age of social manipulation.<br /><br />Wharton herself manipulates the reader--some of her best dialogues and scenes are those the characters never actually have--conversations that they imagine, confrontations which they never allow themselves to have, and resolutions which happen through inaction rather than through decision-making. Filled with acute social observations, the novel shows individuals convincing themselves that obeying social dictates is the right thing to do. Though the novel sometimes seems claustrophobic due to its limitations on action, Age of Innocence brilliantly captures the age and attitudes of the era.

With echoes of Edgar Allan Poe, this 1902 novel continues to delight mystery-lovers.  Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of Sir Henry Baskerville, an American who has inherited it upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles.  The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night-one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.<br /><br />Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor.  The lecherous Baskerville, in pursuit, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\"  The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.<br /><br />In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall.  Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.<br /><br />Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader).  By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of  interest to Holmes.<br /><br />Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise.  The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate.  Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre.

Near the end of this tragicomic novel, a character asks to be taken home, a request which epitomizes the sad ironies in this generational saga, since the reader cannot help but wonder, in this case, \\"Where, exactly, is home?\\" and more importantly, \\"What is home?\\"<br /><br />Young Ned Hall, the narrator, is a child when the story opens in upstate Mohawk, New York, in the 1950s, the son of Sam Hall, a veteran who has returned from the war with a desire to celebrate--\\"Not celebrating victory...celebrating life.  His.\\"  Sam, a drunk, a gambler, a philanderer, and eventually a divorced father, is at the bottom of any insurance company's \\"risk pool,\\" a man both self-absorbed and self-destructive.  Popular in bars and pool halls, Sam \\"involves men in his lunacy by sheer force of his will.\\"  Ned's mother, on the other hand, is sensitive, defeated by her life, and often under psychiatric care.  When his mother suffers a breakdown and his previously absent father claims him, Ned manages somehow to adapt to the uncertainties of his new life and survive his  unusual adolescence.<br /><br />Mohawk, a blue-collar town, is filled with people whose stories come alive as they intersect with Sam Hall and Ned.  Colorful descriptions of the town's sights, sounds, and smells; lively evocations of smoke-filled bars, pool halls, and card games; and hilarious accounts of obligatory fishing trips and treks in the woods emphasize the differences between Ned's reality and the more nurturing environment he might have had in a more stable home and family.<br /><br />Russo extends Ned's story beyond the limits of Mohawk in the second half of the book when Ned goes off to college and into the professional world, pointedly illustrating Ned's self-destructive behavior, his worries about his fidelity (or lack of it), and his tendency to keep moving, even into his late thirties.  Though Ned distances himself from his parents and from Mohawk, he eventually begins to wonder how much he may be a product of the ultimate risk pool, his genetic heritage.<br /><br />An odd assortment of characters comes alive through Russo's dialogue, which conveys their personalities, relationships, resentments, and past history and creates a panoramic study of both people and place.  His themes of identity, personal responsibility, and connection to family are fully developed within this sprawling saga and its personal stories. The second half of the novel, which takes place outside of Mohawk, does lose some of its charm when its connections to place are lost, but the novel richly rewards those looking for a big novel with well-drawn characters and the wry humor which evolves from real life. n Mary Whipplepool, his genetic heritage.

Colm Toibin cuts straight to the heart in this sensitive novel of an independent daughter, long estranged from her overly controlling mother, and their attempt to reach some sort of understanding and level of communication. Daughter Helen and mother Lily are drawn to the neutral ground of Helen's grandmother's house in rural Ireland when Helen's brother Declan is gravely ill with AIDS and wants to return to the strand for a last look at the sea.<br /><br />Toibin is both straightforward and graphic in describing Declan's declining health and completely open in describing the romantic relationships of Paul and Larry, Declan's two gay friends who are also attending him at the cottage in Cush. But the focus of the story remains squarely on Helen and Lily and their long estrangement, so intense that Lily was never invited to attend Helen's wedding and, after seven years, still has not seen her grandchildren. In the crucible of Declan's sick room, those attending him are painfully aware of the tenuousness of life, and as they reach out to him with love, they share many of their innermost feelings and the stories that have shaped their lives.<br /><br />In prose that is so simple and so controlled one wonders how it can possibly carry the weight of these emotion packed scenes, Toibin empathizes with Helen, a daughter whose mother failed to meet her emotional needs when she was a child, and then tried to overpower and control her when she became strong enough to stand on her own. At the same time, he explores Lily's competing needs and the limitations imposed on her by her husband's early death and her need to support her family both financially and physically.<br /><br />The obvious symbolism of the lightship, the wave-washed strand, and the eroding headland on which the grandmother's cottage perches adds weight and universality to the crises facing the participants in this intense and poignant domestic drama. The involved reader will come away with new understandings of the need for connection, the essence of compassion, and the full meaning of love as the characters in this thematically complete novel find their resolutions.

Set sometime in the future, this post-apocalyptic novel takes scientific research in the hands of madmen to its logical and frightening conclusion. Inspiring readers to pay more attention to the world around them, Atwood offers cautionary notes about the environment, bioengineering, the sacrifice of civil liberties, and the possible loss of those human values which make life more than just a physical experience. As the novel opens, some catastrophe has occurred, effectively wiping out all human life.<br /><br />Snowman (known as Jimmy in his youth) is the lone survivor, a man on the verge of starvation in this desolate new world, now living in a tree for protection against \\"wolvogs\\" (part dog, part wolf) and serving as the protector of a bioengineered strain of humanoid children. As Atwood alternates between the unexplained disaster in which Snowman finds himself at the outset of the novel and flashbacks to his youth and early adulthood, which he shared with his best friend Crake, she brings a dismal future-world to life. Not surprisingly, Oryx, Snowman's love, has been involved in the devastation, as has Crake, though Atwood saves till the conclusion an explanation of the catastrophe, something which may frustrate some readers.<br /><br />Because we never see Jimmy/Snowman engaging in the kind of personal conflict which would have led to such a grand-scale disaster, we never really experience the intense reader involvement which might have developed from observing such a conflict. Most of the real conflict, in fact, takes place in the past and is revealed only in flashbacks. Snowman's primary conflict is his final, lonely battle with the environment to stay alive, something which advances the message at the expense of dramatic tension. Characters also are subordinated to message. We know only as much about Jimmy/Snowman as we need to know in order to empathize with him in his predicament as possibly the last man on earth. Crake is an anti-hero, remote and distanced, and Oryx remains a mystery.<br /><br />Despite its grim subject and cautionary message, the novel has a great deal of humor. With trenchant satire, Atwood pokes fun at aspects of our contemporary lives carried to extremes. Not hard science fiction, the novel is a vividly described picture of science and scientists run amok in a society which has failed in its guardianship of the environment and of life itself. More light-hearted than terrifying, and more allegorical than heart-stopping, the novel carries an environmental message of great relevance.  Mary Whippleains a mystery.

Focusing on just two climactic years, 1913 - 1914, Frederic Morton recreates Vienna  in all its splendor during the last days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  The vibrant social, intellectual, and cultural life of Vienna is examined within the context of the seething nationalism of the Balkans, the Machiavellian intrigue among the political rulers of the European nations and Russia, and the human frailties of the seemingly larger-than-life national leaders, which assure that the twilight of the empire will eventually be overtaken by darkness.<br /><br />Rigorously selective in his choice of detail, Morton brings to life the varied activities of a broad cross-section of Viennese society, and reproduces the intellectual milieu which eventually leads to the rise of some of the most influential leaders of the twentieth century--Trotsky, Stalin, Adler, Freud, Jung, Lenin, Hitler, Tito, and a host of others, all of whom are part of Vienna life.<br /><br />Morton's seriousness of purpose and his scholarship are undeniable, yet his primary contribution here, it seems to me, is his ability to make historical personages come to life, to make the reader feel that they were real, breathing humans with both virtues and frailties, and not the cardboard characters one finds so often in history books. Vienna, as we see it here, has a real heart, albeit one that beats in 3/4 time.<br /><br />From the masquerades and balls held by all classes of society, to the revolutionary movements, innumerable newspapers and pamphlets, lively coffee houses, and seemingly endless games of political maneuvering, one feels the ferment and activity which must lead, eventually, to change. The liveliness of the city, as depicted here, is a visual and intellectual contrast to the formality and frailty of Emperor Franz Josef, making the twilight of his empire understandable and its demise inevitable. Even the empire's demise is stylish, however.  According to Morton:  As \\"The World War [came] to the city by the Danube, [it came] dressed as a ball.

Set on the slopes of Chilhowee Mountain in rural Tennessee, Bitter Milk is the strange coming-of-age story of a Loren Garland, a nine-year-old boy who lives with an assortment of weird family members and attends school with an equally weird assortment of teachers and students.  Bright but very fearful about school and all other aspects of his life, the 150-pound fourth-grader lacks friends his own age, and he clings emotionally to his mother, Opal.  The more he seeks attention from Opal, however, the more often his alterego, Luther, who is the book's narrator, clamors for attention.  Opal, who prefers to be called Avery, has been avoiding her extended family for almost a year while exploring life as a man, and she is frequently depressed and impatient with Loren.<br /><br />Upon the death of his grandmother and the sale of the family's land to developers, Opal/Avery suddenly disappears, telling Loren, in a peculiar note, to call her sister Ruby and to go there to dye eggs for Easter.  From this point on, Loren is shunted from relative to relative, and though he stops eating and blames himself for his mother's disappearance, he also begins to learn something new about himself in each bizarre household. Luther remains hidden inside him and stays relatively quiet until Loren begins to make friends with Eli, Ruby's abusive young stepson, who introduces him to the joys of alcohol and the sniffing of Magic Markers.<br /><br />Though the author frequently gives lyrical descriptions of nature--birds, animals, plants--he also shows the ignorance (the \\"ignartness\\") of man toward nature.  The trees Loren loves on the mountain are being bulldozed for development, a cat is grotesquely abused and then killed, a fish hooked through the eye is not put out of its pain.  However much these people abuse nature, however, they also abuse each other-breaking noses in fights, mocking each other, telling the elderly grandfather that he is going to die, deliberately goading a teacher and then defying her, tormenting fellow students.<br /><br />Filled with bizarre characters who resemble hominids more than humans, the novel shows a \\"society\\" that is still close to the level of tooth and claw.  Though Loren learns a good deal about himself, the characters around him do not, and many readers will neither identify with them nor care what happens to them.  Though there is a good deal of dark humor in their lives, the characters lack charm and the humor often falls flat.  Ultimately, the novel remains rooted in the unique, never developing the universal themes which make the reading of novels rewarding.  (3.5 stars) n Mary Whipple, tormenting fellow students.

Winner of the Commonwealth Writers Prize in 1995, Captain Corelli's Mandolin follows for sixty years the life of Pelagia and those who love her, beginning in World War II, when she and her father, a doctor on the small Greek island of Cephalonia, first get drawn into the war.  Attractive and intelligent, Pelagia thinks herself in love with Mandras, an illiterate Greek fisherman who leaves for war.  When the island is overtaken by the ineffectual  Italian army, Captain Antonio Corelli is billeted in their small house.  Corelli, whose response to \\"Heil, Hitler\\" was once \\"Heil, Puccini,\\" is a musician, a mandolin player, who quickly establishes a singing group (meeting in the company's latrines) in preference to waging war.  By the time the wounded Mandras returns, Pelagia and Corelli are in love.<br /><br />Author deBernieres vividly depicts the various political movements which play out in Cephalonia--the Italian occupation; the German \\"cleansing\\" in which the Germans, nearly defeated in Europe, exact revenge on the Italians who have, with a change of government, withdrawn their support; and the later Communist insurgency in Greece and their opposition by fascist partisans.  Always connecting these events to the lives of Pelagia, her father, Mandras, and Corelli, the author gracefully depicts the impact of political changes on the lives of ordinary people.<br /><br />The horrors of the German revenge on the Italians reflect the wartime mentality and contrast with the good feelings various participants have been able to engender on a personal level.  With the withdrawal of the Italians and Germans, the horrors of internecine warfare within the Greek community, and the extremes to which partisans, including Mandras, are willing to go are subjected to microscopic views.<br /><br />DeBernieres is equally adept at contrasting idealistic young love with the institutionalized mindlessness of political passion, the love of the arts and history with the expediencies of political dogma, and one's personal commitments to other individuals with the commitments to ideologies.  Realistic at the same time that it is also romantic, the novel conveys the absurdities of politics and places them within the context of real life.  The author's exuberant, descriptive style enlivens the present in Greece while also emphasizing the culture of the past, leading the reader to recognize, ultimately, that in all times, wherever one finds wit and humor, one also finds pathos lurking in the background. n Mary Whipplef political dogma, and one's personal commitments to other individuals with the commitments to ideologies.

In a simple, unpretentious, and totally accessible style, Murakami tells six tales, each with a message about life and death and love and loss. Simple, straightforward stories, haunting and hypnotic in tone, belie a complexity of themes and thought-provoking observations about the importance of creating your own identity, building relationships, sharing, and avoiding the emptiness of the \\"bogeyman's\\" box, \\"ready for everybody...[and] waiting with the lid open.\\"<br /><br />All the main characters are single or separated, and all feel isolated and empty, naïve in matters of love and life. In \\"UFO in Kashiro,\\" an abandoned husband agrees to help a friend by delivering a box to Hokkaido, learning that the box \\"contains the something that was inside you. You'll never get it back.\\" In \\"Landscape in Flatiron,\\" a 40-ish artist and a young girl meet and build a bonfire. \\"The fire itself has to be free,\\" he remarks, while the young girl comments on the emptiness of her life. In \\"All God's Children Can Dance,\\" a young man pursues the man he believes to be his father to an abandoned baseball field, \\"chasing the tail of the darkness inside [him].\\" \\"Thailand\\" features a doctor in her 40's who is told that she must get rid of the stone inside her and that \\"living and dying are, in a sense, of equal value.\\"<br /><br />In the last two stories, \\"Superfrog Saves Tokyo,\\" and \\"Honey Pie,\\" Murakami begins to offer more hope and direction to his characters. Superfrog, a 6' tall frog who needs a plodding banker to help him fight the Worm and save Tokyo from an earthquake, teaches that \\"the ultimate value of our lives is decided not by how we win but by how we lose.\\" And in \\"Honey Pie,\\" which brings all these themes together, a young man has an opportunity to find happiness with the only woman he's ever loved and her young daughter.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Murakami states his themes overtly, the stories themselves are enigmatic and the action unpredictable, and the reader will ponder his meanings and his images long after the stories are finished.

Noel Coward's ironically entitled novella \\"Star Quality,\\" written in 1951, describes the production of a new play, with all its attendant problems.  Filled with sly observations drawn from Coward's own theatrical experience, \\"Star Quality\\" is so full of dramatic life that it is easy to see why Coward himself attempted to convert it to a play in 1956, and why other playwrights, such as Christopher Luscombe in this version, have used Coward's own script as a base, adding to it and ultimately producing it as a play.<br /><br />\\"Star Quality\\" begins its lively satire of the theatre when the respected Ray Malcolm is hired to be director, and the egomaniacal star Lorraine Barrie is chosen to be leading lady. The clash of egos and wills between Malcolm and Barrie is a foregone conclusion, though each insists, almost as a refrain, that \\"the play comes first.\\"  Barrie, the \\"star,\\" insists that they hire the less-than-qualified Marian Blake as a supporting character, primarily because she knows that Blake will not (and cannot) compete with her for the limelight.  She then decides that the entire ending must be rewritten to give her a more dramatic final scene. When Malcolm decides to fire the newly hired Blake for incompetence and hire a new actor, Barrie starts using her trump cards, and the fate of the production hangs in the balance.<br /><br />The plot, with its fairly predictable twists, pokes fun at the all-too-common machinations of various theatrical characters driven by inflated egos.  The characters themselves are exaggerated stereotypes which the audience will recognize as humorous stock characters.  Of particular note, however, is the character of Tony, a friend of the director. Writing long before gay liberation, Coward is completely open here about the role of gays in the theatre and their influence on productions, though he skirted around this subject in his play Present Laughter.  Casting a jaundiced eye on his own profession, Coward uses his wit and mordant humor to remove the mystery and romance from play production at the same time that he reveals his own love and excitement for the action. n Mary Whippleant humor to remove the mystery and romance from play production at the same time that he reveals his own love and excitement for the action. n Mary Whipple <br />	2005-08-31

Written as a \\"play for voices\\" for the BBC, this historic audiotape features the all-Welsh cast of the original BBC production from 1954. Richard Burton is the First Voice, which connects all the characters, played by twenty-eight men, women, and children. With perfect diction and the sense of character which only a great actor can convey, Burton rolls his R's, modulates his voice in pitch and intensity, and makes Thomas's poetry come fully alive--full of alliteration and various kinds of rhyme, with nouns and adjectives used as verbs to convey action and sense impressions simultaneously, and always a wry humor and honesty of feeling.<br /><br />Depicting one full day in the life of a small town in Wales, Thomas shows its motley residents as they awaken, perform their daily tasks, socialize, gossip, and daydream about the past that might have been and the future that may yet hold hope. When night falls and the residents retire, their losses and disappointments, along with their escapes into dreams, are given voice and poignancy. Polly Garter, with her numerous children by numerous fathers, dreams of Willie, a very small man who was the love of her life. Captain Cat, the blind bell-ringer, thinks of all the sailors he knew who died at sea. Mr. Pugh dreams of poisoning his wife, and young Gwenny, who has extorted pennies from the little boys who do NOT want to kiss her, plans for the next day and more pennies.<br /><br />The sound effects provide context for the drama without overpowering the narrative--a cock's crow, the clip-clop of horses, the bark of dogs, footsteps, the sea, bell buoys--and simple songs add to the realism and the sense of character and place. A mournful tune performed by Polly Garter in a minor key, as she remembers Willie and compares him to her other lovers, is beautifully sung by Diana Maddox, her clear, bell-like voice and almost palpable sadness making her one of the most memorable of the characters. A humorous children's singing game, sung by local school children, gives added realism, and little Gwenny's song to three very young boys is delightfully cheeky.

A ghostly apparition in the misty lamplight, a faceless man who seems to have an inordinate interest in Daniel, a sadistic police inspector, and an incarnation of the devil himself all materialize as Daniel begins his search for information about Carax.

A mysterious photograph, letters which go astray, false identities, an abandoned mansion with a sobbing ghost, a matricide, an evil stepfather, thwarted love, mysterious disappearances, revenge which never dies, and murder most foul all complicate the action. The evil characters are truly villainous, Daniel and his father are truly virtuous, and the women whom Daniel and Julian Carax love are pure and true of heart.<br /><br />Though the novel offers a good escape, it is almost six hundred pages long. Extensive background information for virtually all the characters (and even a house) gives more information than the reader really needs, and many scenes could be compressed. Occasionally, the mood is broken by mild profanity and bathroom humor. This romance does achieve more relevance than some others, however, by being directly connected to the world of books, with a setting that reflects the political climate of Spain after the Civil War and World War II.

This lusciously depicted novel is both a vivid evocation of life in eighteenth century Paris and an homage to the least celebrated of our senses--that of smell. In language so onomatopoetic it must have been an almost insuperable challenge for the translator, Suskind tells the tale of Grenouille (Frog), an orphan on the streets of Paris whose hard life would have destroyed a less single-minded pursuer of the sensuous life.<br /><br />Grenouille's sense of smell is so subtly attuned that he can distinguish a single, elemental scent among the various aromas and stenches bombarding him, all vividly described by Suskind. He can identify individuals from their unique scents, a pursuit so compelling for him that he is willing to kill without conscience to preserve or distill the most glorious of these scents.  As Grenouille moves from his apprenticeship in a butcher shop (depicted in nauseatingly odoriferous detail) to that of a perfumer, one of the book's witty ironies, the reader is bombarded with scents so intoxicatingly described that s/he may reach for the nearest spray perfume in order to participate personally in the author's sensuous celebrations.<br /><br />One of the most gloriously descriptive (and sly) novels you will ever read, it is also an unforgettable commentary on depravity, unfettered arrogance, and ironically misplaced idealism, which culminates in a final, thunderous scene of exuberant depravity.

One of the most seductive of all ghost stories, Turn of the Screw is not a tale for young people inured to Halloween I and II or Tales from the Crypt. It is a sophisticated and subtle literary exercise in which the author creates a dense, suggestive, and highly ambiguous story, its suspense and horror generated primarily by what the author does NOT say and does not describe. Compelled to fill in the blanks from his/her own store of personal fears, the reader ultimately conjures up a more horrifying set of images and circumstances than anything an author could impose from without.<br /><br />Written in 1898, this is superficially the tale of a governess who accepts the job of teaching two beautiful, young children whose uncle-guardian wants nothing to do with them. On a symbolic level, however, it is a study of the mores and prejudices of the times and, ultimately, of the nature of Evil. The governess fears that ghosts of the former governess Miss Jessel and her lover, valet Peter Quint, have corrupted the souls of little Flora and Miles and have won them to the side of Evil. The children deny any knowledge of ghosts, and, in fact, only the governess actually sees them. Were it not for the fact that the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, can identify them from the governess's descriptions, one might be tempted to think that the governess is hallucinating.<br /><br />Though the governess is certainly neurotic and repressed, this novel was published ten years before Freud, suggesting that the story should be taken at face value, as a suspenseful but enigmatic Victorian version of a Faustian struggle for the souls of these children. The ending, which comes as a shock to the reader, is a sign that such struggles should never be underestimated. As is always the case with James, the formal syntax, complex sentence structure, and elaborately constructed narrative are a pleasure to read for anyone who loves language, formality, and intricate psychological labyrinths.

One of the most intricate and haunting ghost stories since Turn of the Screw, which it resembles in many ways, The Ghost Writer is captivating, filled with romance, Gothic twists, melodramatic surprises, vibrant imagery, and a series of rich and overlapping stories within stories.  Complex and carefully constructed, it is also hugely entertaining,  totally involving the reader in good, old-fashioned haunted happenings which turn out to be even eerier than they appear at first.<br /><br />Young Gerard Hugh Freeman grows up in rural Mawson, Australia, a bleak place that is in marked contrast to Staplefield, the English country house where his mother grew up. Extremely private, she has revealed almost nothing else about her family background, and when Gerard, curious, opens her locked bureau and finds some personal papers, his angry mother refuses to speak about her past at all.  Gerard, one the \\"legions of the lost: the swots, the cowards,\\" eventually finds a pen pal in whom he confides everything, Alice Jessell, a paralyzed English girl whose parents are dead.<br /><br />Continuing to investigate his mother, Gerard eventually discovers among her belongings an eerie ghost story written by Viola Hatherley, who may or may not be his grandmother, one of four stories she published in \\"The Chameleon,\\" a short-lived British magazine.  As Gerard grows up, he eventually uncovers the remaining three ghost stories by Viola, all as fascinating as the first, and as the reader discovers when these stories are inserted into the novel, the lives of Gerard and his family overlap with the plots of these stories.  When he is in his thirties, and still pursing Alice, he finally visits the place in England that appears to be his mother's \\"Staplefield,\\" and the details of his mother's life suddenly combine with Viola's four vibrant ghost stories to precipitate an intriguing conclusion.<br /><br />Harwood is a fine writer, giving detailed physical descriptions and creating unforgettable images which reveal similarities among people, surroundings, and events in Viola's four ghost stories. The mystery and suspense begin on the first page, and increase geometrically as Gerard tries to solve his questions while creating even more mysteries.  The parallels among the stories and with Gerard's life keep the reader on edge, trying to figure out who Gerard is, how he might fit into these stories, and even whether Gerard's life is a story manipulated by some great, unknown storyteller.

Alice Thomas Ellis skewers the attitudes and expectations which her characters bring to love and marriage, both as they live their own lives and as they judge the lives of others. But she is also an understanding author, recognizing that their foibles and limitations stem from their upbringing and experience, as they muddle along as best they can, aided by each other, and sometimes the church. This three-part novel concerns the imminent marriage of twenty-year-old Margaret to Syl, a man in his forties, and is told through three points of view: Margaret, who does not love Syl but intends to go through with the wedding; Syl's mother, the sensible Mrs. Monro, who, abandoned by her husband, does not want the marriage to take place; and Lili, a friend of Margaret's mother from school in Egypt, who arrives in a whirlwind, determined to upset the status quo.<br /><br />From Margaret we learn of her passionate first love and a shocking death that have occurred during the year she spent away at school in Egypt. Devoutly religious, Margaret is torn between the concepts of romantic and religious love, and she cannot seem to reconcile the church's teachings regarding love, sex, sin, and death. Mrs. Monro, an elderly lady for whom death is very real, if not imminent, is hiding secrets associated with her own past love life. For her, too, love is associated with death and God, though in ways vastly different from Margaret's experience. Into this mix comes Lili, half Egyptian, half English, a free spirit unconcerned with traditional, churchly definitions of sin, and sexually liberated in her own life. Lili is determined to save Margaret from the \\"pointless secular martyrdom\\" of marriage.<br /><br />A sensitive, philosophical exploration of love and sex, God and sin, and life and death, the novel is also an examination of the compromises people make, willingly or unwillingly, in order to find happiness during their lives and loves. Sparkling dialogue and thoughtful interior monologues reveal the sadness, loneliness, and confusion within many of the characters, while Ellis's sense of irony and ability to create absurd scenes lift the mood with cathartic comedy.

Zapotek \\"Zet\\" van Heerden is beaten, bruised, and sleeping off a drinking binge in a South African jail when he is hired to work as a private detective for attorney Hope Beneke.  Hope's client is the lover of Johannes Jacobus Smit, an antiques dealer who was tortured with a blowtorch before being shot and killed.  His safe, reportedly containing two million dollars, has been emptied, and his will, purportedly leaving everything to his lover, has been stolen.  If it cannot be found within a week, everything will go to the state.<br /><br />Living on the edge and decidedly antisocial, Zet van Heerden is fighting numerous personal demons.  Once honored as an intelligent and resourceful crime fighter, he feels responsible for the death of his mentor, Nagel, who was shot in front of him.  Filled with rage which he does not even try to control, he now lashes out at the world and then escapes into an alcoholic stupor.<br /><br />As van Heerden tries to unearth the will and information about Smit's past, he also investigates events from 1976, when Smit was in the army, and from 1983, when Smit accumulated an enormous amount of cash.  During his research, Zet is haunted by two other cases--one from 1991, involving the murder and mutilation of a woman who lived behind him when he was a teenager, the event which led him to join the police force, and the recent tragedy involving Nagel's death, which led him to leave the force.<br /><br />As van Heerden's family background, his past love life, and the events which have brought him to his present state unfold, the reader comes to appreciate how disturbed van Heerden really is and to feel sympathy for him.  A wide variety of peripheral characters in various police organizations add to the depth of the novel and expand its scope, as van Heerden must deal with the Murder and Robbery division, a \\"friendly\\" gangster with a large security force, the Urban Anti-Terrorist Force, the military Defense Force, and the American consular office.<br /><br />Meyer resists the temptation to turn this compelling psychological mystery and character study into a quasi-love story, choosing instead to involve the reader less through romance than through intriguing and alternating stories, time periods, and points of view.  Details about South African life and the individual characters give immediacy and emotional intensity to the action, and Meyer's deliberate withholding of key information keeps the various mysteries fresh and exciting.  The conclusion is satisfying on all levels, making this unusual and psychologically astute mystery far more intriguing than the typical police procedural. n Mary Whipplee temptation to turn this compelling psychological mystery and character study into a quasi-love story, choosing instead to involve the reader less through romance than through intriguing and alternating stories, time periods, and points of view.

Written by James Prideaux, this long-running Broadway play yielded a 1973 Tony Award for Julie Harris in her role as Mary Todd Lincoln, a woman seemingly without friends or allies after the death of Abraham Lincoln.  Mrs. Lincoln, as we see her here, has long been at odds with the world. Her sister and southern relatives have always believed Lincoln beneath her. Congress has refused to reimburse her for installing central heating and indoor plumbing in the White House, and they have refused to approve her pension. The press uses her vituperation to their own advantage, and the fates have taken two of her sons before adulthood.<br /><br />Full of passion and afraid of no one, Mrs. Lincoln is a woman willing to go to any extreme to protect her husband's memory. Bright, often amusing, and very astute, she is also extremely vulnerable, sick with loneliness and worry, and too prideful to bow to politicians. As she moves to Germany, Chicago, St. Augustine, France, Spain, and ultimately back to Springfield, Illinois, always trying to find peace, her instability and lack of contact with reality become obvious, though her commitment to her husband's memory never waivers.<br /><br />The character of son Tad elicits great sympathy as he tries to help his mother while he lies dying of tuberculosis. Robert Todd Lincoln, the scapegoat for his mother's rage, maintains his patient firmness with her but reflects the enormous difficulties of dealing with a self-destructive parent.  A frustrated Senator Austin locks horns with Mary in a couple of dramatic and hot-tempered scenes, revealing his own love of power in holding up her pension.<br /><br />The production belongs to Mrs. Lincoln, however, a woman full of maddening contradictions, alternating between anger toward Congress and solicitude toward her sick son, between good-hearted protectiveness and a need to dominate, and between independence and complete helplessness. Showing an enormous range of emotion, Mary Lincoln lives and breathes, and even when she is in the grip of her demons, she remains a sympathetic character. A fascinating psychological study of a much-maligned First Lady, this production was a high water mark in Broadway theatre and in the made-for-TV production, recorded (with Julie Harris) by the Broadway Theatre Archive in 1976.

Zsuzsa Bank, in her debut novel, accomplishes a remarkable feat.  She writes a novel with virtually no plot, yet she makes us care about her characters and their lives.  It is 1956 in Hungary, a time of rebellion and upheaval, and Katalin Velencei, wife of Kalman Velencei and mother of young Kata (about eight) and Isti (about six), has abandoned her family without a goodbye and taken off for the west.  Devastated by the desertion of his wife, Kalman, a man who once loved swimming, now spends hours in a trance, staring at a picture of his wife, sometimes unable to recognize his children.  \\"We called it 'diving,'\\"  Kata says.  \\"We'd ask each other, Has Father come back from diving?\\"<br /><br />Packing up the children, Kalman moves them in with a series of friends and relatives, constantly moving throughout the country, keeping the children out of school, and offering them no sense of stability.  \\"It was as if someone had dropped Isti and me into syrup and forgotten about us,\\" Kata remarks.  Lonely and longing for her mother, Kata begins to steal letters from other people's mailboxes.  Isti memorizes train schedules.  When it is time to start school, they pack and move again.  Isti starts sleeping with his eyes open, hides in the woods all night, and stays outside in the winter until he turns blue.  Time becomes meaningless--every day blends into the next with little or no change.<br /><br />Bank divides the novel into a dozen separate sections, each one describing life from the point of view of one of the people in the novel--Kalman, Katalin (the missing mother), and the various characters who play roles in the lives of Kata and Isti as they move from family to family.  The \\"excitements\\" in their lives--seeing snow, riding in a car, visiting a train station--are ordinary events, of interest only because they break the monotony.<br /><br />Bank's simple, clear style features staccato sentences which complement the abrupt movements of the children from place to place.  Images, usually connected to mundane details, are presented matter-of-factly--Isti chewing a bite of cake so loudly \\"we could hear his teeth clicking\\";  Kata feeling as if \\"we were living on a spinning top, on the pointed end where you turn it and then let it go...\\"  The stories of the characters' lives, so rooted in the ordinary, take on particular poignancy as they come to represent the lives of legions of other people who, through the accident of war or rebellion, find their lives uprooted, their families torn, their homes vanishing, all sense of \\"normalcy\\" evaporated.  Ultimately, Bank's recreation of the reality of two young children (and by extension the Hungarian people) achieves a universal significance which, for many readers, may transcend plot. n Mary Whipplennected to mundane details, are presented matter-of-factly--Isti chewing a bite of cake so loudly \\"we could hear his teeth clicking\\";  Kata feeling as if \\"we were living on a spinning top, on the pointed end where you turn it and then let it go...\\"   The stories of the characters' lives, so rooted in the ordinary, take on particular poignancy as they come to represent the lives of legions of other people who, through the accident of war or rebellion, find their lives uprooted, their families torn, their homes vanishing, all sense of \\"normalcy\\" evaporated.

In the summer of 1938, when Leo Joachim arrives at the ironically named Camp Friend-Indeed, he brings with him a set of serious problems.  He is an orphan living at an orphanage, having previously been hospitalized for some sort of terrible trauma involving the deaths of his parents.  Camp is supposed to provide him with some sort of respite from the terrors he has already faced in his life.  Though he is a talented violinist and a naturalist with an interest in spiders, he has no interest in baseball or any other athletic contest by which the various camp units compete for the Hartsig trophy, given to the best unit at the camp.<br /><br />Paired with Tiger, a sympathetic young man who appreciates Leo's talents and tries to ignore his differences from the other boys, Leo gets along pretty well, at first, though he remains somewhat apart from the other boys, preferring to ignore the special baseball practice and stay in the woods to observe an owl and practice his violin.  When he violates some of the \\"sacred\\" camp traditions, Reese Hartsig, his counselor and the son of the camp's wealthy founder, worries that Leo may cost the Jeremiah unit the Hartsig trophy, and Reese becomes Leo's active enemy.<br /><br />As he has done in so many other novels, Tryon builds inexorable suspense.  As Reese begins to promote the \\"you're with me or against me\\" mentality among the other campers in the unit, the pressures on Leo increase cruelly, and he finds himself being shunned, mocked, cast out, and placed in increasingly dangerous situations, until he is finally summoned before a kangaroo court and tried by Reese and his camp-henchmen.<br /><br />Though the characters are sometimes clich&eacute;d and the action sometimes predictable, the psychological torment of Leo is all too realistic, and most readers will recall similar nightmarish incidents from childhood.  The setting in 1938 draws obvious parallels with the rise of Hitler, and Reese is clearly a \\"golden boy\\" who expects always to be part of the winning team, surrounded by yes-men.  The cruel torments of Leo and his friend Fritz, the lone Jewish youth, show, within the microcosm of a boys' camp, the macrocosm of events in Europe.  The climax is stunning, and while it may play on the heartstrings and be an easy way for the author to resolve the problems of Leo's torture, no reader will be disappointed by the final drama.  Though this is not a psychological horror story on the level of Tryon's The Other, or even Harvest Home, it is a well-drawn novel of suspense which will appeal especially to young adults.

Ladysmith, South Africa, was the site of one of the most horrific and bloody episodes in the whole sad story of the Boer War, a war that was waged at the turn of the 20th century between England and Holland for control of another country's riches and in which thousands of native, as well as foreign, people met unnecessary and unimaginably gory ends. In the siege of Ladysmith, the Boers, under General Joubert, held hostage twenty thousand British soldiers, civilians, and African mineworkers for 120 days.  Foden creates and follows a variety of characters as \\"civilization\\" in Ladysmith deteriorates during the siege and conditions become atrocious, revealing the characters' attitudes towards colonialism, their sense of \\"mission,\\" and their understanding of the world.<br /><br />Using multiple points of view, Foden focuses on characters from the British ruling class, British journalists (including Winston Churchill), British and Irish regiments, British settlers and expatriates, Indians (including Mahatma Gandhi), native families displaced by the war, and, of course, the Boers. The reader quickly becomes caught up in the lives of individuals from each of these groups, feeling genuine sympathy for many of them and mourning the tragedies which befall them all as the siege and the bloody skirmishes continue, unabated.<br /><br />Somehow, Bella Kiernan, the daughter of an Irish hotelkeeper, on whom much of the action focuses, manages to fall in love, first with a British soldier, and eventually with a Portuguese barber.  As conditions worsen, the characters' basic natures are revealed, and as the Victorian strictures regarding sexuality begin to fall, the story takes on a sense of realism and modernity.<br /><br />Like the siege itself, there's a hopelessness to each of the characters' stories, which Foden carries to their individual conclusions (in some cases at the end of World War II) by appending a final section aptly entitled \\"Monologues of the Dead.\\"  Foden is primarily a story-teller here, more concerned with the wide sweep of the action, its political complexities, and its reflection of colonial attitudes than with characters.  The many characters, though often fascinating for what they reveal about the period, tend to be a bit flat in comparison to the historical drama.  Though this novel does not have a compelling main character, like Idi Amin in Foden's previous novel, The Last King of Scotland, the author nevertheless presents a powerful story of unimaginable carnage.

Married to a country vicar, Susan leads a life completely lacking in excitement, and in this long monologue she describes her day-to-day activities in minute, often hilarious, detail.  A perceptive woman with a sharp eye, sarcastic wit, and palpable yearning for what is missing from her life, she describes the \\"fan club\\" that constantly surrounds Geoffrey, their patronizing attitudes toward her, and Geoffrey's own cocoon-like existence.  Emotionally blind, Geoffrey even praises Susan's cooking, a dinner of \\"chicken wings with tuna fish sauce,\\" tinned peaches for dessert, and instant coffee with \\"Carnation milk,\\" leading Susan to refer satirically to \\"the supreme joy of the married state.\\"<br /><br />Susan has been committed to Geoffrey and the church for so long that she dates all events by the church calendar and often explains herself through Biblical references.  Lately, however, she has begun to question whether she even believes in God anymore, and she has silently rebelled by smoking and drinking in private.  By her own admission, she must wander farther and farther from the vicarage to obtain the requisite alcohol to get through her days, and on \\"the second Sunday after Trinity,\\" she finds a new escape.  In an Indian grocery store, she meets Ramesh, a twenty-seven-year-old clerk with \\"beautiful teeth,\\" and \\"wonderful legs.\\"  Though she has always regarded sex as \\"shame-faced fumblings\\" and \\"frightful collisions,\\" she finds herself drawn inextricably to Ramesh, and soon finds a \\"bed among the lentils\\" and a kind of happiness she has never known.<br /><br />Playwright Alan Bennett, perhaps most famous as the primary author of the sixties revue \\"Beyond the Fringe,\\" shows as much comic irony here as he does in that landmark production, and just as much precision with language.  Wielding language like a rapier, Bennett, through Susan, makes word choices that convey a multitude of meanings, emotions, and attitudes simultaneously.  Her description of Mrs. Frobisher's flower arrangement, for example--a \\"Japanese number\\" using a \\"test tube\\" (vase) into which she \\"throttles\\" a lone carnation--shows Mrs. Frobisher's sanctimonious behavior, her annoyance with Susan, the depths of Susan's frustration, and Susan's scorn of Geoffrey's \\"fan club.\\"<br /><br />Behind the smart remarks, quips, and self-deprecation is an immense sadness, however, and, when portrayed by a versatile actress (like Maggie Smith, who made the role her own), Susan becomes a character of sympathy as well as comic irony.

When he first meets Charles Strickland, a London stockbroker, the young narrator of this novel thinks of him as \\"good, honest, dull, and plain.\\" When Strickland suddenly abandons his wife and children and takes off for Paris, however, the narrator decides he is a cad. Though he has had no training, Strickland has decided to become an artist, a drive so strong that he is willing to sacrifice everything toward that end. Anti-social, and feeling no obligation to observe even the smallest social decencies, Strickland becomes increasingly boorish as he practices his art. Eventually, he makes his way to Tahiti, where he \\"marries,\\" moves to a remote cottage, and spends the rest of his life devoted to his art.<br /><br />Basing the novel loosely on the life of Paul Gauguin, Maugham creates an involving and often exciting story. His narrator is a writer who feels impelled to set down his memories of his early interactions with Strickland in London and Paris after Strickland's death and posthumous success. Because the narrator never saw Strickland after he left Paris, he depends on his meetings with a ship captain and a woman in Papeete for information about Strickland after Strickland arrived in Tahiti. The ship captain is described as a story-teller who may be spinning tall tales, a constant reminder to the reader that this is fiction, and not a biography of Gauguin.<br /><br />By depicting Strickland as a \\"dull, plain\\" man suddenly gripped by an obsession so overwhelming that nothing else matters to him, Maugham involves the reader in his actions, which even the narrator claims not to understand. The least convincing aspect of Strickland's characterization is the narrator's observation that Strickland is completely indifferent to his wife of seventeen years and his children. No confrontation between Strickland and his wife appears, and one wonders if perhaps Maugham found himself unable to depict such an abandonment realistically. The story moves quickly, however, and whatever is sacrificed in the characterization is more than recouped in the plot and its development.<br /><br />Straightforward in its story line, the novel is romantic in its depiction of the artist in the grip of an obsession, his subsequent abandonment of civilization and return to nature, his suffering of a long terminal illness (during which he paints his masterpiece), and the fate of this creation further develop the romantic themes. Good, old-fashioned story-telling at its best, this uncomplicated story, written in 1919, still has broad appeal.

Palace intrigue of the highest order, conducted by courtiers and officials who will do anything to achieve their goals, makes this a stimulating and thoroughly engrossing novel. The Danish court from 1768 - 1772 pulses with life as powerful personalities collide in their rush to fill the power vacuum resulting from the weakness of King Christian VII, a sensitive, half-mad 17-year-old boy, married to Caroline Mathilde, the 14-year-old sister of Britain's King George III.  This is a time of great intellectual ferment as the new ideas of the Enlightenment, with their value on the individual and freedom, begin to threaten the feudal basis of the old, autocratic monarchies of Europe, and more frightening to the courtiers, their own power within their countries.<br /><br />Enquist brilliantly recreates the psychology of the king, a puppet who desperately wants to please the courtiers and officials and is tormented when he does not, a bright but \\"ravaged child,\\" who from his earliest years was regularly flogged, ridiculed, beaten for casual conversations, forcibly separated from everyone with whom he developed attachments, shamed, and driven mad by his own courtiers. When he becomes interested in the enlightened ideas of Voltaire and Diderot and is celebrated by these philosophers on a trip around the continent, his nervous and threatened court decides he needs a physician. What they never expect is that the physician they engage, Johann Friedrich Struensee from Germany, will establish a relationship with Christian, share his enlightened ideas, and eventually become the de facto king.<br /><br />Bursting with dramatic scenes of Machiavellian court intrigue and the palpable fear of the Enlightenment, the novel is also filled with powerfully moving scenes of psychological abuse, tenderness, passion, love, and genuine sadness. Though the reader knows from the opening pages (and from the historical record) what the outcome of the court struggle will be, Enquist manages to endow it with an immediacy and tension which totally engage the reader. By focusing on the court, rather than on the populace, he makes the Enlightenment and the revolutions it inspires throughout Europe come alive from a new perspective, and in creating this novel based on history, he brings to life both the sad and abused child-king Christian and Struensee, the enlightened but politically naïve mentor who paid the ultimate price.

Robert Merivel, who has studied to be a physician, is appointed, ironically, to be veterinarian for the spaniels of King Charles II, who has recently been restored to the throne following the death of Oliver Cromwell. Merivel enjoys the gaiety and frivolity of court life, and, a bit of a fool, he entertains the king. The king's decision to placate one of his lovers by marrying off his favorite mistress to Robert Merivel, spells the beginning of the end for Merivel's tenuous fortunes. Warned not to fall in love with his wife, Celia Clemence, since the king intends to continue seeing her, Merivel cannot help himself, and he is cast out, losing not only the king's affection, but also his house and, of course his wife.<br /><br />Joining a group of men who work at an asylum for the insane, Merivel learns that there are deeper concerns in life than the hedonism of his life at court, and he develops genuine affection for several of the kindly Quaker men with whom he works. When he transgresses the society's rules, however, he is cast out from there, too, ending up in London at the time of the Great Plague and eventually the Great London Fire.<br /><br />Painting vivid pictures of Merivel's life--at court, at the asylum in Whittlesea, and in the neighborhoods of London--author Rose Tremain brings the age, its customs, its science, and its social structure to life. The years of 1664 - 1666 are especially difficult, and as Merivel lives through the horrors of the Plague and the panic of the Great Fire, which Tremain recreates with the drama they deserve, the reader can see Merivel becoming less a fool and more a human. Like the restoration of the king to the throne, Merivel's \\"restoration\\" to dignity takes place after a period of dark reflection and self-examination, and both Merivel and the country learn from their travails.<br /><br />Tremain develops Merivel's personal transformation with sensitivity, finesse, and much ironic humor, and when, at last, he is noticed again by the court, his understanding of himself and his role in the world is far more profound than it was before. Depicting the personal and the philosophical turmoils of these early Restoration years with a historian's eye for detail and a detached observer's sense of wit, Tremain illustrates the contradictions of this period realistically and often with dark humor. A fine historical novel, Restoration transcends its period, offering observations, themes, and lessons for the present day.

In this stunning play, set in a holding room in Vichy, France, in 1942, Arthur Miller introduces nine men who have been picked up on suspicion that they are Jews or Jewish sympathizers. As they are called, one by one, to be interrogated by Nazi officials before being released or put on the thirty-car freight train waiting at the station, they reveal their thinking, their rationalizations for having been picked up, and their belief that this is all a big mistake. A German major involved in the interrogations also begins to question his own role, reminding his colleague, a professor in charge of carrying out Nazi racial policies, that he is a \\"line officer,\\" not trained for his role.<br /><br />Waiting to be questioned are an actor, a waiter, a businessman, a psychoanalyst, a Marxist railroad worker, a gypsy, an ancient Hasid, a fourteen-year-old boy, and an Austrian prince. As they talk and begin to share bits of information, Miller examines the tendency of ordinary men, who are often victims, to become immobilized when faced with \\"an atrocity...that is inconceivable,\\" to refuse to believe that such behavior can possibly happen in a civilized world. At the same time, he also examines those others, the Nazis and their collaborators in France, who serve an ideology, not mankind, those who subordinate themselves so completely to an abstract concept that they believe \\"there are no persons anymore.\\"<br /><br />As the truth about the waiting train and its destination slowly emerges, the sense of dread becomes palpable. The psychoanalyst tries to make his fellow captives understand that it is their belief that the world is essentially rational that is their main problem, and his conversations with the prince, von Berg, are pivotal to the action. Von Berg, a Christian who left his property and thousand-year-old heritage to escape to France, does not understand that he himself is complicit in the rise of the Nazis for not taking action when he had the chance.<br /><br />Beautifully paced, the play is an unusually sophisticated treatment of this subject. Miller does not see events purely in black and white, showing instead that everyone creates his own reality to keep from accepting the unthinkable. Written in 1964, while Miller was representing the New York Herald Tribune at the Frankfurt war crimes trials of officials from Auschwitz/Birkenau, this play is Miller's creative reaction to the atrocities he has heard first-hand--and one of his most powerful plays.

Feeling utterly betrayed by their leaders, twenty-six women from all over Bosnia meet with Swanee Hunt, former US Ambassador to Austria and Chair of Women Waging Peace, a global policy initiative.  In their own words, they describe the war which ravaged their country and reduced it to rubble.  As they make clear from the outset, this war was not a result of age-old ethnic antagonisms in the Balkans, where city after city had been peacefully multi-ethnic and where most families had loyalties to more than one group.  It was the direct result, they believe, of the nationalism fomented by unscrupulous politicians, especially Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic, as they seized power and wealth in the vacuum which existed following the death of Marshall Tito.<br /><br />The twenty-six speakers are Serbs, Croats, Muslims, Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, atheists (former Communists), and Jews, all bright, articulate women who are, and have been, working to heal their society.  They include engineers, several journalists and physicians, a teacher, a member of the Bosnian Parliament, a professor at the School of Economics, a landscape architect, a member of the seven-member shared Presidency, a farm wife, a flower shop owner, a teenage student, and an art gallery owner, and they represent all areas of Bosnia, from Srebrenica to Mostar, Tuzla, and Sarajevo.<br /><br />With one voice, they blame their politicians for the atrocities of the war, pointing out that their leaders' manipulation of the international press and their sectarian chauvinism led to ethnic fundamentalism in a country which had previously been multicultural.  The imposition of traditional roles on women led to their enforced withdrawal from decision-making, and they universally agree that that they might have been able to influence the direction of the country toward more cultural understanding and better communication if they had been allowed to continue their previous political, professional, and social roles.<br /><br />The stories here are lively, personal, often incredibly sad, and absolutely unforgettable.  Beautiful color portraits of the women, along with brief biographies, make each woman a \\"living\\" voice, and the reader is struck by how much these women typify women around the world.  Most remarkably the women, despite the losses of parents, husbands, sons, and friends, all continue rebuilding their country, ignoring ethnic labels as they work to get housing for all refugees, find medical supplies and equipment, establish a women's collective, work with rape victims, plan conferences to bring together women from all over the country, make radio broadcasts, organize news agencies, write books, promote international awareness of the atrocities in Bosnia (especially in Srebrenica), care for the elderly, become ambassadors, and run schools.<br /><br />Hunt's book and the words of these remarkable women are a major achievement in the understanding of this terrible war, a war far different from what most of us have been led to believe.  Fourteen magnificent photographs, in addition to the women's portraits, will wring the heart--an unrecognizable national library, a snow-covered Sarajevo soccer field which is now a cemetery, and a decimated dormitory in the Olympic village.  Yet amidst the carnage are smiling women who are changing the face of Bosnia.  As Kada tells Hunt, \\"Thank you for telling my story.

Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.<br /><br />Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.<br /><br />Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.<br /><br />Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.<br /><br />Love and the formal protocol or marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.<br /><br />Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

Fans of Maisie Dobbs will delight in this addition to the  series, and those who are new to her have a treat in store.  All these mysteries take place in the aftermath of World War I, this one occurring between September and October, 1930.  Maisie is a survivor, having enlisted, at seventeen, in the nursing corps, where she served in France in the final, horrific days of the war.  A terrible attack, which killed many of the doctors, nurses, and soldiers where she was working, has left her suffering nightmares more than ten years later.  Now working as a psychologist/investigator in London, Maisie stays busy to avoid dealing with her demons.<br /><br />Three mysteries unfold simultaneously.  Avril Jarvis, age 13, is arrested for the murder of her \\"uncle\\" when she is found with a knife in her hand and blood on her clothes.  Penniless, she has no counsel until Maisie takes a case involving Sir Cecil Lawton, whom she persuades to represent Avril as part of her fee.  Sir Cecil's son Ralph disappeared during the war in France, and his wife, believing him still alive, has exacted a deathbed promise that Sir Cecil will search for him.  In addition, one of Maisie's friends from the Ambulance Corps, now married to a wealthy author in France, has begged her to try to find where the third of her brothers died and was buried in France.<br /><br />The horrors of World War I pervade the novel, and when Maisie goes to France, these horrors come alive, for both the reader and for Maisie, as she learns she must \\"slay her dragons\\" at last.  Intriguing characters add color to the novel--a doctor who has been with the secret service, a psychic who knows too much about Maisie, a paralyzed member of Parliament who was a close friend of Ralph Lawton, and an elegant woman and her granddaughter who live in a decaying castle.<br /><br />As the mysteries develop, a plethora of key photographs, kept by numerous characters, connect some of the characters with specific times and places.  Romantic elements, such as a secret passageway leading to a musty room, a hidden journal written in code, assumed identities, an important clue buried under a tree, and several attacks on Maisie keep the action moving.

In a powerful opening scene, fourteen-year-old Carson Fielding, of Twisted Tree, South Dakota, approaches Magnus Yarborough, the slickest and wealthiest man in town, negotiates to buy a horse, and succeeds--surprisingly, for his named price.  Twelve years later, Carson, broke, takes a job training some of Yarborough's horses and teaching Yarborough's wife to ride.  Once again, he succeeds in his mission, but this time he makes a permanent enemy of Yarborough.<br /><br />Carson's view of the world is limited to horses, the ranch, what he has learned from his late grandfather, and his recent discovery of love, but his knowledge grows when he is contacted by Earl Walks Alone, a Lakota teenager, and Willi Schubert, a German foreign exchange student, asking for help.  Earl, a senior in high school, has discovered a small pen containing three starving and thirsty horses, exposed to the elements in a remote area, hidden from all roads.  When Carson investigates with the boys, he is stunned, recognizing these as Yarborough's horses, and he suddenly understands why they are being tortured.  Along with Ted Kills Many, an alcoholic Lakota in his late twenties, the four decide to rescue the horses and to do it in the spirit of Iktomi, the trickster of Indian lore.<br /><br />Though the idea of rescuing the horses controls the action, the rescue is more important symbolically than in real-time.  Each of the four young men has special reasons, clearly developed, for identifying with the plight of these animals--reasons connected to their pasts, their understanding of how man and nature are related, and their understanding of the uses and abuses of power.  Meyers creates much more than a simple coming-of-age story here, delving into the very essence of life itself, while keeping his style unpretentious and his plot lines simple.<br /><br />Stories the characters learn from their parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles connect the various themes, unite the characters, and show the thematic overlaps of cultures.  As the young characters recall these often dramatic stories and hear new ones, they also understand that underlying all stories are dreams, some living and some destroyed, some emanating from culture and some coming from within.

An intense family drama which begins in 1935 and ends in 2035, the novel revolves around Constantine Stassos, a Greek who emigrates to the U.S. and eventually marries Mary Cuccio, an Italian girl who also wants to escape her home.  He eventually fathers three children--Susan, who marries young to escape her father;  Billy, who goes off to Harvard and an alternative lifestyle;  and Zoe, who leaves for a hippie life in New York.  When the children end up as parents themselves, their children's lives are also traced, as they, too, look for independence and a form of escape.<br /><br />Filled with passion, as each character tries to define his/her own life, often using love and sex as their springboards to new lives, the characters reflect the eras in which they live.  This is both a strength and limitation in the novel: a wonderful sense of universality pervades the struggles of the characters through the various generations, but their specific struggles are typical of their periods and easy to predict.<br /><br />The characters themselves are well developed, but though they all possess unique qualities and eccentricities, they are also examples of cultural stereotypes.  Constantine is an up-by-the-bootstraps success as a developer, but he is less successful as a husband.  Mary tries to be the perfect wife and mother and becomes frustrated.  Susan, a brittle striver in a tepid marriage, has one perfect child.  Billy is gay, and Zoe dabbles in drugs and free love.  Constantine's grandchildren are a perfect preppie and an interracial child living in a single parent household.<br /><br />The most vivid character in the novel ironically, is not a member of the family.  S/he is Cassandra, Zoe's transvestite guardian angel, a character so vibrant and so full of life that she dominates the scenes in which she appears and is almost solely responsible for any humor in the novel.  (A scene in which Mary has a phone conversation with her, not knowing she is physically a male, is darkly hilarious, and Mary's first meeting with her is unforgettable.)<br /><br />As the characters face discrimination, an almost-incestuous relationship, gay initiation, drugs, AIDS, divorce, illness, suicide, unplanned pregnancy, family rejection, and death, they also discover the forces which bring families together.  Even those who \\"escape\\" find themselves inevitably connected to their family past.  The search for love, the need for independence, the enduring connections of family, and the importance of memory enliven this generational saga.  Written in beautiful prose and filled with perfect details, the novel revolves around honest characters expressing real emotion and learning real lessons. n Mary WhippleMary's first meeting with her is unforgettable.)

In the author's \\"Prelude in a Saloon,\\" published as the preface of this trilogy, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist William Kennedy portrays himself as Daniel Quinn, nephew of Billy Phelan (of Billy Phelan's Greatest Game) and grandson of Francis Phelan (of Ironweed), as he begins an interview with an old gangster who worked closely with Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond (of Legs).  With tongue-in-cheek humor, Quinn/Kennedy reveals how his writing career began and how he came to know the main characters of this trio of books set in Depression-era Albany, New York.<br /><br />Legs, set in 1930 - 1931, is a fictional biography of Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond, thief/bootlegger/murderer, a man who lived the high life and who double-crossed and cheated his way to success, controlling speakeasies, illegal alcohol, real estate, and gambling, a man who survived eleven bullets in three separate assassination attempts before finally being brought down.  An uncomplicated but well-written and often violent novel, Legs sets the scene for Billy Phelan's Greatest Game and Ironweed, both set in 1938. (4 stars)<br /><br />Billy Phelan's Greatest Game is far more sophisticated, with more fully drawn characters, well-developed suspense, and themes dealing with fathers and sons and their values--intergenerational problems which reveal the changing morality of Depression-era Albany.

As the novel opens, Ellen Gulden is in jail, on suspicion of having aided in the death of her mother, a woman who had been experiencing agonizing pain from inoperable cancer.  As Ellen reminisces about the five months she spent caring for her mother, the novel develops into much more than the story of her mother's death.  Ultimately, it is the story of Ellen's emotional and spiritual coming of age, a positive story of growth and love, not the maudlin tearjerker that one might expect on the basis of plot summaries.<br /><br />When her father first asks her to come home to care for her mother, Ellen is resentful.  She has been out of college only a couple of years, and her career as a journalist in New York is just starting.  She resents the fact that she will have to give up her whole life and return home indefinitely--perhaps permanently--believing that her father has not been doing his part to help her mother.  Ellen, nevertheless, returns home, and she and her mother begin to know each other in new ways, starting, at first, with their two-person book club and then moving on to a sharing of holiday decorating and cooking secrets.  Her resentment of her father increases, as her own relationships, especially with her long-term lover, deteriorate.<br /><br />As her mother moves to a wheelchair, then to a hospital bed, Ellen is the staunch caregiver, and when her mother's morphine dosage increases and she still begs for an end to her pain, Ellen must decide whether to help her.  When an autopsy after her mother's death shows suspicious results, Ellen is jailed, pending an appearance before a grand jury.<br /><br />The death of Kate Gulden is part of the much larger story of Ellen's discoveries about herself and her new understandings of her parents, her parents' marriage, and how one faces one's inevitable fate.  Her ability to make peace with both her mother's death and her changed feelings for her father take place within the context of her arrest and its aftermath, as she comes to a new recognition that life's important questions have no absolute answers.

When Martin Pearce, an Englishman nearly dead from thirst, staggers out of the desert and into the life of Hassanali, a shopseller in a village south of Mombasa, he sets in motion events and themes which echo throughout the novel. It is 1899, and Pearce has been traveling on foot for four days. Believing that \\"This [man] was a burden [God] had...chosen for him,\\" Hassanali enlists his wife Malika, and his sister Rehana to help care for him until a local British official brings him back to \\"civilization.\\" When Pearce returns to thank Hassanali, he becomes enamored of Rehana, and their eventual affair becomes a scandal in both the British and the Indian/Muslim communities.<br /><br />Part II, which takes place fifty years later in Zanzibar, focuses on a new set of characters--two brothers, Amin and Rashid, and their sister Farida. The story of Amin's love for Jamila, which soon unfolds, bears some resemblance to that of Pearce and Rehana--both loves involve cultural and religious taboos and raise questions about the ability of love to survive such difficulties.<br /><br />Part III, which further develops the stories of Amin, Rashid, and Farida, takes place about fifteen years after that. Amin is still in Zanzibar, while Rashid is studying in England. The British have granted Zanzibar independence, but a revolution has taken place. The traumas of this period and its bloodshed, primarily in the 1970s, keep the brothers apart, and, because of censorship in Zanzibar, their communications are difficult and vague. \\"A Continuation,\\" the five-page epilogue, eventually connects all the stories and resolves some unanswered questions.<br /><br />Illustrating, to some extent, the effects of colonialism, along with desertions and displacements in the characters' lives, Gurnah concentrates primarily on stories of family, courtship, and relationships--ordinary people living their daily lives. His style is smooth and descriptive, conjuring the moods and images of different times and places, but structurally, the novel feels like three separate stories, rather than a continuous whole.

These were the strange last words spoken by Helen Stoner's twin sister Julia as she lay, collapsed and dying, just two weeks before her wedding.  Helen has approached Sherlock Holmes because her stepfather, Grimesby Roylott, owner of a decrepit old manse, has moved her into her sister's room just a month before her own wedding, saying her own room needs \\"repairs.\\"  Now some of the strange, night-time events which mystified her sister just before her death are occurring again.  Strange, low  whistles occurring around 3:00 a.m., Roylott's baboon and cheetah prowling freely in the dark, a band of gypsies camping on the property, and mysterious clangings have left Helen terrified.<br /><br />The appearance of Roylott at Holmes's Baker Street residence, where he threatens Holmes physically and bends a fire poker in half to show his strength, make Holmes even more determined to help Helen to protect herself from this maniac.  After Watson and Holmes gain admittance to Helen's quarters one night, they make additional observations--a bell pull which is not attached to any wiring, a new ventilator, a sound like a steam valve, and a bed that is anchored to the floor.  How could all these weird observations be related \\"the speckled band\\"?<br /><br />As always, the melodrama of events is set into sharp relief by Holmes's rational deductions.  Doyle's well known ability to build suspense by capitalizing on the fears of his characters (and his readers), his use of vivid dialogue, his imaginative descriptions, and the quick pace of the action make this story compelling reading.  The real mystery is not who killed Julia Stoner (and threatens Helen), but how the murder took place, and in this respect \\"Speckled Band\\" is one of Doyle's most elaborately constructed and most fascinating stories.  Reputed to have been Doyle's own favorite story, it is the only mystery which Doyle himself adapted successfully for the stage. n Mary Whipple	2005-08-07

With Ironweed, William Kennedy completes his three novels of Depression-era Albany, wrapping up this study of time, place, and people with an emotionally gripping Pulitzer Prize-winner (1984) that focuses on those who call themselves \\"bums,\\" all of them living apart from society because their dreams have died.  Francis Phelan, long-absent father of Billy Phelan, the main character in the previous novel, Billy Phelan's Greatest Game, returns to Albany for the first time in twenty-two years.  In the previous novel, which concludes a week before Ironweed  begins, Francis reconnects with his son Billy, who, stunned by Francis's reappearance, gets him out of jail, gives him money, and begs him to visit his mother and the family.<br /><br />Francis, a former pro ballplayer, lost his career when he lost part of a finger in a fight.  He abandoned his wife Annie and his family when he accidentally dropped and killed his 13-day-old son Gerald, an act for which he still atones.  Francis, however, now discovers from Billy that Annie has never revealed to anyone how Gerald died, a proof of forgiveness that Francis finds astounding.<br /><br />For the past nine years Francis has been living on the road with another down-and-outer, Helen Archer, who managed one year at Vassar studying classical piano before her father died and her life fell apart.  Smart and perceptive about people, Helen, like Francis, has tried unsuccessfully to find solace in the bottle, and now, suffering from a tumor and the effects of alcoholism, she tries to make peace with herself and her life.  Both Francis and Helen understand that they have chosen their lives, and they cast no blame on others or on fate.  Their many acquaintances all have similar stories, and as these stories interweave and overlap, Kennedy endows them with a tenderness of feeling and, sometimes, with an overwhelming violence which stun the involved reader with their power.<br /><br />As Francis relives events in his life, his inner world takes shape.  The opening scene, a trip to the cemetery, where Francis visits his parents' graves and that of baby Gerald for the first time, is one of the most dramatic openings ever written, and as Francis converses with his lost family, he establishes the contrasts with his present life.  Scenes in which Francis, cursed with a hair-trigger temper, literally fights to the death alternate with scenes involving Annie and his family; scenes of his childhood and adolescence alternate  with sad scenes involving the deaths of his homeless friends.<br /><br />A book so good it will leave you reeling, Ironweed tears at the heart without showing a trace of sentimentality, depicting hard lives lived by down-and-out people, most of whom still possess the redeeming virtues of the more saintly who live \\"normal\\" lives.  Hard-edged, sometimes violent, and even cruel, it also reveals human kindness, sweetness, and love.  Kennedy's naturalistic style and ability to create realistic dialogue give life to the stories of these characters and leave the reader with new insights into the nature of family ties, the choices we make, the forgiveness sometimes offered by others, and the nature of redemption if we choose to accept it. n Mary Whippleopening scene, a trip to the cemetery, where Francis visits his parents' graves and that of baby Gerald for the first time, is one of the most dramatic openings ever written, and as Francis converses with his lost family, he establishes the contrasts with his present life.

A finalist in 1994 for both the Booker Prize and the Whitbread Award, Paradise hides major themes and ideas within the seemingly simple story of Yusuf, a twelve-year-old boy in rural East Africa whose father sells him to a trader to settle a debt.  East Africa is in turmoil--on the verge of World War I and the fighting which eventually develops between the Germans in Tanzania and the British in Kenya.  Cities are growing, populations are moving, merchants are trading and selling, and colonialists from many countries are vying for influence.<br /><br />When Yusuf is sold to his \\"uncle\\" Aziz, he leaves his remote rural village in what is now Tanzania and joins a trading caravan, traveling to the highlands and eventually on an ill-fated trading safari to the remote interior, discovering whole new worlds as he goes.  In eight years of travel, he \\"progresses\\" from the countryside to a coastal city, from simple subsistence to the complexities of urban, mercantile life, and from his childish pleasure with a shiny coin to adult love.<br /><br />As a young child/adolescent, Yusuf is an obvious symbol of Tanzania itself at this early stage in its history.  Just as Yusuf must come of age, so also must the country as the various groups contending for influence make choices about how much they will accept, reject, or adapt to outside influences.  As Yusuf comes into contact with tribal chieftains, Muslim traders, Indian shopkeepers, and German empire builders, the reader observes the impact of all of these groups both within Yusuf and within the loose, artificial borders of Tanzania.<br /><br />Creating vivid images primarily through his selection of the perfect detail, Gurnah uses simple, poetic language to tell a delightful story loaded with important social and political observations, conveying clearly and objectively the historical background of Tanzania.  Dialogue is often filled with humor, and Yusuf becomes a real person, not a cardboard symbol.

Eight-year-old Jessamy Harrison, the daughter of a Nigerian mother and a British father, sometimes spends five or more hours hiding motionless in the family's linen closet, attempting to find some sort of \\"fragile peace.\\"  Prone to uncontrollable screaming fits, both at home and at school, she also has high fevers and panic attacks, and often talks to herself.  Struggling with obvious emotional problems, Jess is a bright but lonely child, with no friends, a mother who spends most of her time writing, and a father who is away most of the day.<br /><br />When her mother takes her to Nigeria during a school vacation, she sets in motion a series of events which ultimately leave Jess struggling to hold on to her selfhood.  While visiting her Yoruban grandfather, Jess explores an abandoned building and discovers a strange girl her own age secretly living there.  Titiola, whom Jess calls TillyTilly, becomes her first true friend, and though Jess explores the countryside with her, no one in her family ever sees her.<br /><br />When Jess returns to school in England, her friend TillyTilly follows.  Jess is delighted at first, but TillyTilly begins to monopolize her time, deliberately breaking things in the house, \\"getting\\" people who make Jess unhappy, and causing accidents.  Jess's parents become alarmed at the havoc, especially when Jess insists that it is caused by her mysterious, unseen friend.  Then TillyTilly reveals a family secret, and the battle begins in earnest for possession of Jess's soul.<br /><br />Nigerian author Helen Oyeymi, who wrote this book when she was eighteen, incorporates aspects of Nigerian culture when Jess returns to Nigeria on a second visit.  Oyeymi keeps the action fast-paced and creates considerable suspense as Jess, through TillyTilly, becomes physically dangerous to those around her.  Only her Yoruban grandfather, who believes in magic and traditional ceremonies, seems to have the resources necessary to exorcize the demon.<br /><br />The novel moves along smartly, developing tension and excitement by recreating many of the nightmares of childhood, though the author's simple approach to complex problems may reflect her youth.  Jess, an eight-year-old, is far too sophisticated about TillyTilly and too articulate about her fears to inspire much  reader empathy, and she never feels quite realistic, especially when she herself questions whether TillyTilly really exists.

Albany, New York, during the Depression, when mobsters, crooked politicians, and fast-buck artists were in control, is the setting of _Billy Phelan's Greatest Game-, the second in William Kennedy's \\"Albany cycle.\\"  With some of the same characters appearing in the earlier _Legs_, and later appearing in the later Pulitzer Prize-winning novel _Ironweed_, this novel is a huge step forward for Kennedy.  His ability to define character, create suspense, and explore major themes affecting fathers and sons and their values is far more sophisticated here than in _Legs_, the story of mobster Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond.<br /><br />In a sensational opening scene young Billy Phelan, part-time bookie and small-time card-player and gambler, is bowling the string of his life--two strikes away from a perfect score.  The unexpected conclusion of the match, and its consequences for his opponent, produce a kind of metaphor for life in this era:  Everyone lives on the edge, no one knows when disaster will strike, and there's not much anyone can do about it.  Billy, whose father disappeared when he was young, is doing the best he can, \\"honoring\\" those he must \\"honor,\\" helping his mother and sister, and acquiring a local reputation as a \\"good guy,\\" taking bets and paying off, and not straying far from home.<br /><br />When one of his acquaintances, Charlie MacCall, the son and nephew of two local pols, is kidnapped, Billy is asked to monitor the activities of one of the men with whom he plays cards, a man suspected of involvement in the kidnapping.  Not a \\"stoolie,\\" Billy faces a crisis of conscience.  The reappearance of his father, an alcoholic who \\"helps\\"  people who can help him, adds to his dilemma, since he counsels cooperation.  Martin Daugherty, a newspaper columnist, offers a more mature view while commenting on the political and social aspects of the kidnapping of Charlie MacCall.<br /><br />Whereas _Legs_ is a fairly straightforward biographical novel, this novel is far more complex.  Numerous sets of fathers and sons, all of whom have intergenerational problems, reveal the changing morality of Depression-era Albany.  Billy's moral code is more stringent than his father's, Martin Daugherty's son is studying for the priesthood (to his dismay), and the kidnapped Charlie MacCall is isolated from the political machine of his father and uncle.

Christopher Durang writes the blackest of black comedies and tackles some of the most emotionally devastating issues in life, often wresting humor from the Catholic upbringing of the main characters, which has left them unprepared to deal with the tragedies of their lives. \\"Sister Mary Ignatius,\\" which won the 1981 Obie Award, is his most controversial and most pointed indictment of the church. Sister Mary, one of twenty-seven children--\\"five became priests, seven became nuns, three became brothers, and the rest were institutionalized\\"--will not hear of any compromise, and mercy plays no part in her life.<br /><br />Four former students of Sister Mary arrive at her 25th anniversary celebrationto find her on stage expounding church dogma, answering questions from the audience, and telling doubting individuals that they will go to hell. The four former students have found that Sister Mary's view of the world has left them unprepared to face the devastating circumstances of their lives--abortion, rape, homosexuality, alcoholism, unwed motherhood, sexual abuse by a priest, thoughts of suicide, the suffering of a loved one from cancer. As they confront her with realities, the confrontation becomes increasingly emotional, and Sister Mary resorts to name-calling, screaming insults, and bullying.  The climax is stunning and may offend some reader/viewers.<br /><br />The second play, An Actor's Nightmare, is much less a play than a soliloquy. When the lead actor in an unnamed play cannot appear, another actor, totally unprepared, is forced to take his place. The play brings a nightmare to life, as the unprepared actor, George Spelvin, recites lines from Noel Coward's Private Lives, switches to Hamlet, then to Samuel Beckett in an effort to keep from \\"drying up.\\"  As he becomes more emotional, he recites everything else he remembers--the Pledge of Allegiance, the Catholic Act of Contrition, The Lord's Prayer, and eventually his ABC's.<br /><br />Nightmare and tragedy infuse both these works, which also manage, through their ironies, to tap into the bleakest of humor. The characters evoke empathy, but Durang's quick pace and the outrageous disconnects among his characters keep emotional events from becoming maudlin. His weird wit always shines through.

The young son of an Albanian mother is discovered in Albania by his Scottish father, Lord Sane, who brings him back to a deteriorating manse in Scotland and schools him for a new life as his heir.  Ali, the boy, apparently tainted by the Sane family curse, soon begins his misadventures.  A painful young love, a gruesome hanging, an escape by ship in the moonlight, the discovery of a young woman masquerading as a boy, ominous sleepwalking episodes, the periodic appearance of a bear, the arrival of a ghostly double, false imprisonment--all these events figure in Ali's story, which illustrate all the complications of a Gothic romance.<br /><br />Author John Crowley presents Ali's story as the missing novel written by George Gordon, Lord Byron in 1816, creating a scenario in which Byron's missing manuscript is sold to finance Byron's involvement in European movements promoting Liberty and Freedom.  Clear parallels exist between events in Ali's story and events in Byron's life, but Crowley also connects Bryon, through his manuscript, with the life of Ada Byron King, Countess of Lovelace, Byron's estranged daughter.<br /><br />In a third plot line, a web site designer, Alexandra Novak, known as \\"Smith,\\" is working on a site devoted to women's science history.  Georgiana, her client, purchases some  papers found in a seaman's trunk which once belonged to Ada's son Byron, who ran away to sea.  Georgiana shows Smith a single sheet of an unknown manuscript in Byron's handwriting, but there are many additional pages containing long columns of numbers, their importance unknown.  Smith's attempts to discover the secret to the numbers, written by Ada, unfold simultaneously with Ali's story.<br /><br />Crowley maintains his fine sense of where and when to change the focus from Ali to Ada to Smith in order to keep the tension and interest high, creating intriguing plot lines which intersect and gradually reveal parallels in the lives of the characters.  Life, love, betrayal, alienation, separation and reconciliation are themes pervading all the subplots, and the coincidences and moments of revelation, common to all romantic novels, keep the reader intrigued.<br /><br />There is no real suspense, however. Crowley begins the novel with an episode from Ali's life, making it obvious from the beginning that Byron's novel IS discovered.  The biographies of Bryon and Ada are well documented, and no suspense evolves from  new discoveries.  The episodes in Ali's life are similar to those in many other Gothic romances, not unique.  Still, I found the novel to be a delightful read--a terrific escape into romanticism, possibly the most classically romantic novel in recent years. n Mary Whipplend reconciliation are themes pervading all the subplots, and the coincidences and moments of revelation, common to all romantic novels, keep the reader intrigued.

Transporting the reader into two different worlds in two different time periods, Ahdaf Soueif provides fascinating insights into British and Egyptian cultures.  At the same time, she also incorporates a good deal of British colonial history into an exciting and completely developed story line, introducing a main character whose charm and intelligence are not necessarily an advantage in the colonial society in which she finds herself.<br /><br />Anna Winterbourne, an aristocratic young widow from England, travels to Egypt in the late 19th century during the height of the British Empire. She observes (and resents) the condescending behavior of her countrymen towards the Egyptians and is intelligently critical of British military \\"adventures\\" there and in other Arab states, such as the Sudan and Palestine. As Anna comes to know the Egyptian people and falls in love with an Egyptian, the reader learns much about the historical betrayals which have so complicated relations between western and Arab countries even to the present day.<br /><br />Anna's story unfolds through letters and diaries which her granddaughter and great-granddaughter have found in a trunk a hundred years later, and when Isabel Parkman, the great-granddaughter, travels to Egypt and asks a friend to translate some of the letters, which are in Arabic, she discovers a whole new world, not just her grandmother's world but a new world of her own.  Obvious parallels between Anna's life and Isabel's are developed in the unfolding love stories, and they are further emphasized when Isabel and an Egyptian friend discover that they have more in common than they had suspected.<br /><br />Like most romances, this one requires the reader to accept a very high level of coincidence, but that is more than offset by fine descriptive writing, well drawn characters, and the placing of a great many very recent Middle Eastern events into their Arab contexts.  Shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1998, the novel's biggest surprise lies in the author's ability to convey an Arab point of view so successfully and sympathetically to a western audience--a point of view that is culturally honest without being polemical.

Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond, a larger than life thief/bootlegger/murderer, captured the imagination of the public during Prohibition, the Roaring Twenties, and the beginning of the Great Depression.  Living the high life, surrounded by beautiful women, bodyguards, and associates, Diamond, in his early thirties, moved smoothly between speakeasies and sordid backrooms, between murder scenes and rural retreats, always exuding a sense of confidence and glamour.  Setting this novel primarily in Albany, New York, in 1930-1931, Kennedy recreates the mystique of Diamond, a much handsomer contemporary of Chicago gangster Al Capone, and New York beer king Dutch Schultz, as he exercises his power, fights off intrusions into \\"his\\" territory, corners the market in illegal beverages, buys off politicians and judges, and tries to avoid conviction for his crimes.<br /><br />Telling Diamond's story is Marcus Gorman, a lawyer who gets swept up in the excitement which surrounds Diamond and ends up as his attorney.  Marcus, however, always insists that he be paid for his work, up front, and he refuses to be drawn into obviously illegal behavior.  This makes him the perfect narrator-someone who admires much about Diamond but also someone whose judgment the reader can trust.  Terse dialogue reminiscent of the novels of Raymond Chandler or Dashiel Hammett, fills the novel, but Marcus's musings about what motivates Diamond offer a more thoughtful approach to this shady character and his life than what one usually finds in noir novels.<br /><br />A man with no conscience, Diamond double-crosses and cheats his way to success, often killing his own associates, events described in gory detail.  But Diamond's legend grows.  Kennedy humanizes him by emphasizing the loyalty of his wife Alice and the crazy love of his girlfriend, showgirl Kiki Roberts.  After his two major trials, even the jury celebrates the inevitable acquittals.  Other mobsters fear him, however, and know that if they don't get him first that he will get them.  Surviving three murder attempts in two years, Diamond absorbs eleven bullets, before his final gun battle.<br /><br />An uncomplicated but well-written novel, _Legs_ illustrates the attraction many feel to celebrity, even a sadistic celebrity such as Diamond.

Instead, we have a much darker, more pessimistic vision, set in Texas in the 1980s, a microcosm in which drugs and violence have so changed \\"civilization\\" that the local sheriff believes \\"we're looking at something we really aint even seen before.\\"<br /><br />Forty-five-year-old Sheriff Ed Tom Bell must deal with the growing amorality affecting his small border town as a result of the drug trade. The old \\"rules\\" do not apply, and Bell faces a wave of violence involving at least ten murders. Running parallel with Bell's investigation of these murders is the story of Llewelyn Moss, a resident of Bell's town, who, while hunting in the countryside, has uncovered a bloody massacre and a truck containing a huge shipment of heroin. He has also discovered and stolen a case containing two million dollars of drug money, which results in his frantic run from hired hitmen. Hunting Moss is Anton Chigurh, a sociopathic cartel avenger, a Satan who will stop at nothing, the antithesis of the thoughtful and kindly Bell. A rival hitman named Wells is, in turn, stalking Chigurh.<br /><br />By far McCarthy's most exciting and suspenseful novel in recent years, the story speeds along, the body count rising in shocking scenes of depravity. Bell's first person musings about crime, society, and the people around him break the tension periodically, allowing the reader to ponder the wider implications of the action and to see it as a symbolic struggle for man's soul between good and evil, love and hate, God and Satan. As the violence continues and Bell becomes more discouraged, he visits his elderly Uncle Ellis, a former deputy sheriff and war veteran, and as they talk about World War I and the Vietnam War, where they were willing to give their lives for a presumably winnable cause, the contrast between those battles and this battle on the home front is seen in broader and bleaker perspective.<br /><br />McCarthy's desire to preserve traditional values, and his grim vision of the present and future, reflect a view of life that many readers will not share. The artistry the reader has seen in McCarthy's thematic development throughout the rest of the novel is sacrificed in the last forty pages, in which Bell's overt warnings and cautionary remarks about the future sound preachy. Still, the novel is breathtaking in its construction, and Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is one of McCarthy's best-drawn characters.

Two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Tennessee Williams abandons his southern roots by setting his fascinating first novel (1950) in Rome, just after World War II.  An American actress, recently widowed, decides to live in Rome after retiring from the stage.  Karen Stone, now in her fifties, is still nursing her ego after attempting but failing to be a convincing Juliet, the critics having cruelly pointed out her advanced age.  Sensitive about the loss of her beauty and her plummeting career, Mrs. Stone plans to lead a less visible life in Rome.<br /><br />Making the acquaintance of the Contessa, a friendly but cruelly manipulative and impoverished woman who introduces her to a series of beautiful young men, Mrs. Stone allows herself to be escorted but refuses the young men's other favors.  Even with Paolo, the most attractive of her escorts, she maintains her dignity, until, after a particularly bitter argument, she realizes that she can use him for sexual pleasure, without guilt or remorse, since there is no possibility of unforeseen biological consequences.<br /><br />As Mrs. Stone explores her sexuality in an effort to prove her desirability, Williams is remarkably candid about the characters' relationships. Sensitively, and with an expert eye for the vulnerability of women of a \\"certain age,\\" he explores Mrs. Stone's relationship with a long-time female friend, her seemingly passionless marriage to Tom Stone, her budding sexual liberation, and Paolo's relationships with other men and women.  Gradually, Mrs. Stone becomes more dependent on Paolo for emotional support while Paolo demands more of Mrs. Stone's financial support, until they both reach breaking point.<br /><br />Williams's vibrant dialogue successfully reveals the tensions and expectations of Mrs. Stone, the Contessa, and Paolo through their conversations, but Williams is also startlingly adept at incorporating symbols which add to the intensity of the internal action.  The seasons, the imagery of birds, and even Mrs. Stone's name enhance the plot and themes, while the action ironically mimics the Romeo/Juliet tragedy.  Small details add to this irony--a handsome young man follows Mrs. Stone, and as she gazes at him from the top floor of her apartment near the Spanish Steps, the Romeo/Juliet balcony scene comes to mind.  Though the novel is sometimes melodramatic, it never becomes maudlin, and the conclusion, totally different from the two films based upon it, involves an emotional resolution, rather than dramatic action. n Mary Whipplen Mrs. Stone's name enhance the plot and themes, while the action ironically mimics the Romeo/Juliet tragedy.

From the dramatic opening paragraphs, in which a person believes that his face is sliding off and his insides are falling out, Fossum captures the bizarre inner worlds of several characters barely holding onto their sanity.  Errki Johrma, a 24-year-old who has been committed to a residential lockup for the disturbed, escapes the residence in rural Norway and seeks solitude in the woods.  There he sees an elderly woman, Halldis Horn, working outside her cabin.<br /><br />Suddenly the point of view shifts, and a 12-year-old boy, Kannick Snellingen, runs into the police station saying that Halldis is dead, with a hoe embedded in her face, and that he has seen Errki lurking nearby.  Kannick, like Errki, is also disturbed, living in a home for children with behavioral problems.  A sudden shift to the next morning, and Detective Inspector Konrad Sejer, after noting a strange person entering the bank, soon hears a gunshot and learns that it has been robbed and a hostage taken--Errki.<br /><br />The intersecting worlds of Errki, the robber (known as Morgan), Kannick Snellingen, and Inspector Sejer and his assistant, Jacob Scarre, create a fascinating series of psychological portraits and interactions.  Morgan and Errki, hiding out together in an abandoned cabin, try to avoid the police and stay alive, remaining wary of each other but starting to communicate about the voices Errki hears from The Coat and a spirit named Nestor.  Kannick, who wants to become a national archery champ, wallows in the attention he gets from his peers at the home, describing the gory condition of Halldis's body in exchange for candy.  At the same time, Sejer, a widower for eleven years, confers with Errki's psychiatrist in order to understand Errki more fully, and finds himself powerfully drawn to her as he tries to solve Halldis's murder and the robbery of the bank by apprehending Errki and Morgan.<br /><br />Developing the story in clean, straightforward prose, Fossum reveals the disturbing thoughts of Errki, Morgan, and Kannick, along with their traumatic backgrounds, stories which need no  additional melodrama.  As the reader comes to know the characters and feel empathy for them, she creates fine dramatic tension and a suspense-filled story in which nothing is as it appears to be.  Occasionally, the ironies are leavened with dark humor.  A climactic meeting involving all the major characters leads to a full resolution and, ultimately, a greater understanding of the characters' interior worlds. Fascinating, well-drawn, and concise, this novel, the second in the Inspector Sejer series, is a psychological mystery of the first order, filled with intriguing characters and unusual plot twists.

Naturalist/writer Gerald Durrell, with a writer's eye for unusual detail, a great sense of humor and absurdity, and an unquenchable enthusiasm for finding unique animals, recounts his third animal-collecting trip to the Cameroons in this classic 1960 memoir, recently reprinted.  Supplying other people's zoos for many years, Durrell, on this trip, intends to collect specimens for his own zoo, one which will be open to the public and which will become a \\"self-supporting laboratory\\" with a captive breeding program to prevent the extinction of these species.<br /><br />Arriving on the west coast of Cameroon, Durrell uses pidgin to converse with the Africans and refers to all animals as \\"beef,\\" but he soon acquires many rare animals from the local population.  A frightening canoe ride through hippo-infested waters, an attempt to capture a fifteen-foot python, a search for the blue-scalped, bald-headed Picanthartes bird, and the experience of smoking out a hollow tree keep Durrell and his staff energized and excited before they head to the highlands.  There, Durrell stays with the charming Fon of Bafut, a elderly king with many wives, and he and Durrell enjoy many long evenings of talk, dance, and whisky.  Soon the Fon's compound fills up with hundreds more captive reptiles, birds, and animals, including a half-grown baboon, a five-year-old chimp, and a baby chimp, all of which provide innumerable, often hilarious adventures.<br /><br />Durrell provides details about the care and feeding of these animals, and he and his staff prove to be very \\"hands-on\\" caretakers, often having animals creep into their beds.  The logistics of building cages and, eventually, packing them for the trip home, reveal the level of detail necessary to keep these animals healthy and calm so they can survive the trip to England.  Upon his return, Durrell then begins the daunting task of trying to find a place to house these rare specimens, a task he neglected ahead of time.<br /><br />A lively writer with a commitment to conservation and a tremendous sense of fun, Durrell gives the flavor of the whole trip, not just the academic details, providing realism at the same time that he reveals irrepressible humor, much of it directed at himself.  His sensitivity to his surroundings, which he conveys through vibrant descriptions, makes the countryside come alive, while his anecdotes about the animals and the people he meets show his interest in expanding his knowledge while fully participating in events around him.

Providing an exciting story that includes the highs and lows of Boston life, lawyer David Hosp's debut novel ranges from Beacon Hill to Southie, from a \\"white shoe\\" law firm to a ghoulish home \\"operating room,\\" from security company offices to exploding trains, and from the Governor's office to the dark corners where associates of fugitive mob boss Whitey Bulger converge.  Scott Finn, an orphan from Southie who worked his way out of juvenile detention and into a job at a prestigious Boston law firm, is devastated when his colleague and former lover, Natalie Caldwell, turns up dead on the Southie waterfront.<br /><br />While police are investigating Natalie's death, Finn accepts the job of representing Huron Security in a major lawsuit, a case that Natalie was preparing when she died.  Huron was in charge of security when a terrorist planted and detonated bombs on twelve rail cars, killing dozens of commuters, and a young widow has sued.  When the governor of Massachusetts and his chief aide take an unnatural interest in Natalie's death and Finn himself is physically \\"warned,\\" he knows he must investigate all aspects of Natalie's life if he is going to solve the case.  Soon, he himself is under suspicion for her murder.  An edge-of-your-seat conclusion worthy of the big screen ties up the loose ends and sets the scene for a possible series featuring Finn.<br /><br />Although Hosp employs some melodramatic details at the beginning of the novel (the hand of a dead body reaching out \\"for help,\\" and a man facing imminent death grabbing for the family photo in his pocket), he soon settles down and lets his plots and subplots develop more naturally.  His depiction of Southie, the characters who populate it, the \\"presence\\" of real-life fugitive Whitey Bulger, and references to the trial of John Connolly, an FBI officer who handled Whitey and then went to jail for becoming \\"too close,\\" set the scene and add realism and local color to the novel.  Finn's own connections to Southie provide a bridge between the uptown characters, governmental offices, and the movers and shakers of Southie.<br /><br />Occasionally, Hosp's clumsiness with key details--and the attempt to drop red herrings--are obvious and telegraph the reader that s/he is being manipulated.  The inclusion of too-helpful friends and colleagues, along with Finn's own loose lips about crucial information, are the marks of an inexperienced author trying to control outcomes.

Child's Play, an early tour de force, showcases Australian author David Malouf's remarkable versatility and his focus on ideas and themes.  Taking us into the mind of a terrorist/assassin as he waits to commit a murder, Malouf shows him to be a \\"normal\\" person with the same thoughts and reactions to the world around him as everyone else.  Malouf keeps us at a distance from the killer, however, restricting the killer's consciousness to his sense impressions about the world around him, his remembrances and warm feelings toward his childhood and family, his everyday life, and his philosophical musings about his predestined relationship with his chosen victim.<br /><br />Though this novella was probably considered shocking when it was written in 1982, its impact has been lessened to the point of insignificance by recent events.  The reader is given no clue about what has made this man a terrorist or what his ultimate purpose might be, and Malouf provides no sense of significance or context for what otherwise appears to be a motiveless killing by an intelligent and sensitive man.  The assassin is, in many ways, like a child playing a very deadly game.<br /><br />Malouf uses a similar technique in The Bread of Time to Come, also known as Fly Away Peter, though this novella is more emotionally involving than Child's Play.  Here the main character, Jim Saddler, the opposite of the assassin in many ways, also seems detached from his life and also naïve.  A young man whose chief pleasure is acting as a guide at a bird sanctuary in coastal Queensland, he has been protected from many of life's cruel realities by Australia's physical isolation from the wider world.  This changes when he finds himself, along with his employer/friend Ashley Crowther, fighting in France during World War I.<br /><br />From the opening scene, which sets up dramatic contrasts between a bird and a biplane, Malouf emphasizes the contrasts between the \\"civilized\\" and \\"natural\\" worlds and between the Garden of Eden of the bird sanctuary, and the violence and killing of war.  Jim's discoveries about life and about himself are straightforward and are enhanced by the author's use of repetitions, a great deal of symbolism, and numerous contrasts:  Even during war, Jim sees migrating birds.<br /><br />In both books, Malouf presents dense imagery of sights, sounds, and smells; lovely vignettes about country life; and characters who seem both intelligent and sensitive.  The \\"civilized\\" world of Europe is, in both cases, seen to be fraught with violence and random cruelty.  The Bread of Time to Come, however, reveals a character who comes to realizations about his place in the universe.  The terrorist in Child's Play has no world view.

With her third mystery in three years, I. J. Parker continues her series featuring Akitada Sugawara, a twenty-five-year-old member of the nobility whose family is no longer influential in the emperor's court in 11th century Japan.  When three yearly tax shipments from Kazusa province disappear without a trace, Akitada, a minor official in the Ministry of Justice, is assigned to investigate, a task he accepts enthusiastically, believing it to be a great honor.  Traveling through the cold countryside by horseback in the \\"Gods-Absent Month\\" of November, Akitada is accompanied by an elderly family retainer, Seimei.<br /><br />From the outset, Parker creates a fast-paced and exciting narrative which keeps the reader interested both in the action and in the revelations of eleventh century culture and tradition.  In the first fifty pages, the reader experiences the murder of a beautiful noblewoman, the gruesome death of a prostitute, the attempted robbery of Akitada and subsequent fight to the death with robbers, the attempted assault of a young deaf-mute woman by several Buddhist monks, and a violent attack on a member of Akitada's party by a female martial artist of enormous skill.<br /><br />Though this novel is the most recent Parker novel to be published, the story line occurs chronologically earlier than both The Rashomon Gate and The Hell Screen, two previous mysteries in the same series.  Akitada is a young bachelor here, meeting Tora, a powerful aide who appears in both the previous books, for the first time.  As Akitada tries to discover the fate of the tax convoys, he investigates the death of the retired governor of the province, observes the behavior of \\"monks\\" who seem unfamiliar with traditional ceremonies, investigates unsavory neighborhoods and elegant residences, and falls in love.  The action develops gradually, and builds to a conclusion that is filled with fireworks.<br /><br />The cultural separation between noble and commoner, the tension between the Buddhist and Shinto religions, and details about government and cultural traditions are included very naturally within the story.  Parker develops her characters realistically, allowing her readers to identify with them, also including unusual characters whose idiosyncrasies make them memorable--the Rat, a beggar-informer;  Higekuro, a former member of the nobility who is now the paralyzed director of a martial arts school;  and Otomi, the deaf-mute artist whose sketches of a monastery figure in the investigation.

Author Elizabeth Kostova's unusual debut novel combines her ten years of scholarly research on Vlad Tepes, the Impaler of Wallachia, sometimes known as Drakulya, with the stories that have become part of local folklore in Bulgaria and Rumania, and the legends created and perpetuated by Bram Stoker (in his novel Dracula).  A sadistic prince from the mid-fifteenth century who killed up to 15,000 of his own people, often impaling them on stakes and leaving them to die horrible deaths, Vlad terrified his enemies from the Ottoman Empire, though it was Stoker who created the belief that he was a vampire.<br /><br />Three people from the twentieth century, all of whom have studied Drakulya and his history, tell interlocking stories here through letters, archived research documents, scholarly lectures, and their own experiences.  All believe that Drakulya still walks the earth, selecting his acolytes and spreading his evil through bites on the neck, which leave them \\"undead.\\"  An unnamed girl, who lives with her American father in Amsterdam and travels with him on diplomatic missions to Eastern Bloc countries and Europe, is devastated when her father, known only as Paul, suddenly disappears, and she sets out to track him down.  Her father is obsessed with the disappearance of his colleague and academic mentor Bartholomew Rossi, the only clue being bloodstains on his desk and ceiling.  Rossi himself has been researching Vlad for many years, and has left important documents for Paul in case of emergency.  As these characters tell their stories in alternating scenes from different time periods, they travel widely, often to libraries and universities, searching for clues about Drakulya, whom they believe is connected to recent disappearances and deaths.<br /><br />Historians and scholars will be fascinated by the detailed information revealed in this novel as the three main characters uncover key information about Vlad/Drakulya.  The characters' trips to Rumania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, then under Communist rule, provide fascinating glimpses of Eastern Bloc life, both in the cities and in the countryside, and scenes which are set in archives and libraries show the excitement of the scholar on the track of important information.  Travels to remote, previously uninvestigated sites connected with Vlad suggest the intriguing nature of field work. The plot is used primarily as a framework which allows the author to disclose the historical Vlad, revealing information slowly as mysteries begin to be solved.<br /><br />Those looking for a fast-paced blood-and-gore thriller may be disappointed by the author's serious approach.  Though the story is often exciting---and has a conclusion which packs a wallop--the characters themselves are undeveloped, and the constant shifting of location as the points of view change makes the stories difficult to follow, at times.  Foreshadowing is often obvious, and the use melodramatic elements is sometimes unnecessary and intrusive--a gypsy curse, ghostly appearances in a photograph, feelings of \\"presences,\\" convenient letters and postcards, and frequent use of coincidence.  At almost seven hundred pages, the story sometimes lags because the dramatic tension cannot be maintained when the focus shifts suddenly from action to research.

Alexander MacDonald, the narrator of this warm and ennobling family saga, comments to his brother that \\"Talking about history is not like living it...Some people have more choice than others.\\" And there, in a nutshell, is the essence of this tender generational novel. The MacDonalds are, in many ways, an \\"ordinary\\" family on Cape Breton, but MacLeod creates a history for them so alive that the reader experiences it, too, feeling their sorrow and joy, admiring their pluck and independence, and celebrating their loyalty and bravery as they make the hard choices their lives require. They become heroes to us not because they have performed unusual feats but because they have achieved nobility within the collective memory of their own family.<br /><br />Alexander MacDonald, the speaker, no longer lives on Cape Breton. An orthodontist, he travels weekly to Toronto to visit his alcoholic brother Calum, named for the family patriarch who came to the island in 1779 from Scotland. As he travels back and forth and reminisces, sometimes in Gaelic, with his much less fortunate brother, many generations of MacDonalds come to life, and we see how these forbears have shaped the two brothers and influenced their different, but shared, destinies.<br /><br />MacLeod is very lyrical. Like a musician, he repeats certain themes. Gaelic phrases echo throughout, almost like a refrain. First names continue in different generations to remind the reader of historical resemblances and differences. And always, in every generation, he celebrates the dominance of the original Calum MacDonald and of Cape Breton in shaping their lives.<br /><br />MacLeod never stoops to sentimentality, however. His main characters are all macho males living macho lives, and he includes no romantic love story to soften the harshness of life. Still, he has created one of the warmest, most loving, and enduring family stories anyone will ever find. The book pulses with heart, an unforgettable novel by a writer who is so precise in his structure and word choice that in his entire career he has produced only this one novel and fourteen short stories published in two extraordinary collections.  Reading MacLeod is a great, rewarding pleasure for anyone interested in beautiful prose and careful execution.

Stunning in its raw power, this novel, unlike many other Irish novels, draws its power from its simplicity, rather than from lush description or the accumulation of details. Stripping language to the bare bones here, Dermot Healy draws the reader, without embellishment, directly into the confused mind of the main character, a carpenter named Ollie Ewing.<br /><br />Ollie has just returned to Sligo, almost mute with shock from unspoken, terrible events which have befallen him while in London, where he has been working as a day laborer on construction sites. The narrative shifts back and forth in time and location, revealing Ollie's paranoia through flashbacks, brief scenes, and dialogue, which sometimes seem to have no context other than their revelation of his suffering. He is clearly trying to hang on to his sanity--and is only marginally successful--as he talks to the reader in quiet, almost confessional tones. Using unadorned, simple language, he describes things he sees that are not there and voices that no one else can hear. Never wasting a word, his earnest narrative forces the reader to share his thoughts while interpreting his state of mind.<br /><br />Gradually, the reader learns of Ollie's almost paralyzing experiences in London, where he lived with a friend, Marty Kilgallon, in a trailer at an old construction site. Through Marty, Ollie learns firsthand about the protection rackets and extortion on construction sites, the common use of murder as a weapon of enforcement, and the unsympathetic judicial system. When his friend disappears and does not return for six weeks, Ollie gets caught in a whirlwind of violence and learns the true meaning of hell.<br /><br />By the time he returns to Sligo, he has come to believe that there is a \\"glass sprinkler\\" machine, operating at night, which sprinkles glass over the streets of London, that the flecks in people's eyes are aliens, and that his own image in a mirror is someone imitating him.

Winner of the Obie Award in 1975, Lanford Wilson's play details the excavation of Jasker Field by archaeologists as they try to solve some of the mysteries of Native American temple mounds from 700 - 1000 A. D.  This is frantic work, as a nearby lake is rising, and a planned interstate, under construction, is scheduled to bury the site.  Wilson creates a cauldron of emotions by housing all the principals in a farmhouse belonging to Mr. Jasker, whose son Chad enthusiastically awaits the arrival of the interstate and the expansion of the lake, which will give him valuable \\"waterfront property.\\"<br /><br />As traces of civilization are uncovered at the dig, followed soon after by the discovery of artifacts and bones, the tensions inside the house grow.  Each of the main characters has problems--a previous emotional breakdown, a pregnancy, the unwanted attentions of Chad Jasker, a divorce and loss of personal direction, alcoholism, irresponsibility, and professional stress--and the viewer cannot help but make comparisons between the seemingly structured lives of the mound builders and the chaos in the lives of their present investigators.  The \\"resolution\\" to the drama proves to be far more \\"uncivilized\\" than anything the early civilization might have contemplated.<br /><br />The intensely confessional atmosphere inside the farmhouse, as the characters reveal their problems and conflicts, requires that actors play their parts with subtlety to avoid stereotyping and melodrama.  The weakest character in the play is, unfortunately, the important character of Jean Loggins, gynecologist-wife of one of the lead archaeologists, who tries to help D. K. Erikson, an alcoholic and insecure writer who is the sister of the project director, resting at the farmhouse to \\"dry out.\\"  Loggins, unfortunately, is so fraught with her own problems that it is impossible to imagine her as a hard-driving medical school graduate with a specialty career, and this limits the realism and increases the melodrama.  D. K., however, is a tough woman who views life with a cynical realism, and her gradual transition from angry recluse to a more \\"civilized\\" persona is a key aspect to the drama.<br /><br />Dealing with the age-old conflict between preservation and progress, which is still at issue thirty years later, Wilson shows that the strong traditions and culture of the mound builders--their civilization--have much of value to offer modern man living in a more multicultural and chaotic world.

With echoes of Edgar Allan Poe, this 1902 novel continues to delight mystery-lovers.  Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of the Baskervilles, which an American, Sir Henry Baskerville, has just inherited upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles.  The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night--one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.<br /><br />Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a young woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor.  The lecherous Baskerville, following the dog closely, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\"  The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.<br /><br />In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall.  Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.<br /><br />Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader).  By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of  interest to Holmes.<br /><br />Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise.  The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate.  Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre.

One would hope a book written more than thirty years ago about race relations at the end of the nineteenth century would be irrelevant and possibly dated today.  Though a novel like The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith could have been written about many minorities subjugated during many periods in many different countries, Keneally concentrates here on Anglo settlers and their attitudes towards Australia's native aborigines.  Timeless, articulate in its presentation, and graceful in its execution, the novel remains vibrant and powerful in its universal message, even after these many years.<br /><br />The basic story is not unique. Half aborigine and half Anglo, Jimmie Blacksmith grows up in aborigine culture. Because he is light-skinned, however, he is able to obtain jobs on white landholdings more readily than other aborigines, and there he is exposed to Anglo culture--with all its stated, good intentions, but its sometimes patronizing attitudes and selfish goals.<br /><br />After being worked hard and cheated from his earnings repeatedly, Jimmie snaps, visiting on his former employers the kind of permanent punishment which he has seen so often being dealt to the aborigines. As vigilantes and police join forces to apprehend Jimmie, we see all the conflicting attitudes toward life and justice which undermine the creation of a unified, fair society.<br /><br />The throbbing drumbeat of Jimmie's chants and Keneally's insistent narrative pace combine with our revulsion toward Jimmie's actions, to catch us up in the emotions of both the pursuers and the pursued. Our understanding of Jimmie and our empathy with him make us long for his redemption at the same time that we are anxious for justice to take place.<br /><br />Keneally's resolution is brilliant, fittingly combining the best elements of both of Jimmie's worlds. Shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1972, the novel deals with a complex and sensitive subject without polemics or convenient, easy solutions, and it is as relevant today as it was when it was written.

Anyone who has ever been to Kenya's extraordinary game parks to see the elephants, or dreamed of doing so, will be fascinated by this story of how these parks came to be the refuges they are and not the corrals for government-sanctioned poaching that they were. When paleontologist Richard Leakey took over the Department of Wildlife and Conservation in 1989, rampant corruption, theft, absenteeism, and a don't-care attitude were hallmarks within the department.<br /><br />As Leakey tells us here, the Kenyan government lacked a real commitment to conservation, and the burgeoning population exerted pressure on national park borders, clearing land for farming and threatening wildlife, unimpeded. Poaching, patronage, a general ripoff mentality, and collusion between park rangers, politicians, blackmarketeers, and smugglers, were so interconnected and seemingly so ineradicable that the department resembled a many-headed hydra.<br /><br />Tribal rivalries within Kenya, a porous border through which Somalian thieves made forays, and a lack of agreement between Kenya and neighboring African countries about the best way to conserve animals made this one of the most daunting management challenges imaginable.<br /><br />In prose that is as direct and to the point (and sometimes as self-congratulatory) as he is, Leakey tells how he set up and managed a multimilliondollar corporation in a country in which everyone wants a piece of the pie, usually under the table.<br /><br />As Leakey tells of cleaning up the department and conserving the elephants, the reader also learns about the economics of the ivory trade, the tug-of-war between immediate political realities and long-term goals, the role of the World Bank in African development, and the politicking involved in deciding what is an endangered species under the U.N.'s Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

The Third Man, written originally as the outline for the screenplay of Carol Reed's famous 1949 film of the same name, is set in occupied Vienna just after World War II.  The sectors established by the conquering British, Americans, French, and Russians contribute to an atmosphere of tension and mystery, and an almost palpable aura of menace as residents and visitors alike must deal with four different governments, four sets of officials, and four collections of laws as they move throughout the city.<br /><br />Rollo Martins, an author of cowboy novels, arrives in Vienna to visit an old school friend, Harry Lime, only to find that he has arrived on the day of Lime's funeral. Investigating Lime's death, Martins learns that a neighbor saw the traffic accident that killed Lime and observed three men carrying Lime's body from the scene. Only two of those men have been identified--the third man has vanished.<br /><br />As Martins investigates Lime's death, the novel is by turns exciting and darkly humorous, intensely visual in its descriptions and action, but lacking the characterization and thematic focus which one associates with most of Greene's work. The novella is full of wit and dark theatrics, and includes everything from a chase through the sewers to a love story.<br /><br />The Fallen Idol, sometimes known as \\"The Basement Room,\\" is, by contrast, a psychological, rather than plot-based story.  Nine-year-old Philip, who idolizes the family's butler Baines, since his parents pay little attention to him, is left with Baines and his wife while the parents go on vacation.  Baines is having an affair, and Philip innocently discloses this to his wife.<br /><br />The resulting confrontation results in an accident in which the wife ends up dead, and Philip, panicked, runs out, only to be picked up by a policeman, to whom another naive remark conveys the idea that Baines has murdered her.  Irony and a delightfully drawn child's point of view (unusual for Greene)  make The Fallen Idol one of Greene's more interesting and twisted stories.<br /><br />Both The Third Man and The Fallen Idol led to film collaborations between Greene and director Carol Reed--The Fallen Idol in 1948, and Reed's more famous film of The Third Man in 1949.  Dark humor, elaborate ironies, and surprising twists characterize both stories and show Greene to be a master manipulator of perceptions.  Mary Whipplemore interesting and twisted stories.

Christopher Durang writes the blackest of black comedies and tackles some of the most emotionally devastating issues in life, often wresting humor from the strict Catholic upbringing of the main characters, which has left them unprepared to deal with the tragedies of their lives.  \\"Sister Mary Ignatius,\\" which won the 1981 Obie Award, is his most controversial and most pointed indictment of the church.  Sister Mary, one of twenty-seven children--\\"five became priests, seven became nuns, three became brothers, and the rest were institutionalized\\"--will not hear of any compromise, and mercy plays no part in her life.<br /><br />Four former students of Sister Mary arrive at her 25th anniversary celebration at a church hall, where, years ago, they performed their own version of the Christmas story.  Sister Mary is on stage expounding church dogma, answering questions from the audience, getting her eight-year-old prot&eacute;g&eacute; to spout catechism, insisting on the strictest interpretation of religious doctrine, and telling individuals that they will go to hell.  The four former students have found that Sister Mary's view of the world has not helped them to deal with their own lives, and they confront her onstage.<br /><br />The four have faced emotionally devastating situations--abortion, rape, homosexuality, alcoholism, unwed motherhood, sexual abuse by a priest, thoughts of suicide, the suffering of a loved one from cancer--which the church (through Sister Mary) has not prepared them to handle. \\"I believed you, how you said the world worked,\\" one character says, as they confront her with the realities of their lives.  In an increasingly emotional confrontation, she remains unmoved--\\"Every bad thing that happens, God has a special reason for.\\"  Unwilling to compromise in any way (\\"These are your options.  There are no others.\\"), Sister Mary, challenged, resorts to name-calling, screaming insults, and  bullying.  The climax is stunning and may offend some reader/viewers.<br /><br />The line between tragedy and comedy is always blurred here, as the play, through its consummate ironies, taps into the bleakest of humor.  The characters evoke empathy--both the disillusioned former students and Sister Mary herself--but Durang's quick pace and the outrageous disconnects among his characters keep emotional events from becoming maudlin.  His weird wit always shines through.

Though \\"humorous\\" is not a word usually associated with Peter Hoeg, The Woman and the Ape, with its irony and satire, is very, very funny.  An ape of unknown primate species escapes smugglers at the docks of London, only to be captured by animal researchers and primatologists, who intend to advance human knowledge--and themselves--through their testing and research on him.<br /><br />The ape, named Erasmus, is actually more intelligent than the men who are testing him secretly at the estate of Adam Burden, a zoolological research director.  When Madelene, Burden's alcoholic wife, discovers Erasmus, she helps him escape, and the two go off together.  Establishing their own Garden of Eden in a protected forest outside of London, Erasmus and Madelene enjoy seven weeks of mutual discovery, learning, and eventually love, hidden from the outside world.  When Erasmus learns to speak English and Madelene's native language, Danish, the two return to London.<br /><br />Hoeg is brutally satiric of British society and academia as Adam Burden, his evil sister Andrea, the scientific community, the smuggling network, and virtually all other humans are shown to be arrogant in their assumptions about the relationship of men and animals.  They will be taught an object lesson, and Madelene and Erasmus are only too happy to provide it.  Themes of freedom vs. captivity (real and symbolic), man's role in the evolutionary scheme of things, and the fragility of the environment are developed, none too subtly, as the ape proves his superiority to \\"civilized\\" humanity.  When asked what he calls the other members of his species, Erasmus replies, \\"People,\\" indicating that humans would be considered \\"animals\\" where he lives.<br /><br />This satire/sci-fi novel, though intriguing, is strange, becoming even stranger with its interspecies love affair.  Madelene is a shallow character with no charm, more apt to lose her inhibitions as a result of alcohol than from any deep feeling. Structurally, the novel falls into two parts--the arrival of the ape, his discovery by Madelene, and their escape, which has some hilarious and even empathetic moments to it--followed by their idyll in a nature preserve and their return to London, a section which is very didactic, fraught with environmental messages and social criticism.<br /><br />The conclusion, which incorporates many surprises, is a dramatically appropriate tour de force, which outweighs many of the novel's other problems.  Perhaps too long to carry the burden of its message, Hoeg's novel is still daring and full of unique images and twists--the product of a creative author whose next novel I eagerly await.

In this fascinating portrait, Sherlock Holmes, now ninety-three, deals with the indignities of old age and the forgetfulness which accompanies it.  It is now 1947, and Dr. Watson has been dead for many years.  Holmes lives in a small country house in rural Sussex with a housekeeper and her 14-year-old son, spending much of his day tending to his bees and working on his writing. Frail and reliant upon two canes to get around, Holmes is dedicated to the pursuit of longevity and believes that the royal jelly from his hives is a key ingredient.<br /><br />Holmes has just returned from postwar Japan, where he has been seeking information about the prickly ash plant and its life-giving properties.  His host there, the son of a diplomat who disappeared when World War II broke out, tells Holmes that his father once met him in England, but Holmes no longer remembers the man.  As he reminisces about the trip, he wants to help the man come to terms with his father's mysterious abandonment.<br /><br />These two settings, one in rural Sussex and one in Japan, in 1947, alternate with \\"The Case of the Glass Armonicist,\\" an uncompleted story about one of Holmes's cases from 1902, which Holmes hopes to finish before he forgets the details.  The story concerns a young man whose wife keeps disappearing following her lessons on the glass armonica (sometimes called the \\"glass harmonica\\").  Holmes follows the woman, often donning a disguise to get closer to her.  In formal Victorian language, Holmes tells a story reminiscent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in style.<br /><br />Cullin has created a plausible psychological profile for Holmes, who, to the best of anyone's knowledge, has never been in love and has never allowed his emotions to govern his life.  Now, at the end of his life, he has the same needs and fears as the rest of mankind, a man far more human than we have ever seen before, though he retains his dignity.  Vibrant physical details about the natural world and the places in which the action takes place bring life to the narrative, which is unusually sensitive in its descriptions of the inner world of an elderly man whose memories consist of \\"brief remembrances that soon became vague impressions and were invariably forgotten.\\"<br /><br />Gracefully combining all the story lines, Cullin leads the reader to a conclusion which is especially memorable for its completeness.  Here Holmes concludes his searches, lays his philosophical ponderings to rest, and tries to find whatever peace is possible for a solitary man.

TO KIDS looking for a great book:  My eight- to eleven-year-old grandchildren say this is the best book they've ever read!  It's about a typical fifth grade boy, full of imagination, who matches wits with a strict, elderly teacher who loves words and dictionaries.  When he asks her who decides that the word \\"dog\\" means the thing that wags its tail, her answer is \\"You do.\\"  Nick then leads his friends in a plan to change the word \\"pen\\" to \\"frindle.\\"  Soon all the kids at his school say they are using \\"frindles,\\" not pens.  The word \\"frindle\\" catches on beyond Nick's school, and \\"frindle\\" soon spreads across the country.  What happens to Nick, who attracts a lot of attention, and Mrs. Granger, the teacher who opposes him in the \\"frindle\\" plan, is funny, exciting, and different from anything you've ever read.<br /><br />TO ADULTS looking for good kids' reading:  Not only is this a terrific story, sure to capture the imagination, it is also a story which teaches important ideas about words, dictionaries, communication, and how the mass media of national TV, newspapers, and magazines influence the acceptance of words and ideas.  As \\"frindle\\" spreads rapidly throughout the country, it begins to be used in marketing and advertising, and kids reading the book see indirectly how these fields depend on trends--and the latest and most popular words--to sell products.  The personal relationship of Nick and Mrs. Granger, his teacher, is presented sensitively, and a follow-up at the end, when Nick is an adult, gives a grand conclusion to this creative and delightful story about learning and communication.

The National Book Award Winner from 1988, _Paris Trout_, based on a real murder and subsequent trial in Milledgeville, Georgia, is a tale of racism, abuse, bribery, injustice, and most of all, arrogance.  Paris Trout, a white shopkeeper in Cotton Point, Georgia, makes his own rules, paying little attention to other laws as he sells used cars (on which the rust is hidden under new paint), terrorizes the black community into repaying loans with high interest, and uses trickery to avoid claims on the insurance policies he sells.<br /><br />When the older brother of 14-year-old Rosie Sayers refuses to pay for a damaged car that Trout has sold and insured but will not fix, Trout and an accomplice decide to use him as an object lesson.  Going to Henry Ray's home, Trout shoots little sister Rosie to death and leaves Mary McNutt wounded with four bullets.  Surprisingly to Trout, he is put on trial, where people are bribed and the outcome is uncertain, despite eyewitnesses.  The crime and trial take up the first half of the book, while the effects of the trial on Trout's defense attorney, Harry Seagraves, the increasing madness of Trout, and the town's growing impatience with Trout's behavior occupy the second half.<br /><br />Dexter manages to give new life to a story of bigotry which has been told many times, creating in Rosie a particularly vulnerable and sad child, and in Harry Seagraves a lawyer who faces a crossroads--as a lawyer, husband, and man.  Paris Trout, however, remains a bigoted stereotype, which reduces important aspects of the plot to \\"good guys\\" vs. \\"bad guys.\\"  Dexter's earthy tone creates an atmosphere that vibrates with emotion, however, and his brilliant selection of revealing details create innumerable symbols that develop the themes, poison being the most obvious symbol--Rosie's poisoning by a rabid fox, Hanna Trout's poisoning by physical and sexual abuse, and the town's poisoning by Trout's attitudes.<br /><br />Dramatic, bloody, and horrifying, this novel shines a spotlight on a town which resembles a large snake that has been run over and is now \\"stuck to the highway with her own gum.\\"  As the town begins to free itself from Paris Trout, his power, and the attitudes he represents, the reader knows that Trout, too, is only a symbol, that real change will take generations.

Dorothy Rothschild Parker's malicious wit, mordant humor, and cynicism are brilliantly revealed in this audiotape narrated by Elaine Strich.  With a gravelly voice appropriate for the wearied New York lives she portrays, Strich imbues \\"Big Blonde\\" and a host of other stories with attitudes of the late 1920s through the early 1940s, showing the arrogance of men in relation to women, the voluntary subservience of the women, and the shallow goals of socially conscious people whose primary concern is recognition by each other.<br /><br />\\"Big Blonde,\\" her most famous story, describes how Mrs. Morse, a large blonde woman, finds happiness in her recent marriage and homemaking, only to find her husband becoming less interested in her as she becomes more domestic and less \\"exciting.\\"  Mrs. Morse's downward spiral into drink and an eventual suicide attempt parallel Parker's own life.  \\"Too Bad\\" tells of the Weldons, an upscale couple who seem to have a perfect marriage, except that they can no longer find anything to say to each other, largely because the wife has become a bore.  \\"Song of the Shirt\\" tells of a wealthy woman of \\"great heart,\\" who volunteers to sew hospital robes for wounded soldiers but is unable to help the unemployed mother of a polio-stricken child.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Durant\\" continues the emphasis on the arrogance of men, as the title character has an affair with a naïve employee who becomes pregnant and loses her desirability.  \\"Diary of a New York Lady\\" details the shallow social activities, the theatre going, and the repetitive parties of a woman with too little to do.  The funniest, most tongue-in-cheek story, \\"The Garter,\\" tells of a character named Dorothy Parker who is stranded on the couch at a major party because her garter has broken and she can't get up without losing her stocking.<br /><br />Parker adds much ironic humor to these stories of failure.  She is cruelly critical of women who let men determine their destinies, mocking both their pretensions and their lack of imagination, but she also recognizes that they have little choice and few opportunities to escape their lot.  Equally critical of men, she finds their interest in women selfish and often limited to the bedroom.

Virgil Ball, son of a Kansas preacher, \\"student of Spinoza and Descartes,\\" and the focus of much of the action, is \\"the Redeemer's darling,\\" bright, literate, and willing to commit murder without remorse.  The other members of the gang, equally violent and even more bizarre, gradually reveal how they, too, have become associated with Morelle and how they have acted on his instructions.<br /><br />In the second half of the novel, the \\"religion\\" of Morelle and his \\"apostles\\" gains more attention, with numerous references to a small blind child, the OLD Old Testament, the sephira of the kabbala, mystical symbols, the \\"ladder of the spirit,\\" and cleansing through violence.  Believing that the Canaanites are the descendants of the sixth tribe of Israel, Morelle's followers wish to learn \\"Canaan's tongue...the language of the elect.\\"<br /><br />The story moves back and forth in time and is told through the first-person points of view of the eight gang members. (Their identities are revealed, oddly, through the key phrase \\"Virgil [or someone else] says,\\" embedded in the first sentence of each  chapter.  The 3rd person point of view then switches suddenly, and without any transition, to a first person account by the named person).  Samuel Clemens's reference to the Redeemer, a letter in which he talks of meeting \\"Murel,\\" a letter from Morelle to Sec. of State Seward, along with daybooks, a court inquiry, occasional poetry, and quotations from famous people give a sense of historicity to the novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bizarre and violent characters do not inspire much reader sympathy, and the constantly shifting points of view sometimes make the action difficult to place chronologically.  The concept of the Trade and its support by government officials is fascinating, even exciting, and possibly allegorical, but Morelle's unusual religion, which the reader must figure out from often indirect references throughout the narratives, is esoteric and not always clear.

Cookbook authors Marion Burros and Lois Levine, who co-authored the original Elegant But Easy cookbook in 1960, team up once again, adapting some of their most popular recipes from the past to today's changing tastes.  Fifty recipes from the earlier edition are included here, though all these recipes have been purged of MSG, canned soups, and most convenience foods.  Butter, cream, eggs, and cheese are used in reduced quantities, and wherever the authors have been able to substitute low fat for high fat, they do so.  This cookbook, however, is not about low-calorie or low-fat cooking.  The goal is \\"pure, simple, fresh-tasting\\" food, and that sometimes means lots of eggs and fat-based dairy products.<br /><br />Two of the most appealing sections are Appetizers and Hors d'oeuvres, but these are also sections where those on low-fat diets need to pay attention.  Sour cream, Roquefort and cream cheeses, and phyllo dough (brushed with 1 - 3 sticks of melted butter) are heavily featured in the appetizers.  In the Hors D'Oeuvres section, however, Hummus, Black Bean Dip, Pickled Shrimp, and Caponata (served on bruschetta) offer great low-fat alternatives to cheese and cream-based spreads.<br /><br />Imaginative chicken recipes--Chicken Gloriosa (with pineapple, cranberries, and tangerines), Grilled Chicken with Black Bean and Mango Salsa, and Curried Chicken and Apples are delicious and relatively low-fat, with turkey or chicken sausage replacing pork sausage in several recipes.  Meat recipes, once the biggest section of Elegant But Easy, have been reduced to fifteen recipes, with a delectable Lasagna calling for turkey sausage, lowfat ricotta, a sauce of red wine and tomatoes, and baked eggplant.  Desserts range from simple fruit desserts to a Triple Chocolate Mocha Madness Cake, a complex recipe which takes four full pages of instructions.  And for those who loved the Plum Torte in the earlier book, it's here, along with a lower fat alternative, just as good.<br /><br />The authors always tell how far in advance each recipe can be prepared, how long it can be refrigerated, and whether it can be frozen and for how long.  An extensive list of mail order addresses for some of the less common ingredients is included at the beginning, and \\"Ten Menus with [Step-by-Step] Countdown Game Plans\\" are included at the end.  In short, this cookbook tries to be as \\"elegant but easy\\" as the 1960 edition, and it succeeds--as long as you recognize that \\"lower fat\\" is not the same as \\"low-fat.\\"  Mary Whipplee authors always tell how far in advance each recipe can be prepared, how long it can be refrigerated, and whether it can be frozen and for how long.

Brian Friel, one of Ireland's leading contemporary dramatists, creates an unusual and absorbing drama about \\"The Fantastic Francis Hardy,\\" a faith healer originally from Ireland, who has been traveling the small towns of England, Wales, and Scotland with his wife Grace and his manager Teddy. On some nights several people in a small audience may be healed, but, nine times out of ten, no one is. \\"Am I endowed with a unique and awesome gift?\\" Frank wonders. \\"Am I a conman?\\" He believes he falls somewhere \\"between those absurd exaggerations.\\"<br /><br />The play has no interactive scenes.  In separate monologues each character stands alone on an almost-bare stage, and all attention is riveted on him/her.  In glorious language, each person reveals the problems which torment him/her. Talking about his days on the road with Grace and Teddy, Frank discusses his recent return to Ireland, where, in a local pub, he made two attempts at healing, but he refuses to say much more.<br /><br />The suspense builds in the next act, as the distraught speaker is Grace, a former lawyer who gave up everything to follow the charismatic Frank. As she tells of her love for Frank, his treatment of her, and the terrible conditions of life on the road, the audience is unsure why they have been living apart. The third speaker, the devoted Teddy, fills in some gaps between the monologues of Frank and of Grace, though we still do not know what has happened--until Frank's final monologue.<br /><br />In the hands of outstanding actors, these monologues are powerful theater. (James Mason was Frank in the 1979 New York run of the play.)  In a repeating incantation, Frank and Grace \\"sing\\" the names of the small towns in Scotland and Wales to which they have journeyed, connecting their monologues through this repetition and different memories of the same events. Surprisingly, the lyrics of Jerome Kern's \\"The Way You Look Tonight,\\" which Teddy uses as background music during Frank's healings, echo through Teddy's monologue, which achieves great irony when he sings, \\"I will feel a glow just thinking of you...\\"<br /><br />As the audience develops interest in and empathy for the speakers, the tension rises. Gradually one becomes aware that time has passed between these monologues, and Frank's concluding monologue is stunning. Friel manages, somehow, to create an involving and powerful drama, despite the fact there is no on-stage interaction and the characters flout the \\"rules\\" of theater by \\"telling about\\" events instead of reenacting them. Memorable and haunting, both as an overall play and as close-ups of three individual characters, this is Friel in one of his most compelling and unusual plays.

Mary Renault's great historical novel of Theseus begins when he is a young man in Troizen, a well-bred youth who has never known his father's identity. When, with the help of the gods, he succeeds in lifting a stone to reclaim his father's sword, Theseus discovers that he is the son of Aigeus, King of Athens. On his way to Athens to meet him, Theseus arrives in Eleusis, where after wrestling the king in a fight to the death, he finds himself, unexpectedly, the King of Eleusis. Later, in Athens, when fourteen young men and women are chosen by lot to become bull-dancers in Crete, fulfilling a tribute demanded by the King of Crete, Theseus listens to his god and joins the group, never knowing if he will survive to return to his father.<br /><br />Renault tells the story of Theseus as if Theseus were a real person, not a mythical character, using history, archaeology, and a deep understanding of the cultures of the period to place Theseus in a realistic context. Her descriptions of the lifting of the stone, the wrestling match in Eleusis, Theseus's arrival at the palace in Athens, and especially his experiences in becoming a bull dancer bring the period vibrantly to life in ways consistent with the historical record. Theseus's devotion to the god Poseidon, to whom he prays throughout his journey, reflects his appreciation of his own smallness in relation to the gods, and his honoring of the gods unique to the kingdoms he visits show how the Greek religion gradually incorporated increasing numbers of gods and goddesses to explain the increasingly complex mysteries of life faced by Greek citizens.<br /><br />Renault never fails to treat Theseus, his religion and culture, and the traditions of the countries in which he travels with the dignity they would have inspired in their own period. She never patronizes either her characters or her readers, writing with elegance and a fine appreciation for the details of daily life, the art of the period, and the pantheon of gods thought to control men's destinies. Whether Theseus was a real man whose strength and reputation grew to mythical proportions, as Renault illustrates, or whether he was, in fact, a mythical character whom she places in a realistic context in ancient Greece is less important than the fact that she creates a plausible life for this monumental character. Few, if any, other authors are so successful in recreating an entire era, its people, its beliefs, and its culture. Mary Whipplel men's destinies.

Neil Simon molds the stories of Anton Chekhov into exquisitely timed, often hilarious theatre, dramatizing seven stories which incorporate a wide variety of characters--a governess, a lady of the night, a blustering general, a wild woman with a nervous disorder, a rou&eacute; flirting with a new bride, a man who earns money by \\"drowning,\\" and an actress. The stories, adapted for the stage, are filled with dry humor, surprise endings, and clever common people in confrontations with \\"superiors,\\" ending in absurdities.  \\"The Writer,\\" obviously Chekhov, who himself was a \\"good doctor,\\" acts as narrator and serves to connect the various scenes.<br /><br />The short stories/plays, all filled with irony, include \\"The Sneezer,\\" who cannot apologize enough to a general for splattering a sneeze on his head.  In \\"The Governess,\\" an employer tricks a subservient governess out of her pay.  \\"The Seduction\\" shows a man-about-town using a husband as the conduit for his attempted seduction of the man's new bride.  \\"The Drowned Man\\" claims to be in the \\"maritime entertainment business\\" and will drown himself for a small fee.  \\"The Defenseless Creature,\\" a particularly hilarious scene, features a clever wife suffering from a \\"nervous disorder,\\" who tries to extort money from a banker.  In \\"The Arrangement\\" a father takes his shy, 19-year-old son to a house of ill repute.<br /><br />The most challenging scene for an actor is \\"The Audition.\\"  An actress who has walked for four days from another city in order to try out for a play, arrives with a temperature of 103, then insists on doing the audition.  Playing the parts of all three sisters from Chekhov's The Three Sisters, the actress begins as a sensitive sister, then bursts into tears on cue as the second sister, and ultimately becomes rational, composed, and straightforward as the third, the changes of mood requiring split second timing.<br /><br />Throughout the play, a running joke revolves around Chekhov's reputation as a less \\"beloved\\" writer than Tolstoy and Turgenev.  Often dealing with suffering characters, the scenes show that there is a kind of absurd humor underlying even the most tragic of circumstances.  Though \\"Some of us are indeed trapped,\\" and many are suffering, the world itself, according to Chekhov, has \\"gone mad.\\"  If one can see the humor in this mad world, life becomes bearable.

Written as a \\"play for voices\\" for the BBC, this work was originally performed in 1954, with Richard Burton as the First Voice, connecting all thirty-three characters--men, women, and small children.  Depicting one full day in the life of a small town in Wales, Thomas shows its motley residents as they awaken, perform their daily tasks, socialize and gossip, and daydream about the past that might have been and the future that may yet offer hope.  As is always the case with Thomas, the \\"play\\" is full of alliteration and various kinds of rhyme, with nouns and adjectives used as verbs to convey action and sense impressions simultaneously.  A wry humor and honesty of feeling make the work engaging for the listener/reader and charmingly illustrative of a time and place now gone.<br /><br />Individual characters come alive through their own voices and through the gossip of others, spread by the postman and by neighbors.  When night falls and the residents retire, their additional losses and disappointments, along with their escapes into dreams, are given voice and poignancy.  Polly Garter, with her numerous children by numerous fathers, dreams of Willie Weasel, a very small man who was the love of her life.  Captain Cat, the blind bell-ringer, thinks of all the sailors he knew who died at sea and Mr. Pugh dreams of poisoning his wife.<br /><br />Simple songs add to the realism and the sense of character and place. An elegiac song by Polly Garter, as she remembers Willie and compares him to her other lovers, conveys an almost palpable sadness and makes Polly one of the most memorable characters.  A humorous singing game by children adds to the realism, and young Gwenny's song to three very young boys is full of cheeky humor.  Filled with the hurly-burly of everyday life in a small town in 1950s Wales, this and A Child's Christmas in Wales are among Thomas's most beloved works.  Mary Whipple	2005-06-01

Mma Precious Ramotswe, warm-hearted proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Gaborone, Botswana, is drinking tea at an outdoor caf&eacute; when she witnesses the theft of a bracelet. In her haste to apprehend the female thief and return the bracelet to the poor vendor, she leaves her table without paying her bill. The waitress hurries after her, accuses her of intentionally neglecting her bill, and then offers to \\"forget\\" about it if Mma pays her an extortionate fee.<br /><br />Distressed by what she sees as the loss of Botswana's traditional values, Mma Ramotswe believes fervently in setting a good example, respecting others and promoting friendships in her own life. Recently married to Mr. J. L. B. Matekone, proprietor of the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, Mma Ramotswe runs her detective agency (where she doles out homespun advice and often serves as a \\"mother confessor\\"), takes care of two orphaned children, mentors Mma Grace Makutsi, her assistant, and endeavors to get the two apprentices at her husband's garage to become responsible citizens.<br /><br />Throughout the series, plots and subplots serve primarily as vehicles for character development and the exploration of cultural values. In this novel Mma Ramotswe has a deep secret, not shared even with her husband, and she is desperate to have it remain a secret. Her house is broken into, her car is stolen, and Note Makoti, her first husband, returns to Gabarone. Mysterious goings-on occur in Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni's former house, now rented; the detective agency looks for a missing man from Zambia; and Mma Makuti finds herself receiving the attentions of a clumsy suitor.  None of these events are, of course, world-shaking, but they are significant in the lives of the hard-working and honest people who populate this delightful novel.<br /><br />South African playwright Lisette Lecat, reader of this audiobook, puts her feeling for dialogue to work here, giving a dramatic but completely realistic sound to this story of Mma Ramotswe, rolling the MM in \\"Mma\\" in a completely natural way, impossible for a foreigner to duplicate.  Her ability to assume different voices for different characters, without being \\"cute,\\" adds to the sense of place and to the characters' personalities.

The Forder family, in the first of three major story lines, is on assignment in Ecuador in 1970, where the father works for the US State Department. Rosalind Forder, the mother, and Alice, her daughter, are doubly displaced since they are originally from Australia.<br /><br />In the second story line, taking place in 1929, Violet Clarence (Rosalind's mother) is living in Australia, helping her husband Alf hack out a home in the bush.  Because her family originally came from England, she has always regarded England as \\"home.\\"  Part III follows an earlier relative, a Mr. Clarence in 1822, as he is dispossessed of his land in Scotland and moves with his foster son George to St. Michael in the Portuguese Azores.<br /><br />In each of these three story lines, the \\"exotic\\" foreign residents permanently affect the environments in which they live--Mr. Forder by manipulating the fluid Ecuadorian political system so that American tuna companies can harvest at will in Ecuadorian waters;  Violet and her husband through their work clearing land for farming and sheepherding;  and Mr. Clarence and George through their importation to the Azores of exotic plants and new kinds of orange trees from around the world.<br /><br />Alison clearly believes that despoiling a natural environment by removing or adding new plants and/or animals is dangerous and often foolish, no matter how honorable the motives, and she is even clearer on the subject of colonialism, both the old colonialism of the British Empire and, as she sees it, the more recent colonialism of the US.  Mr. Forder's notion that \\"[Development in Ecuador] is not a matter of right...it's a matter of responsibility,\\" is shown to have permanent, ineradicable effects, both on the natural environment and on the local people who inhabit it.<br /><br />Alison never forgets that she is a novelist, however, and she never yields to polemics, softening her message through the love that some of the characters show for the environment and through sensuous, lyrical descriptions of immense beauty.  Her depiction of geological eras and natural processes is so vivid the reader feels transported to a different world, making the contrasts effected by civilization more strongly felt.

First performed in 2001 in Dublin, Justin Butcher's Scaramouche Jones is a fascinating one-man \\"play\\" in which a clown, Scaramouche Jones, relives his life and contemplates his death at the age of one hundred. Born at midnight on December 31, 1899, Scaramouche will die as the Millenium begins, having witnessed major events of the twentieth century, which he brings to life and explores, not just as a clown who has acquired seven masks during his lifetime, but as an everyman, giving breadth and universality to this drama.<br /><br />The son of an \\"Ethiop\\" gypsy mother living in Trinidad and a British father, long gone, his masks include, among other things, his pale skin, the salt he acquires on a sailing dhow, and the white goat's milk paste used to keep away evil spirits in northern Africa. Gradually, he acquires additional masks, each one associated with a life-changing experience, including one from a Nazi death camp.<br /><br />At every stage of Scaramouche's story, the author compares Scaramouche's life as an outsider, a man who is denied life's \\"blessings\\" and who often lives in Third World societies, to what is happening in mainstream European history, bringing the contrasts to life. Butcher creates vivid word pictures and elicits extraordinary sympathy for Scaramouche, at the same time that he gives Scaramouche strength, a sense of honor, and, ultimately, heroic stature. His stories are vivid, the characters he meets are often fascinating, the mood varies from humor to sadness, and the ironies are palpable. It is a testament to Butcher's ear for conversational language that Scaramouche's speech sounds so real.<br /><br />This edition incorporates a number of photographs from the production by the Bristol Old Vic in 2002, with Pete Postlethwaite as Scaramouche.

The History of Love is one of the most original and engaging pieces of literary fiction of the past year.  The novel focuses on a book entitled The History of Love, written by Leo Gursky at age twenty in Slonim, Poland, to honor Alma Mereminski, with whom he has shared an extraordinary love.  When the Nazis threaten Poland and Alma has to flee, Leo, unsure if he will escape, gives his book for safekeeping to his best friend, who is sailing to Lisbon.  Leo eventually makes his way to New York, where as a locksmith, he is a \\"man who became invisible.\\"  His book about Alma has vanished.<br /><br />Leo's story unfolds through his memories and moves back and forth in time, running in parallel with the story of Alma Singer, a 14-year-old girl named for a character in a Spanish-language book entitled, coincidentally, The History of Love, which her father bought in Valparaiso, Chile, and gave to her mother when they were newlyweds.  Young Alma, lonely following her father's death, spends her days writing How to Survive in the Wild, in an attempt to control the uncertainties of her life, while her brother Bird, eleven and a half, loses himself in religion, believing he may be the Messiah.  Their mother becomes a translator of books.<br /><br />Gradually, the characters and their stories converge, and the reader learns how a book written in Polish came to be published in Spanish in Chile, then translated into English by Alma's mother for a client living in Venice.  The relationships of the characters as they age, their attitudes toward life and love, and their goals for the future create a fluid thematic structure in which characters spring to life and become the primary focus.<br /><br />Using humor, absurdity, and a variety of points of view, Krauss creates profound emotion and sympathy for these characters as they deal with absurd reality, always keying her unique imagery to their particular points of view.  Ultimately the reader recognizes that Krauss's novel, like Leo's book, illustrates the many different kinds of love.  With an opening page guaranteed to pique the interest of even the most jaded reader, this confident novel, written with assurance and panache, is fresh and full of charm, a novel illustrating in unique ways some of the oldest themes in literature.

New Zealand artist Jane Seabrook has succeeded in creating one of the most charming and amusing gift books ever! Using captivating watercolor animal portraits to illustrate aphorisms, many of them with new twists, she puts parenthood into perspective on many levels--and does so with panache. A mother kangaroo looks into her pouch at her baby and states, \\"A perfect example of minority rule is...a baby in the house.\\"  A pileated woodpecker with two older chicks states, \\"There are few things more satisfying than seeing your children have teenagers of their own.\\"  A turtle suggests, \\"No matter how old a mother is...she continues to watch her middle-aged children for signs of improvement.\\"<br /><br />Seabrook's art techniques allow her to pull off a book which in the hands of a lesser, less painstaking artist might be just \\"cute.\\" Her paintings are rich and meticulously detailed--beautifully drawn with a sable brush of a single hair.

The eyes of each animal \\"character\\" sparkle with what appears to be secret understanding of the message.

As naïve Jim gravitates toward the more street-wise Doyler, their friendship blossoms, they rejoice in each other's company, and they begin to try on roles for the future--Doyler finding an outlet with Irish rebels, and Jim considering a priestly vocation.<br /><br />It quickly becomes clear to the reader that this will be a gay coming-of-age story within the broader context of the Irish rebellion, and these two stories mesh seamlessly, with many obvious parallels. Quietly, without beating any drums or making any polemical statements, O'Neill allows his characters to discover their feelings for each other and their inborn nature, even as the political rebellion takes shape. O'Neill's characters are who they are, and he respects them and the reader too much to use them simply to prove a point. The parallels he draws between them and some of the famous leaders of the Irish rebellion, such as Roger Casement, and between them and the Sacred Band of Thebes are incidental to the story, though they do give a broader context to the gay relationship.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this engrossing novel was with the character of MacMurrough, an older \\"mentor\\" to both boys.

One of the most seductive of all ghost stories, Turn of the Screw is a sophisticated and subtle literary exercise in which the author creates a dense, suggestive, and highly ambiguous story, its suspense and horror generated primarily by what the author does NOT say and does not describe. Compelled to fill in the blanks from his/her own store of personal fears, the reader ultimately conjures up a more horrifying set of images and circumstances than anything an author could impose from without.<br /><br />Written in 1898, this is superficially the tale of a governess who accepts the job of teaching two beautiful, young children whose uncle-guardian wants nothing to do with them. On a symbolic level, however, it is a study of the mores and prejudices of the times and, ultimately, of the nature of Evil. The governess fears that ghosts of the former governess Miss Jessel and her lover, valet Peter Quint, have corrupted the souls of little Flora and Miles and have won them to the side of Evil. The children deny any knowledge of ghosts, and, in fact, only the governess actually sees them. Were it not for the fact that the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, can identify them from the governess's descriptions, one might be tempted to think that the governess is hallucinating.<br /><br />Though the governess is certainly neurotic and repressed, this novel was published ten years before Freud, suggesting that the story should be taken at face value, as a suspenseful but enigmatic Victorian version of a Faustian struggle for the souls of these children, yet numerous other interpretations find their ardent supporters as well.  Assembling an assortment of scholarly, critical essays on this ambiguous novel, editor Peter Beidler provides a variety of other interpretations, ranging from psychosexual to feminist and materialist.  The authors of each of these interpretations find ample material in James's ambiguities to support their own interpretations, since James himself never provided any explanations.  The editor's fascinating collection of interpretations of James's most elusive novel make this is a fine resource for serious students.

Sometimes compared to Dickens or Victor Hugo for the strength of his descriptions, Rohinton Mistry uses \\"ordinary\\" men and women as his protagonists and fills his novels with the sights, sounds, smells, and color of India.  Depicting his characters as neither saints nor sinners, he involves the reader in their lives as they try to survive the complexities of their culture.<br /><br />In this novel, Gustad Noble and his wife Dilnavaz, living in a congested apartment building in Bombay, try to lead good lives and inspire their children during Indira Gandhi's rule in the 1970s, with all its political, professional, and social upheaval.  India is on the verge of war with the Muslims of Pakistan, and though Gustad, a Parsi, is aware of political chicanery, he is far more pre-occupied with having his son accepted at a school of technology, doing his job as a bank supervisor, and supporting his family.  Constant blackouts and continually deteriorating conditions on the street add to the frustrations of Gustad's life.<br /><br />Then Jimmy Bilimoria, an old friend, asks Gustad for help, claiming that he is training freedom fighters in Bangladesh to act on behalf of the Indian government against Pakistani \\"butchers.\\"  Gustad reluctantly agrees to use his position at the bank to deposit money to a secret account, but he soon finds himself enmeshed in a spiral from which he cannot break out, his life turned upside down.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, the wall outside Gustad's apartment building symbolizes the larger world of Bombay and parallels some aspects of Gustad's own life.  At the outset, it is used as a latrine, breeding illness in the neighborhood but keeping the noise and tumult of the street out of the apartment house.  When Gustad persuades a sidewalk artist to paint it, he depicts scenes from all the religions of India, and the wall becomes a shrine--until the government decides to widen the road and tear it down. Gustad's personal crisis and the fate of the wall intersect in a conclusion both moving and profound.<br /><br />Though this novel lacks the grand scale of A Fine Balance, it is a beautifully constructed and emotionally involving story of a small family trying to live meaningful lives against almost overwhelming odds.  The characters are finely drawn, and the plot, though not \\"exciting,\\" reflects the traumas of an ordinary man and his wife caught up in events and crises not of their own making.

Published in 1984, this stunning collection of interrelated short stories won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction.  Focusing on the lives of several Chippewa Indian families, and the white families with whom they interact and/or marry, author Louise Erdrich depicts their traditional culture through some of the early characters, and, through later characters, the way the old ways change or become compromised through education, the introduction of religion by missionaries, and contact with modern society.  The stories are set in North Dakota on or near a remote reservation, not far from the Canadian border, similar to the place where Erdrich grew up and where her parents worked as teachers for the Bureau of Indian Affairs<br /><br />The stories reveal fifty years in the lives of the Kashpaw and Lamartine families from the 1930s to the 1980s, as they interact, intermarry, and ultimately try to figure out who they have become.  Through her selection of details and her often lyrical descriptions, Erdrich creates vibrant local settings within which her characters tell their stories in lively, colloquial voices. Emotional, matter-of-fact, tormented, and sometimes angry, the characters are equally well drawn for both men and women.<br /><br />The separate stories of Marie and Nector Kashpaw, which come together when they marry, occupy much of the very early years covered by the collection, but their stories also involve Lulu Lamartine, with whom Nector has a long affair.  In the 1980s, Marie and Nector's grandson, Lipsha Morrissey, tries to create a \\"love medicine\\" for his elderly grandparents in an old age home, a story filled with ironies and, ultimately, dark humor.  Between these stories time flashes forward and back as other generations, other children and parents from the same families, try to deal with the immediate aftermath of war, the harshness of the prison system, unemployment, and poverty.<br /><br />As the characters overlap and interact throughout the stories,  the author conveys Chippewa culture, the families' resistance to and acceptance of change, the roles of strong women in holding families together, the hostility towards the federal government, and the sometimes overwhelming despair of those who live on the reservation.  The characters' sense of pride and endurance elevate even the saddest and most wrenching stories, however, while the bleak humor keeps them from becoming morbid or sentimental.  Dramatic, thoughtful, and powerful, Erdrich's collection creates an unforgettable portrait of two families who represent a changing Chippewa nation.

Investigating the 1984 murder of Mickalou Maugham, a Traveler well liked and admired for his gentleness of spirit and his playing of the uillean pipes, Chief Inspector Peter McGarr focuses on Desmond Bacon, known as the Toddler, who is the sadistic head of the drug trade in Ireland. Mickalou, missing for weeks, has been found dead at the top of a giant sequoia tree in County Wicklow, and Biddy Nevins, his wife, a former addict and sidewalk artist, has fled from Ireland, fearing both the Toddler and the possibility that one or more Garda members may be working with him. Twelve years later, the Toddler catches up with her, and shootouts, home invasions, car chases, and a high body count result, as he tries to protect his turf and avoid prosecution.<br /><br />As he does in the rest of this series, Gill develops stories on two levels--the immediate action and excitement of a specific mystery, focusing on some lesser known aspect of Irish life (in this case, the Traveler community), and the stories and relationships of his continuing cast of characters as they develop during the series. Ruthie Bresnahan and Hugh Ward, whose discovery of each other was a huge and often hilarious part of an earlier mystery (Death of a Joyce Scholar), have now had a years-long relationship, which is about to be tested during the action of this novel.<br /><br />Gill's intensely realized descriptions--of the abuse of a Traveler by the Tod, of an addict in need of a fix, and of a teenager trying to fit in at a dance, for example--make his scenes come alive, while his understanding of the vagaries of police procedure gives a sense of reality to his less than perfect detectives. McGarr is a strong and caring main character whose sense of justice and honor are paramount (even if it means bending the rules), while his well developed cast of likable and amusing subordinates, who continue to grow in successive novels, provides the reader with long-term rewards throughout the series.

Setting this novel in Venice immediately after World War II, Joseph Kanon creates a stimulating mystery that turns the city itself into a major character. Venice, unlike other areas of Italy, has not been damaged physically by the war, and life is returning to normal. The political atmosphere, however, remains turbulent. Aristocrats, businessmen, and politicians who cooperated with the fascists and Germans are still in power. Partisans who fought the fascists and Germans regard many of these people as traitors and want justice. The Communists are making inroads into society with their promises of reform.<br /><br />Into this milieu comes Grace Miller, an American widow, and her son Adam, just released from the US Army as part of a de-Nazification team in Frankfurt. Grace is about to marry Gianni Maglione, a Venetian doctor, and Adam wonders about Gianni's past. Soon Adam meets Claudia Grassini, a young Jewish woman who survived internment in Fossoli, and they begin a passionate affair. When Claudia is introduced to Gianni at a party, however, she recognizes him immediately, telling Adam that Gianni betrayed her very sick father to security forces rounding up Jews.<br /><br />Using his past army connections to get further information about Gianni, Adam investigates, but violence soon changes the focus of his energies, and the nightmare involving Adam, his family, and Claudia intensifies. Adam's extreme introspection as he helps the police investigate broadens the scope and focuses attention on important themes of crime and justice, and Claudia's vulnerability as a result of the Holocaust gives added poignancy to her similar self-examinations.<br /><br />With a setting so vivid that one cannot imagine the story taking place anywhere else, the reader sees Venice shining, but beneath the surface it is a decaying city, literally sinking under its own weight. War crimes, hate crimes, crimes of passion, crimes committed for altruistic reasons, and crimes committed in self-defense all play a part in the plot. Kanon also raises questions about the punishments, if any, associated with these crimes. Are some crimes less \\"serious,\\" or even justifiable, if they balance the scale of justice? Is the murder of a criminal excusable? Does justice depend on who wins? Ultimately, a chase scene through the canals of Venice, leads to a stunning conclusion, filled with twists, though whether justice is truly served remains an open question.

On some nights several people in a small audience may be healed, but, nine times out of ten, no one is.  \\"Am I endowed with a unique and awesome gift?\\"  Frank wonders.  \\"Am I a conman?\\"  He believes he falls somewhere \\"between those absurd exaggerations.\\"<br /><br />In each of the four acts, one of the three characters appears alone on stage and speaks in a dramatic monologue.  Talking in Act I about his days on the road with Grace and Teddy, Frank discusses his recent return to Ireland, where, in a local pub, he made two attempts at healing, but he refuses to say much more.  The suspense builds in the next act, where the distraught speaker is Grace, a former lawyer who gave up everything to follow the charismatic Frank.  As she tells of her love for Frank, his treatment of her, and the terrible conditions of life on the road, the audience is unsure why she and Frank have been living apart.  The speaker in Act III, the devoted Teddy, fills in some gaps between the monologues of Frank and of Grace, though we still do not know what has happened--until Frank's final monologue.<br /><br />In the hands of outstanding actors, these monologues are powerful theater.  (James Mason was Frank in the 1979 New York run of the play.)  Each speaker stands alone on an almost-bare stage, and all attention is riveted on him/her, what s/he says, and the glorious language in which s/he says it.  In a repeating incantation, Frank and Grace \\"sing\\" the names of the small towns in Scotland and Wales to which they have journeyed, connecting their monologues through this repetition and through their different memories of the same events.  Echoing through Teddy's  monologue, are the lyrics to Jerome Kern's \\"The Way You Look Tonight,\\" which Teddy uses as background music during Frank's healings, and which achieve great irony when he sings, \\"I will feel a glow just thinking of you...\\"<br /><br />As the audience develops interest in and empathy for the speakers, the tension rises.  Gradually they become aware that time has passed between these monologues.  Frank's concluding monologue is stunning. Friel manages, somehow, to create an involving and powerful drama, despite the fact there is no on-stage interaction, and the characters flout the \\"rules\\" of theater by \\"telling about\\" events instead of reenacting them.  Memorable and haunting, both as an overall play and as portraits of three individual characters, this is Friel in one of his most compelling and unusual plays.

Newland Archer, the protagonist of this ironically entitled novel set in the late nineteenth century, is a proper New York gentleman, and part of a society which adheres to strict social codes, subordinating all aspects of life to doing what is expected, which is synonymous with doing what it right.  As the author remarks early in the novel, \\"Few things were more awful than an offense against Taste.\\"  Newland meets and marries May Welland, an unimaginative, shallow young woman whose upbringing has made her the perfect, inoffensive wife, one who knows how to behave and how to adhere to the \\"rules\\" of the society in which they live.<br /><br />When Newland is reintroduced to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, who has left her husband in Europe and now wants a divorce, he finds himself utterly captivated by her freedom and her willingness to risk all, socially, by flouting convention.  Both Ellen and Newland, however, are products of their upbringing and their culture, and they dutifully resist their feelings because of their separate social obligations.  Various meetings between them suggest that their feelings are far stronger than what is obvious on the surface, and the question of whether either of them will finally state their feelings pervades the novel.<br /><br />Wharton creates an exceptionally realistic picture of New York in the post-Civil War era, a time in which aristocrats of inherited wealth found themselves competing socially with parvenus, and social rules were changing.  Her ability to show the conflict between a person's desire for freedom and his/her need for social acceptance is striking.  As the various characters make their peace with their decisions--either to conform to or to challenge social dictates--the novel achieves an unusual dramatic tension, subtle because of its lack of direct confrontation and powerful in its effects on individual destinies. This is, in fact, less an \\"age of innocence\\" than it is an age of social manipulation.<br /><br />Wharton herself manipulates the reader--her best dialogues are those in which the characters never actually participate--conversations that they keep to themselves, confrontations which they never allow themselves to have, and resolutions which happen through inaction rather than through decision-making.  Filled with acute social observations, the novel shows individuals convincing themselves that obeying social dictates is the right thing to do.  Though the novel sometimes seems to smother the reader with its limitations on action, Age of Innocence brilliantly captures the age and attitudes of the era.

One of the most original and delightful novels of the year, Borges and the Eternal Orangutans is simultaneously a literary thriller, a parody of the detective story, and an anti-detective story.  Taking its title (and one of its primary images) from Elizabethan writer John Dee, who wrote that if an orangutan were given enough time, he would eventually produce all the books in the world, the novel takes place in Buenos Aires, where an international group of Edgar Allan Poe specialists gathers for a meeting of the mysterious Israfel Society.<br /><br />The narrator, Vogelstein, a 50-year-old man who has led a cloistered life, \\"without adventures or surprises,\\" believes that he has been called to the conference by destiny--\\"some hidden Borges\\"--and the convenient death of his cat confirms this belief. For years Vogelstein has wanted to meet author Jorge Luis Borges, who is attending the meeting.  He once translated a Borges story for \\"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine,\\" creating and tacking on a new conclusion--a \\"tail\\"--to \\"improve\\" its inconclusive conclusion.  He has been trying to make amends with the horrified author ever since.<br /><br />Addressing the novel to the blind Borges, Vogelstein describes how, during the conference, he discovered the bloody body of Rotkopf, the most argumentative speaker, in Rotkopf's hotel room.  Two other speakers wanted Rotkopf dead.  Borges and Vogelstein eventually team up, applying their talents to solving the cryptograms Vogelstein believes are hidden within the murder scene and in the position of the victim's body.  Throughout the investigation, Vogelstein and Borges study the tales of Poe for help, while they simultaneously explore the origins of language, the work of John Dee and the \\"Necronomicon\\" (publicized by H. P. Lovecraft), the Kabbala, the occult, the Gnostic gospels, apochrypha, and the \\"eternal orangutan.\\"  \\"Everything is a message,\\" Vogelstein declares, \\"even the shape made by the hairs in your bar of soap.\\"<br /><br />Wildly imaginative, this literary detective story fully engages the reader with its tongue-in-cheek humor, its erudition, and its parallels with Poe.  Like some of Poe's protagonists, Vogelstein proves to be an unreliable narrator, always saying what he believes will impress his idol, Borges.  Acting like an excited child, Vogelstein serves as a blundering foil, both for the more august Borges and for the criminologist Cuervo, who wishes the dead man had \\"simply told [Vogelstein] the name of the murderer over the phone, instead of making such a complicated game of it.\\" Scholarly in its allusions and in the concepts which underlie the investigation, the novel's earnest tone and enthusiastic pursuit of arcana create a fun-filled mystery/parody sure to delight lovers of literary fiction.

Setting this almost 700-page novel in Sudan and neighboring Kenya, Philip Caputo details the massive aid efforts of non-government organizations (NGOs) from around the world to bring aid into an area so dangerous that the UN will not enter.  Using bush pilots and small airlines from Kenya, the NGOs fly into southern Sudan and land on hidden landing strips.  The Muslim government of Sudan, located to the north in Khartoum, has long been at war with the oil-rich, largely Christian south, and atrocities, thoroughly described here, occur on a regular basis--the abduction of children for children's armies, the rape and enslavement of women, the maiming and mutilation of the healthy, the cutting off of food and water, and the theft of crucial medical supplies.<br /><br />Caputo's large cast of characters consists of relief workers in Nuba, an oil-rich area in Sudan--Christian evangelists who bring aid and wish to convert the inhabitants;  the International People's Aid group, a humanitarian group from Canada, run by a former Catholic priest;  German Emergency Doctors, which operates a local hospital;  and the mercenary pilots and owners of small airlines which service the area--along with members of the SPLA; a local Arab warlord allied with the Khartoum government; and members of the international press, most notably CNN.<br /><br />The novel has a three-fold, rather than single focus--the very real atrocities of war and the real corruption of the Sudanese and Kenyan governments;  the real, marginal lives, and real tribal and religious conflicts of the Sudanese people; and the fictional lives, backgrounds, and relationships of the characters.  Well over two hundred pages are devoted to the backgrounds of fictional characters, including, sometimes, even the backgrounds of the characters' parents.  The characters are people of action and impulse, however, not of thought and contemplation, and it is their actions, not thoughts or past history, which drive the novel.  Judicious editing of the lengthy background material, especially at the beginning, could have shortened the novel significantly, tightened it thematically, and improved it dramatically.  The three love stories draw in the reader and keep the interest high, but they are given as much space here as the real struggles of the real Sudanese of Nuba.<br /><br />Caputo's intentions are to publicize the horror of this Sudanese civil war, but he also wants to show that \\"In Sudan the choice is never between the right thing and the wrong thing but between what is necessary and what isn't\\"--an ethical conundrum which conflicts with absolute, conventional values and shows the magnitude of the problems.  Planes flying aid are sometimes used to smuggle weapons;  the desire to save lives on a massive scale sometimes involves the sacrifice of lives on a small scale.<br /><br />Caputo's vision of man's inner nature is dark.  When even a high-minded evangelical makes expedient decisions with horrifying results, and when intense love slowly sputters out, then what is left?  Caputo does not provide those answers, nor does the structure of the novel.  In a conclusion dependent upon coincidence and melodrama, the reader is left with the idea that in a conflict between good and evil, the best one can hope for is a toss-up.

In a change of pace from his previous intricately plotted and lengthy novels, Iain Pears here writes a novella-length study of an artist painting a three-part portrait of the most famous art critic in England in the years of 1910 - 1913, a man with whom he has had a significant history over many years.  The critic, William Nasmyth, has come to Houat, a small island off the Brittany coast, where the artist, Henry Morris MacAlpine, has been living in exile for several years.<br /><br />As he paints Nasmyth's portrait during the course of several days, MacAlpine addresses him about their past in London, the state of the art world and its artists during these years of post-impressionism, their mutual friends and lovers, and Nasmyth's role in the success or failure of MacAlpine's artist-friends.  Sometimes angry and hostile, sometimes snide, and occasionally sentimental, MacAlpine reveals the sordid details of Nasmyth's life and ego-driven personality, which he intends to use in the portrait, a triptych--his view of Nasmyth as he was, as he is now, and as he will be.<br /><br />The artist, articulate and observant, feels totally realistic, a person we come to know, not by what he says, but by what he implies and then forces us to conclude.  Nasmyth, we see, loves power, the making or breaking of artists.  MacAlpine's friend Evelyn and his model Jacky are depicted realistically, and the reader, who comes to know them through MacAlpine's reminiscences about them, empathizes with them for their treatment by Nasmyth.  Gradually, the reader becomes aware that MacAlpine intends to make Nasmyth pay for past crimes, and though the reader may figure out generally how the novel will conclude, Pears has saved some surprises.  When the novel draws to its close, the reader feels the rightness of the conclusion.<br /><br />Because the novel is a dramatic monologue, the reader comes to know only the speaker and his point of view.  No conversations with other characters exist to show how they interact with each other, and the reader never sees other characters in action.  This leads to a novel which \\"tells about\\" what happens, instead of recreating it and allowing the reader to share it.  The author must build suspense and tension through words, rather than through action scenes, a device which leaves the reader at arm's length.

For those looking to eat more fish and less meat for health reasons, such as the need to reduce saturated fats in the diet, this cookbook offers some wonderful recipes prepared in a variety of ways--using the grill, broiler, oven, soup pot, and frying pan.  The recipes use a wide variety of fish and shellfish, including suggested alternatives for some of the more esoteric choices (monkfish, pompano, skate) not always available away from the coast.  Recipes range from \\"simple suppers\\" to fancier, special occasion preparations, and each recipe is accompanied by an attractive full-page photo of a beautiful presentation.<br /><br />Cooks looking for a complex blend of flavors to set off the fish (especially in sauces) will find that many of these recipes depend instead on only one or two ingredients for their primary flavors--a red snapper recipe is flavored with rosemary and pernod, cod flavored with vegetables and basil, and skate with brown butter and lemon juice.  Those who enjoy fruit with their fish may enjoy the halibut with oranges and molasses, salmon with fennel and apple salsa, and salmon with a sauce of mango juice.<br /><br />Many of the recipes show elaborate presentations--oven-poached whole salmon covered with 1/16\\" slices of English cucumbers, and orange roughy with 1/8\\" zucchini slices, easy to do if you have a food processor but a bit fussy to assemble.  The halibut fillet en papillote can be prepared ahead, so the \\"fuss\\" is done before the guests arrive.  Those who plan to cook fish on the grill will need to plan for split-second timing of the grilling and the presentation, and to be sure to have the correct implements for turning the fish to avoid shredding it on the hot grill, a reason many people avoid grilling fish for guests.<br /><br />Those on low fat diets need to be aware that several of these recipes call for high-fat cooking and sauces--fillets of sole meuniere calls for 6 T. of butter, trout amandine for 4 T. of butter and 4 T. olive oil, the skate with brown butter sauce for 8 T. butter, the striped bass in green curry for 14 oz. of coconut milk (very high in saturated fat), and the New England fish chowder for 1 c. half-and-half and 1 ½ c. of whole milk.  Still the selection of forty-two recipes, both fish and shellfish, offers many new ideas for the cook who needs inspiration, and some recipes can be adapted to lower fat cooking.<br /><br />Note:  Williams Sonoma has an earlier Fish cookbook by Joyce Esersky Goldstein, available Used.  The recipes in the Goldstein edition are heartier in flavor and less fussy in preparation and presentation.

When he first meets Charles Strickland, a London stockbroker, the young narrator of this novel thinks of him as \\"good, honest, dull, and plain.\\"  When Strickland suddenly abandons his wife and children and takes off for Paris, however, the narrator decides he is a cad.  Though he has had no training, Strickland has decided to become an artist, a drive so strong that he is willing to sacrifice everything toward that end.  Anti-social, and feeling no obligation to observe even the smallest social decencies, Strickland becomes increasingly boorish as he practices his art.  Eventually, he makes his way to Tahiti, where he \\"marries,\\" moves to a remote cottage, and spends the rest of his life devoted to his painting.<br /><br />Basing the novel loosely on the life of Paul Gauguin, Maugham creates an involving and often exciting story.  His narrator is a writer who feels impelled, after Strickland's death and posthumous success, to set down his memories of his early interactions with Strickland in London and Paris.  Because the narrator never saw Strickland after he left Paris, he depends on his meetings with a ship captain and a woman in Papeete for information about Strickland after Strickland's arrival in Tahiti.  The ship captain is described as a story-teller who may be spinning tall tales, a constant reminder to the reader that this is fiction, and not a biography of Gauguin.<br /><br />By depicting Strickland as a \\"dull, plain\\" man suddenly gripped by an obsession so overwhelming that nothing else matters to him, Maugham involves the reader in his actions, which even the narrator claims not to understand.  The least convincing aspect of Strickland's characterization is the narrator's observation that Strickland is completely indifferent to his wife of seventeen years and his children.  No confrontation between Strickland and his wife appears, and one wonders if perhaps Maugham found himself unable to depict such an abandonment realistically.  The story moves quickly, however, and whatever is sacrificed in the characterization is more than recouped in the plot and its development.<br /><br />Straightforward in its story line, the novel is romantic in its depiction of the artist in the grip of an obsession, his subsequent abandonment of civilization and return to nature, his suffering of a long and terminal illness (during which he paints his masterpiece), and the fate of this creation.  Good, old-fashioned story-telling at its best, this uncomplicated story, written in 1919, still has broad appeal.

Mma Precious Ramotswe, warm-hearted proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Gaborone, Botswana, is drinking tea at an outdoor caf&eacute; when she witnesses the theft of a bracelet.  In her haste to apprehend the female thief and return the bracelet to the poor vendor, she leaves her table without paying her bill.  The waitress hurries after her, accuses her of intentionally neglecting her bill, and then offers to \\"forget\\" about it if Mma pays her an extortionate fee.<br /><br />Distressed by what she sees as the loss of Botswana's traditional values, Mma Ramotswe believes fervently in setting a good example, respecting others and promoting friendships in her own life.  Recently married to Mr. J. L. B. Matekone, proprietor of the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, Mma Ramotswe runs her detective agency (where she doles out homespun advice and often serves as a \\"mother confessor\\"), takes care of two orphaned children, mentors Mma Grace Makutsi, her assistant, and endeavors to get the two apprentices at her husband's garage to become responsible citizens.  A special pleasure in this novel is the introduction of a wonderful, new character, Mr. Polopetsi, a man with a sad story who will undoubtedly be further developed in later novels.<br /><br />Throughout the series, plots and subplots serve primarily as vehicles for character development and the exploration of cultural values.  In this novel Mma Ramotswe has a deep secret, not shared even with her husband, and she is desperate to have it remain a secret.  Her house is broken into, her car is stolen, and Note Makoti, her first husband, returns to Gabarone.  Mysterious goings-on occur in Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni's former house, now rented; the detective agency looks for a missing man from Zambia; and Mma Makuti finds herself receiving the attentions of a clumsy suitor.  While these events may not be very exciting when regarded on a large scale, they are significant in the lives of these ordinary people trying to live their lives with dignity.<br /><br />Reading this series is like returning to a familiar neighborhood to meet old friends.  In simple, direct prose and a leisurely pace, the author recreates the colorful lives of a repeating set of characters who treasure relationships, treat each other with respect, and possess inherent good sense.  Full of gentle humor and much wisdom, the novel emphasizes the richness of a traditional life without including the violence, sex, or horror which fill other \\"detective\\" novels.

This classic mystery from 1935 details the complicity of Walter Huff, an insurance agent, and Phyllis Nirdlinger, in the death of Phyllis's husband, one of Huff's insurance clients.  Huff has persuaded Nirdlinger to take out an accidental death policy which pays double if his death occurs on a train, and Huff and Phyllis, who become lovers, agree to share the benefits.  Planning for every contingency down to the last detail, the two accomplish their goals, but the insurance company does not want to pay off, and Walter's bosses become convinced that the death was either a suicide or a murder.<br /><br />As the investigation becomes more intense, Walter and Phyllis become more and more frantic with worry, especially when Nirdlinger's twenty-year-old daughter and her boyfriend also start to investigate. Filled with twists and turns, the novel's conclusion comes as a complete surprise.<br /><br />This hard-boiled, noir story is entirely plot-based, with cardboard characters who are not believable even within their limited development here.  Walter Huff is a realist and sees through Phyllis from the moment he meets her, predicts all aspects of her behavior, and even mocks her in his first person narrative, yet the story depends on his falling in love with her.  He is an insurance agent dealing daily with the real world, and he appears to have no financial worries, yet he engages in murder because of his \\"love\\" for Phyllis.  His murder of Nirdlinger, planned for weeks and executed without remorse, suddenly inspires second thoughts--after the fact.  Phyllis proves to be staunch in the face of the murder, even though she said initially that she didn't even dislike her husband--and that it seemed wrong to murder him for money.<br /><br />The clipped dialogue and terse narrative, characteristics Cain shares with Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett, move the action along quickly, but today's reader cannot help but smile at how dated and overly dramatic the story is, its prose self-conscious and, at times, even cute.  Still, the story is very well plotted (with the possible exception of the conclusion), and Cain's attention to detail makes the mystery both clever and engaging.

Jeanette Winterson's magnificently descriptive, impressionistic novel tells two interconnected stories, each of them asking who we are as humans, how we connect to the past, and what makes our lives worth living.  Its modern story focuses on Silver, born in 1959, \\"part precious metal, part pirate.\\"  A young girl without a father, Silver is orphaned at ten and moves into the local lighthouse with Pew, the aged and blind lighthousekeeper, whose family has tended the light in northwest Scotland since 1828.  There, she polishes the brasswork, makes the tea, and listens to Pew's stories, some of them historical and some more fanciful, but all of them filled with wisdom and lessons from the past.<br /><br />The lighthouse, we learn through Pew's stories, was built by the father of Robert Louis Stevenson.  In 1878, R. L. Stevenson comes to the lighthouse for a visit and is fascinated by the story of Babel Dark, a local preacher, who becomes the inspiration for Mr. Hyde in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Dark, we learn through stories, falls in love with beautiful Molly in the early 1850s, then sees her embracing another man, becomes overcome with jealousy, and rejects her.  Taking the symbolic name of Lux (meaning \\"light\\") when he is with Molly, Dark is unable to control his emotions and becomes a Hyde-like abuser.  \\"He was dark...the light in him never lit.\\"<br /><br />As the stories of Silver (which reflects light) and Babel Dark develop in tandem, the novel takes on operatic qualities, with the two stories often sounding like duets, one voice light and one dark, singing in counterpoint to each other.  As each person seeks fulfillment through love and connection, the cadence of Winterson's writing rises and falls, swirls, and turns in upon itself, with the same themes of creation, connection, and the continuity of life echoing throughout.  Winterson's incorporation of the Tristan and Isolde story, along with the visit of Charles Darwin to the lighthouse, expands and further emphasizes the themes.<br /><br />Both romantic and philosophical, Winterson offers much unique imagery.  Pew, for example, is a \\"silent, taciturn clamp of a man.\\"  An Albanian family was \\"vacuum-packed into a ship,\\" the grandmother, \\"all sun-dried tomato, tough, chewy, skin split with the heat.\\"  Her narrative tempo is flawless, the language elegant, and the characterization consistent with the themes.  The end of the book harks back to the beginning, completing a circle and granting new insights into her meanings.  A rich novel which the reader will want to read slowly and savor.

A disturbed, young British woman, known only as Grey, arrives in Tokyo after a long hospitalization in a psychiatric unit.  She has been hoping for nine years to find a piece of film recording the Nanking Massacre in China by the Japanese in 1937, a massacre of 300,000 people, which the Japanese deny happened.  Needing a very specific bit of information that she believes is in the film, Grey contacts Shi Chongming, an elderly Chinese professor at a Japanese university, whom she believes has the missing film. She eventually agrees to try to unearth information he wants about a life-saving medicine used by an ailing Japanese gangster in exchange for information about the Nanking film.<br /><br />Grey is a fragile and interesting character, bearing both physical and emotional scars, and when she is accepted as a hostess at the \\"Some Like it Hot\\" nightclub, run by the unforgettable Strawberry Nakatani, who believes herself a Marilyn Monroe look-alike, she meets the ailing gangster, Junzo Fuyuki.  Other intriguing peripheral characters add to the drama:  Jason, an American with a pre-occupation with death and a sexual fetish for \\"weirdos\\" like Grey; a pair of Russian twins, who are also hostesses;  and Ogawa, the transvestite nurse of the gangster, who lurks in the background and acts as an enforcer.  The various settings, especially that of a falling-down house occupied by Grey, Jason, and the Russian twins, showcase the bizarre characters and their actions.<br /><br />The point of view alternates between Grey, as she tries to gain control of her life by finding this mysterious film, and that of Shi Chongming, who recounts in painful detail his memories of the Japanese invasion of  Nanking and the attempts that he and his wife Shujing make to to stay alive.  The author's ability to present both internal action and external terror is admirable, creating both tension and heart-stopping suspense, though she does resort to obvious foreshadowing to keep the reader going:  \\"I knew that the answer I wanted was very nearby,\\" for example, and \\"I was sure, without knowing why, that just behind those blinds....\\"<br /><br />The plot and characters are intriguing for the first two-thirds of the book.  Then, as the exact nature of Grey's quest on behalf of Shi Chongming becomes clearer, the plot veers into stomach-turning sadism and perversion.  Sensational deaths and ankle-deep gore increase as Grey's shocking \\"crime,\\" Fuyuki's pathology, and Shi Chongming's \\"sin\\" come together in dramatic fashion.  Not for the faint of heart, this pop novel is nightmare-inducing, filled with pathological behavior and grotesque deaths, minutely described. (3.5 stars).

Focusing on the coming of age of Arnold Hitler, Marc Estrin follows Arnold's life from elementary school in Mansfield, Texas, in the late 1950s (where John Howard Griffin, the author of Black Like Me, did his experiment in racism in 1960), through high school in the 1960s, Harvard University in the late 1960s, and the tumult of the post-Vietnam era in the 1970s. Here Estrin explores the nature of identity--how we find our true identities, how our identities are shaped by those around us, and how false perceptions of our identities are developed by others.<br /><br />In his early years, Arnold was the most popular, most successful student in his class, and when he became a football star in a town that lived for football, his reputation and adulation were secured.  It was not until he received a scholarship to Harvard, and exposure to a wider world, that he experienced, firsthand, the prejudice that black students, recently integrated into his Texas high school, had taken for granted.  Jewish students would not share a room with him, and East Coast WASPs rejected him.  His success in Mansfield did not carry over to Harvard, where his unfortunate name became more important than his identity.<br /><br />Estrin describes in often hilarious detail the day to day life of Arnold Hitler, always connecting him to the history of the period--the Tet offensive, the Harvard occupation of the administration building by the Students for a Democratic Society, the professors who gave seminars on how to avoid the draft, the Watergate scandal, and the My Lai massacre.  He meets fellow Harvard student Al Gore, MIT professor Noam Chomsky, and Leonard Bernstein, father of one of his girlfriends.  After graduation, he goes to New York, where his \\"education\\" in life's realities continues.<br /><br />Estrin's episodic novel could have been a great collection of interrelated short stories.  His keen observation of the world around him casts light on the period and on the inherent racism and prejudice against \\"otherness\\" which dominated, and he analyzes the period with a scalpel.  Arnold himself does not engender much empathy, however, and his crises do not feel very compelling since the simple expedient of changing his name would have avoided them.  His \\"epiphanies\\" feel artificial, and his exploration of religion and cultural history feels like a fiction writer's construct to give broader scope to the novel.  Readers unfamiliar with the period from the late sixties to late seventies may gain insight into a seminal period in American history; for those who lived through it, it may feel a bit stale.

A fast-paced and witty bedroom farce of the 1930s, Present Laughter was written by Coward as a vehicle in which he himself planned to star, and it may well reflect some of the less attractive aspects of his own life.  The play concerns a well-known, 40-ish actor, Gary Essendine, who is about to set off for a series of performances in Africa.  Essendine enjoys all the perks of stardom, including women who can't resist him, fawning fans, and late nights of partying, followed by late mornings of undisturbed sleeping.  Though he is married to Liz, they have been separated for a couple of years, and neither minds the other's dalliances, or the serial dalliances of their circle of friends.<br /><br />In the course of the play, several women \\"forget their latch keys\\" and have to spend the night at Essendine's apartment, where his secretary, valet, and housekeeper hide them to keep succeeding visitors from discovering them.  One of them, Joanna, is married to Essendine's friend Henry, but she has had a long-standing affair with another friend, Morris, and she seduces Essendine in the course of the play.  In the midst of all this deception, a young playwright also arrives, wanting to know if Essendine has read his play, at the same time confessing to having an obsession with Essendine himself, before he is shuttled off to the office when yet another unexpected visitor arrives.<br /><br />As is always the case with Coward, each scene sets the stage for the next scene, and the play unfolds with dramatic ease and considerable dramatic irony.  The characterizations are exaggerated for comic effect, and the dialogue is witty, with many tongue-in-cheek remarks, as the all-consuming game of \\"musical beds,\\" \\"heartfelt\\" confessions, and diabolical scheming takes place.  Fast pace is crucial to the action, demanding the split second appearances and disappearances of some characters as new characters enter and depart.<br /><br />Though the hijinx are distinctly sexual, the play maintains an elegance of language and an on-stage formality.  The clever repartee never descends to vulgarity, and the love scenes all take place off-stage.  Universal in its observations of human nature, this play is still being revived and finding audiences after more than half a century.  This play and Private Lives are Coward at his best.

This farcical look at marriage, first produced in 1930, starred the author, Noel Coward, and the legendary Gertrude Lawrence. The play's recent revivals in London and New York, however, attest to its incisive wit and its razor-sharp social observation, both of which transcend the 1930s setting and give continuing life and relevance to the play.<br /><br />Elyot Chase, five years divorced, has just married a young bride, Sybil, with whom he is on his honeymoon at a French seaside resort. His former wife, Amanda Prynne, has also just remarried, and, coincidentally, she and Victor, her new husband, are also honeymooning--in the room next door. Almost immediately, Elyot and Amanda rediscover each other on their adjoining balconies, find themselves drawn to each other, and abandon their new spouses at the resort to run away together to Paris.<br /><br />The major action of the play shows us the relationship of Elyot and Amanda in Paris as they try to sustain their rekindled love and avoid the pitfalls that destroyed their original marriage. Both are passionate, uninhibited, live-in-the-moment people, and both have married very traditional, predictable, and conformist new spouses. When Sybil and Victor eventually discover the lovers, who, by now, are fighting and even engaging in fisticuffs, Coward makes his point about the nature of relationships, their fragility and/or what makes them endure.<br /><br />Though the play is set in the 1930s, Coward so accurately captures human traits and behavior that the play is still delighting audiences today. In his opening scene, for example, he shows Sybil subjecting new husband Elyot to a mood-killing interrogation about his former wife. He then turns this scene on its head by showing Victor interrogating Amanda about her honeymoon with Elyot, showing the two new spouses to be identical to each other--and completely opposite to Elyot and Amanda. The scenes in Paris, in which Elyot and Amanda, their passion rekindled, try to keep their roiling anger under control are hilarious, and when they eventually resort to slapping and dish-throwing, the elegant verbal duels and clever repartee we have seen till now change the play into a more visually exciting and more farcical experience.<br /><br />The ending of the play is not really a resolution, but it does confirm Coward's theme that though opposites may attract in the short term, this kind of attraction may not be as powerful as the attraction between like characters, which, however, can change instantly when familiarity breeds contempt. Sardonic and sometimes a bit cynical, the play artfully captures the vicissitudes of a wild, passionate relationship and provides insights into its inner workings.

Now almost twenty-five years old, this mystery by P. D. James is a delightful entertainment, filled with plot twists and turns, over-the-top action, and characters who are so exaggerated that they might be considered caricatures.  Cordelia Gray, a detective whose job is usually the finding of lost pets, is hired to guard egomaniacal actress Clarissa Lisle during the days leading up to her performance in The Duchess of Malfi.  Always preoccupied with death, Clarissa has recently received threatening notes, leaving her hysterical on the eve of her performance.<br /><br />Both Cordelia Gray and Clarissa Lisle are staying at Sir Ambrose Gorringe's Victorian castle, perched high on a remote island where Gorringe has restored the theater at which Clarissa will perform.  A collector of morbid relics, including, most recently, the arm from a memorial statue of a dead child, Gorringe also delights in telling the island's history as a place where German POWs were interned.<br /><br />When, despite precautions, Clarissa Lisle is, in fact, murdered--with the marble arm from the dead child's statue--the reader is presented with a typical \\"closed room\\" murder, the killer obviously one of a dozen or so people staying at the castle, each with a possible motive for killing Clarissa--the need of money for a business, blackmail, long-standing hatred, blame for the death of a child, humiliation, rejection.  As the police (and Cordelia) investigate, the story of the island and the death of a German prisoner plays a role in the action.<br /><br />As always, James's eerie setting furthers the mystery and enhances the suspense.  The quirky and memorable characters are well drawn, but they often border on absurdity, and James's large cast and her use of stereotypes prevent significant character development.  The unfolding mystery and constant plot twists keep the reader guessing--just when the murderer has been \\"uncovered,\\" doubts arise about other characters and their possible involvement.  Additional deaths keep the tension high, and the ending, in keeping with the tone of the novel, shows the decadence of these \\"elite\\" characters.

Winner of the UK's Whitbread Prize for Best Novel, the Orange Prize, and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize, Small Island may soon find deserved success in the US, too.  Set in London in 1948, it focuses on the diaspora of Jamaicans, who, escaping economic hardship on their own \\"small island,\\" move to England, the Mother Country, for which the men have fought during World War II.  Their reception is not the warm embrace they have hoped for, nor are the opportunities for success as plentiful as they have dreamed.<br /><br />Four characters alternate points of view, telling their stories with an honesty and vibrancy that make the tragicomedy of their lives both realistic and emotionally involving.  Queenie Bligh, a white woman with a mentally ill father-in-law, takes in boarders when her husband Bernard does not return from war in India.  Most of her boarders are black immigrants from the Caribbean, desperate men and women willing to pay high prices for small rooms.  Gilbert Joseph, a Jamaican who participated in the Battle of Britain, is one of Queenie's tenants, working as a truck driver, the only job available to him.  Gilbert's bride Hortense arrives from Jamaica with her heavy trunk a few months later, ready to show London her superior \\"British\\" manners.  When Queenie's husband Bernard unexpectedly returns shortly thereafter, life at Queenie's changes forever.<br /><br />These four characters, through their often touching first-person narratives, convey their hopes and dreams for the future, revealing, as their stories intersect, their personalities, family backgrounds, experiences in love, commitments to the Mother Country, economic predicaments, and, not incidentally, their prejudices.<br /><br />Levy imbues this novel with fine detail, both in her descriptions of the physical surroundings and in the emotional subtleties with which her characters react to their postwar lives.  Her ear for dialogue is exquisite, both in the everyday speech of Londoners and in the dialect and sentence patterns of Jamaicans.  Casual, conversational tones bring the characters to life, while Gilbert's recognition of \\"the way things are\\" keeps the novel from becoming polemical or strident, despite its thematic emphasis on prejudice and injustice.  Levy's touch is light, often humorous, and her scenes of amusing irony are nicely balanced by scenes of high drama.<br /><br />The author's tendency to tie her male characters to real, historical events--the Hindu/Muslim riots in Calcutta (experienced by Bernard) and a race-based riot at a London movie theater (experienced by Gilbert)--and her reliance on extreme coincidence to conclude the action, do occasionally feel intrusive and manipulative, but this is a minor quibble.  This hugely conceived novel has everything going for it--well-drawn characters, vivid descriptions of an unusual time in postwar London, important themes which are not beaten to death, and lively action and interactions which keep the reader constantly involved.

In a weak moment, sardonic journalist Lydia, recovering from a faithless lover, invites an emotionally needy acquaintance, to accompany her to a primitive cottage in rural Wales. Never particularly fond of Betty, \\"the human equivalent of sackcloth and ashes,\\" Lydia finds herself alternating between resentment of Betty's good sense and optimistic outlook, and toleration of her desire to be helpful and, not incidentally, do the cooking. The two women have decidedly different temperaments, with Lydia often cynical, worldly, and full of snide comments, while Betty is honest, direct, and patient. Their conversations, often hilariously ironic dialogues, show two people who have nothing in common, stuck with each other for a vacation and toughing it out.<br /><br />Hywel, a dour farmer; Elizabeth, his fearful wife (with a secret lover); Beuno, Hywel's brother, who is studying to be a priest; and randy Doctor Wyn provide Lydia and Betty with their only real social life--a dull dinner party given by Elizabeth, visits by Beuno (whom Lydia regards as \\"one of her own kind\\") to discuss philosophy, trips to the Fair and to a concert, walks in the countryside, and eventually a grand finale of a picnic, all of which offer a marked contrast to Lydia's lively, intellectual life in the city.<br /><br />In brief dramatic interludes, interjected throughout the narrative, Hywel's sister Angharad, a deformed and mute \\"free spirit\\" (or demon) who roams the countryside, comments poetically on what she observes of these people and their behavior when she looks through windows and eavesdrops on conversations in the woods. Drawn to nature instinctively, she notes the contrasts between human nature and the life she sees in the woods and countryside. \\"If the land was a graven image, then Angharad was its priestess.\\"<br /><br />Mysterious, \\"unexplained laughter,\\" heard only by Lydia, adds mystical overtones to the novel, though the laughter is usually associated with observations made by Angharad. Gradually, Lydia begins to learn more about man and nature, love and betrayal, and good and evil, especially the nature of Satan, whom she calls by the much less threatening name of \\"Stan.\\" Dry, ironic humor contrasts with genuine sadness, and cynicism with sensitivity here, as Lydia's farcical intrusions into the country life lead her to new understandings and a greater appreciation of the real world.

When the Germans finally retreated from Belarus in the summer of 1944, almost twelve hundred Jewish survivors of the Holocaust shocked the world by materializing from the forest where they had lived in hiding during the German occupation. Tuvia, Asael, and Zus Bielski, three brothers, had managed to establish a well-organized community in the forest which lasted for almost three years, protecting hundreds of Jewish citizens while wreaking havoc on their German occupiers. Author Peter Duffy places this extraordinary story of survival in context by describing the Bielskis' lives and achievements, quoting from Tuvia Bielski's previously unknown journal, and revealing the sociopolitical history, including the anti-Semitism, of Belarus, a region south of Lithuania.<br /><br />In establishing their forest community, open to all Jews, the Bielskis had to fight \\"wars\\" on four fronts: the immediate threat from the Germans and the local police; the danger from local peasants and collaborators; the suspicions of Soviet partisans who questioned whether the Bielskis were sufficiently dedicated to their cause; and most of all, internal dissension. This was no \\"utopian community of enlightened democratic and egalitarian governance,\\" and many readers may cringe at the extremes to which the leadership occasionally resorted in order to eliminate dissension.<br /><br />At its height, the forest village consisted of long, camouflaged dugouts for sleeping, a large kitchen, mill, bakery, bathhouse, tannery, school, jail, theater, and two medical facilities. Tailors, seamstresses, shoemakers, watchmakers, carpenters, mechanics, and experts in demolition provided the 1200-member community with necessary skills, and about sixty cows and thirty horses provided food and transportation. Many of the men served as part of the armed contingent which secured food and engaged in sabotage and the murder of German officials.<br /><br />By concentrating on one family and its life during the war, Duffy creates a powerful documentary about Jewish life. Breaking the narrative into six-month installments, he details the progress of the war throughout the region, relentlessly revealing cold statistics--the thousands of people killed in a single ghetto in a single day. As the numbers mount, the reader's horror at the immense scale of the genocide grows, the victims' utter helplessness becomes obvious, and the reader's amazement at the Bielskis' achievement in creating their village increases.

Strikingly different in tone from all the other Peter McGarr mysteries, this novel may have been a Gill experiment in the blackest of black humor. It's a curiosity in the McGarr series, a wicked piece of work with some truly disgusting scenes, perhaps an attempt to mock the pseudo-realism of other mysteries and/or film, or, more likely, an attempt to imitate the dark satire of Jonathan Swift, whose work is featured throughout this novel about the murder of a man who regarded himself as the Dean's reincarnation.<br /><br />In the opening scene McGarr arrives at the estate of B.H.P. Herrick, the keeper of Marsh's Library of antique manuscripts in Dublin, finding find him nude and six days dead. With a sort of ghoulish glee, Gill describes the macabre scene in minute detail, omitting none of the putrescent details. Herrick was in the midst of a Frollick, \\"inspired by Swift,\\" a lurid carnal escapade in which Herrick quoted lines from Swift and which he videotaped, unwittingly recording his own agonizing death from poison.<br /><br />I concede that the book is clever, in that it incorporates some serious literary criticism about Swift's work, some of it obscure, in addition to discussions of Gulliver, the Brobdingnagians, the Yahoos, and the Houyhnhnms, and it does illustrate how the main character surrounded himself with the modern incarnations of these Swiftian creatures. However, Gill's additional remarks about \\"excremental verse\\" and the Freudians, along with additional scenes of degradation, keep this grim and grisly little novel firmly mired in depths most readers do not expect of this series and will not want to explore. 1 star for subject matter, 2 stars for cleverness.

Written originally as the outline for the screenplay of the famous 1949 film of the same name, Greene sets the story in Vienna just after World War II, employing the sectors established by the conquering British, Americans, French, and Russians to provide tension, mystery, and an almost palpable aura of menace as residents and visitors alike must deal with four different governments, four sets of officials, and four collections of laws as they move throughout the city.  With massive bomb damage, the city is still emerging from devastation.  Black markets, selling everything from food to penicillin, abound.<br /><br />Rollo Martins, the author of cowboy novels written under the name of Buck Dexter, arrives in Vienna to visit an old school friend, Harry Lime, only to find that he has arrived on the day of Lime's funeral.  Investigating Lime's death, Martins learns that a neighbor saw the traffic accident that killed Lime and observed three men carrying Lime's body from the scene.  Only two of those men have been identified--the third man has vanished.<br /><br />As Martins investigates, he must deal with the city's several different governments, each of which has carved out a sector.  The initial co-operation among sectors has vanished, and co-operation with the Russian sector is almost non-existent.  Wanted men use the city's sewers to escape from one sector to another, where they cannot be followed.  The investigation of Lime's death becomes more complex when an inebriated Martins is sure that he has seen Harry Lime on the street.<br /><br />By turns exciting and darkly humorous, the novel is a curiosity among Greene's entertainments, since this story was never written to be a novel at all.  Intensely visual in its descriptions and action, it lacks the characterization and thematic focus which one associates with most of Greene's work.  The novel's dialogue, rather than narrative, conveys the story, as it does in the film, and the setting in a war-torn city adds to the sense of danger and drama.  Certainly not one of Greene's \\"finished\\" novels, it is still fun to read, especially when one is familiar with the even better film of it, directed by Carol Reed and starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton, and Trevor Howard.  Of particular interest to those studying writing and film-making, Greene's novella is full of wit and dark theatrics, and includes everything from a chase through the sewers to a love story.

As a general cookbook, this one is hard to beat.  Geared to the needs of a wide spectrum of users, the book has a huge variety of well-seasoned recipes reflecting many different kinds of ethnic cookery.  Each recipe carries a stated range of difficulty from complex to simple, a complete guide to preparation, and an introductory note describing interesting facts about the recipe or its ingredients, the amount of preparation time, and the amount of cooking time.<br /><br />Divided into the usual sections--such as Grains and Beans, Desserts, Chicken and Turkey--this cookbook has an unusual feature that will delight the busiest cook.  At the front of each section is a complete list of the recipes in that section, with individual recipes classified as Easy, 30 Minutes, 60 Minutes, Microwave, Make Ahead, Low Fat, One Pot, and Classic.  If a recipe falls into more than one category, it is listed more than once, so that someone looking for Coq au Vin, listed here as Chicken in Red Wine, a classic recipe, will find it under Classics, but also in the Easy, Lowfat, and One Pot categories.<br /><br />Long boxes on each page, adjacent to the binding, offer helpful tips for cooking, recipe variations, microwave adaptations, and useful trivia (the number of shrimp per pound, depending on size, how to carve a roast, how to get perfectly rounded muffins, for example).  Several longer inserts, almost a page long, appear in green boxes and offer the \\"how-to's\\" of basic cooking--everything from grilling vegetables to making perfect pie crusts.<br /><br />The most helpful feature for those who are health-conscious or on special diets is that every recipe provides the counts of calories, carbs, protein grams, fat grams, cholesterol, and sodium, taking the guesswork completely out of planning healthy, nutritious, good-tasting meals.  Sections at the end of the book provide menus for a year, special recipes for entertaining and celebrations, and information on herbs, cheeses, and wines.<br /><br />I initially selected this cookbook to give at a bridal shower, but when I had a chance to get it home and really look at it carefully, I bought a copy for myself.  I had used and enjoyed the Joy of Cooking and the Fanny Farmer Cooking School Cookbook for years, but I have now found that this newer cookbook offers so many more features that I use it nearly all the time, in preference to my old standbys.

The rest of the collection continues this standard of color, taste, and texture, with a picnic salad of Curried Chicken and Wild Rice with apples, raisins, dried cranberries, and sunflower seeds;  a special occasion salad of Grilled Duck Breast on mesclun greens with blueberries and currant vinaigrette;  a glorious Ratatouille Torte on Baby Spinach; and a Fiery Thai Beef Tenderloin Salad with tomatoes, mint, lemon grass, cilantro, and lime.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Overton remembers that the reader is not a professional chef, and he includes helpful notes regarding the cooking of any meats, poultry, and fish for use on the salads, along with alternatives for flavorings, suggestions for variations or additions, and explanations of procedures.  All the main ingredients and most of the fresh herbs can be found in a well-stocked supermarket, and suggestions for appropriate garnishes are given for each recipe.  Though all the recipes are not illustrated, the dozen photographs that are included are inspiring.

In his longest novel, written in 1970, Nobel Prize-winning author White examines the question of an artist's creativity, where it comes from, whether it can be controlled, and what obligations, if any, accompany it. As he traces the life of Hurtle Duffield from the age of four until his death as an elderly (and successful) avant-garde artist, we see Duffield always as somehow different from his peers.<br /><br />The son of a laundress and a bottle collector, Hurtle is from birth inspired, painting large images on walls as a toddler, but he recognizes at an early age that \\"people look down at their plates if you said something was 'beautiful.'\\" To provide him with opportunities which will allow his genius to flourish, his parents sell him, when he is four years old, to the wealthy family for which his mother works.<br /><br />As a member of the Courtney family, Hurtle travels and becomes educated, though he continues to see rather than think. For him, the usual emotional traumas of adolescence are accompanied by unique questions of his identity, both because of his two families and also because of his view of the world. Not religious, he sees God as the Great Vivisector, and men treating each other as animals, slaughtering each other in war.<br /><br />When he himself goes off to war and returns to find that the family has gone in separate directions, he devotes himself, once again, to his art, using women who love him as vehicles for his own self-expression and behaving as a vivisector himself. About his painting of one model, White says \\"[Hurtle] disemboweled her while she was still alive.\\" As time passes, Hurtle continues to search for love, inspiration, self-expression, and some sort of balance in his life between his immense need to paint, his desire for personal connection, and his simultaneous need to be alone.<br /><br />White's prose style is direct and concise, elegantly simple, and easy to understand. He uses colloquial speech-words like \\"smoodge,\\" \\"sook,\\" \\"slommacky,\\" and \\"mumped,\\" which must be understood from context-and reveals character and action through dialogue. The novel is old-fashioned, using a straight chronological narrative with no complex flashbacks, and it is quite romantic in its plot elements, despite its serious theme development. The biggest problem for the reader is that the main character is not very likable, nor does he inspire a great deal of empathy--a difficult character to live with for approximately six hundred pages--and I'm not sure how typical he is of the artists he is supposed to represent.

In the middle of the night, Henry Perowne, a 48-year-old neurosurgeon, awakens for no apparent reason and sees what he thinks, at first, is a meteor, but the object brightens, moves faster, and blazes through the skies at low altitude--a plane on fire, approaching Heathrow.  In intensely realized descriptions, Henry thinks about this dramatic event and reacts and shares the most intimate aspects of his existence, drawing the reader into his life.  Every action, thought, and question about life, fate, and destiny is articulated as Henry struggles to make sense of this one day in his life and see it in a philosophical context.<br /><br />Happily married to Rosalind, a lawyer for a newspaper, Henry has two remarkably creative children--one a blues musician and the other a poet.  Through their lives, he recognizes that his own preoccupation with science and reality has left him incomplete.  He has come to believe that \\"there [is] more to life than merely saving lives,\\" and he yearns to find a complete, \\"coherent world, everything fitting at last.\\"<br /><br />As the day progresses, Henry fixates on the plane accident, possible terrorism, the imminent war with Iraq, and a traffic accident resulting in an altercation with a thug.  But throughout this \\"action,\\" Henry is contemplating his relationships with the world at large, trying to understand his place within it.  Having rejected organized religion, he finds some comfort in the conclusions of Darwin, who connects all life in a continuum in which he sees himself a part.<br /><br />As he thinks of his own parents and children, he also observes contrasts in the world around him, people whose lives are different, not because of any inherent difference but simply because of chance--\\"the currents that alter fates.\\"  When the Perowne home is invaded during a family gathering at the end of the day, Henry faces a decisive moment in the battle between his emotions and his intellect.  The climax is loaded with menace and executed with high drama, but the events themselves are less significant than Henry's reactions to them.<br /><br />Intensely introspective and beautifully integrated, this is McEwan's most thoughtful--and least plot-based--novel to date, with every detail adding to the complex characterizations and themes--a wonderful meditation on individuals and culture, connection and disconnection, and the arbitrariness of fate.

Setting this novel during the glory days of Big Studio Hollywood, in which he himself was an earnest young screenwriter, Ray Bradbury sets out to create a murder mystery in which a twenty years-dead body is found on a ladder leaning against a wall between a graveyard and the movie studio next door. Over-the-top Hollywood characters and wannabes, \\"beasts\\" and monsters, and faux settings, such as Notre Dame, Calvary, and even the speaker's grandparents' house in Green Town, Illinois, fill this book with the illusions in which the film industry excels, while the machinations of ego-driven moguls provide motivations for murder.<br /><br />No one should read this novel expecting a hard-boiled mystery, however. Bradbury's obvious love of people and of life itself is so heartfelt and overwhelming that it makes any sense of toughness unbelievable--but there are many other reasons to enjoy this book. Grounded by Midwestern values, fundamentally decent, and lacking the ego which seems to drive the rest of the industry, Bradbury shines in describing a mad Hollywood, \\"where great elephant ideas go to die. A graveyard for lunatics,\\" where men so dedicate their lives to the creation of illusions that they often lose sight of reality.<br /><br />His wacky imagination flourishes, and it is clear that despite his sometimes flippant, tongue-in-cheek observations, his irony, and his criticism of Hollywood excess, that he loves the place and the exotic characters he meets there. With imagery and descriptions that bring to life every aspect of studio activity, trenchant philosophical observations inserted casually (almost as throwaways), self-deprecating humor, and visions of plain folks challenging the studio bigwigs, Bradbury's mystery ambles toward an almost amiable conclusion.<br /><br />For the lover of Bradbury, this is another chance to share his visions and his enthusiasm for a life lived honestly. Most readers will undoubtedly share the feelings of Constance, who tells speaker/Bradbury, \\"How lucky to be inside your skin...Don't ever change. We stupid doomsayers, cynics, monsters laugh, but we need you. Otherwise, Merlin dies, or a carpenter fixing the Round Table saws it crooked, or the guy who oils the armor substitutes cat pee.

Resembling both McEwan's Atonement and Frayn's Spies in its plot, this 1953 novel, recently reprinted, tells of a pre-adolescent's naive meddling in the love lives of elders, with disastrous results. Set in the summer of 1900, when the hopes and dreams for the century were as yet untarnished by two world wars and subsequent horrors, this novel is quietly elegant in style, its emotional upheavals restrained, and its 12-year-old main character, Leo Colston, so earnest, hopeful, and curious about life that the reader cannot help but be moved by his innocence.<br /><br />Leo's summer visit to a friend at Brandham Hall introduces him to the landed gentry, the privileges they have assumed, and the strict social behaviors which guide their everyday lives. Bored and wanting to be helpful when his friend falls ill, Leo agrees to be a messenger carrying letters between Marian, his host's sister, and Ted Burgess, her secret love, a farmer living nearby. Catastrophe is inevitable--and devastating to Leo. In descriptive and nuanced prose, Hartley evokes the heat of summer and the emotional conflicts it heightens, the intensity rising along with the temperature. Magic spells, creatures of the zodiac, and mythology create an overlay of (chaste) paganism for Leo's perceptions, while widening the scope of Hartley's focus and providing innumerable parallels and symbols for the reader.<br /><br />The emotional impact of the climax is tremendous, heightened by the author's use of three perspectives--Leo Colston as a man in his 60's, permanently damaged by events when he was 12; Leo as a 12-year-old, wrestling with new issues of class, social obligation, friendship, morality, and love, while inadvertently causing a disaster; and the reader himself, for whom hindsight and knowledge of history create powerful ironies as he views these events and the way of life they represent. Some readers have commented on Leo's unrealistic innocence in matters of sex, even as a 12-year-old, but this may be a function of age.

In his fifth novel about the #1 Ladies Detective Agency, run by Mma Precious Ramotswe, author Alexander McCall Smith presents the full cupboard of Botswana life in all its richness. For Mma Ramotswe, people and their relationships are paramount, and she believes that these relationships are facilitated by Botswana's traditional code of behavior, with its customs of greetings, sitting down together, drinking bush tea, and casually talking around a subject, rather than addressing it aggressively.<br /><br />Life is a rich, full, and happy experience for Mma Ramotswe, who can find out everything she wants to know from her broad network of family and friends. Engaged to the good-hearted Mr. J.L.B. Matakone, who has not yet set a date for a wedding, she helps him surreptitiously with his problems and cooks and cares for the two orphans he has taken into his home.<br /><br />In this novel, full of gentle humor and wisdom, Mma Ramotswe and her friends face several \\"difficult\\" problems: A woman who has made a fortune establishing hair-braiding salons hires Mma Ramotswe to find out whether her suitors want to marry her for her money. Mr. J.L.B. Matakone finds himself tricked into \\"volunteering\\" to do a parachute jump.  He is also disturbed to discover that First Class Motors, a rival garage, has sold improper parts and failed to service a classic old Range Rover correctly, and he has been procrastinating about reporting him to authorities.<br /><br />With an obvious lack of exciting plot lines, the reader focuses completely on the characters-- beautifully drawn, sometimes flawed, and always forgiven their faults. In a pace as leisurely as life in Botswana, McCall Smith recreates the colorful everyday lives of these ordinary people, who treasure friendships, treat each other with respect, and possess inherent good sense. Honoring the values that contemporary readers sometimes do not take the time to preserve, McCall Smith portrays complex social relationships in very simple and direct prose.

This plaintive phone message from a Indian father to his son in another part of New York reflects the problems of communication illustrated in this 1968 play. The Indian is stuck at a New York bus stop at night, trying to reach his son's house in the Bronx, which is on a different line. He does not know where he is and has no idea how to get where he wants to go. The Indian doesn't speak English (though his lines are in English in the playbook so that actors can respond to them appropriately). Two toughs (one played in the original production by Al Pacino, who won an Obie for his role) saunter up to him and hassle him, mocking his inability to speak English, his turban, his constant politeness no matter how rude they are, and his predicament of being lost in \\"their\\" territory.<br /><br />In the course of the play, Murph and Joey reveal all their ignorance and prejudices, their hostility, and their feelings of being left out of the mainstream, for which they want to take action. They are mean and aware that in the situation at the bus stop they have all the power. When the hassling becomes more serious, Joey earns his neighborhood stripes, attacking the Indian, who simply wants to get home to his son.<br /><br />Presented with little scenery, except for a bus stop sign, a telephone booth, and some trash cans, this is a bare-bones play for three characters, depending largely on the actors to convey a sense of menace, rather than on the dialogue. Capturing the political and social unrest in the cities in the 1960s, it simply portrays issues, rather than investigating them or offering any commentary on them, and much of the dialogue and the attitudes are now dated. The Indian is a character for whom the reader/viewer evolves sympathy, but since he speaks no English during the play, the audience must understand him through his body language and sense of ingenuousness. A play which reflects the period in which it was written, it offers less of enduring value for the present day. Mary Whipplepresent day. Mary Whipple <br />	2005-03-18

A sad cynicism lies at the root of Greene's dark humor in this very early (1932) novel, Greene's fourth book and the first entertainment to be written and published for a wide audience. A Jewish businessman, a lesbian journalist, her rebellious young companion, a dancer in need of a job, a Socialist physician wanted in Serbia for treason, and an Austrian thief meet and interact aboard the Orient Express on a trip from London to Istanbul (Stamboul).<br /><br />Each person in this motley group hopes that some remarkable change will occur to him or her as a result of the trip, but though all eventually get their wish, fate has something devious up its sleeve for each one. These twists and turns, sometimes humorous and sometimes immensely sad, constitute the heart of the novel.<br /><br />Unlike Greene's later novels, with their fully developed characters and religious themes, this novel's characters are often stereotypes, and the action is often designed simply to bring the characters down, showing that no matter what dreams or goals they may have, that ultimately they have no control over their destinies. Greene's later, much more intensely realized themes--sin and atonement, innocence and guilt, love of life and fear of death, piety and corruption, sex and religion--are missing here.<br /><br />As the action unfolds and the characters are manipulated, the reader easily recognizes the \\"bones\\" of the themes which will later evolve in Greene's mature philosophical novels. As a series of tours de force, and as a glimpse into the creative process of a writer who, at this point, was just beginning to come into his own, this is an intriguing novel, loaded with insights, a fascinating and enjoyable read.

New Orleans, 1863:  the Civil War is raging, controversial Union General Benjamin Butler has just turned over his post to his successor, blacks are disappearing from their neighborhoods, horrific murders are occurring, voodoo ceremonies are taking place in the countryside, and terror is everywhere.  Some white \\"philanthropists\\" have established a program for sending blacks back to a welcoming Africa, but many former slaves wish to stay in New Orleans.  Both blacks and whites are terrified at what the future may hold.<br /><br />Into this milieu comes Abel Jones, a major in the Union army who came to the US from Wales, by way of India, and whose rigorous moral code has brought him to the attention of President Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln has asked him to investigate the death of Susan Peabody, the abolitionist daughter of a wealthy northerner.  Abel believes that she has been murdered, though no one knows a specific motive.  Jones, the often dour hero of five previous Parry mysteries, is a fascinating character, and in this novel he continues to grow, showing far more emotion than he has in the past and far more flexibility in his interpretation of his religious duties as a devout Methodist.<br /><br />Author Parry's considerable research into the New Orleans setting of 1863 is smoothly incorporated as he makes the city come alive in all the tumult of its mid-Civil War upheavals.  His greatest skill, however, is in creating a fast pace in which one sensational event succeeds another at a never-slackening speed.  Much of the mystery is connected to the Creoles' voodoo beliefs and voodoo ceremonies, which Parry describes in gruesome and gory detail, while Abel tries to connect events to missing Negroes and Susan Peabody's death.  During his investigations, Abel runs afoul of some of the army officers who are supposed to be maintaining public order, and when he uncovers the theft of a huge sum of money entrusted to the army, his life is endangered.<br /><br />Filling the novel with details and events guaranteed to excite the reader, including macabre deaths and torture not for the faint of heart, he appeals to the reader's emotions, sometimes creating scenes that are over-the-top in their sensationalism.  \\"More is more\\" here, and subtlety is not an objective, once the action gets going.

Like the famous Eleanor Rigby, Liz Dunn, an overweight and reclusive thirty-six-year-old woman, is lonely, living in an apartment which is not a home.  While she is recuperating from oral surgery, Liz receives a surprising phone call from the police, summoning her to the hospital.  A twenty-year-old man named Jeremy Buck has been picked up wearing mesh stockings and black lingerie and suffering from a drug overdose, and Liz's name is on his Medic Alert bracelet. When she meets him for the first time, he greets her as \\"Mom.\\"<br /><br />The novel shifts back and forth between 1997, when Liz first meets Jeremy Buck, and her earlier childhood and teen years, and then fast-forwards to 2004.  It gives nothing away to say that Jeremy was obviously conceived on Liz's high school trip to Europe when she was sixteen, but she has no recollection of Jeremy's father and no awareness, for many months, that she could even be pregnant.  After giving birth during a bout of \\"indigestion,\\" Liz gives the baby up for adoption, until he finds her twenty years later.<br /><br />Through this framework, \\"Generation X\\" author Douglas Coupland examines the nature of family life and the search for meaning.  We know from the outset that Jeremy has multiple sclerosis, but he does not look to religion to provide solace or answers.  Instead, he has visions, usually about farm families awaiting the end of the world, visions which bear striking resemblances to some of the issues Liz faces.  As Jeremy's MS progresses, his desire to find meaning grows.  \\"Death without the possibility of changing the world was the same as a life that never was,\\" he believes, and he intends to live it as well as he can--with Liz.<br /><br />Witty and often mordantly funny, the novel develops an edge of satire at the same time that it strives to be emotionally stirring.  When Liz goes to Europe to help with a police investigation, seven years after she meets Jeremy, a comedy of errors ensues, taking the novel further into the realm of absurdity and farce.  Although the novel often discusses issues of death and other Gen X concerns, the author uses a consistently light touch, keeping the tone upbeat and avoiding the details of Jeremy's final decline.  The novel is not complex, nor is it subtle, with the parallels between Jeremy's visions and Liz's life fully explained by the author.  Sparkling dialogue and a conclusion which carries the themes to their absurd conclusions keep the reader going, and the novel ultimately answers the big questions in the song for which it is named.

Gary Kinder tells three spell-binding narratives as he describes the search for the SS Central America, a sidewheel steamer which left Panama in 1857 and went down in the Atlantic while carrying gold from California (then valued at over $2 million). First person accounts by some of the survivors tell of the ship's journey, the hurricane which suddenly arose in the Atlantic, and the frantic efforts of crew and passengers to keep the engines fired and the ship afloat. Touching love stories revealed in these accounts give human faces to the drama, as women and children were put into lifeboats while their husbands stayed with the ship.<br /><br />These survivor accounts alternate with the narrative of the life of young Tommy Thompson, a phenomenally inventive child who grew up in Ohio, studied engineering, became fascinated by the challenges of underwater engineering, and eventually worked for famed treasure hunter Mel Fisher, learning what kind of underwater equipment was needed but not available. In the early 1980s, Thompson, more interested in research than in treasure, decided to search for the SS Central America, with the backing of a group he convinced to underwrite his expedition. As the ship was thought to be in eight thousand feet of water, deeper than had ever been explored, Thompson would succeed only if he could design the necessary equipment.<br /><br />The third story describes the search for the ship itself, a search which had two false starts before the site was finally located. Kinder develops almost unbearable tension as he describes how Thompson has to fend off rivals who are \\"treasure hunters,\\" rather than scientists. Thompson's experimentation with equipment, the comprehensive documentation of the site through photographs and film, the legal battles for the rights to the salvage, and the final recovery of \\"treasure\\" ranging from gold bars and coins to beautifully preserved suitcases of clothing are vividly portrayed.<br /><br />A book with appeal to historians, engineers, marine scientists, adventurers, and all who pursue dreams, Kinder brings the entire recovery process to life, honoring the efforts and heroism of the Central America's Captain Herndon, the indomitable spirit of Thompson as he developed unique robots and equipment to explore the ocean at depths of over a mile, and the scientific commitment, rather than treasure-hunting, which inspired Thompson, his crew, and his backers, the Columbus-America Discovery Group. Gripping, and filled with the wonder of discovery, this is non-fiction at its most exciting best.

Using the old, and politically incorrect, story of Little Black Sambo as her controlling metaphor and the inspiration for her title, Gilman provides a look at the hidden racism within the white community, specifically a college community in rural Vermont. Students, deans, and faculty all examine their attitudes and behavior when Simon Brick, one of the few African-American students on campus, finds a hate note tacked to the door of his room. Dean of Students Sarah Daniels, in whose office the action takes place, is quick to respond with outrage, as is the politically correct faculty and administration.<br /><br />Though all have good intentions, everyone has an agenda, and the on-campus dialogue they hope to establish becomes increasingly emotional. As in Little Black Sambo, the \\"tigers\\" soon begin to chase each other furiously around the tree, until they spin  themselves into a pool of butter.  The characters are painted with a broad brush, and for each one we know only what will further the message or provide humor to leaven the didacticism. Sarah Daniels's on-campus affair provides plenty of opportunities to hold male characters up to humorous examination for their sexual biases. The administration wants to keep the racial incident out of the press. The Dean of Humanities proposes innumerable campus meetings where students and faculty will publicly examine and confess their attitudes and biases.<br /><br />A student founds Students for Tolerance because it because it will look good on his law school application, stating, \\"Where I'm from, I do not think people are racists.\\" Conflicts within the administration rise to the surface, and Sarah's good intentions of securing a large scholarship for a minority student, if he will declare himself \\"Hispanic\\" or \\"Puerto Rican,\\" rather than \\"nuyorican,\\" backfires.<br /><br />Though this play was written in 2000, it feels more like something from the 1970s. During the past thirty years, college campuses have dealt with so many demonstrations about race and bias that administrators are, by now, universally sensitive to these issues. As a result, this \\"message play\\" feels dated, treating familiar issues of racism as if they were new, but offering few new insights into them. Because the characters here are shallow, there is little sense of audience identification to give universality to the conflict or a sense of catharsis to the \\"surprise ending.\\" The important, and still relevant, subject of bias is hidden within a play which seems unsure of whether it is serious, absurd, or both.

This final novel in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy of the southwest brings together the themes McCarthy has developed throughout the trilogy.  In the first novel, All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy stresses the romanticism of John Grady Cole, who runs away to become a cowboy, suffers a heart-breaking loss at love, and returns, sadder and perhaps wiser, to find solace in the solitude of his work on the plains.<br /><br />Times are changing as the 20th century progresses, and the independent life of ranchers is threatened.  In The Crossing, a far darker novel, Billy Parham, another young man, takes off with his brother, crossing the border into Mexico, to explore its older traditions and ways of life.  Cities of the Plain, with Biblical suggestions in the title, brings young John Grady Cole and the older Billy Parham together, as they work on the McGovern ranch in Texas in the 1950s.  The wilderness is disappearing, cities are encroaching, and an army base may take their land.<br /><br />Focusing less on the harshness of ranch life than in past novels, McCarthy here concentrates more on character, in this case, that of John Grady Cole, who falls in love with a prostitute from Juarez and wants to bring her across the border to his way of life.  Billy Parham counsels him against marrying her, but John Grady is determined to wrest her away from Eduardo, her manager, and give her the peace that she has never known.  Life is harsh, however, and outcomes are bleak for dreamers and altruists.  John Grady soon finds himself engaged in a struggle with Eduardo which is vicious and unrelenting, a metaphorical struggle between honor and evil, and between civilized values and the \\"justice\\" of tooth and claw, hope and desperation, and acceptance of change and adherence to the past.<br /><br />McCarthy's gorgeous descriptions of this vanishing way of life on the ranch are as effective here as they are in the other novels in the trilogy, though they seem to be presented nostalgically.  Times are changing, and the \\"old man,\\" the ranch owner, is now becoming senile.  Civilization is drawing closer, and John Grady, the cowboy, uses taxis instead of horses when he is in a hurry to travel.  As McCarthy draws the reader into John Grady's story, the reader knows that the struggle between him and Eduardo is a mythic struggle, and s/he also knows what the likely outcome will be.  The elegance with which the ending is drawn, however, gives both potency and poignancy to McCarthy's message.  Mary Whippleand the \\"old man,\\" the ranch owner, is now becoming senile.

The Wainewright of this \\"novel,\\" is a notorious and very real man of the nineteenth century--a writer, painter, swindler, companion of famous Romantic authors, probable murderer, and criminal transported to Tasmania.  As the subject of a novel, he would seem to be endlessly fascinating.  The author, Andrew Motion, a Poet Laureate of England and a professor of creative writing, has all the credentials to make Wainewright's story as \\"brilliant,\\" \\"memorable,\\" \\"engaging,\\" and \\"convincing\\" as it is described in the publicity.  Unfortunately, Wainewright's fictional \\"confession\\" is presented so formally and in such scholarly fashion that it feels more like a dissertation than fiction.  Ultimately, it fails to engage the reader because Wainewright never feels like a living, breathing person, someone who, under different circumstances, might live again today.<br /><br />The voice of Wainewright, who is thought to be a murderer, is done extremely well in the formal language of the period, but the language and lack of insight into his thinking keeps him at an unbridgeable distance. Wainewright himself never admits his crimes--in fact, does not even recognize them as crimes--and seems to be solely concerned with his own ends, not characteristics allowing for much reader identification.<br /><br />Most unfortunately, footnotes so heavily burden the narrative they constitute almost as many pages as the novel itself, and they bring any flow the author does create to a juddering stop. Appearing at the end of every chapter, rather than at the end of the book, they act as deadweights throughout.<br /><br />Andrew Motion is a respected biographer who has chosen to write this \\"novel\\" because it is the only way he can fill in the gaps in the real Wainewright's shadowy history, but he is too much the conscientious scholar to be able to exploit the privileges which fiction allows him.

Axel Vander tells us from the opening of this sensitive and tension-filled study of identity that he is not who he says he is. A respected scholar and professor at a California college, Vander is recognized for his thoughtful philosophical papers and books, especially on the nature of identity.  Just before he leaves for a conference on Nietzsche in Turin, however, he receives a letter from a young woman in Antwerp, questioning his own identity and asking to meet with him. As the novel unfolds, we come to know more about the \\"real\\" Axel Vander and more about his mysterious correspondent, the emotionally disturbed Cass Cleave.<br /><br />Like Banville's narrators in other novels, the elderly Axel Vander of Shroud is unreliable and often dishonest, self-concerned but not self-aware. Consummately venal, he blithely takes advantage of whatever circumstances arise. Cass Cleave, the daughter of Alexander Cleave, the narrator of Banville's previous novel, Eclipse, has visions and seizures, and Vander regards her as mad, but she and Vander develop a relationship of almost religious significance. He is depraved and amoral, and she is a sick, avenging angel.<br /><br />In Turin, where she joins Axel, Cass sees religious symbolism in common events, finding an ordinary breakfast a form of communion. Artworks, especially crucifixion scenes by artists from the various settings in which the novel takes place (Cranach, Bosch, Memling, and Van Eyck in the Low Countries; and Tintoretto, Mantegna, and Bellini in Italy) further develop the symbolism. Always present in the background, of course, is the Shroud of Turin, which may be the real burial cloth of Jesus--or may not be. Parallels and contrasts between Vander and Jesus abound.<br /><br />Banville's novel is intense, highly compressed in its development of overlapping themes, and filled with suspense, both real and intellectual. Every plot detail expands his themes of identity and selfhood, and our desire to be remembered after our deaths. Banville's prose is exquisite, creating mystery by introducing details at a snail's pace, conveying attitude, and acutely observing sensuous details and physical reactions. He juxtaposes unlikely events from different times to convey information, providing voluptuous descriptions which contain both an idea and its antithesis simultaneously.

Originally published in 1977, Gill's first novel (originally entitled McGarr and the Politician's Wife) may be particularly interesting to those who are already familiar with the series about Peter McGarr, Chief Superintendent of Detectives of the Garda Soichana, and his staff. Although Gill writes a competent mystery and introduces all the characters who become so familiar to fans of his later McGarr mysteries, he is clearly feeling his way here as he decides how to develop them and his plots. The character quirks and foibles we take for granted in the later novels are just hinted at here, the character of McGarr is outlined but not fully developed, and the role of Noreen, McGarr's wife, and her involvement in his career are much stronger here.<br /><br />The mystery is straightforward. When a battered, unconscious, and nearly drowned boat captain is pulled from shallow water at the Killiney Bay Yacht Club, McGarr and his staff--Hugh Ward, Liam O'Shaughnessy, Bernie McKeon, and others who become regulars in the series--find themselves involved in a mystery involving a politician, his promiscuous wife, the influence of the IRA on local politics, gun-smuggling from the U.S., and plots to discredit McGarr. The mystery is not very complex, and some readers may find that their primary interest is in seeing how Gill develops and presents his plot here, as opposed to his later, more fully developed novels.<br /><br />Unlike the much smoother and subtler style in the later novels, Gill's foreshadowing here is still a bit clumsy. (\\"Very shortly, McGarr would need every friend inside the Castle he could muster.\\") He sometimes states the obvious: \\"The stakes [McGarr] was gambling with were his reputation, career and spotless criminal record.\\" He tells the reader what is important, rather than letting the reader discover for himself: \\"Little could Hubbard have known how important the play was to McGarr.\\"<br /><br />The wry and sometimes dark humor which we take for granted in the later novels are not much in evidence here, while the wild flights of Irish good spirits and camaraderie, and the fine description which gives color and depth to the Irish settings, while present in a few scenes, are not yet fully incorporated.

As the author remarks early in the novel, \\"Few things were more awful than an offense against Taste.\\"  Newland meets and marries May Welland, an unimaginative, shallow young woman whose upbringing has made her the perfect, inoffensive wife, one who knows how to behave and how to adhere to the \\"rules\\" of the society in which they live.<br /><br />When Newland is reintroduced to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, who has left her husband in Europe and now wants a divorce, he finds himself utterly captivated by her independence and her willingness to risk all, socially, by flouting convention.  Both Ellen and Newland are products of their upbringing and their culture, however, and they resist their feelings because of their separate social obligations.  Various meetings between them suggest that their feelings are far stronger than what is obvious on the surface, and the question of whether they will finally state the obvious or act on their feelings constitutes the plot.<br /><br />Wharton creates an exceptionally realistic picture of New York in the post-Civil War era, a time in which aristocrats of inherited wealth found themselves competing socially with parvenus.  Her ability to show the conflict between a person's need for social acceptance and the desire for personal freedom is striking.  As the various characters make their peace with their decisions--either to challenge or yield to social dictates--the novel achieves an unusual dramatic tension, subtle because of its lack of direct confrontation and powerful in its effects on individual destinies. This is, in fact, less an \\"age of innocence\\" than it is an age of social manipulation.<br /><br />Wharton herself manipulates the reader--some of her best dialogues and scenes are those the characters never actually have--conversations that they imagine, confrontations which they never allow themselves to have, and resolutions which happen through inaction rather than through decision-making.  Filled with acute social observations, the novel shows individuals convincing themselves that obeying social dictates is the right thing to do.  Though the novel sometimes seems claustrophobic due to its limitations on action, Age of Innocence brilliantly captures the age and attitudes of the era.

Written as a well developed melodrama, this play by William Albert deals so honestly with men, women, their relationships, and their strivings for success that it ultimately achieves the status of true tragedy.  Set in Brooklyn in 1890, the play develops an intense, almost claustrophobic feeling as the characters interact in intimate, two- or three-person scenes and come into conflict.  Main character Kathleen Stanton is the devout, young, convent-bred wife of Matt Stanton, an up-by-the-bootstraps Dublin immigrant to Brooklyn.  Having met her on a quick trip to London, he married her there in a secret civil ceremony which she has always wanted to legitimize in the church.  Now Matt is a candidate for mayor of Brooklyn, and he has promised that once he has won the election, he will seek a church wedding.<br /><br />For three years before his marriage to Kathleen, Matt had been the lover of Agnes Hogan, an older woman who helped him in his rise to success.  Gradually, Matt's history as \\"Hogan's goat\\" unfolds as various neighborhood characters reveal bits of information to the audience.  Kathleen does not know about Agnes, but Agnes's death and funeral bring the history of Matt and Agnes into the open in a particularly traumatic scene for Kathleen.  When Matt faces overt, political conflict with Ned Quinn, the crafty mayor for the past thirty years, Quinn has information with which he intends to blackmail Matt.  The local priest, mysteriously, sides with Quinn.  As the campaign heats up, the stresses on the marriage of Kathleen and Matt reach the boiling point.<br /><br />Filled with passions arising from conflicting political, social, and personal goals, the play deals with the theme of pride and the foolish sacrifices men make for it, with all the action seen as conflicting with honor, a belief in larger values.  For characters like the passionate but devout Kathleen, the larger values are those of the church.  For the ambitious Matt, however, the church is an impediment to his success.  The full details of the relationship of Agnes Hogan and Matt Stanton are gradually revealed in a shocking conclusion, and as the various characters are brought low by their pride and recognize their failings, the play achieves the status of true tragedy.

Author Ha Jin, born in the People's Republic where he lived until 1985, offers a unique perspective on Chinese culture, different from that of most \\"Chinese\\" novels written for a western audience.  Setting the novel in a POW camp in South Korea from 1951 - 53, Ha Jin focuses on the differing attitudes the Chinese, Koreans, and Americans have toward home, country, and each other.  Through Yu Yuan, a young soldier from the Chinese Communist army, Ha Jin shows how differently this young man sees his life and his obligations but how similarly he values friendship, justice, honor, and love.<br /><br />The only son of an elderly mother, Yu Yuan is a twenty-three-year-old member of the Chinese army when his unit enters Korea to aid the North Koreans in 1951, but the Chinese army, Yuan discovers, is not a \\"well-oiled machine,\\" and there is no glory in battle.  Their weapons are Russian, but no one can read the instruction manual.  Lines of communication are so long that men can get orders to march in two different directions from two different officers on two different days, and no officer is allowed to make his own decisions.  Yuan recognizes that his own life has no value.<br /><br />Wounded during a vividly described battle which inflicts atrocious casualties, Yuan is assigned to a POW camp, hiding his true identity because being captured is a crime in China.  Abominable camp conditions, presented in stunning detail, become especially challenging for Chinese like Yuan and his mates, who want to return to their families on the mainland after the war.  The Nationalist Chinese, allies of the US, have been given almost free rein within the camp to bully the mainland Chinese into going to Taiwan, instead of returning home.  Water tortures, unremitting beatings, murders, denial of food, and the tattooing of anti-Communist slogans on the bellies of Communists are powerful \\"motivations\\" for refusing repatriation.<br /><br />Buffeted by fate, Yuan epitomizes the helpless individual at the mercy of a system in which individualism is not valued.  He yearns to return home to his mother and fiancee with some sense of honor, and does not think about freedom, which he has never known.  Ha Jin's writing is efficient and exact, his narrative revealing stories of horrific battles, constant privation, and abusive behavior by Nationalist Chinese, mainland Chinese officers, and Americans.  A strong novel which emphasizes culture more than individuals, War Trash lacks a love story which sometimes unites other war novels, but it remains fascinating and rewarding for readers interested in seeing how culture determines behavior.

Combining moments of danger with moments of profound introspection, mountaineer/explorer Ridgeway details his journey from the top of Mount Kilimanjaro through the Tsavo game reserves to Mombasa, a month-long journey on foot, which allows him to experience man's primal relationships with the environment. Traveling with an experienced guide, two members of the Kenya Park and Wildlife Service, and two sharpshooters (in case of life-threatening danger), Ridgeway follows dry riverbeds across the savanna, seeking \\"tactile knowledge of Africa's wildlands and wild animals.\\"<br /><br />Far more than a search for thrills, the journey offers Ridgeway an opportunity to observe breath-taking vistas and the full panoply of wildlife, from the elephant to the tiniest of birds, paying equal attention to all. Mourning the absence of once-plentiful animals from the bushlands near Kilimanjaro, and the decline of species elsewhere, Ridgeway contemplates the long-term effects of colonialism, big game hunting, poaching, traditional tribal values, climatic changes, and tourism, as well as man's seemingly innate tendency to kill certain species into extinction.<br /><br />Ridgeway, long a hunter himself, is an engaging author, both observant and thoughtful. A great admirer of hunter-turned-game-park-adminstrator Bill Woodley, whose two sons from the Park and Wildlife Service are on the journey, he provides a sensitive and impartial treatment of conservation issues.  Extolling the work of elephant researchers Cynthia Moss and Joyce Poole, the latter of whom joins the group for part of the journey, he points out that they have acquired through study a kind of knowledge not available to hunters.  Without preaching, he conveys \\"the big picture,\\" making a compelling case for the fact that to preserve Africa's large mammals one must \\"fight fiercely not only to preserve, but even to expand, their wild habitat.\\"  Mary Whipple	2005-02-25

New Zealand artist Jane Seabrook has succeeded in creating one of the most charming and amusing gift books ever!  Using captivating watercolor animal portraits to illustrate aphorisms, many of them with new twists, she puts life into perspective on many levels--and does so with panache.  A precariously balanced coqui frog says, \\"I try to take one day at a time...but sometimes several days attack me at once.\\"  A baby alligator emerging from its egg states, \\"I didn't claw my way to the top of the food chain to eat roughage!\\"  A hyperactive chipmunk announces, \\"It's been lovely.  But I have to s c r e a m now.\\"<br /><br />Seabrook's art techniques allow her to pull off a book which in the hands of a lesser, less painstaking artist might be just \\"cute.\\"  Her paintings are rich and meticulously detailed--beautifully drawn with a sable brush of a single hair.  Piling up many layers of watercolor, she builds her drawings and achieves depth, yet somehow still manages to convey a sense of spontaneity.  The eyes of each animal \\"character\\" sparkle with what appears to be secret understanding of the message.  Whimsical and full of surprises, this is the perfect gift book, even (or maybe, especially) for curmudgeons.  Mary Whipple	2005-02-23

In his fourth novel-adventure, art restorer Gabriel Allon is recalled to action by the Israeli intelligence service for which he once worked.  A massive truck bomb at the Israeli embassy in Rome and the shooting of fleeing victims has left fifty-two dead.  When the Israelis obtain a computer disk from the terrorists' house outside of Milan, they discover recent photos of Gabriel Allon and his lover, notes about his real identity, and details of his sanctioned killing of Black September members, along with the second in command in the PLO.  Yassir Arafat himself ordered reprisals against Allon, which resulted in the death of Allon's son and the maiming of his wife in a car bombing.<br /><br />Believing the Rome bombing to be connected to the bombings of a Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires in 1994 and the bombing of Istanbul's main synagogue in 2003, Allon and his mentor, Ari Shamron, an advisor to the prime minister of Israel, soon focus on three generations of a single family.  Sheikh Asad led the Arab Revolt in 1936, unleashing deadly attacks all over Israel, until he was assassinated on orders of Yitzhak Rabin.  The Sheik's son, Sabri, a friend of Yassir Arafat, accepted his father's terrorist mantle, until he was eliminated.  Sabri's orphaned son, young Khaled, adopted by Yassir Arafat, is believed to be behind the recent spate of bombings of Jewish buildings around the world.  Allon is now assigned to find and execute him.<br /><br />The novel, the fourth in the Allon series, is filled with familiar main characters from the past, both in Allon's personal life and in his life as part of the Israeli security service.  These familiar \\"faces\\" and the numerous references to Allon's previous adventures add depth and important historical background to this novel.  The past relationships of characters and their interconnections are written clearly so new readers will not become confused, as Allon and Shamron try to find Khaled and prevent another attack, this time in France.<br /><br />Silva is a particularly efficient novelist, writing in an exciting narrative style which keeps the tension high while he explores contemporary issues.  He is a master at juggling subplots and developing his characters, especially his flawed main character, Gabriel Allon.  His inclusion of real people, such as Itzhak Rabin and Yassir Arafat, gives immediacy to the action, and his background information on the continuing war between the Arabs and Jews for the land in Palestine gives a sense of context to this long-standing enmity.

In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate.<br /><br />When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"<br /><br />Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims. Eventually, a casual remark by Henry leads to the loss of a job for Leonard Bast, a penniless young clerk, but Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.<br /><br />Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on others. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, is charged with educating a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success.<br /><br />Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry. Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it.

Queen Victoria, her family, and her genetic contribution to the scourge of hemophilia in ruling families throughout Europe, all figure in this fascinating medical mystery. Dr. Henry Nanther, Physician In-Ordinary to Prince Leopold, Queen Victoria's beloved hemophiliac son, tells through letters, diary entries, and his personal \\"alternative history\\" the story of his research into hemophilia and how it is transmitted.<br /><br />Martin Nanther, the 4th Lord Nanther, who inherited his peerage from his great-grandfather Henry, is the desk-bound modern detective in this tale, researching Henry's life for a biography he intends to write about his contributions to history and medicine. The agony of the hemophiliac during the Victorian era, when little help could be offered the sufferer, is finely drawn.<br /><br />Though most of the action takes place \\"off stage,\\" Vine's characterizations are fully drawn and Martin's quest is intriguing,making the reader feel like part of the action, even the action of 100 years ago. Students of genealogy will be fascinated as Martin follows a genealogical paper trail through many generations of Nanthers and the Hendersons, his forbears on his mother's side of the family.<br /><br />The serious, intellectual tone and Vine's careful attention to detail, particularly as it reveals the psychology and motivation of her characters, elevate this a serious novel and give the reader much to contemplate. Ironically, Henry's personality is so carefully delineated that many readers may figure out, on the basis of Vine's information, Henry's secret history, well before the conclusion.<br /><br />With its insights into the Victorian period, the clear discussions of genetics, the contemporary insights into British reforms of the House of Lords, the personal and medical mysteries at the heart of the story, and the urgency of Henry's and Martin's quests, Vine's novel is an unusual and fascinating entertainment.

In this somewhat atypical Jane Austen novel, Austen abandons her precise characterization and carefully constructed plots, usually designed to illustrate specific ethical and social dilemmas, and presents a much broader, more complex picture of early nineteenth century life. Though the polite behavior of the middle and upper classes is always a focus of Austen, and this novel is no exception, she is more analytical of society as a whole here, casting a critical eye on moral issues which allow the upper class to perpetuate itself.<br /><br />Fanny Price, the main character, is the daughter of a genteel woman who married for love but soon found herself in poverty. When Fanny's aunt and uncle, the wealthy owners of Mansfield Park, invite Fanny alone, of all the children, to live with them, Fanny enters a new world, where she is educated, clothed, and housed, but always regarded as an \\"outsider.\\"<br /><br />Through Fanny's two cousins, Maria and Julia, Austen shows the complex interactions of the upper class as they negotiate marriages, try to maintain the family's reputation and wealth, and react to those \\"beneath\\" them socially. Fanny, having experienced both poverty and plenty, comments on what she sees, and though she lacks the witty charm of some of Austen's other characters (such as Elizabeth Bennett), she shows an intelligence and conscience lacking among her cousins. Only Edmund, the youngest of the Bertram sons, pays genuine attention to her, and her love for him is real, though secret.<br /><br />This is a darker novel than Austen's others, showing conflicts between late eighteenth century rationalism and the growing romanticism of the nineteenth century.  Often unfeeling toward his own family, Sir Thomas also shows cruelty toward Fanny when she rejects a marriage he has negotiated for her to a man she does not love. Cousin Maria chooses to marry Rushworth for his fortune, but she succumbs to her passion for someone else, and introduces a romantic, new sexuality into the novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Fanny, though sweet and reasonable, is also quiet and predictable, while Edmund, the only other potentially empathetic character, is naïve and often appears to be weak. Austen's light touch and quiet humor, which make her other novels vibrate with life and come to a satisfying ending, are less obvious here, and the abrupt conclusion leaves many questions unanswered.

This slim volume of 44 recipes offers a great deal of variety for the home cook, showcasing recipes from around the world using the standard varieties of fish found in good fish markets throughout the country.  Dividing the book into sections, the author features all the various methods of preparation--poaching and steaming, saut&eacute;ing and frying, broiling and grilling, and baking and roasting--along with the garnishes, sauces, and salsas that can make fish cookery so interesting.  A helpful photo is included for each recipe, along with suggested accompaniments.<br /><br />Among the most interesting recipes for those looking for something different are:  Tandoori Fish, with its marinade of ginger, onion, garlic, a variety of (readily available) Asian spices, and yogurt;  Steamed Fish with ginger, green onions, and soy sauce;  Broiled Fish in a Greek Marinade of garlic, oregano, thyme, and ouzo; and, my favorite, Italian Fish Stew, with green peppers, onions, garlic, red pepper flakes, fennel, plum tomatoes and white wine.  None of these recipes cook for more than 8 - 10 minutes, so if all the preparation is done ahead of time, cooking can be a no-fuss, last-minute activity.<br /><br />A few of the recipes are not very attractive to look at.  Though the Salmon Poached in Red Wine with Caramelized Shallots sounds as if it would be tasty, the purplish  red wine sauce that bathes the fish is pretty daunting to look at.  Trout with Prosciutto and Sage also sounds tasty, but the fish is served whole--the head, tail, and skin intact--not a pretty sight when wrapped in a blanket of red prosciutto.<br /><br />No shellfish recipes are included, and those who live in parts of the country such as Florida and Hawaii, where a more exotic variety of fish is readily available, will have to figure out their own substitutions in these recipes.  There is no mention of fish such as mahi-mahi or the unusual varieties of snapper so plentiful in these areas.

Wendy Wasserstein's debut play brings women's liberation to hilarious but sympathetic life in this 1970 drama.  Setting the play at Mount Holyoke College, Wasserstein focuses on six young women who are about to graduate and enter a world newly sensitized to feminist goals.  Caught between traditional values of home and hearth, and rival goals of sexual liberation and personal liberation, these women are on the cusp of a whole new way of life.  The play opens a few years after graduation as the women meet to reminisce about their lives in college, where \\"milk-and-crackers\\" teas and \\"gracious living\\" have dominated.<br /><br />The play is both sympathetic and satiric, as an Emily Dickinson-reading \\"housemother,\\" works to make these students into \\"ladies\\" while they explore options never before open to them.  Discussions of Women's History courses, references to Father-Daughter Weekend, and interactions among the various women as they explore who they are and who they will become illustrate the changing values of the times.  Rita is the dominant figure, a promiscuous and iconoclastic woman who wants to write the great American novel and who refuses to bend to convention.<br /><br />In contrast to her is Leilah, a shy student who avoids the spotlight and who plans to study anthropology in Iraq after graduation.  Other characters include Kate, who plans to attend law school; Samantha, who is in love and believes her primary role is to be wife and mother; Holly Kaplan, who is not sure what she wants her role to be; and Muffet, who becomes \\"partly liberated\\" but has yet to define her ultimate goals.  Throughout the play, a disembodied male voice narrates a promotional film for the college, illustrating the gap between what is real (as presented onstage) and what is ideal (as the college presents its PR).<br /><br />Wonderfully poignant pictures of the social, sexual, and personal conflicts faced by these bright students in 1970 evolve as the students fumblingly make the transition between traditional expectations and unlimited possibilities.

When Isabel Archer, a bright and independent young American, makes her first trip to Europe in the company of her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, who lives outside of London in a 400-year-old estate, she discovers a totally different world, one which does not encourage her independent thinking or behavior and which is governed by rigid social codes. This contrast between American and European values, vividly dramatized here, is a consistent theme in James's novels, one based on his own experiences living in the US and England. In prose that is filled with rich observations about places, customs, and attitudes, James portrays Isabel's European coming-of-age, as she discovers that she must curb her intellect and independence if she is to fit into the social scheme in which she now finds herself.<br /><br />Isabel Archer, one of James's most fully drawn characters, has postponed a marriage in America for a year of travel abroad, only to discover upon her precipitate and ill-considered marriage to an American living in Florence, that it is her need to be independent that makes her marriage a disaster. Gilbert Osmond, an American art collector living in Florence, marries Isabel for the fortune she has inherited from her uncle, treating her like an object d'art which he expects to remain \\"on the shelf.\\" Madame Serena Merle, his long-time lover, is, like Osmond, an American whose venality and lack of scruples have been encouraged, if not developed, by the European milieu in which they live.<br /><br />James packs more information into one paragraph than many writers do in an entire chapter. Distanced and formal, he presents psychologically realistic characters whose behavior is a direct outgrowth of their upbringing, with their conflicts resulting from the differences between their expectations and the reality of their changed settings. The subordinate characters, Ralph Touchett, Pansy Osmond, her suitor Edward Rosier, American journalist Henrietta Stackpole, Isabel's former suitor Caspar Stackpole, and Lord Warburton, whose love of Isabel leads him to court Pansy, are as fascinating psychologically and as much a product of their own upbringing as is Isabel.<br /><br />As the setting moves from America to England, Paris, Florence, and Rome, James develops his themes, and as Isabel's life becomes more complex, her increasingly difficult and emotionally affecting choices about her life make her increasingly fascinating to the reader. James's trenchant observations about the relationship between individuals and society and about the effects of one's setting on one's behavior are enhanced by the elegance and density of his prose, making this a novel one must read slowly--and savor.

Croatian author Josip Novakovich's novel bursts the bounds of genre.  Both naturalistic in its depiction of the Yugoslavian war and its atrocities, and fantastic and darkly absurd in its depiction of the life of main character Ivan Dolinar, the novel seesaws between the horrific and the hilarious.  Surprising in his ability to wrest unique images from universal experiences, Novakovich writes with such clarity and directness that the reader immediately identifies with Ivan and empathizes with him as uncontrollable forces buffet him throughout his life.<br /><br />Born, appropriately, on April Fool's Day, 1948, Ivan immediately comes alive for the reader through the author's recognition of the universal qualities of children.  In many ways Ivan is a child-Everyman, albeit one with a Croatian upbringing.  At nineteen, he passes the exams for medical school, where he forms fast friendships, tries to fall in love, and excels in anatomy--until he and a roommate are overheard joking about assassinating Marshall Tito, a conversation which results in a four-year sentence to a prison labor camp, where, absurdly, he has a cigar with Marshall Tito.<br /><br />As Ivan becomes more and more a prisoner of his political system, the sense of absurdity grows.  Eventually, thanks to nationwide unrest, Ivan, a Croat, is drafted into the Yugoslav army and, absurdly, sent to Croatia to fight the Croatian army, only to be captured by the Croats and forced to fight the Serbs until his unit surrenders to the Yugoslav Army which drafted him in the first place.  Forced to make a 100-mile march, the end of which would be freedom for anyone who survived, Ivan observes atrocities beyond his imaginings.<br /><br />In the second half, his eventual marriage, fatherhood, employment, and decision to engage in \\"preemptive adultery\\" lead to further absurdities (and some long-standing enmities) as he ages into his fifties.  Having studied philosophy, Ivan continues to look for meaning in life, often engaging in personal religious debates as he searches for \\"a chance to think something essential,\\" something which would \\"give him the sensation of being alive.\\"<br /><br />The conclusion is a blockbuster, sixty pages of the most absurd, farcical, and hilariously ironic writing in recent memory, a section which comes close to slapstick at the same time that it is indescribably bleak.  Mining the emotions of both comedy and tragedy, the ending transcends the boundaries of realism.  Novakovich writes a testament to the absurd, creating a satire/farce which features a main character whose wasted life comes as close to tragedy as anything the Greeks imagined.

From the beginning of the series, Gill has experimented with his characters and plots in an effort to find his m&eacute;tier, gradually increasing his character development, narrowing down his settings by making them more \\"Irish,\\" and developing increasingly complex plots. This novel, his fourth, unlike its two immediate predecessors (McGarr on the Cliffs of Moher, set largely in New York, and McGarr and the Sienese Conspiracy, set in Italy), is located entirely in Ireland, with all the action connected with the Dublin Horse Show. While the plot is complex, the characters are not, and the charming humor of later novels, such as Death of a Joyce Scholar, the eighth in the series, is absent.<br /><br />Many threads develop simultaneously and go in different directions. An enormously talented young girl, Mairead Caughey, wants to become a concert pianist. Her mother, the murder victim, is the sister of an IRA member on the run, and both of them have lost their land to a greedy neighbor. Mairead's boy friend, the son of a newly rich member of the Irish Dial, is a drug addict who may be involved in local burglaries. A major horse dealer, paralyzed in an accident, is has staked much of his reputation on the success of his horses in the Dublin show, and his wife is slated to ride the horse which paralyzed him. A priest seems to have more than a passing interest in Mairead, and Mairead herself may not be who she appears to be.<br /><br />To develop all these threads, Gill introduces innumerable characters, some of whom are connected to just one thread, and some of whom overlap. Because they are not developed, except superficially, their motivations are always not clear, nor are the reasons the action moves in the direction that it does. McGarr, McKeon, O'Shaughnessy, McGarr's wife Noreen, Ruthie Bresnahan, Hugh Ward, and the rest of the detective division of the Garda Soichana all make their appearances, but their characters remain static, since they appear only as police officers and not as developing characters.<br /><br />A pure police procedural, the novel lacks the quirky characters of later novels, and the very funny scenes that evolve from their interactions. The plot here, though complex and broad, is not very tight, the suspense diffused among too many plot lines. A fascinating novel for those who are interested in observing the development of the series, this novel (also known as Death of an Irish Tradition) is less interesting for its plot and characters than the novels which come later in the series.

In Gilad Elbom's witty, metafictional novel of life in Jerusalem, an iconoclastic \\"fictional\\" speaker named Gilad is writing a novel which parallels events in the life of the book's real author Gilad Elbom.  The main character, a young man who studied languages and linguistics at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has taken a job as an assistant nurse in a mental hospital, and as he speaks to us in his lively and sometimes flippant style, the reader observes his personal relationships, the lives and behavior of the inmates in the asylum where he works, the uncertainties of daily life of Jerusalem, and the overriding question of what constitutes sanity in modern-day Israel.<br /><br />Gilad's girlfriend Carmel is married to a dying man whose death she anxiously awaits.  His patients, a motley crew whom the reader comes to know well, include an atheist who describes himself as suffering from Faith Deficit Disorder, a Beat poet who writes paeans to a porn star goddess, a woman who believes she is dead, and the Palestinian murderer of a young Israeli woman, whom the military has assigned to the asylum for observation.<br /><br />The dark humor of daily life in Israel permeates the novel, from Gilad's delay of his departure for work until he has heard that the daily deaths and bombings by terrorists have already occurred (and have missed him once again), to his running around to military camps throughout the country to obtain files and paperwork for one of his patients.  His trip to the Palestinian territories to a casino (populated entirely by Jews, since gambling is anathema to Muslims), and his attempts to take his patients on an outing to a restaurant add to the color and sense of absurdity.<br /><br />Moments of hilarity abound, varying in style from rapid-fire, who's-on-first interchanges, to descriptions of personal quirks, the inclusion of absurd poems by a patient, Carmel's constant, chorus-like interruptions of Gilad's day at work, and literary discussions of Robinson Crusoe, which Gilad is trying to read at work.  Stream of consciousness writing and free association, some of it related to Gilad's interest in heavy metal music, are interposed into discussions of life and literature, creating a wild, existential tone.  Plot is almost non-existent.  Fortunately, the light touch, the humor, the self-deprecating commentary, and the pseudo-angst of the main character provide enough intrinsic excitement and charm to keep the reader going in lieu of a \\"real\\" story.

Heidi Holland, with an Ivy League education and a Fulbright in England under her belt, is a lecturer in art history, an expert on female artists virtually unknown in their lifetimes, though their work is as good as that of the male painters who dominated their ages. Using the art history \\"hook\\" into the question of women and their roles--as they see their roles, as men see women's roles, and as women search for happiness within these roles--Wendy Wasserstein has written a thoughtful and very funny drama about the Baby Boom generation and the price its women have paid as they have searched for fulfillment.<br /><br />Exploring Heidi Holland's life from the late 1960s to the 1990s, Wasserstein takes us from Heidi's high school and college days, as she grows in her thinking and view of her role in life, to her experiences with women's lib focus groups, the Eugene McCarthy campaign, the rise of AIDS, the gay movement, and ultimately Heidi's realization of what is important to her, not just professionally and philosophically, but personally and emotionally.<br /><br />Wasserstein uses wit and a keen ear for dialogue to create quick, often humorous interchanges which advance the action and the feminist message without polemics.  Heidi is, on the surface, a success by all external measurements, but she feels that she is missing something from her life.  Professional success is not enough for her, a revelation that made this play somewhat controversial within the women's movement when it was first produced in 1988.  Some feminists apparently believed Heidi's desire for emotional fulfillment through love to be a sellout to a male dominated culture.<br /><br />Wasserstein emphasizes that women should be able to pursue both professional success and a personal life, however, and the rounded character of Heidi remains a nice contrast to the more strident and sometimes hostile female characters with whom she interacts on stage.  Throughout the action, the play's high humor and absurdity are nicely balanced with scenes of sentiment and sorrowful revelation, and Wasserstein maintains her light touch without trivializing the issues.  Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1989, the play offers insights into significant social issues, gracefully presented so that they do not alienate the audience.

In the fifth of his sixteen Peter McGarr mysteries, author Bartholomew Gill is still finding his niche.  Though he is using the same police characters from the Garda Siochana in Dublin with which he began the series (in Death of an Irish Politician), he has not yet begun to concentrate on their quirky personalities, their humor, or their often hilarious interactions.  In terms of his plots, he has yet to discover the charm of using strictly Irish settings and intrigue, as he does in his later novels, concentrating instead on Nazi art thefts in France during World War II and the party bureaucrats who conveyed impressionist masterpieces to Nazi collectors.<br /><br />When Henry Craig, a Dublin art and antiques dealer is found shot to death near his showroom, Peter McGarr and his investigators first concentrate on his business associates, his schizophrenic French wife, who may have seen the murder, and Craig's son, with whom he has had a recent fight.  Soon, however, McGarr finds that Craig's own staff has some strange connections, with direct ties to the IRA.  The theft of a priceless Alfred Sisley painting brings McGarr's art conservator wife Noreen into the investigation, and the war-time activities of Craig's wife and his partner, along with the paternity of her son, come into question.<br /><br />The mystery is complex, with the author needing to provide a good deal of background information about the Nazi Occupation of France in order to connect the plot elements.  Several additional, intricate subplots keep the reader challenged with even more characters, interactions, and complications.  Violence, stories of atrocities, brute force on the part of McGarr and his staff, and the suggestion that one of the Garda higher-ups is protecting IRA members keep the plot firmly focused on the sensational.  None of the humor which characterizes Gill's later novels is observable here, and Noreen is included primarily as an expert on art, rather than as a humanizing factor for McGarr.<br /><br />Gill has obviously done considerable research on art, conservation, and Nazi history, and he incorporates it well.  Since his first novels, his plots have grown more complex, and his hand seems surer as he manages his characters and juggles details.  His descriptions are beautifully drawn, and his ability to recognize and promote those elements which keep the reader interested is obvious.

Changing the tempo, creating new phrasings, breathing emotion into lyrics one has stopped hearing because of their familiarity, and also having fun with novelty songs that helped make the twenties \\"roar,\\" she entertains and draws new attention to composers we all regard as \\"greats\\" but to whom we may never have listened so carefully.<br /><br />A genius at creating an interesting pace for the CD, Haran alternates fast and slow tunes, changes moods in songs from humorous to passionate, and switches from a light \\"Betty Boop\\" voice in songs like \\"They're Blaming the Charleston\\" and \\"Monkey Doodle Doo\\" to a voice of regret and contemplation in \\"It Had to Be You\\" and \\"Moanin' Low.\\"  In a torchy jazz tune with a frantic tempo, \\"Pack Up Your Sins and Go to the Devil in Hades,\\" by Irving Berlin, she tells us that \\"Hades is the best of the winter resorts,\\" and that \\"All the best people are there,\\" camping it up with a \\"growly\\" voice that cannot help but bring a smile.  But when she does \\"What'll I Do,\\" also by Berlin, she slows the tempo and whispers, wrapping this familiar song with pathos.<br /><br />The flexibility of her voice and versatility of her styles are showcased by the clever piano accompaniments of Richard Rodney Bennett, who not only accompanies her but also sings on several tracks.  The only other instrument we hear is Linc Milliman's bass.  Featuring six songs by Irving Berlin, the strongest songs on the album, I believe, she also reinterprets Rogers and Hart, George and Ira Gershwin, Noel Coward, and in \\"Lullaby of Broadway,\\" Al Dubin, slowing the tempo until the song almost sounds like a real lullaby.  Reining in her powerful voice, Haran focuses on the lyrics of the songs, singing with her usual clarity but whispering when it suits the lyrics and camping it up on the novelty songs.

Ignoring the conventions of time, this playful \\"message play\\" follows one family from the days of the glaciers and dinosaurs to a post-apocalyptic, modern world. George Antrobus, the inventor of the wheel, and Maggie, his wife, the inventor of the apron, have two children, Gladys and Henry (whose previous name was Cain). The bossy father, domestic and subservient mother, aggressive and dangerous son, and innocent daughter interact, often humorously, onstage and are also seen through the viewpoint of Sabina, the flirtatious maid. As the play progresses through the eras, Wilder raises questions about civilization and values. George, by Act II, is convinced that the world is made for pleasure and power, but by the final act, after a world cataclysm, the family confronts what is truly important in their lives.<br /><br />A pet dinosaur and a wooly mammoth, the Boardwalk of New Jersey and the Miss America contest, the fraternal Order of Mammals (of which George is President), and the attempted seduction of George and his fellow Mammals by predatory women all add to the visual appeal of this production. Though the play pretends to be traditional in its dramatic structure, it takes liberties with the audience as the various actors step out of character to address the audience, as does the director. At one point Sabina refuses to play a scene, summarizing it for the audience as the director and George plead with her.<br /><br />First produced in 1942, the play reflects Wilder's fear that the war then engulfing the world might truly be a war for the future of civilization. His conclusion, which highlights the values of western philosophers, such as Spinoza, Aristotle, and Plato, also reflects his religious beliefs and his belief in the enduring values of (western) literature. \\"We've come a long way--we're learning,\\" he says, hopefully, but he also reminds us that \\"the end of this play isn't written yet.\\" Creative and original in its day, the play represents a major moment in American theater. Less innovative now, more than sixty years later, it still offers food for thought in its reminder of enduring values and its questions about what we value and would save from our own lives in a similar cataclysm.

Setting her novel in an ethnically mixed neighborhood of Jerusalem, Israeli novelist Batya Gur continues the career of Chief Superintendent Michael Ohayon, formerly a historian, now a police investigator.  In this fifth book in the series, Michael  Ohayon investigates a particularly gory murder.  An apparently beautiful young woman has been murdered in the attic of a house undergoing renovations, her face beaten to a pulp.  No one knows how she might have been lured to such a place or why she might have been murdered.<br /><br />Zahara Bashari, the victim, has been developing a small museum \\"for the splendor of Yemenite culture\\" in the basement of a local synagogue.  Complex political issues exist between the Yemenites, known as the Mizrahis, and the Ashkenazis (Russian Jews), and Zahara believes that the Ashkenazim want to wipe out everything that distinguishes the Yemenite Jews.  Furthermore, in the 1950s, Yemenite babies were kidnapped from their parents and given to others to raise, and Zahara wants to find out more about this period and what might have happened to one of her own kin.<br /><br />The investigation is centered on the neighborhood, where Zahara's parents and their next door neighbors have not spoken for years.  Nessia, a lonely, young girl with no friends, idolizes Zahara and follows her movements in the neighborhood, collecting \\"souvenirs\\" of Zahara's life, and looking for some sort of recognition-until she, too, disappears. Zahara's personal life proves to be complex, and her previously unknown ownership of an apartment and substantial savings account prove particularly worrisome.<br /><br />The rivalries and tensions within the neighborhood and the police reflect all aspects of society and all political and social movements.  Though Ohayon is a moderate in his views toward Arabs, Danny Balilty, deputy commander of the intelligence division, is a hard-liner.  Within the neighborhood, however, residents work with and hire Arab contractors, some have friends who are Arabs, and some express annoyance at the strict measures imposed by their government to prohibit the work of Arabs except under certain circumstances.<br /><br />Though the novel is filled with information about a unique way of life, the mystery is not always easy to follow.  Pronoun references are sometimes unclear, the translation is occasionally awkward, and digressions slow down the action.  Ohayon's dissertation on love during his courtship, for example, wanders on too long and lessens the tension.  Still, author Batya Gur has some good psychological insights into character, especially of the fat, young girl Nessia, and Gur's ability to juggle innumerable characters and plot ideas is admirable.

Now approaching his sixtieth birthday and wanting to escape from cell phones, answering machines, the daily newspaper, and being \\"put on hold,\\" he is determined to travel from Cairo to Cape Town. He believes that the continent \\"contain[s] many untold tales and some hope and comedy and sweetness, too,\\" and that there is \\"more to Africa than misery and terror.\\"<br /><br />Traveling alone by cattle truck, \\"chicken bus,\\" bush train, matatu, rental car, ferry, and even dugout canoe, he tries to blend in as much as possible, buying clothing at secondhand stalls in public markets, carrying only one small bag, and avoiding the tourist destinations. He is an observant and insightful writer, and his descriptions of his travails are so vivid the reader can experience them vicariously. His interviews with residents are perceptive and very revealing of the political and social climate of these places, and his character sketches of Sister Alexandra from Ethiopia (a nun who \\"has loved\\") and of two charming Ethiopian traders, a father and son, who take Theroux to the Kenyan border, are delightful.<br /><br />For most of the countries of Africa, however, he has no kind words. Kenya is \\"one of the most corrupt...countries in Africa,\\" everything in Kampala, Uganda, has changed for the worse, and in Tanzania \\"there was only decline--simple linear decrepitude, and in some villages collapse.\\" At the U.S. embassy in Malawi, he finds an \\"overpaid, officious, disingenuous, blame-shifting...embassy hack\\" and, in pique, he wonders, \\"Had she, like me, been abused, terrified, stranded, harassed, cheated, bitten, flooded, insulted, exhausted, robbed, browbeaten, poisoned?\\"<br /><br />Theroux has become curmudgeonly over time, and it is difficult to \\"travel with\\" a man who sees himself as a hero for making the trip at all, but who also refuses to give a half-eaten apple to a hungry child when she begs for it.

This plaintive phone message from a Indian father to his son in another part of New York reflects the problems of communication illustrated in this 1968 play.  The Indian is stuck at a New York bus stop at night, trying to reach his son's house in the Bronx, which is on a different line.  He does not know where he is and has no idea how to get where he wants to go.  The Indian doesn't speak English (though his lines are in English in the playbook so that actors can respond to them appropriately).  Two toughs (one played in the original production by Al Pacino, who won an Obie for his role) saunter up to him and hassle him, mocking his inability to speak English, his turban, his constant politeness no matter how rude they are, and his predicament of being lost in \\"their\\" territory.<br /><br />In the course of the play, Murph and Joey reveal all their ignorance and prejudices, their hostility, and their feelings of being left out of the mainstream, for which they want to take action.  They are mean and aware that in the situation at the bus stop they have all the power.  When the hassling becomes more serious, Joey earns his neighborhood stripes, attacking the Indian, who simply wants to get home to his son.<br /><br />Presented with little scenery, except for a bus stop sign, a telephone booth, and some trash cans, this is a bare-bones play for three characters, depending largely on the actors to convey a sense of menace, rather than on the dialogue.  Capturing the political and social unrest in the cities in the 1960s, it simply portrays issues, rather than investigating them or offering any commentary on them, and much of the dialogue and the attitudes are now dated.  The Indian is a character for whom the reader/viewer evolves sympathy, but since he speaks no English during the play, the audience must understand him through his body language and sense of ingenuousness.  A play which reflects the period in which it was written, it offers less of enduring value for the present day.  Mary Whipple.  Mary Whipple	2005-02-04

Storey's 1976 Booker Prize-winner captures the heart of its characters, draws in the reader, and smoothly traces the life of Colin Saville from his childhood to early adulthood in the small and dying mining village of Saxton.  In some ways, Saville is the archetype of all those young people who have used their educations--and some luck--to develop interests which take them beyond their smalltown villages and into the wider world.  As Storey shows us, this is not a smooth transition, and it is not done without regrets and feelings of abandoning family ties.<br /><br />Set during World War II and after, the novel concentrates on daily life as a young boy deals as well as he can with the circumstances of life, even when he has to live with a neighbor for several months because his mother is hospitalized and his father works at night.  Always limiting his descriptions to what the main character would observe at various stages of his life, Storey conveys Colin's world realistically, from his embarrassment at having a bath in front of the neighbor woman he stays with to his feeling that \\"everyone had moved away.  At school he was suddenly cut off.\\"<br /><br />Colin's friends range from Batty and Stringer, two young delinquents who have a \\"hut\\" in the woods, to Michael Reagan, a violinist, fat Ian Bletchley, and Stafford, a wealthy boy who befriends him in school.  Through them Storey is able to create a realistic novel which also shows what happens to these other, equally typical characters as the post-war years progress.  At school Colin is subjected to snobbism, sadistic punishment, and emotional abuse by teachers who seem to regret their own lack of success and their awareness that the class structures of which they have been a part are breaking down.  But he survives, making friends, discovering women, and learning about equality, both in terms of women's liberation and in terms of his own potential.<br /><br />Ultimately, a colleague tells Colin, now an adult, \\"You don't belong to any class, since you live with one class, respond like another, and feel attachments to none.\\"  This breaking up of traditional class structures is Storey's theme, one repeated throughout countries and ages as young people achieve more than their parents, the communal spirit of villages changes, opportunities open up for those who work for them, and life becomes more global.

Initially resembling an old-fashioned, hard-boiled detective story, this novel by Graham Swift becomes, as the perspective widens, an investigation of love, man's need for love, and the sacrifices we are all willing to make for love. Private detective George Webb allows the reader to \\"tag along\\" during one day of his life in 1997, talking to his readers about aspects of his life as they impinge randomly on his consciousness. Description is not a big part of George's life, and it takes the reader some time to understand all his references in this lengthy interior monologue. We don't know, at first, why Nov. 20 is a significant date to him or where he goes every other Thursday, nor do we know about his personal relationships with the women introduced at the beginning, or the reason he's buying flowers, or why he's had a woman's handbag in his possession for two years.<br /><br />As George's recollections, memories, and observations expand, however, we gradually come to know him and his past, including his relationship with his father, his own broken marriage and the circumstances surrounding it, his alienated daughter, his womanizing, the scandal which has resulted in his leaving the police force, and his decision to specialize in \\"matrimonial work.\\" We learn, too, that George's client, Mrs. Nash, is now in jail, the reasons for this unfolding even more gradually, as we come to know her, her husband Bob, and the privileged life they've led. Always, however, our opinions of these characters and their relationships are colored by George's point of view, and we, as objective observers, learn as much about them from what George does not say as we do by what he does say.<br /><br />All of George's memories are concerned with the vulnerability of people who are in love, as Swift raises questions about whether we choose the people we love, or whether we are chosen by them. Does love just happen? What makes it last? What happens to lovers who are \\"unchosen\\"? And can we love too much? Although a mystery story is not usually the framework for such a serious, philosophical analysis of love in all its permutations, Swift manages to make this work through his beautifully wrought character study of George, buffeted every which way by the loves in his life. In the lean, unemphatic prose style he first employed in Last Orders, Graham Swift presents a sensitive investigation of love with all its mysteries and ineffable sadness. Mary Whipplelove too much?

In this impeccably controlled novel, prize-winning Australian author Thea Astley combines her irrepressible good humor and wry view of people and the world, telling an offbeat story of feisty characters in search of their spiritual \\"centers.\\" Main character Belle grows up on her grandfather's marginally successful sheep farm, Perjury Plains, \\"outside a lost townlet called Drenchings.\\" Her assertive but impractical mother Bonnie works as a drummer in an all-girls' band, playing gigs at local church halls and sheep-farming conventions, her absent, trumpet-playing father having sought his own career in the United States.<br /><br />Sent to boarding school at the age of seven, this lonely but remarkably self-sufficient child grows up longing to know what it is like to have a family, a solid, emotional center in her life-\\"I want love,\\" she says. As Astley follows her from her birth, at which her grandmother \\"only just managed to intercept grandfather as he dialed the vet,\\" through her childhood and eventual marriage, we see Belle choosing friends, forming relationships, and making decisions, always attempting to find someone, real or imagined, who will serve as \\"a center in which [she] can merge.\\"<br /><br />Humorous but pithy observations fill this novel as feisty Belle, Bonnie, and their friends make do the best way they can, always hoping that happiness is just around the corner, if only they can free themselves from their present circumstances. Astley astutely manipulates the tone and point of view to match various stages of Belle's life. Belle's flippant and youthfully cynical point of view as a child changes gracefully to a more serious and conventional point of view when she becomes an adult, and to a controlled magic realism when she fantasizes about a character she is researching in her role as an archivist. Unique descriptions abound: Belle describes her mother's alternative lifestyle as \\"like living in a Longfellow ballad,\\" and, when she is tired of her husband's smiles, devoutly wishes that \\"Seb's teeth would go black.\\" Filled with literary delights, high spirits, and much good sense, this is a novel to savor.

With this toast Chief Superintendent Peter McGarr of the Garda Soichana salutes his New York counterparts for helping him investigate IRA fund-raising in the U.S. to finance terrorism abroad. A seemingly straightforward investigation of the murder of a young Irish woman, stabbed to death with a wooden pitchfork on the Cliffs of Moher, has quickly turned into an international conspiracy involving secret cells of the IRA, money-laundering, and plans for a major terror attack in the Emerald Isle.<br /><br />McGarr's investigation of the murder of May Quirk, a reporter for a New York newspaper, reveals the wide variety of people affected by her death and their interactions--educated young Irish emigres now living in New York, sad and frustrated old folks tending small farms in County Clare, owners of local dance halls and pubs in Lahinch, misguided supporters of the IRA, crooks threatened by May's investigations, and even her German boyfriend with his Irish roots.<br /><br />McGarr, his wife Noreen, and his officers--Hugh Ward, Bernie McKeon, and Liam O'Shaughnessy--whom we know from two previous novels, continue to develop their personal relationships in parallel with the ongoing IRA investigation. McGarr, who is not averse to having a jar with the lads, even the bad lads, is an honest investigator who shows his emotions and is willing to get \\"down and dirty,\\" if necessary. He himself admits to interpreting the law on terms that are \\"somehow fairer than the cold print on the pages of the law books,\\" in order to effect a just outcome. The action is fast, the plot is exciting, and the characters, with all their quirks and idiosyncrasies, are unforgettable.<br /><br />Author Gill's eye for revealing detail, his colorful dialogue with all its colloquialisms, his perceptive recreation of unique settings and atmosphere, and the loving humor of his observations make this novel a lively and memorable evocation of characters and places we have come to know as part of this sixteen-book series.

Adapted from a story by Ivan Turgenev, this play by Ronald Ribman was winner of the Obie Award for 1966 Best Play of the Year.  Zoditch, the main character, is the neurotic \\"first reader\\" at a small publishing house in Petersburg, Russia, at the turn of the century.  Considered \\"an interruption in everyone's conversation,\\" Zoditch is a man who has no friends, no ability to relax, no lady-love, and no promise for the future, though he has many unrealistic dreams.<br /><br />When a local housekeeper wants to publish the diary of Nicolai Chulkaturin, which was left to her when he died, Zoditch at first rejects it out of pique because its punctuation, paragraphing, and literary style do not meet his standards, but he reads it at home. As he does, Chulkaturin, a young man who has just died of tuberculosis, emerges from the pages of the diary (and appears, ghostlike, in Zoditch's room), revealing that he, like Zoditch, feels like a \\"fifth horse,\\" a superfluous addition to the coach of life. When, unexpectedly, Chulkaturin meets a young woman with whom he falls deeply in love, an experience which Zoditch has missed, Chulkaturin's life changes.<br /><br />As the action alternates between scenes from the lives of Zoditch and Chulkaturin, all enacted in Zoditch's cold, bare room, the parallels between them become obvious. In many ways Chulkaturin is what Zoditch wishes he could be--tall, handsome, and in love. The same actors play roles both in Chulkaturin's story and in Zoditch's life, and the idea of Chulkaturin as Zoditch's alterego is inescapable. The romance lacking from Zoditch's real life is seen here through Chulkaturin's story and through Zoditch's fantasies and dreams, as Zoditch, a self-serving and hostile young man reveals his inner life and longings. Moody and dark, the play reveals a bleak reality, and, in its conclusion, a dark humor, which puts Zoditch's yearnings and false hopes into perspective.  Mary Whipple	2005-01-30

One of Greene's \\"entertainments,\\" this short novel written in 1944 was hidden away for nearly forty years before being discovered in the MGM files.  Written as the idea for a film, the novella is a fine example of Greene's style, as finished and polished as any of his more complex novels.<br /><br />Set in France during the war, the story concerns a group of thirty Frenchmen imprisoned by their German occupiers and then told that they must decide for themselves which three of the thirty men will be executed.  One of the men who draws a marked ballot for his own death is a wealthy lawyer with considerable property who offers his entire fortune to any man who will take his place.  One young man accepts, drawing up legal papers which give his newly acquired property to his sister and mother before he is executed.<br /><br />The remaining three parts of the novel deal with the return of the now-penniless former owner to \\"his\\" house after the war, where he meets the dead man's sister and works as a servant under a new name;  the arrival of an imposter who claims to be the former owner; and the showdown between the former owner and the imposter.<br /><br />As is always the case with Greene, the dialogue is taut, revealing character and plot simultaneously, with no extraneous chat.  The main character, like so many others Greene depicts, is a weak man whose bad choices, in this case his decision to buy his own life, have led to the complications which become the story.  Living a lie, Chavel/Charlot faces a crisis of morality in which he must decide what, if anything, he can do to redeem himself to atone for the life-or-death decision he forced upon another man.  The imposter who arrives at the house claiming to be the former owner is described as resembling a devil, and the showdown between him and the real former owner is seen as the struggle between goodness and evil.<br /><br />Filled with ironies and absurdities, the novel maintains considerable suspense until the dramatic, tour de force of an ending.  Too short to allow for much character development, the novella conveys a strong message within an exciting little morality tale filled with sharply observed details--simple without being simplistic.

Telling the story of Luca Turin, a French scientist who, in the mid-1990s, developed a revolutionary new theory about how we smell, Chandler Burr focuses on the evolution of the theory and why it has not led to a Nobel Prize.  Turin, a controversial researcher,  posited (and believes he proved) that scent is not determined by the body's ability to recognize the shape of molecules, the accepted explanation of smell.  Instead, he believes that vibrations of electrons are recognized by a kind of \\"spectroscope\\" in our noses--that atoms with the same vibrations have the same smell even when they come from different elements.<br /><br />Burr details Turin's experiments and his successful (he believes) searches for proof through the late 1990s.  But he also describes Turin's unsuccessful attempts to be published in prestigious scientific magazines, his battles royal with other researchers, some of whom have rejected his ideas without reading his papers, and his disappointments with the \\"Big Boys,\\" the world's seven biggest makers of perfumes, who would benefit directly if Turin were correct.  Ultimately, Burr concludes that the scientific community and its attitudes toward Turin reflect their \\"scientific corruption, corruption in the most mundane and systemic [sense].\\"<br /><br />For whatever reasons, Burr is unsuccessful in getting opposing scientists to discuss Turin's vibration theory in relation to their belief in a molecule's shape as a determinant of smell, and he ultimately presents a book that is biased in favor of Turin's work. By the end of the book, Burr has clearly abandoned any sense of impartiality and become a supporter of Turin.  He inserts an Author's Note three-quarters of the way into the book to justify his inability to present an alternative viewpoint, concluding that scientific rejection of Turin's theory is the result of \\"vested self-interest and bad science.\\"<br /><br />Turin is clearly a difficult man, however, and his attitudes, reflected in humorous and sarcastic comments about other scientists and their ideas, may well have contributed to his lack of acceptance.  Though one of his supporters praises him for being the first person to apply quantum mechanics to a physical problem, he also indicates that Turin's biggest flaw is his impatience.  (In fact, Turin has already abandoned this work, moving on to a new project studying energy storage in cells.)  Fascinating, though complex in its discussions of biology, chemistry, and physics, the book is also fun to read--the story of a maverick who had a great idea which no one takes seriously, at least not yet.

The bloody Siege of Krishnapur in 1857 is the pivot around which the action revolves in this Booker Award-winning novel by J. G. Farrell, but Farrell's focus is less on Krishnapur and the siege than it is on the attitudes and beliefs of the English colonizers who made that siege an inevitability. He puts these empire-builders under the microscope, then skewers their arrogant and superior attitudes with the rapier of his wit, subjecting them to satire and juxtaposing them and their narrowly focused lives against the realities of the world around them.<br /><br />Remarkably, he does this with enough subtlety that we can recognize his characters as individuals, rather than total stereotypes, at the same time that we see their absurdity and recognize the damage they have done in their zeal to spread their \\"superior\\" culture.<br /><br />From the opening pages, Farrell builds suspense as the English colony ignores reports of unrest in Barrackpur, Berhampur, and Meerut. The flirtations of the single women, the amorous attentions of the young men, the boorish and insensitive behavior of the officials, the gossipy whispering of their wives, and the unrelenting efforts to maintain the same society they enjoyed at home--with tea parties, poetry readings, and dances--all attest to their degree of isolation from the world around them.<br /><br />When violence breaks out in Krishnapur and all the inhabitants take refuge in the colonial Residence, Farrell turns it into a microcosm which illuminates their misplaced values and goals as they interact with each other and face dangers from without--and from within. The siege continues for more than three months, with bloodshed, disease, starvation, lack of water and medicine, and the summer weather taking their toll.<br /><br />Farrell's dark humor is unparalleled. Using irony, understatement, and a sense of the absurd, he conveys his disapproval of colonialism without resorting to the harshness of polemics. By concentrating exclusively on the English in the Residence and not on India's local population (ironically reflecting the approach of the colonizers themselves), he makes their behavior appear ridiculous in its own right, rather than ridiculous in comparison to other cultures. Mr. Rayne, the Opium Agent, calls the sale of opium, \\"progress.\\" The Padre cannot understand why the Bible was originally written in an obscure language like Hebrew, rather than English, which is \\"spoken in every corner of every continent.\\" A dying man offering up his last, heartfelt prayer is told by the Magistrate, \\"Yes, yes, to be sure, don't worry about it.\\" The heads from a collection of small sculptures of the \\"great minds of Europe\\" are used as deadly explosives when shot becomes scarce.<br /><br />Through his precise imagery, his acute eye for memorable and revealing details, his unerring ear for dialogue, his ability to maintain pace and suspense, and his humor, Farrell creates a historical novel with the enduring qualities which make it as relevant today as it was when published thirty years ago.

Seeing himself as a \\"panther in the basement,\\" much like Tyrone Power in a favorite old film, Proffi, the 12-year-old son of activist parents in Jerusalem in 1947, is a member of an \\"underground cell\\" which he and two friends have formed. Their objective, like that of their parents, is the ouster of the British, who have been mandated by the UN to set up a Jewish homeland. Though the children enjoy \\"spying\\" and see themselves as glorious heroes, their plans of attack are distinctly childish.<br /><br />When Proffi finds himself drawn to Sgt. Stephen Dunlop, a gentle, shy British soldier from Canterbury, who wants to learn Hebrew and to teach Proffi English, Proffi justifies this friendship as his chance to probe for information for his own \\"secret DOD agency.\\" Declared by his friends Ben Hur and Chita Reznik to be a \\"lowdown traitor\\" when this relationship is discovered, Proffi feels isolated, at a crossroads in his life.<br /><br />Jerusalem is under constant curfews, the British are searching houses for weapons, his parents are involved in an underground movement, and he himself is beginning to become interested in girls--at least in Yardena, the nineteen-year-old sister of Ben Hur. As we come to know her, the people of the neighborhood, and the people important to Proffi, such as Mr. Gihon, his teacher, we see Proffi's knowledge and insights to be those of a twelve-year-old child whose belief in a bright future is absolute.<br /><br />The powerful, often poetic language of this coming-of-age novel, along with its lively humor and warm understanding of human nature, make this an unforgettable novel of great universality. Told by an adult narrator who accurately captures Proffi's youthful viewpoint, the novel paints a picture of a loving, scholarly family seeking peace and knowledge, even as they actively try to expel \\"perfidious Albion.\\" As we watch their interchanges with each other, with Proffi, and with British soldiers, we see them as decent people who want to be left in peace in a homeland of their own, to recover from the traumas of the Holocaust.<br /><br />Filled with gorgeous sense impressions and images (the description of the father's library is stunning), the novel draws in the reader with its contagious warmth and good humor. Written by one of Israel's most highly regarded novelists, this short novel is an eloquent and elegant testament to enduring values.

Telling the true story of James Hazen Hyde, a glamorous young man who was majority shareholder of Equitable Life Assurance Society from 1899 - 1905, Patricia Beard gives a close-up view of the turn-of-the-century Gilded Age, with all its excesses.  Upon the death of Henry Baldwin Hyde, who founded and ran Equitable, his son James, a recent graduate of Harvard, succeeded to the Board.  Under the terms of his father's will, a regent would oversee his participation in the company until he was thirty, at which point he would take over.<br /><br />His regent and \\"mentor,\\" a friend of his father, was James W. Alexander, who had engaged in some questionable deals with Henry Hyde.  More interested in protecting his own wealth and interests than in guiding James, Alexander, aided by other self-interested Board members, put James on forty-eight different boards, persuaded him to invest company funds in a variety of projects, and generally kept him in the dark.  Because Equitable was formed by private investors who became shareholders, and was not a \\"mutualized\\" company, Board members could reap huge profits from the company's investments while avoiding oversight.<br /><br />In 1905, when he was twenty-eight years old, the attractive James, a much-sought-after socialite, gave a huge ball, modeled after an event at Versailles, which cost him $100,000.  James Alexander and other Board members, fearing young James's takeover of power in two years, used this party to accuse James of illegally using company funds.  Throughout the many legal investigations which ensued, James behaved honorably as his father's \\"friends\\" destroyed his reputation to save their own.<br /><br />As a portrait of the Gilded Age and the venality of some of its wealthiest men, the book is fascinating.  The financial complexities are difficult to follow, however, and the assorted characters, including, unfortunately, James Hyde himself, never really come alive.  James was only twenty-three when he became embroiled in Equitable and twenty-eight when he sold out and moved permanently to France. Too young and too much a victim to be intrinsically interesting, he is a cipher who reveals nothing about his inner self.  Lacking a clear focus, the author devotes considerable research to the peripheral characters, their lifestyles, and marriages, even devoting pages to James's son, who was not born until long after the events at Equitable.  More interested in lifestyles than financial dealings, the author misses the chance to draw meaningful lessons from the financial crisis at Equitable in 1905.

He was a sculptor, not a painter, and Pope Julius II had angered him by postponing his commission to build the Pope's tomb after Michelangelo had bought all the marble.<br /><br />Unpracticed in the difficult technique of fresco, he accepted the commission reluctantly. Illustrating stories from Genesis in the brightest and most costly pigments available, he created powerful visions of a terrifying and vengeful God in twelve panels, which depict stories of crime and punishment, prophets crying in the wilderness, and doomed sinners facing hanging, beheading, flood, and plague.<br /><br />Halfway through his commission, Michelangelo decided that his earliest, most tumultuous panels were too \\"busy,\\" with too many figures painted too small, and he changed his style significantly. Beginning with the famous Creation of Adam, he painted simpler, more powerful designs with larger figures, dramatically foreshortening and contorting them. God, who appears fully robed in classical attire in the early panels, becomes far more vigorous, muscular, and \\"human\\" in the later panels, appearing with his chest bare, his poses contorted and foreshortened. Eventually, he appears to \\"tumble down\\" toward the viewer from the ceiling.<br /><br />Full of fascinating, memorable details, King's text tells how Michelangelo constructed the scaffold for the fresco (which did not require him to lie on his back), how his first panel was ruined by the build-up of salts and efflorescence and six weeks' labor had to be laboriously chipped away, how a child in one panel is \\"making the fig\\"\\" (an obscene gesture), and how the fingers of God and Adam at the Creation are not the work of Michelangelo or of his assistants but complete restorations. A helpful \\"map\\" of the ceiling allows the reader to locate particular details, though the colored pictures of the ceiling itself, reproduced almost in its entirety, are extremely small.<br /><br />When the ceiling was completed in 1512, the world was dumbstruck, according to Vasari, and Michelangelo's figures were said to surpass those of the ancient Greeks. Never before had the human form been used with such \\"astonishing invention and aplomb...or with the brute force of Michelangelo's naked titans.\\" Writing with enthusiasm and insight, in addition to careful scholarship, King tells the intriguing human story of this artwork, which is as fresh and relevant today as it was when it was painted almost six hundred years ago.

When it came to dealing with people, Dian Fossey was sometimes her own worst enemy, but her dedication to saving the African mountain gorilla and its habitat in Rwanda is indisputable.  Describing himself as an \\"editorial collaborator,\\" rather than as a biographer, Farley Mowat assembles Fossey's story from her never-before-printed journals and private papers, inserting them directly into the book in boldface so she can tell her own story.  From her founding of the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda in 1967, until her murder there in December, 1985, Fossey battled to save \\"those she loved\\" from poaching, abduction, and dismemberment.<br /><br />Throughout her eighteen years at Karisoke, Fossey studied organized groups of gorillas to whom she became so familiar that they would even touch her.  As fierce and protective of her own \\"turf\\" as a silverback, however, she refused to bend to the exigencies of the political climate and funding requirements and made innumerable enemies.  When local herdsmen exerted their age-old rights to graze cattle on \\"her\\" mountain, Fossey shot the cattle.  When poachers hurt her gorillas, she pursued them, even kidnapping the four-year-old son of one of them to force his surrender.

She battled conservation organizations which wanted to get her funds, rival researchers who wanted to take over her project, and governmental officials who saw tourism in the park as a source of wealth and graft.

An extended Anglo-Irish family living in the vicinity of Dublin on the eve of the Easter Rebellion of 1916 reflects the attitudes and pressures that lead eventually to the cataclysmic events at the Dublin Post Office.  Andrew Chase-White, a young officer in the British Cavalry, has been assigned to Dublin, where he has often spent holidays with his extended family and where he has an almost-fiancee.  His idolized cousin Patrick Dumay, \\"the iron man,\\" is secretly a member of the Irish Volunteers and an admirer of Padraig Pearse.  His teenaged cousin, hot-headed Cathal, supports the Citizen's Army under James Connolly.<br /><br />As the action unfolds throughout the week leading to the uprising, the family interacts on several levels, revealing their mores, their dreams for the future of Ireland, their occasional tendency to look for religious significance in political destiny, and their personal hopes and failings.  The story of Andrew's chaste courtship of Frances Bellman is thrown into sharp relief through the character of Millicent Kinnard, Andrew's aunt, a flamboyant and overtly sexual woman.<br /><br />Millie has tempted one relative into abandoning his priestly calling, persuaded another to propose marriage to her as a way of solving her financial problems, and worked her wiles on her chaste young nephews, a generation or more younger than she is.  Since she has a peripheral role in the rebellion, Millie, in the absence of a single main character, connects the older and younger generations both socially and politically, acting as a linchpin of the action.<br /><br />Murdoch's stunning ability to choose precisely the right word or phrase leads to memorable descriptions which enliven the story and bring the large cast of characters to life.  Andrew, for example, possesses \\"plodding conscientiousness,\\" in place of courage.  An elderly man's legs are like \\"solidified paste, rigidly tubular yet without significant shape or color.\\"  Physical love is regarded by one person as \\"the triumph of his will over his fastidious mind.\\"<br /><br />Murdoch's eccentric characters combine with her sense of irony to create absurdities that are filled with dark humor, and in one memorable scene, the procession in and out of Millie's boudoir (which also serves as a shooting gallery) resembles a slapstick film.

When John Proctor says these words to his wife Elizabeth at the conclusion of this play, he has faced accusations of being in league with the Devil and is ready to face consequences meted out by the religious tribunal he has faced. Though he has sinned by committing adultery with Abigail Williams, he believes the witchcraft trials which have ultimately consumed him to be the result of human, rather than godly, forces. Playwright Arthur Miller sets the scene for this action in an Overture explaining the theocracy which controlled Salem. Powerful clergymen, some more rigid in their interpretations of Scripture than others, \\"protected\\" citizens by enforcing conformity with the church's teachings.<br /><br />Through detailed character sketches inserted into the structure of the play, Miller broadens the realism, and when a group of hysterical young women makes accusations of witchcraft, resulting ultimately in the deaths of nineteen of their fellow-citizens, Miller has prepared his audience to accept the trials and the behavior of the characters as plausible. His straightforward prose, use of homely details, and simple sentence structure (despite its archaic tone) further add to the realism. When the affair between John Proctor and Abigail Williams, who precipitates and then promotes the hysteria among the young \\"afflicted\\" girls, is revealed within the play, the modern reader is given a \\"hook\\" with which to identify with characters and situations which might otherwise feel foreign.<br /><br />Miller's play is a powerful revelation of themes involving mass hysteria, fear of the unknown, and a belief in the essential evil hidden within the hearts of men. As the accused are required to prove their innocence, questions regarding the role of individualism within this society, its intolerance of differences, its justice as defined by the state and by clergymen who differ, and the hysteria which grows from repression all surface within the dramatic action, leading to an intensity of feeling rare in modern theater. When John Proctor is faced with a choice of telling the truth and being sentenced to death or lying and being saved, the ironies of the play are fully revealed.<br /><br />Written in 1952, slightly before the McCarthy era, Miller's depiction of these trials presages the McCarthy hearings and illustrates his belief that the fear of Communism is the equivalent of fear of the Devil in colonial times. Miller, however, has selected facts which illustrate his point of view and his themes, making no pretense of accuracy regarding the witchcraft trials themselves. In reality, Abigail Williams was eleven, and John Proctor was sixty, quite different from the dramatic circumstances here. Mary Whipplesity of feeling rare in modern theater.

Gleefully combining the raucous humor of absurdity with slyly subtle wordplay and caustic satire, Greene entertains on every level, poking fun at British intelligence-gathering services during the Cold War. Setting the novel in the flamboyant atmosphere of pre-revolutionary Havana, where virtually anything can be had at a price, Greene establishes his contrasts and ironies early, creating a hilarious set piece which satirizes both the British government's never-satisfied desire for secrets about foreign political movements and their belief that the most banal of activities constitute threats to national security.<br /><br />Ex-patriot James Wormold is a mild-mannered, marginal businessman and vacuum cleaner salesman, whose spoiled teenage daughter sees herself as part of the equestrian and country club set. Approached by MI6 in a public restroom, Wormold finds himself unwillingly recruited to be \\"our man in Havana,\\" a role which will reward him handsomely for information and allow him some much-needed financial breathing room.<br /><br />Encouraged to recruit other agents to provide more information (and earn even more money), he chooses names at random from the country club membership list and fabricates personas for them, featuring them in fictionalized little dramas which he churns out and forwards to his \\"handlers.\\" Always careful to fulfill their expectations exactly, Wormold becomes a more and more important \\"spy,\\" his stories become more creative, his \\"enemies\\" find him and his \\"agents\\" to be dangerous, and his friends and the real people whose names were used as fictional agents begin to turn up dead.<br /><br />Skewering British intelligence for being such willing dupes of a vacuum cleaner salesman who never wanted to be an agent in the first place, Greene betrays both his familiarity with the inner workings of the intelligence service, of which he was once a member, and his rejection of Cold War politics. In a conclusion which will satisfy everyone who has ever become impatient with political maneuvering, Greene carries the absurdities of power to their limits, orchestrating a grand finale which shows British politicians at their most venal--and most ridiculous.

From the beginning of the series, Gill has experimented with his characters and plots in an effort to find his m&eacute;tier, gradually increasing his character development, narrowing down his settings by making them more \\"Irish,\\" and developing increasingly complex plots.  This novel, his fourth, unlike its two immediate predecessors (McGarr on the Cliffs of Moher, set largely in New York, and McGarr and the Sienese Conspiracy, set in  Italy), is located entirely in Ireland, with all the action connected with the Dublin Horse Show.  While the plot is complex, the characters are not, and the charming humor of later novels, such as Death of a Joyce Scholar, the eighth in the series, is absent.<br /><br />Many threads develop simultaneously and go in different directions.  An enormously talented young girl, Mairead Caughey, wants to become a concert pianist.  Her mother, the murder victim, is the sister of an IRA member on the run, and both of them have lost their land to a greedy neighbor.  Mairead's boyfriend, the son of a newly rich member of the Irish Dial, is a drug addict who may be involved in local burglaries.  A major horse dealer, paralyzed in an accident, has staked much of his reputation on the success of his horses in the Dublin show, and his wife is slated to ride the horse which paralyzed him.  A priest seems to have more than a passing interest in Mairead, and Mairead herself may not be who she appears to be.<br /><br />To develop all these threads, Gill introduces innumerable characters, some of whom are connected to just one thread, and some of whom overlap.  Because they are not developed, except superficially, their motivations are not always clear, nor are the reasons the action moves in the direction that it does.  McGarr, McKeon, O'Shaughnessy, McGarr's wife Noreen, Ruthie Bresnahan, Hugh Ward, and the rest of the detective division of the Garda Soichana all make their appearances, but their characters remain static, since they appear only as police officers and not as developing characters.<br /><br />A pure police procedural, the novel lacks the quirky characters of later novels and the very funny scenes that evolve from their interactions.  The plot here, though complex and broad, is not very tight, the suspense diffused among too many plot lines.

The Amazing Mantecon Brothers Circus, a down-at-the-heels roadshow of freaks, failures, and outcasts, dissolves after its arrival at an abandoned Mexican town. Eight performers and one of the brothers remain behind to \\"settle\\" the town and create a home, while the majority continue their haphazard journey through the hinterlands. For the settlers, \\"A bunch of empty houses was a greater temptation than a life filled with applause...\\" In this unique \\"utopia,\\" which they name Santa Maria of the Circus, the \\"essential\\" jobs for the community are assigned by lot. The midget, for example, becomes the priest (saying \\"The hell with it,\\" when he can't remember the Mass),  the bearded lady is the surgeon, the strongman is the \\"puta,\\" assigned to a house on the outskirts of town, and the youthful contortionist is \\"the Negro,\\" the scapegoat for all.<br /><br />With no water, no food, no clocks, and no mirrors, the characters in Santa Maria confront, often humorously, the very essence of life and survival. Toscano uses his wild cast to comment on the world at large, revealing man's innate longings and fears, his need to belong, and the sadness of being different. As Nathaniel, the one-eyed midget, says, \\"If it weren't for my height, no one would know I'm a midget.\\" Gentle satire, whimsy, black humor, subtle and not-so-subtle word pictures, and consummate irony combine with sensitive description and poignant observations by these characters about the world as they, and, presumably, we find it.<br /><br />Despite the book's warmth and whimsy, however, the overriding belief that \\"chance is God\\" pervades this narrative, leading ultimately to an extremely dark and very depressing conclusion, one which came as a huge letdown to me. Though life is not all fun and games, and many problems exist both in society and in human relationships, these characters are survivors in the very weird circus of their lives, despite the curves that chance has thrown them. The ending is consistent with the theme that \\"chance is God,\\" but I felt it was not consistent with the overall tone of the book, even when that tone became darker and less playful.

With her usual precision, Colegate here focuses on \\"deceits of time,\\" those deliberate little falsehoods that all of us, over time, create and eventually accept as truth because they allow us to smooth over unpleasant events in our lives and assuage any guilt we may have about them. In creating personal deceits, we adjust our pasts--our personal histories--so that they are more palatable and easier to cope with. Ultimately, most of us try to convince others to accept these little falsehoods as the truth.<br /><br />Colegate, a writer of the utmost exactitude, wants the whole truth laid bare, and in this remarkable novel she requires each of her characters to face reality in order to come to new understandings.  Catherine Hillery, a widow in her fifties, is hired by a solicitor for the Campion family to write the definitive biography of Neil Campion, a young Member of Parliament, a World War II pilot, and a man with an idealistic vision of what society could become. Neil died in 1941 in a car crash on his way north toward Scotland, his reasons for that trip unknown, and Catherine is not sure why she, rather than someone more famous, has been chosen to write his biography.<br /><br />Determined to find out the truth about her subject and not merely reflect what the family wants her to say, she intends to get all the facts. As we come to understand Neil's family--his brother and sister, his wife, and his grandson--we also become acquainted with Catherine, her two sons, and their wives. All, including Catherine, are hiding from some truth.<br /><br />As is characteristic of Colegate, this novel is a marvel of compression, with individual scenes casting light on Neil Campion, one or more of his relatives, and Catherine, all at the same time. Colegate's sparkling dialogue conveys attitude, class, prejudices, and personality, while also revealing plot and the deceits each character insists on maintaining. Parallels among characters and between the Campion family and Catherine expand the scope and give added power to the message, and the irony which occurs at the end is both darkly humorous and memorable.

Tolstoy's novella entitled \\"The Kreutzer Sonata\\" inspired composer Leos Janacek to write his Kreutzer Sonata for strings, years later, and that, in turn, inspired Margriet de Moor to create this novella.  In Tolstoy's story, a man on a train tells another passenger the story of how and why he murdered his wife.  The man and his wife were both musicians, and the husband, insanely jealous, believed she was having an affair with another musician.<br /><br />Adapting Tolstoy's passionate and violent story, de Moor introduces an unnamed narrator, a musicologist, who meets Marius Van Vlooten, a blind music critic, at an airport as they are both leaving for International String Quartet Week in Bordeaux.  While there, the narrator introduces Suzanna Flier, the beautiful first violinist of the Schulhoff Quartet to Van Vlooten, whose previous relationship was so passionate that Van Vlooten blinded himself in a failed suicide attempt when his lover left him.  Suzanna Flier's quartet has been practicing Janacek's Kreutzer Sonata, \\"a fatal psychological drama that no earthly power could bring to a halt.\\"  Soon Suzanna and Van Vlooten are engaged in a torrid affair.<br /><br />Ten years later, the narrator sees Van Vlooten again at an airport, and, through flashbacks, Van Vlooten tells the narrator the story of his marriage to Suzanna, which was marred by his uncontrollable jealousy.  Sixteen years after this meeting, the narrator, on his way to Amsterdam learns the conclusion of the story.<br /><br />Author de Moor's tautly constructed and romantic story explores the relationship of Suzanna Flier and Marius Van Vlooten.  Symbols (butterflies, water), like musical motifs in a sonata, abound in the novel.  In crystalline prose, de Moor selects details which reveal the point of view of a man dependent upon sound, instead of sight--\\"Trees are only trees as long as the wind blows.\\" As he creates Van Vlooten's life with Suzanna, the reader alternately sympathizes with Van Vlooten and becomes angry with him because he uses his need for consistency as a means of control.<br /><br />De Moor does an admirable job of giving an old story a new twist, and her conclusion is surprising.  Romantic in that the action is often implausible and carried to extremes, the novel is nevertheless fascinating reading.  De Moor is so observant of details and conveys them so perceptively that the reader cannot help but feel that s/he is learning something new--about the blind, about musicians, and about lovers as they interpret their worlds.

Hilariously funny and very touching, this five-character play by David Storey introduces two proud men who meet and talk in the garden of what appears, at first, to be some sort of assisted living facility. Well-spoken Jack and dapper Harry, dressed in jackets and ties and carrying a cane and gloves, are clearly men of some status as they meet and make small talk--about the news, the clouds, varieties of chrysanthemums, the possibility that Vale Evesham is the Garden of Eden, and the fact that their wives are not going to be visiting that day.<br /><br />Two raucous and uninhibited women take their places in the garden when the men  go off for a walk, completely destroying the buttoned-up mood with their hilarity and satire. Kathleen and Marjorie are obviously from a completely different social background from the men, with casual attitudes towards clothing and hygiene, bawdy humor, and a willingness to say absolutely anything. The women joke about having had shoelaces and belts removed and to being \\"committed,\\" one for the second time, ironically changing our view of Jack and Harry, who they really are, and why they may be in this residential facility.<br /><br />The meeting of the men and the women in the garden after lunch reveals their touching need to communicate, even when they have so little in common. The men stay true to their class and upbringing and the women true to their own backgrounds, but all get teary at various times, and as these people try to help each other, despite their social differences, the universal need for companionship and understanding is highlighted. As the characters begin to confuse their stories, the viewer becomes aware that despite our hopes, the characters probably belong where they are.<br /><br />Winner of the Booker Prize for his novel Saville, David Storey won the New York Critics Best Play of the Year Award for this play in 1970.  The play is breath-taking, and the characters are flawless, feeding off each other to make the play come alive.

Go into town and declare that I am here"	Escaping in 1756, after sixteen months in a Venice jail, Giacomo Casanova, \\"all seven deadly sins in one accursed body,\\" arrives in Bolzano, where the Doge and the Inquisition cannot reach him.  Seeing himself as \\"that rare creature, a writer with a life to write about,\\" he and a defrocked priest, Balbi, move into a hotel, not far from where the Duke of Parma and his young bride Francesca reside.  Casanova was wounded by the duke in a duel over Francesca three years before and has promised never to see her again.  When the Duke arrives at Casanova's hotel with a letter from Francesca, asking to see him, the stage is set for the action and a surprising ending.<br /><br />This is the second of Hungarian author Marai's \\"lost masterpieces\\" to be \\"discovered\\" and published recently in English, and it bears some structural similarities to Embers, his previous novel.  Like Embers, the action takes place largely in one room, where an assertive narrator comments on his life, his rationalizations for his actions, his beliefs, and his future.  Observant of even the smallest details about people, the author is far more romantic in his descriptions here, as befits a novel about Casanova, piling up detail upon detail in a narrative which sounds, in places, almost like the grand chorus of an opera (with one incredible sentence consisting of over three hundred words).<br /><br />As the author catalogues the response of the citizenry of Europe to news of Cazanova's escape, the glories and cruelties of Venice, the enthusiastic reaction of the citizens of Bolzano to the \\"surgeries\\" Casanova holds each afternoon to discuss love, and the details of Cazanova's life, he sets the scene for the action which takes place in the second half of the novel.  The arrival of the Duke with Francesca's letter, his \\"deconstruction\\" of the letter, and the solution the duke proposes to Cazanova set up a morality tale in which Casanova must evaluate his life, his feelings for Francesca, and his definition of love.<br /><br />Witty and delightful to read, the novel raises thoughtful questions about love and responsibility, but in its details it is not as fully integrated as Embers.  The story seems overloaded with heavy descriptions in the first half, lacking the action and, more importantly, the characters' interactions which make the second half so enjoyable and the ironies of the ending so memorable.

Using a real literary fraud from Australia as the basis for his main plot, Carey introduces the reader to Lady Sarah Wode-Douglass, the editor of a small English poetry magazine, always on the verge of financial collapse. Persuaded by John Slater, a poet and friend of her deceased parents, to accompany him from England to Kuala Lumpur in 1972, she is recollecting her encounter there with Christopher Chubb, a refugee from Australia where he had, in the 1940s, perpetrated a major literary hoax, designed to protest the trends in modern poetry. Chubb had written and succeeded in getting published a series of \\"poems,\\" supposedly by a man named McCorkle.<br /><br />The fraud, which took place in the 1940s, is told in flashbacks from the 1972 trip, mainly by Lady Sarah and Chubb. Its wry humor and social commentary are fun to read, with Chubb mocking the state of literary awareness in Australia at that time and providing information about the obscenity trial which resulted from his hoax. When Chubb cleverly shows her one page from another work by \\"McCorkle,\\" Sarah sees it as a masterpiece akin to \\"The Wasteland,\\" and tries to obtain the whole manuscript, the publication of which would save her magazine. Sarah's life in 1983, and shocking revelations by John Slater about Sarah's parents, their marriage, and her mother's death in the late 1930's widen the focus and time frame. The reader quickly recognizes, as all the characters play their parts and the story develops, that all are guilty of some sort of fakery.<br /><br />The second half of the book, however, becomes a wild, often wacky adventure story as separate new plots develop, the time frame changes to World War II, and several new characters, unrelated to the main plot, tell their own stories. Sarah and Slater play no real role in the action as Chubb tries to rescue his daughter from a suddenly real, seven-foot-tall McCorkle, who has kidnapped her and run from island to island in Indonesia and Malaysia, where the Japanese have invaded and have begun vividly described atrocities.<br /><br />Separate, virtually unconnected plots in four time frames--1983, 1939, 1972, and World War II--revealed by four or five different narrators, in settings that include England, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Australia all contribute to a confusion of focus. The characters, events, and plot line from the beginning of the book have little if any overlap with the characters, events, and plots in the middle.

Minnie, Seumas, and the other residents of the tenement all side with the rebels, and while Donal never says that he is with the IRA, neither does he work very hard to convince the residents otherwise.<br /><br />Seumas, on the other hand, is actively involved with the rebels, using his work as a peddler of second-hand goods to make connections and carry information.

During a disturbance that night, Minnie takes a bag of bombs, left under the bed by one of Seumas's friends, into her own room to protect Donal, to whom she is attracted, only to face the police in a raid.<br /><br />The first of Sean O'Casey's \\"Dublin Trilogy\\" to be produced (followed by Juno and the Paycock in 1924 and The Plough and the Stars in 1926), this 1923 play is the work of a gifted but still inexperienced playwright.  Walking the tight line between the absurd/satiric and the violent/tragic, the play has lovely dialogue but relatively little action onstage.  Visitors come and go in Shields's tenement room, but most of the play consists of witty remarks, poetic commentary, and the dialogue of daily life--until gunfire breaks out in the street.<br /><br />O'Casey establishes obvious contrasts between the poetry of Davoren and the grim reality of the \\"revolution,\\" between the elegantly poetic statements of the always-sleepy Shields and the brutality of the police, between the love which Minnie offers and the political hatreds which dominate their lives, and between the men who engage in the chess game of rebellion and the women who often make the sacrifices.

Contemplating her old age and approaching death, elderly Mrs. Monro reflects upon the irony that it is the skeleton which is revealed by death while the cupboard of one's life, with all its memories and experiences, is absorbed by the earth and disappears forever.  In this fascinating novel, however, there are many other \\"skeletons.\\"  Every character, including the serious and thoughtful Mrs. Monro, is hiding some aspect of the past from others, and it is these skeletons from the past which support the structure of the book and determine the present action, the forthcoming marriage of Mrs. Monro's son Syl, a single man in his late forties, to Margaret, a young woman barely in her twenties.<br /><br />Mrs. Monro recognizes that Margaret does not love Syl and may, in fact, loathe him, but since she herself had reason to marry someone she did not love, she does not condemn.  Instead, she empathizes silently with the bride, without understanding why she is going through with the wedding.  Eventually, she reveals her own past skeletons and her heartbreaking past, and when her son's \\"skeletons\\" are revealed, it is no surprise that several fianc&eacute;es have cancelled previously scheduled weddings.<br /><br />The bride's father, divorced from her mother, has a horrifying secret, and Lili, one of the wedding guests, an acquaintance of both Mrs. Monro and the bride's mother from their days in Egypt during the Empire, has several secrets of her own.  As the date for the wedding approaches, all the skeletons come out of the cupboard with both humorous and poignant effects.<br /><br />This is one of Ellis's more thoughtful novels, dealing with Mrs. Monro's intelligent and sensitive reflections on love and sex, God and sin, and life and death, both as these subjects have affected her own life and as they seem to be occupying the other characters in the novel.  Grounded in reality, eminently practical, and honest in her assessments, Mrs. Monro is a contrast to the bride's mother and the younger characters, all of whom refuse to come to grips with the past.  Darker and more philosophical than many of Ellis's other novels, the novel, though short, stands on its own, offering insights into this aging woman, her difficult life, the compromises she has made, and their ultimate significance.

Often regarded as Conrad's masterwork, Nostromo is also Conrad's darkest novel, filled with betrayals at all levels and offering little hope for man's redemption. A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins. All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them. Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.<br /><br />When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits. Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work. Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.<br /><br />In contrast to these \\"unrealized\\" humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences. Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word. Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself. Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia spends her time helping others.<br /><br />When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, Conrad provides a bleak commentary on idealism and human nature. The conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, reveals Conrad's darkest self and offers little hope of change and even less hope for man's redemption. Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

Deftly juggling four separate plot lines, Michael Gruber's challenging mystery focuses on Emmy Lou Dideroff, a woman with a checkered past, who has been a postulant in a religious nursing order.  Found in the Miami hotel room of a Sudanese oil merchant who has just been pushed out of a tenth floor window, Emily is talking earnestly  with St. Catherine of Siena when the police arrive, willing to confess to a murder of which she may be innocent because \\"it would be an honor to be executed unjustly, like Jesus.\\"<br /><br />Tito Morales, the first officer on the scene, soon becomes the partner of Iago Xavier (Jimmy) Paz, another Cuban-American police officer and a main character in Gruber's previous novel, Tropic of Night.  Their relationship with Major Oliphant, formerly with the FBI, and with other federal agencies, as the investigation unfolds, constitutes another subplot, as roadblocks are constantly erected by both the Department of Justice and the FBI.<br /><br />Lorna Wise, the psychologist in charge of Emmy Lou's competency hearing, becomes her therapist/advocate, and it is to Lorna that Emmy Lou's \\"confession\\" in a series of notebooks is addressed.  Though Lorna herself is not religious, she feels an inexplicable connection to Emmy Lou, and the reader soon discovers that Lorna has problems of her own.  Throughout the novel, historical information is interjected about the Nursing Sisters of The Blood of Christ, the religious order in which Emmu Lou Dideroff was a postulant, and about its founder, Marie-Ange de Berville.<br /><br />As the investigation moves from Miami to the Sudan, Gruber provides detailed information about the anthropology of the Dinka tribe in Sudan, the ethnographic conflicts which have threatened them with extinction, their powers of magic and sorcery, and the mystical connections they have with their surroundings, calling into play issues far greater than those of the local murder investigation.<br /><br />Gruber keeps the reader interested, not only in the story but in the unfolding characterizations and interrelationships of his offbeat characters.  By withholding key information about them, the author keeps the interest high, further ratcheting up the suspense through the complexities of the plot, with its increasing mayhem.

South Africa from 1968 - 2000 is revealed in all its cultural variety and internal stresses through the life story of Paul Sweetbread, an overweight Jewish boy who is an outsider to everyone.  Neither a Boer nor an Englishman, he is also not really a Jew, since his family has never been observant, leaving him without any common roots that connect him to his Caucasian countrymen.  A person with a photographic memory, he is, from the outset, a victim of his memory.  Because he can quote from his schoolbooks exactly, teachers think he cheats;  his fellow students torment him.<br /><br />As he sets the scene and creates a fully drawn personality for Paul, the author recreates his early school and home life, his relationships with black servants, and his family history, including the death of his father.  The action intensifies when Paul, having finished school in 1987, joins the South African Defense Force for two years, instead of going to college.  South Africa is nervously protecting its borders against what it believes are communist insurgents, while also facing threats from within.  Apartheid has been challenged, the British and Boers are at odds, and African nationalism is growing.<br /><br />Paul's wartime experiences, recreated in stunning detail, further develop his character as he observes Captain Lyddie, \\"The perfect specimen of South African manhood,\\" engaging in racial brutality, described in passages of great power which embed themselves in Paul's perfect memory and in the reader's.  The battle for survival of South Africa and the changes which will be necessary as the country changes from white to black rule are ever at the forefront of the novel.  Paul's empathy for the Bushmen, whom the SADF uses as trackers, is palpable, while his fear, engendered during a photo assignment in a black township, reflects his awareness of the dangers from within.<br /><br />Thoughtful and challenging but filled with wry humor, Eprile's novel presents events from Paul Sweetbread's life slowly, sometimes deliberately omitting important information in order to maintain suspense and let the reader come to know Paul through his life and actions, rather than through background information.  He creates a sympathetic picture of an extremely sensitive young man who finds himself in impossible situations which mark him for life.  His philosophical musings near the end of the book about memory and metaphor raise important questions about society and national \\"memory,\\" how a country constructs its memories of the past in order to make it acceptable, and careful readers will savor the language and sheer intelligence of Eprile's observations.

When Hedwig Kessler marries her shy and diminutive first cousin Dagobert, known as Berti, she plans never to leave the substantial German villa which her family has occupied for generations--until the Nazis come to power.  Escaping to London with Berti, the imperious, Valkyrian Hedwig totes the family history along with her in boxes, arriving at the doorstep of her cousin Harry Eisenstein, where she promptly takes over.<br /><br />Steadfastly refusing to believe that the situation in Germany is as bad it really is, Hedwig keeps the family afloat by selling items from the family boxes when they need cash.  When she visits Germany after the war, she finds that \\"every Kessler she sought was gone.  She had lost the flavors of her past,\\" except for what she has saved herself.  When her strange, dark, and hairy daughter Gerda is born, Hedwig pays little attention to her.<br /><br />Disregarding the conventions of plot, Frieda Arkin creates unusual and oddly intriguing characters, who seem to take control of the book, just as Hedwig takes control of everyone's life.  Gerda, always at odds with her mother, is a ferocious child who quickly develops a passion for the piano and eventually becomes a prodigy, a \\"fury\\" who plays everything her own way.  Berti, so self-effacing that even the author finds little to say about his life, finds a job as a veterinarian's assistant, and Hedwig remains perpetually unhappy.<br /><br />The focus of the novel constantly shifts--first from Harry to Hedwig, and then either to Gerda, as she develops a musical career, or to Berti, shifting back and forth during thirty years.  The settings also change, as Hedwig uproots the family and moves from England to New York and then to Kansas, always toting her precious boxes, and always feeling isolated from the Kessler connections which have formed the basis of her life.  The constantly shifting perspectives parallel in many ways the dislocations of all emigrants as they move to new places and attempt to establish new lives.<br /><br />Filled with oddly charming characters, the novel is full of surprises and quirky humor.  Arkin never demeans her characters nor does she satirize them.  Instead, she shows the characters in action, the wry humor arising from their very human characteristics and the difficulties they have individually in dealing with themselves and their own worlds.

Danzig, a Polish city with German ties (and often under German control), became, officially, a Polish port after World War I.  One generation later, however, Hitler invaded Poland to reclaim the city.  The Russian offensive at the end of World War II drove the Germans out of Gdansk, at the same time that Poles living in the eastern territories came flooding back into the city.  Stefan Chwin, a much praised Polish novelist from Gdansk, for whom this is the first novel translated into English, focuses on Danzig/Gdansk as it adapts to the comings and goings of its changing citizenry during the tumult of 1945.<br /><br />Imbuing the city with the aura of a main character in his darkly impressionistic novel, Chwin shows that no matter who is officially in control, the city somehow survives, a permanent monument to the endurance of the communal spirit and the ability to adapt.  Meticulous descriptions of the smallest aspects of daily life--home furnishings, buildings, neighborhoods, and life at the port--turn the city into a living, breathing entity, battered by changes of fortune, perhaps, but still functioning and still providing a home to a changing population.<br /><br />The characters are finely drawn, unique beings with stories of their own, though many of these stories involve personal secrets which are not fully revealed, even to the reader.  Hanemann, a former lecturer at the Anatomy School, has been in love with a young woman who drowned, something that Hanemann discovers when he is asked to perform her autopsy.  Piotr, a young Polish boy who becomes the narrator, moves with his family into the empty apartment beneath Hanemann when the previous owners return to Germany.  They are joined by Hanka, a young Ukrainian woman, sometimes suicidal as a result of unspeakable atrocities she has apparently endured.  Later a mute child moves in.  Numerous parallels are drawn between characters, especially lovers, and their destinies and the city and its destiny, and suicide is a constant motif.<br /><br />Breath-taking in its language, its ability to create vibrant portraits of people and places, and its love and faith in the enduring qualities of the city itself, Death in Danzig is a fascinating, though unusual novel, one in which plot is far less important than the daily lives of those who inhabit it.  Leisurely in its development, the novel creates an impressionistic time capsule in which the city becomes the only constant.  Mary Whippleif.

Hally, unable to depend on his alcoholic father, now living in an institution, has always depended on Sam, the waiter, for guidance and knowledge about the real world. They share a long history in which Sam has been very much a father substitute for Hally, who has always shown him respect.<br /><br />Willie, the custodian, who also looks to Sam for guidance, plans to participate, along with Sam, in a ballroom dancing competition in two weeks. For them, dancing \\"is beautiful because that is what we want life [in South Africa] to be like.\\" In real life, however, \\"none of us knows the steps...we're bumping into each other all the time.\\" As the play progresses, the three men reminisce, talk about their ideas of what constitutes a great hero, and show their easy relationship with each other.<br /><br />A phone call announcing that Hally's father is being released from the hospital upsets the equilibrium, however. Hally, morose and worried about the future, fears that his father will once again destroy his world. Taking out his anger on Sam and Willie, he tears at their dreams regarding the dancing contest, mocking their goals and becoming cynical about what the contest means to them. As his frustration grows, Hally hurts them as he has been hurt by his father, demanding ultimately that both men call him \\"Master Harold.\\"<br /><br />Based on an incident in the life of the playwright, who was strongly opposed to the policies of apartheid which began in South Africa around 1948, this powerful and poignant drama casts Sam, a black man, as a person of vision and nobility. Hally, a young white man, chooses to exert power, instead of being human, and shows that he is a lesser man than either Sam or Willie.

Although these words refer to Teddy Brewster in this hilarious play by Joseph Kesselring, they could have applied equally to most of the other members of the Brewster household. Teddy thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt, always \\"charging\\" upstairs when he is not in the basement digging \\"locks for the Panama Canal.\\" His two elderly aunts, with whom he lives, also have their own bizarre secret, for which the hand-dug \\"locks\\" in the basement are employed to good effect.<br /><br />Jonathan, Teddy's \\"disagreeable\\" brother, who disappeared many years ago, returns during the play with secrets of his own. With his face altered by plastic surgery, he is accompanied by Dr. Einstein, with whom he plans to set up an operating room in the house so the doctor can give new faces to criminals. The only normal person in the family is Mortimer, a drama critic who hates plays, engaged to marry Elaine, the innocent daughter of the minister next door. Mortimer is particularly upset by Jonathan's return--\\"the most detestable, vicious, venomous form of animal life I ever knew.\\"<br /><br />The frantic action, the ironies, the comic routines, and the dramatic surprises all center around two bodies, hidden at various times in the window seat of the living room, and the reactions to them by the various people within the household. The local police, friends of Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha, stop by to chat, have coffee, and protect these \\"sweet\\" old ladies, often at the worst possible moments, while Mortimer tries to decide what to do about his strange family and the bodies in the house.<br /><br />Arsenic and Old Lace is such a strong play, with so many hilarious moments, that it is not surprising that this is a staple of local theaters and high school drama groups. Much of the play involves sight gags, contretemps, and weird characters behaving outrageously. Careful delivery of lines and subtlety of gesture are far less important here than the high- speed action, over-the-top characterizations, and split second timing of entrances and exits.

With warmth, gentle humor, irony, and repeating characters, Hassler's novels have always recreated the friendships and loyalties, along with the gossip, resentments, and long memories, which make life in Staggerford, Minnesota, a community activity.  In his latest offering, Hassler presents two novellas in very different tones.  The first, The Staggerford Murders, is a farce of the first order.  A letter appears in the Staggerford newspaper from Penny Jean Nichols, from Fresno, California, asking for information about her mother, Blanche Nichols, who disappeared from Staggerford nine years ago.  Her father had been murdered in front of the local movie theater at that time, and her mother disappeared without a trace.<br /><br />The \\"detectives\\" in this case are Grover, the 81-year-old desk clerk at the run-down Ransford Hotel, and his two friends, Dusty Luuya, a resident who is limited in his abilities, and Ollie Luuya, his nephew, a former derelict, now a born again preacher.  Unearthing a series of shocking allegations against Neddy Nichols and others, they, Penny Jean, and her husband are soon examining the man her mother married immediately after Neddy Nichols's murder.  Bizarre natural and accidental deaths, and a murder trial for the murder of a dead body are among the absurdities Hassler features, as he piles irony upon irony and twist upon twist, revealing the dark underbelly of humanity, even in Staggerford.<br /><br />\\"The Life and Death of Nancy Clancy's Nephew\\" is totally different in tone.  This sensitive character study focuses on W. D. Nestor, a seventy-two-year-old turkey farmer.  Through vivid word pictures, the life of W.D. unfolds, detailing his marriage to his wife Lucille while she was still in high school, their contented, but uncommunicative, marriage, and W.D.'s late-in-life befriending of a young boy, the poorest player on the local Little League team.  When he is eighty-two, he visits his Aunt Nancy, almost one hundred, and through this visit, shows the reader that this is the story of an old man assessing at his life just before his death.<br /><br />These two novellas, one hilariously funny and one sadly introspective, separately emphasize the two characteristics which make Hassler's novels so vibrant.  His characters are often humorous and always believable, their dialogue pitch perfect.  At the same time, Hassler details moments of touching sadness as he shows the high and low points in the lives of these ordinary men.  Sensitive, full of wry moments, and realistic in the vision of small-town America, Hassler's novels are among literary America's best kept secrets.

Harking to one of his favorite themes, Keane, one of Ireland's foremost dramatists, once again focuses his action on a character who is at odds with the law but in tune with the sentiment of his fellow farmers. Big Bull McCabe, a farmer whose nineteen-acre farm has no water, has leased four acres of poor land from Maggie Butler for five years, gradually developing it into prime grazing pasture by fertilizing it, fencing it, and pulling the thistles, to give his cows access to water. Now Maggie wants to sell the land to the highest bidder, and Bull, having invested his time and effort, believes that he has rights to the property. When an \\"imported land grabber\\" from England offers an unusually high price for the land, Bull, his son, and a friend decide to take justice into their own hands.<br /><br />The passion of local Kerry farmers for their land, and their consequent resentment of outsiders who threaten the land, take on particularly dark tones in this play. Bull, who seems to have sprung fully grown from the soil, believes that land has its own morality, that the laws which are imposed by \\"society\\" are irrelevant. He is willing to do whatever it takes to control the outcome. The other characters here are equally tied to the land, supporting Bull and adhering to a code of silence regarding his activities when the law and the local priest investigate the dispute.<br /><br />Starkly realistic, the play is simple in concept, but its revelations of the local Irish culture and the response of these Kerry farmers to outsiders and \\"the clan of the round collar\\" taps into the \\"us vs. them\\" dynamic of the disenfranchised everywhere. Bull is no more extreme in his temper and his desire to protect what is \\"his\\" than is Mick Flanagan, the pub keeper, who treats his constantly pregnant wife Maimie like property. Dark and powerful in the tension it establishes between the \\"law\\" and the men it is supposed to govern, the play is firmly rooted in the local culture, establishing Bull McCabe as one of Ireland's most famous characters.

Setting this monumental family saga in rural Gaomi, in northeast China, where he grew up, Mo Yan vividly portrays political and historical events--most of them bloody--over the course of the twentieth century, from the Boxer Rebellion through the Communist Revolution, the Japanese invasion, the Cultural Revolution, and the death of Mao. Jintong, the only son of Shangguan Lu, tells the story of his remarkable mother, his eight sisters, and their families as they live through these seminal events.<br /><br />Shangguan Lu's early marriage and domestic life unfolds through flashbacks. With an infertile husband, whose family beats and abuses her for failing to produce a son, she resorts to extreme measures, giving birth to eight daughters by eight different fathers before finally producing a male heir. The stories of the daughters and their marriages to men with varied political agendas reflect the history of twentieth century rural China, and its unconscionable atrocities, starvation, death from exposure, forced marches, and land seizures.<br /><br />Author Mo Yan, who lived through the major events depicted here, gives a thorough portrait of rural life during these historical crises. The author's style, while often exciting, is also brutally realistic. Precise physical descriptions help bring the culture and people to life, including the kind of clothing nursing mothers wear so they can feed their children in very cold weather, descriptions of the silent \\"snow market,\\" and facts and figures about the minimum amount of grain needed per person to keep farm workers alive for the harvest season. But the author also uses satire, wry comments, and black humor to criticize totalitarian governments and closed societies.<br /><br />Providing a helpful cast of characters at the beginning of this episodic novel, Mo Yan shows a society in which individualism has little meaning. The narrator and spoiled only son, Jintong, is neither a hero nor a fully realized character in the western sense, and though much detail is given about what characters do and how they behave, less consideration is given to how they think and why they behave as they do.<br /><br />Author of nine novels, Mo Yan, whose pen name, ironically, means \\"Don't speak,\\" has sometimes been mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize. The vibrancy and accuracy of his portraits of Chinese life, his steadfast insistence on showing life as it is, rather than as it ought to be, his celebration of resourceful women, and his willingness to take risks for his art make him one of the most influential writers in the People's Republic.

And The Boys (Penguin Plays)	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Life: "None of us knows the steps, and no music's playing"	Set in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1950, this powerful three-character play considers the interwoven relationships of young Harold (Hally), the seventeen-year-old son of the white proprietor of a tea room, and two of the African men who have worked there for years.  Hally, unable to depend on his alcoholic father, now living in an institution, has always depended on Sam, the waiter, for guidance and knowledge about the real world.  They share a long history in which Sam has been very much a father substitute for Hally, who has always shown him respect.<br /><br />Willie, the custodian, who also looks to Sam for guidance, plans to participate, along with Sam, in a ballroom dancing competition in two weeks.  For them, dancing \\"is beautiful because that is what we want life [in South Africa] to be like.\\"  In real life, however, \\"none of us knows the steps...we're bumping into each other all the time.\\"  As the play progresses, the three men reminisce, talk about their ideas of what constitutes a great hero, and show their easy relationship with each other.<br /><br />A phone call announcing that Hally's father is being released from the hospital upsets the equilibrium, however.  Hally, morose and worried about the future, fears that his father will once again destroy his world.  Taking out his anger on Sam and Willie, he  tears at their dreams regarding the dancing contest, mocking their goals and becoming cynical about what the contest means to them.  As his frustration grows, Hally hurts them as he has been hurt by his father, demanding ultimately that both men call him \\"Master Harold.\\"<br /><br />Based on an incident in the life of the playwright, who was strongly opposed to the policies of apartheid which began in South Africa around 1948, this powerful and poignant drama casts Sam, a black man, as a person of vision and nobility.  Hally, a young white man, chooses to exert power, instead of being human, and shows that he is a lesser man than either Sam or Willie.

Winner of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, August Wilson's sensitive story of a family's struggle to reconcile the past with the present centers around the carved piano which dominates the living room of Doaker Charles and his niece Berniece.  The legs of the piano are carved with faces of their slave ancestors, carvings made by a distant relation who was owned by the Sutter family and working on their farm in Mississippi before Emancipation.  Berniece's brother Boy Willie, recently released from a prison farm and penitentiary, has come to Pittsburgh with his friend Lymon, determined to sell this ancient piano in which he claims half-ownership.  His arguments with Berniece conjure up the ghost of Sutter, who calls out Boy Willie's name.<br /><br />The struggle of Boy Willie and Berniece over possession of the piano gradually broadens as they reveal the past, incorporating vivid pictures of the family's tenuous survival from slavery to the present.  A dozen or more of the white men who have been most abusive over the generations have met their deaths by \\"falling\\" into wells, crimes of revenge attributed to the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog.  These ghosts are supposedly the ghosts of five black men burned to death in a boxcar by Sutter after his carved piano, the one in Berniece's living room, was stolen.  The most recent Mr. Sutter \\"fell\\" into a well and died three weeks ago, and Berniece believes that Boy Willie may have had a hand in his death.<br /><br />The play's success rests on the well-developed family relationships and their interactions on stage, as they reflect the legacy of slavery and its aftermath. Berniece wants the piano because the blood of her family has been worked into its wood--it represents her heritage.  She and Doaker have learned a whole new culture of survival through their move to the city, but they do not want to forget the past.  Boy Willie, by contrast, wants to sell the piano in order to buy land for his future, remarking, \\"I got to mark my passing on the road.  Just like you write on a tree, 'Boy Willie was here.'\\"  He, however, still focuses on vengeance--righting past wrongs.  The tension between these viewpoints provides the drama and, in a powerful concluding scene, conveys the message of this play, ultimately a \\"piano lesson.\\"  Mary Whipplemark my passing on the road.

Frank O'Connor's famous short story, also a stage play by Neil McKenzie, is set in Ireland in 1921, the waning days of the fight for Irish independence.  Both the short story and the play emphasize the futility of war as two Irishmen capture two British soldiers while the soldiers are bird-watching, and are assigned to guard them in an Irish cottage for three weeks.  All four are country people who have been doing what they are expected to do by those in charge of their \\"side,\\" and none of them are really committed to the bloodshed which has marked this horrific war for independence.<br /><br />To help the time pass inside Kate O'Connell's thatched cottage, they play cards together, practice step-dancing, share cigarettes, become friends on the most basic level, and even argue about the fine points of religion (Does God bring droughts?  What is the role of the pagan gods of Ireland?  Do angels wear wings-and who made the wings?). The Irish think their prisoners are \\"decent chaps....to keep a guard on them is beyond sense,\\" while the British acknowledge that \\"it's hard to remember what side you're on....I ain't even thinking of being set free no more.\\"  When a sixteen-year-old English soldier is killed in the western part of Ireland, the Irish soldiers must decide whether their emotional kinship with these simple, British \\"good lads\\" is stronger than their political kinship with the Irish army.<br /><br />The almost slapstick high humor of the beginning becomes agonized decision-making in the course of the action.  The Irish guards, effectively convey the difficulties of wielding power over men very much like themselves.  Hawkins and Belcher, the English birdwatcher, are so ingenuous that their efforts to be friends, rather than enemies, are completely believable.  Kate O'Connell offers common sense advice, gradually changing from being a crotchety scold to a woman blossoming under their attention.

Jackson Brodie, a private detective, is investigating three old cases, which soon begin to converge and overlap. Three-year-old Olivia Land disappeared without a trace thirty-five years ago while sleeping outside with one of her sisters, two of whom have hired Jackson to find out what happened. Theo Wyre has hired him to investigate the death of his daughter Laura Wyre, who was killed by a maniac ten years before while working in her father's office. Shirley Morrison, Jackson's third client, is trying to locate her sister and her niece. Her sister Michelle, living with her husband and young daughter on an isolated farm, has vanished from Shirley's life, and after twenty-five years, Shirley wants to find her.<br /><br />Atkinson's suspenseful and dramatic cases pique the reader's interest in the characters and their lives, especially the female characters. Most have faced traumatic events and suffered through less than ideal childhoods, which unfold inexorably as the cases become more complex. Not a linear narrative, the novel focuses on different characters in successive chapters, moving back and forth in time to provide background and to set up the overlaps which eventually occur. The characters are sometimes bizarre, baffling, and even unsympathetic, but they are always memorable for their behavior and their justifications for it.<br /><br />Filled with ironies and noir humor, the novel also reveals Atkinson's astute observation of social interactions, as she skewers some aspects of her characters' lives while also creating sympathy for them. While the first two case histories-that of the missing Olivia and the murdered Laura-are genuinely sad and regarded overall as tragedies, the story of Michelle Fletcher, and peripherally, her sister Shirley, is much darker. Neither Michelle nor Shirley elicits much empathy after the opening chapter, but the occasional interjection of their story line stirs up the action, changes the pace, and keeps the novel from being overly melodramatic. Atkinson's eventual revelations about Michelle's life provide Atkinson with some of her best opportunities for social satire and wit.<br /><br />Readers will delight in Atkinson's characterizations, and the ironies are priceless, with the biggest noir twists saved for last. Though the cases are, in fact, all \\"solved\\" by Jackson, they are not really resolved. At least five important \\"loose ends\\" regarding the perpetrators of these murders and disappearances remain, showing that even murder cases are not as \\"cut and dried\\" as one might expect.

Like previous albums, it is beautifully arranged for the trio and quietly sung, emphasizing the songs and harmonies rather than solo voices. The accompaniments, primarily Louis Kauakahi's six-string guitar, Jerome Koko's twelve-string guitar, and John Koko's acoustic bass, reflect the importance of keeping the backgrounds simple yet rhythmic, spotlighting the voices and their harmonies. Keyboards by Michael Grande and drums by Konrad Kendricks finish out the orchestration.<br /><br />Three of the songs are new, with two of them written by Louis Kauakahi, the trio member who does all the vocal arrangements: \\"Sing Praises to Him,\\" and \\"Come Now, It's Christmas.\\" Another new and memorable song, \\"E Ke Keiki, E Iesu\\" by Frank Kawaikapuokalani Hewett, closes the album. The honesty of feeling and simplicity of accompaniment make the songs' messages all the stronger. On the non-religious songs, the references to Christmas lu'aus, aloha, swaying palms, lau lau, opi'i, and Santa arriving on a surfboard are special fun for those of us more accustomed to songs about \\"winter wonderlands.\\"<br /><br />As is often the case with Hawaiian albums, the \\"whole family\\" is involved here, with guest appearances by Rocky Brown, Robi Kahakalau, and Darlene Ahuna. \\"Silent Night\\" is particularly interesting, as it begins with a guitar rendition of \\"Dona Nobis Pacem,\\" with Sistah Robi in the vocal solo. Partway through this carol, the melody is taken over by Darlene Ahuna, with Sistah Robi and Darlene singing a duet for the conclusion. The Makaha Sons' voices range from bass to falsetto.

Ward Fearnside and his co-author, William B. Holther, have written a textbook on critical thinking which is so cogent that it remains an important teaching text even to the present.  Originally published in 1959 and still in print, the book presents fifty-one separate fallacies of argumentation commonly used in everything from political spin to advertising, marketing, and even personal relations, and discusses them in clear, unambiguous, easily comprehensible language.<br /><br />At the outset, the authors liken argument to a manufacturing process, pointing out that \\"if materials are up to standard, the operator efficient, and the machine running smoothly,\\" that the finished product will pass scrutiny.  In argumentation, they see the basic facts as the \\"material,\\" the person making the argument as the \\"operator,\\" and logic as the machine.  Dividing their text into three sections, they discuss in detail the Material Fallacies (problems with facts), Psychological Fallacies (problems with the bias of the person arguing), and Logical Fallacies (problems with logical processes).<br /><br />The Material Fallacies section discusses making improper generalizations, assuming causes, making false classifications, and presenting false dilemmas.  The many examples, sometimes humorous, that they give for each section parallel arguments readers will recognize from daily life.  Because the examples are short, followed by thorough explanations, they really come to life and stick in the reader's mind.  The Psychological Fallacies include: Emotional Coloration (charged language), Misusing Authority, Stirring up Prejudice, Rationalizations, Biased Misconstructions (including cultural biases), and Diversions (humor, ridicule, red herrings, creating impossible conditions).  For each section the examples are numerous, pertinent, and easily recognizable in daily life.<br /><br />The Logical Fallacies section is the most difficult but most interesting section, as Fearnside and Holther take the reader through the basics of logic, illustrating that logical validity is not the same as \\"truth\\"--logically valid statements can be patently untrue (because of factual, not logical, errors).  They use graphics to illustrate the \\"undistributed middle term\\" in syllogisms and the improper conversion of propositions (making broad generalizations about Y based on \\"some\\" X or \\"no X\\").  Numerous exercises for each fallacy appear at the end of the book, and an excellent index makes it easy to find specific fallacies, examples, and definitions.  Even more important now, in the the age mass media, the internet, and instant global communication, than it was in 1959, Fallacy: The Counterfeit of Argument remains a major contribution to clear thinking and communication.

Intending to write a \\"transcultural tragicomedy,\\" Margaret Drabble announces that this novel will ask questions \\"about the nature of survival, and about the possibility of the existence of universal transcultural human characteristics.\\"  Using the real memoirs of 18th century Korean Crown Princess Hyegyong as the inspiration for her novel, Drabble creates her own version of these memoirs, placing them within the context of world history by relating them to what was happening in western civilization at the same time.<br /><br />Chosen to be the bride of the Crown Prince when both are ten years old, the Princess abandons her family and marries the prince that year.  We hear her adult voice relating the sad changes her husband undergoes after their marriage, as he becomes increasingly fearful and eventually insane, committing atrocities, including murder.  \\"I failed my husband,\\" she says, unable to stop his rampages.  Describing her training to be queen, the birth of her children and their fates, and her experience in the claustrophobic court, she breathes life into her descriptions of her unusual existence.  Though her observations are honest and fair, her language, not surprisingly, is elegant and formal.  She keeps her distance, not really sharing her innermost thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />In Part II, Babs Halliwell, a contemporary scholar in Oxford, leaves for Korea to deliver a paper at a conference on globalization.  Drabble creates obvious parallels between the life of the Princess and that of Halliwell from the outset of Part II.  As Halliwell boards the plane, she brings with her a copy of the Princess's memoirs, \\"sent to her anonymously, packaged in cardboard, through Amazon.com,\\" which she reads in flight.<br /><br />No reader will miss the parallels between the life of Halliwell and that of the Princess, who \\"has entered her, like an alien creature in a science-fiction movie.\\"  Halliwell's background, her tragedies, her own difficult marriage to a mentally ill husband, and her uncertainties about the future are clearly created to show parallels to the Princess's life.  Drabble draws additional parallels between recent news events from around the world and events in the life of the Princess, in an effort to continue the connections across cultures and time.<br /><br />Those who have studied other cultures may find Drabble's themes obvious and her deliberate parallels lacking in subtlety.  She explains these parallels, rather than allowing the reader to discover them.  The construction feels artificial, and Drabble's tone is sometimes coy.  The diary of the Princess, however, is especially interesting for the light it casts on a way of life almost unknown to contemporary westerners, and for this the novel is both important and fascinating.

In his fifty-ninth novel in fifty-seven years, Louis Auchincloss continues his thematic focus on the socially prominent families of New York and how they achieved their status.  Beginning with David Carnochan, an immigrant from Scotland, a \\"good burgher with a sharp eye for a deal,\\" who was \\"a granite pillar of respectability,\\" Auchincloss traces the family through ten characters belonging to four generations, as they successively increase their fortunes and cement their places in the highest echelons of New York society.<br /><br />The family's pragmatism is shown when Douglas Carnochan purchases a substitute during the Civil War, while his abolitionist brother Andrew fights, is wounded, and returns to the front.  Douglas's wife Eliza imposes \\"standards in manners and morals\\" on the family, and son Bruce shows how marriages are negotiated when the family's fortunes begin to fail.  The reader observes the vulnerability of the family's most idealistic members, as pressure is exerted on them to remember the interests of the family and its businesses as a whole and to ignore the sometimes unethical behavior of relatives.<br /><br />With the characters' public and private moralities sometimes shown to be at odds, an individual family member's corporate interests often take precedence over what one would consider to be morally \\"right\\" behavior toward others.  Even the family's penchant for attending the same elite schools is put under the microscope, as is the tendency to keep the wealth in the family by intermarrying with distant cousins.  Showing that the family's contribution to the arts, to politics, to teaching, \\"to any occupation that involved giving out rather than taking in, was minimal,\\"  Auchincloss also shows that they are not enviable because of the opportunities that their wealth has given them, but sometimes to be pitied because of their limited outlooks and lack of connection to the outside (real) world.<br /><br />Auchincloss wisely presents a genealogical diagram at the beginning of the novel, which resembles a series of interconnected short stories, each individual's personality being obvious through Auchincloss's effective changes in tone and conversational styles as the chapters change.  While the characters may not be fully rounded, they are individualized enough that the reader will remember them, as each character reveals at least one important characteristic of the family as a whole.  The novel is a fascinating sociological study which shows Auchincloss's own closeness to the social milieu that he observes--honest, straightforward, and without a shred of satire.

Focusing on the women who work in a failing fish-packing plant, where their mothers and grandmothers also worked, \\"North Shore Fish\\" (1987) is the first of a cycle of \\"Gloucester plays\\" by Israel Horovitz, a playwright from New York and Gloucester (MA). The women in the plant are all locals, mostly in their thirties, as are the two men, Salvatore (Sally) Morella, the plant manager, and Alfred (Porker) Martino, the custodian. As the play opens, the women are arriving at work, casually stripping off their clothes to put on their smocks, making smalltalk, teasing Porker, and making raw jokes about Sally's libido. Their dialogue is natural, vulgar, and very funny.<br /><br />With a mixture of comedy and seriousness, the backgrounds of the workers at the fish plant unfold. Most are there by default--there are few other opportunities in this city, where the only real industry is fishing. All have graduated from the local high school, married local boys, and expect to spend their lives in town. The plant, for all its problems, has become a substitute family for these tough women, a place where they can escape the drudgery of their homes, talk about their kids, make smart remarks about each other, and share their real feelings.<br /><br />Serious issues from the past are revealed through the dialogue and add depth to the present situation--the story of Dot, who committed suicide in the freezer of the plant, the layoff of Florence's mother after thirty-eight years of work, and Sally's marriage at seventeen to a pregnant sixteen-year-old classmate. Slowly, the equally serious issues from the present unfold onstage--an assembly line worker gives birth in the plant during the play, another character is planning her abortion, and a huge fistfight develops between Porker and Sally. These provide plenty of action and allow for commentary about the present and the future. The female characters care about each other and wish to be treated with respect by the company which has employed them and their families for generations.<br /><br />By focusing on the smallness of the characters' lives, Horovitz gives an ironic universality to this play, since these characters are like millions of others with limited outlooks and no real future. At heart they are good people, looking for happiness where they can find it, wondering if they've made the right choices, and trying to make life better for their kids. Filled with local color and the (accurate) accent and syntax of local speech, the play beautifully captures the comedy and pathos of those working in a dying industry.

In what may be Jose Saramago's most playful novel, Tertuliano Maximo Afonso, a secondary school history teacher, views a film and is stunned to discover an actor who looks exactly like him in every respect.  \\"One of us is a mistake,\\" he declares, and as he begins (typically) to overanalyze the fact that \\"never before in the history of humanity have two identical people existed in the same place and time,\\" he finds himself wondering what it would be like to discover and meet this double.<br /><br />Renting dozens of videos in an effort to identify the look-alike actor he saw in the film, Tertuliano finds his life transformed--\\"as if he were...in a corridor joining heaven and hell,\\" and he wonders \\"where he had come from and where he would go to next.\\"  Enlisting his girlfriend, Maria da Paz, to help him find the address of actor Daniel Santa Clara, without telling her the whole story about his double, he learns that the actor's real name is Antonio Claro, contacts him by telephone, and arranges to meet him at a remote place, where a series of profound, dramatic ironies unfolds.<br /><br />Telling Tertuliano's story is a bold and quirky narrator.  Self-conscious about his writing, the narrator digresses, acts patronizing toward Tertuliano, and often makes arch comments about him to the reader.  He manipulates the reader, jokes with him as he constructs Tertuliano's story, plays with logic and language, creates conversations and debates between Tertuliano and Common Sense, reflects on the origins and destinies of words, and generally shows off, acting as a foil for Tertuliano Maximo Afonso, whose own \\"emotions have never been strong or enduring.\\"<br /><br />Saramago raises serious questions about identity and destiny, presenting Tertuliano Maximo Afonso and Antonio Claro (Daniel Santa Clara) as they compare their lives, recognize their different approaches to life, and then find their natural curiosity becoming transformed into resentment.  \\"There is one too many of us in the world,\\" Tertuliano declares.  The climax is shocking--quite different from what the reader expects--and just when you think the surprises have ended, a final surprise awaits.<br /><br />Readers new to Saramago should be forewarned that his style can be off-putting--page after page of run-on sentences, few paragraphs indentations, and a lack of quotation marks.  The reader must read dialogue carefully, since there is no punctuation to set off which remarks are made by which character.  Despite this flouting of convention, however, Saramago achieves a remarkably conversational tone, and this often humorous novel reads quickly.  Lively and clever, The Double gives us the game of life, played with a whole new set of rules.  Mary Whippleliano declares.

Referred to as \\"the female Frank Sinatra\\" by Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr., Keely recorded this album in 2001, when she was sixty-nine years old. Her voice is as strong and pure as it always has been, a voice seemingly impervious to the usual ravages of time. Recording some of Frank Sinatra's most famous songs, this album is, as Keely says, \\"a labor of love,\\" a celebration both of Frank's career and of the recording relationship Keely and Frank shared in the 1960s. Sinatra himself, seriously ill when this recording was made, specifically asked Keely to record \\"Angel Eyes,\\" telling her by phone that he loved the CD after it was completed.<br /><br />Both Sinatra and Keely Smith worked with Nelson Riddle and Billy May, whose arrangements echo throughout this album, featuring the full Frankie Capp Orchestra. Introduced by Frank Sinatra, Jr., the album begins with the light \\"South of the Border,\\" the lovely ballad \\"I've Got a Crush on You,\\" and the passionate \\"Night and Day.\\" Gradually, the selections become more complex, drawing more fully on Keely's versatility, timing, and note-perfect range of several octaves. \\"A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening\\" is at least as good as any version Sinatra recorded, and \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" features a vampy interpretation and Keely's wonderful, controlled vibrato. In \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" Keely soars, completely confident in her strong voice and its ability to hold its own in concert with a full orchestra, all playing full-out.<br /><br />The second half of the album features Frank's most famous songs, including \\"New York, New York,\\" \\"It Was a Very Good Year,\\" and \\"My Way,\\" all done with sensitivity, emotion, and Keely's full-voiced style. (Keely reveals in the liner notes that Sinatra was amazed that she was still able to hit the final high note of \\"My Way\\" so easily.) Frank Sinatra, Jr. closes the album with a forty-five second tribute to his father. The love just oozes from this album as every person involved in it pours out his/her heart. With Keely singing these songs in much the way that Sinatra sang them in the early and middle part of his career, they remind the listener just how huge Sinatra was for over forty years--and how huge Keely remains.

Winner of the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Anna in the Tropics recreates the Cuban-American community in Ybor City, Florida, in 1929,with its color, its cockfights, its close relationships, and its love of romance. Santiago and his wife Ofelia own a cigar factory, where the sometimes illiterate workers roll cigars and, to keep from becoming bored, hire a \\"lector\\" to read to them. Romantic stories spice up their lives, and since they have finished Wuthering Heights, they now look forward to a new novel, Anna Karenina, read by a new lector, Juan Julian.<br /><br />Conchita, one of the workers whose marriage with Palomo has grown stale, soon finds herself reenacting Anna Karenina, as she has a passionate affair with Juan Julian, and then tells Palomo about it. Marela, daughter of Santiago and Ofelia, also fantasizes about Juan Julian. Reality intrudes on romance, however, when Santiago's gambling on cockfights results in partial ownership of the factory going to Cheche, his half-brother, who now wants to introduce machines to speed up production. He also wants to eliminate the lector, to the workers' further dismay.<br /><br />In language that is often lyrical and sometimes fanciful, the action unfolds, with discussions evolving about the nature and importance of literature, the enduring values of their culture, the importance of love, and the possible effects of \\"progress\\" on traditional values. The characters, though not fully drawn and sometimes too obviously following plot lines of Anna Karenina, are, nevertheless, interesting and unusual as they try to do the best they can during trying times. To celebrate their happiness with the story of Anna Karenina, they decide to create a new cigar in her honor, and to have Marela serve as the model for the cigar box, but their happiness is as fragile and temporary as the idea of a \\"family\\" of workers making cigars without machines.<br /><br />When disaster strikes, it affects the entire factory, and the characters must decide to what extent it is possible to remain in a fantasy world when reality has reared its ugly head, and to what extent it is possible to hold on to the past when the survival of the factory may depend on progress. The obvious themes, their rather thin development, and the plot lines which parallel Anna Karenina show playwright Nilo Cruz's desire to give significance to this tragedy, though the characters do not develop fully on their own. Unique and unusual in its approach, however, the play beautifully captures a time and place in history.  Note:  I read this in English and cannot attest to the Spanish version.

Marek van der Jagt is a pen name for iconoclastic Dutch novelist Arnon Grunberg, whose novel Blue Mondays won the Netherlands' 1994 Anton Wachter Prize for a Debut Novel. After publishing additional successful novels, Grunberg created a literary controversy when he invented \\"Marek van der Jagt,\\" an author who was supposedly a Viennese philosopher, and with whom Grunberg engaged in a bitter \\"rivalry,\\" heavily covered in the European press. When The Story of My Baldness, \\"van der Jagt's\\" first novel, unexpectedly won the 2000 prize for Best First Novel, a prize Grunberg had already won, the true identity of \\"van der Jagt\\" was discovered and the prize withdrawn.<br /><br />Young, irreverent, and gifted with the ability to see real life as the joke it sometimes is, Marek van der Jagt/Arnon Grunberg writes earthy, beautifully observed prose, breathing life into every aspect of this hilarious and ribald coming-of-age story. The \\"author\\" is a fourteen-year-old philosophy student as the novel opens, deciding he will devote his life to \\"l'amour fou,\\" or mad, passionate love. The son of a Viennese insurance salesman and a woman for whom unrestrained \\"l'amour fou\\" is life's primary occupation, Marek has little family guidance about the facts of life, but he eventually finds two tourists, Milena and Andrea, to teach him.<br /><br />Marek's farcical reactions to \\"l'amour fou,\\" his inappropriate comments, his clumsy approaches, and his undisguised fascination with his older brother's prowess make Marek's first attempt at seduction one of the least romantic (and most amusing) seductions ever recorded. For Marek, however, this is an ironically life-changing experience: Milena's pointed comments about his naked body cause him to seriously question whether he might really be a dwarf, one who is a little taller than usual. The remainder of the novel deals with Marek's attempts to cope with his feelings of inferiority as he becomes an adult.<br /><br />Throughout his farcical search for l'amour fou, Marek makes grand pronouncements and \\"profound\\" comments about life and love, often relating his experiences to those of philosophers and creating satiric epigrams (\\"If you drink enough vodka, you understand everything.\\"). When he is making love, he thinks of Camus, ponders the French Surrealists, fantasizes about being \\"the Rimbaud of Vienna,\\" and dreams of being a successful poet with a volume entitled The Dwarf and Other Poems. His comic observations about the human foibles of his larger-than-life family and friends show them to be ludicrous, while his own naïve, Don Quixote-like search for \\"l'amour fou\\" is both touching and laugh-out-loud funny. Ironic, satiric, and ultimately thoughtful, the novel teaches that one \\"should not live as if a masterpiece is on its way.\\" Mary Whipplesearch for l'amour fou, Marek makes grand pronouncements and \\"profound\\" comments about life and love, often relating his experiences to those of philosophers and creating satiric epigrams (\\"If you drink enough vodka, you understand everything.\\").

Dr. Louis Marais is in intensive care in the hospital in South Africa as this novel opens, recovering from an accident that claimed the life of his wife Marion.  Louis, an Afrikaner of hard-scrabble background, has met and married Marion, an Englishwoman from a prominent family which regards Afrikaners as \\"not people, but brutes with hair on their backs.\\"  Recognizing from the outset that the hospital is the \\"safest place\\" for him, he knows that \\"he has to be careful if he wants to see [the three children] again.\\"<br /><br />When Marion's sister and soulmate Kate arrives from Paris for Marion's funeral, she regards the accident as suspicious, as does the reader, since Louis has already made pointed comments to that effect (and because the book jacket summary gives away the main plot).  As Kate investigates, aided by John, the elderly, almost blind Zulu house servant who sometimes sees Marion's ghost, Louis reminisces from his sickbed about his life before and during his marriage--his relationships, his goals, his loss of cultural identity as an Afrikaner, and his abusive temperament.  The action builds up to its climax when Louis decides, on his own, to leave the hospital to visit the children and his wife's family.<br /><br />A novel of psychological horror, Crossways differs from the psychological horror stories of some other writers of this genre--Patrick McCabe, for example.  From the outset the reader knows the direction of plot--only the details and characters' backgrounds need to be filled in.  Unfortunately, too, the reader recognizes Louis as damaged and dangerous, but he has no qualities which inspire any empathy.  The author suggests through Louis's comments that his loss of cultural identity has contributed to his derangement, and the memories and thoughts of John, the house servant, add to the suggestion that this is a main theme.  John, the most sympathetic character in the novel, remarks that \\"without tradition and law, how can people live?\\"  Yet the difference in scale between John's loss of his Zulu traditions and Louis's losses makes this cultural explanation for Louis's madness unrealistic.<br /><br />The author limits and controls what we know about the characters, telling us their inner thoughts, rather than showing these characters in action and allowing the reader to draw conclusions.  The excitement and suspense develop through the withholding of key background information, rather than through the reader's observations of the characters' behavior.  The intense psychological approach, the graphically described evidence of past violence, and the considerable suspense, as the reader awaits the characters' fateful destinies, however, will appeal to lovers of Gothic suspense and psychodrama.

Philip Roth, in this first of the Nathan Zuckerman novels, published in 1979, introduces Nathan as a twenty-three-year-old graduate of the University of Chicago who has had four short stories published and is looking for a mentor. Having contacted famed writer E. I. Lonoff, a writer living in rural New England with his wife of 35 years, he has accepted Lonoff's invitation to visit, but a snowstorm arises and Zuckerman finds himself spending the night with Lonoff and his wife. His observations about the life of Lonoff leads him to imagine many stories--about Lonoff's past, his possible relationship with a young former student, and about his life in the countryside. In addition, Zuckerman also reminisces about his own past, his relationships with his family, his feelings toward his own writing, his possible obligations to Jewish history, and the imagined past of Amy, Lonoff's former student, who resembles Anne Frank.<br /><br />Though Zuckerman is full of hopes for a broader relationship with Lonoff, he soon discovers that his idol is a petulant and insecure man who has used and, in some cases, emotionally abused, those around him, all in the name of \\"art.\\" Spending a sleepless winter night on the couch in Lonoff's den, Zuckerman investigates Lonoff's library, especially Lonoff's collection of the writings of Henry James, whom Lonoff admires so much, tries to write a letter to his estranged father (who is appalled by one of Nathan's recent short stories, which, he feels, feeds anti-Semitic prejudice), and ponders the relationship between genuine creativity, editing and revision, and the possible responsibilities of a writer beyond his own creative impulse.<br /><br />A story about the writing of stories, this novella explores the fictional lives writers create from their own lives and the sacrifices they make. As Lonoff's wife says of Lonoff, \\"Not living is what he makes his beautiful fiction out of.\\" Lonoff himself says, \\"I turn sentences around...That's my life.\\" And Henry James says in a motto Lonoff has framed in his den, \\"We give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and passion is our task.\\" When Zuckerman leaves Lonoff's house the next morning, he no longer sees Lonoff as an idol, but Zuckerman is still committed to his destiny as a writer, anxious to go to a writers' retreat to work on some new stories. Thoughtful, imaginative, and great fun to read, The Ghost Writer is one of Roth's most tightly organized and revelatory works, essential reading for anyone interested in the creative process.

Containing over a thousand tried-and-true recipes from cooks all over the country, this cookbook provides easy slow cooker meals, all with reduced fat and reduced salt.  Substitutions are the key here, with reduced fat ingredients such as turkey sausage and ground turkey, in place of beef, and low-fat cuts of pork, skinless and boneless chicken breasts, and low-fat cuts of beef in place of the higher fat cuts normally used.  Low-fat condensed mushroom and chicken soup (canned), low sodium barbecue sauce, low-fat or nonfat cheeses, and low-sodium tomatoes and tomato sauce replace the usual products.<br /><br />The soup section is the largest section, and there are over twenty-five versions of chili.  Desserts feature fruit, rice pudding, and bread pudding, but there is one Hot Fudge Cake resembling the standard \\"Denver Chocolate Pudding Cake,\\" which quickly converts this delicious baked recipe to the slow cooker.<br /><br />The primary value of this cookbook is that it shows easy adaptations of standard recipes, so if you have favorite recipes and need to adapt them, this offers some good alternatives.  Most of the recipes are light on herbs and spices, and adding them or increasing the amounts greatly improves the low salt versions of these recipes.  The chicken recipes are particularly good, with a Dill-Lemon Chicken, a Twenty-Clove (Garlic) Chicken, and a Southwestern Chicken which are delicious, though there is a significant loss of texture to the meat when skinless, boneless chicken is used in place of chicken breasts with bones and skin.<br /><br />Very low fat meat cuts (pork tenderloin or pork top loin, flank steak or extra lean beef cubes, for example), do not result in the cut-with-a-fork, fall-off-the-bone meats one is accustomed to with slow cooking--they remain quite firm (and rather dry) even with hours of cooking.  Longer cooking of the pork, especially, creates an almost pasty texture, and the slow cooker's original purpose of tenderizing a tough, fatty cut is lost.  This may be one of the reasons that the soups, which are imaginative, are the largest and most interesting section here.  Lovers of slow cookery may prefer to use their own recipes and seasonings for favorites, checking here for ways to cut down on fat and salt and perhaps getting ideas for new ways of cooking.

The child of Ashkenazi Jews who escaped to Jerusalem just before the outbreak of World War II, Amos Klausner (the author's original name) grew up in a scholarly family which encouraged his precocity.  His great uncle Joseph was Chair of Jewish History at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and wrote his magnum opus about Jesus of Nazareth.  His father read sixteen or seventeen languages, wrote poetry, and had an enormous library, while his mother spoke four or five languages, could read seven or eight, and told elaborate stories.<br /><br />Amos grew up a solitary child, encouraged to entertain himself while his parents worked.  Always a writer at heart, he believed that \\"it was not enough for me to be intelligent, rational, good, sensitive, creative.\\"  He often felt he was a \\"one-child show...a non-stop performance,\\" always on display to the relatives, his accomplishments never seeming to be enough.<br /><br />In this elaborate, non-linear autobiography, Oz and his family are seen as archetypal immigrants to Jerusalem, people who arrived when the land was still under British rule and who helped create a new homeland, arguing ferociously about the direction the country should take and the leaders who should lead it.  The history of Jerusalem combines with the author's own genealogical records and his memories about his early family life to create a broad picture of the society in which he grew up and in which his writing talent took root.<br /><br />Detailed, highly descriptive, and filled with introspection about his unusual life, the book shows the tensions within the society and within his family.  After his mother's suicide when he was twelve, he broke with his father, joined a kibbutz, and, at fifteen changed his name.  His observations about himself in relation to his peers and in relation to the outside world, even at that young age, show his inner turmoil and determination to discover a personal identity.<br /><br />As the book moves back and forth in time, the author comments about his writing, the people who influenced him, and his \\"pickpocketing,\\" his \\"stealing\\" of the lives of real people in order to invent stories about them.  His observations about Israel, its leaders, its never-ending wars with the Arabs, and his experience as a resident of a kibbutz for more than thirty years broaden the scope and provide insight into one man's life in this developing country.  Obviously a huge achievement for Oz personally, this is also a huge contribution to the understanding of the growth of a Jewish homeland and to an understanding of how Oz became the writer he is.  Much more detailed and leisurely than Oz's novels, this is slow but satisfying reading for those who admire his novels.

Brian Friel, Ireland's premier modern dramatist, produces a minimalist ensemble drama in this 1995 play, presenting a story of immense dramatic power with no dramatic action on stage at all.  Molly Sweeney, a forty-year-old woman who lost her sight when she was a baby, is the central character, the two others being her husband Frank, and Mr. Rice, a man whose surgical skill can return partial sight to her.  When the play opens, all three characters inhabit their own spaces on stage, and each tells his/her story directly to the audience, the characters having no interaction with each other at all.<br /><br />In a brilliant example of dramatic irony, the play comes fully to life through their stories and achieves a poignant reality though the audience never actually sees any action.  In this way, the play's structure parallels the life of Molly, a woman who sees nothing but fully experiences the joy of life.  Molly is fully independent, works as a massage therapist in a local health club, and, in fact, supports her husband, who is unemployed, considering her life completely \\"normal.\\"  When she has the opportunity to regain partial sight, she accepts the surgery at the behest of her husband and the surgeon, a man so dependent on alcohol that he sees the surgery as his last chance to restart his career.<br /><br />Through the story of the surgery and how it changes the lives of the three characters, Friel forces the audience to consider important aspects of reality and how we interpret it.  As he points out during the play, a functioning person without sight has created \\"engrams\\" of reality based on the other senses and must be taught how to connect new visual knowledge with the tactile engrams of his/her life if s/he is to be successful in understanding a sighted world.  The gaining of sight involves the loss of the blind person's known world and the creation of a world in which everything is constantly moving and changing, \\"all the consolations of...the familiar\\" gone forever.  Friel brilliantly recreates the drama of all three main characters as they try to cope emotionally with the changes wrought by Molly's surgery.<br /><br />Ultimately, the play raises complex questions about fantasy vs. fact, and imagination vs. reality and suggests that these concepts may not be the opposites that many of us think them.  The unusual format of the play itself is perfectly suited to this subject matter, asking us to imagine each character's invisible, but nevertheless completely real, inner life.

His sunglass-clad, talking fruit bat, Roberto, also plays a role.<br /><br />Lena's argument with Dale is witnessed by young Josh Barker, aged seven, who is distraught at the thought that \\"someone killed Santa.\\"  Soon Josh is visited by the Archangel Raziel, who appeared in Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, a klutzy angel whose mission it is to go to earth and \\"find a child who has made a Christmas wish that can only be granted by divine intervention,\\"  and do something for him.  Josh wants Santa to come back to life.<br /><br />As always, Moore's off-the-wall imagination takes over, and the investigation of Dale Pearson's disappearance becomes complicated.  As the holiday comes closer, Raziel starts to work his bizarre magic and bring about his Christmas \\"miracle.\\"  The juxtaposition of the Christmas message and the violence in town are seen in sharp, ironic relief, and the question of whether there are any heroes in this novel and whether Raziel is truly an archangel come to the fore.<br /><br />A no-holds-barred, let-it-all-hang-out free-for-all which gives a whole new meaning to \\"the willing suspension of disbelief,\\" this is a fast-paced narrative that will keep you in stitches.  The young at heart probably will not bat an eyelash at its profanity, its vulgar hilarity, and its unexpected satiric twists and turns.  Your staid and proper Aunt Martha, however, may be more than a little startled.  Mary Whippleyou in stitches.

Focusing on the women who work in a failing fish-packing plant, where their mothers and grandmothers also worked, \\"North Shore Fish\\" (1987) is the first of a cycle of \\"Gloucester plays\\" by Israel Horovitz, a playwright from New York and Gloucester (MA).  The women in the plant are all locals, mostly in their thirties, as are the two men, Salvatore (Sally) Morella, the plant manager, and Alfred (Porker) Martino, the custodian.  As the play opens, the women are arriving at work, casually stripping off their clothes to put on their smocks, making smalltalk, teasing Porker, and making raw jokes about Sally's libido.  Their dialogue is natural, vulgar, and very funny.<br /><br />With a mixture of comedy and seriousness, the backgrounds of the workers at the fish plant unfold.  Most are there by default--there are few other opportunities in this city, where the only real industry is fishing.  All have graduated from the local high school, married local boys, and expect to spend their lives in town.  The plant, for all its problems, has become a substitute family for these tough women, a place where they can escape the drudgery of their homes, talk about their kids, make smart remarks about each other, and share their real feelings.<br /><br />Serious issues from the past are revealed through the dialogue and add depth to the present situation--the story of Dot, who committed suicide in the freezer of the plant, the layoff of Florence's mother after thirty-eight years of work, and Sally's marriage at seventeen to a pregnant sixteen-year-old classmate.  Slowly, the equally serious issues from the present unfold onstage--an assembly line worker gives birth in the plant during the play, another character is planning her abortion, and a huge fistfight develops between Porker and Sally.  These provide plenty of action and allow for commentary about the present and the future.  The female characters care about each other and wish to be treated with respect by the company which has employed them and their families for generations.<br /><br />By focusing on the smallness of the characters' lives, Horovitz gives an ironic universality to this play, since these characters are like millions of others with limited outlooks and no real future.  At heart they are good people, looking for happiness where they can find it, wondering if they've made the right choices, and trying to make life better for their kids.  Filled with local color and the (accurate) accent and syntax of local speech, the play beautifully captures the comedy and pathos of those working in a dying industry.

Devastated by the surrender of his country just five days after the Nazi invasion, twenty-three-year-old Erik Hazelhoff, decides to resist.  A university student in Leyden, Hazelhoff, joined by friends, makes several attempts to get to England so they can fight the Germans, before finally succeeding.  Connecting with Francois van 't Sant, Private Secretary to Queen Wilhelmina, who is in exile in England, Hazelhoff and three friends agree to help start \\"Contact Holland,\\" an Underground communications network between Holland and England.  Ferrying spies across the North Sea into Holland proves more difficult than they have imagined, and with winter weather, high seas, and no communications network in place in Holland, their good intentions do not produce the desired results.<br /><br />In this autobiographical account, Hazelhoff conveys in dramatic detail the many attempts to establish Underground connections through Scheveningen, and in equally dramatic detail the political scheming between Dutch bureaucrats living in London, who simply want to continue the government's legal existence, and Van 't Sant and the Queen, who want real results.  When their plans for Resistance are co-opted by other governmental agencies and Van 't Sant is demeaned as the \\"Dutch Rasputin,\\" Hazelhoff and his fellow \\"Englandfarers\\" decide to take direct action, enlisting in Britain's RAF, so they can fly Mosquito Pathfinder missions over Germany.<br /><br />Within Hazelhoff's personal story are the stories of many other young men--his friends--all willing to face extreme odds in order to help their country.  It is here that the story achieves its greatest significance.  Of the 144 agents dropped into Holland between 1940 - 1944, only 28 survived the war.  The statistics regarding RAF pilots are equally grim.  Yet Hazelhoff tells story after story of various friends performing incredible deeds.  His anecdotes about Queen Wilhelmina, to whom he eventually becomes an aide, show her to be a sensitive sovereign dedicated to saving her people, but also a woman worthy of the tribute paid her by Winston Churchill:  \\"I really fear no man in the world--except Queen Wilhelmina.\\"<br /><br />Hazelhoff brings a writer's sensibilities to this story.  His attention to detail and ability to arrange details dramatically create a fast pace and clear picture of the action.  His innate modesty keeps his revelations from appearing self-serving, and his observations about the Dutch government and Queen Wilhelmina in exile are fascinating.  Filled with the kind of excitement one is more accustomed to reading in fiction, this first-person account of the Resistance is a fine contribution to the historical record and a testament to the spirit of Erik Hazelhoff and his friends.

The drug trade throughout Mexico, Latin America, and the Mediterranean come alive in Arturo Perez-Reverte's latest novel, quite different from his intellectual mysteries.  Here he writes the \\"biography\\" of Teresa Mendoza, a young woman from Sinaloa, Mexico, who becomes the mastermind of a multimillion dollar drug empire operating from Marbella, Spain.  This novel's challenge lies not in an intellectual puzzle, but in understanding the business networks Teresa builds with drug lords from Russia, Italy, Morocco, and Colombia, along with various agents of government whom she buys off.  As she becomes a successful businesswoman, known as \\"The Queen of the South,\\" the suspense develops:  Will she stay alive?  And how?<br /><br />The story begins in Mexico when Teresa is twenty-three.  Uneducated but attractive, she is in love with Guero Davila, a Chicano pilot involved in shipping coca.  When she suddenly receives a phone call telling her to run for her life, she does so, escaping through Mexico City into Spain, and then Morocco.  Putting her knowledge of drug transportation to work by involving herself in hash-running between Morocco and Spain, she ends up with a short jail sentence but an important friendship with another inmate, Patty O'Farrell, the rebellious daughter of a wealthy Spanish family.  When they are released, they set up a big-time drug trafficking business, with Teresa running the show and becoming, eventually, the person with whom everyone in the business must deal.<br /><br />Teresa's story is not told in linear fashion.  An unnamed speaker/narrator, presumably Perez-Reverte himself, has come to Sinaloa to investigate and describe Teresa Mendoza's life and business.  Interviewing everyone with any information, he inserts himself and his interviews into the narrative.  Soon the line begins to blur between fiction and fact, since some of the people he interviews, such as the three people to whom he dedicates the novel, are, in fact, real people who are included as characters in the novel.  These add depth and a fine sense of realism to the novel.<br /><br />Although Teresa Mendoza is not a character with whom the reader will identify, the author develops a certain amount of sympathy for her.  Teresa is an entrepreneur of great intelligence, and this, combined with her ability to avoid creating any sort of trail that will implicate her legally, keeps her going in her dog-eat-dog world.  The novel is episodic but fast paced, despite the sometimes unwelcome intrusions of the narrator/speaker, and Perez-Reverte succeeds in presenting a broad, intriguing picture of the business of drug smuggling and those who make it their careers.

Nora Howard, a thirty-five-year-old writer, is almost always in the grip of a creative fever, but though she always starts out intending to write fiction, she soon finds that the problems and misfortunes of her friends, relatives, and acquaintances seep into her stories.  Before long, she is reading into the real person's mind and divining thoughts, motivations, and emotions--and using these observations in her stories.  Though this leads to stunning realism, her friends feel betrayed.<br /><br />When Nora reconnects with Isaac Mitchell, an art photographer and former lover who was a major part of her life five years before, he is hesitant about resuming their past relationship.  His early promise as a creative artist has not borne fruit in the way he has hoped, and he is now working as deputy photo editor for a newspaper, a job that he enjoys, though he fears that he is no longer the \\"moral touchstone\\" that Nora once thought him.<br /><br />In alternating chapters, Nora and Isaac tell their stories, past and present.  The story of Nora's \\"writing life\\" becomes more complex when her aunt Billie, her only remaining relative, becomes seriously ill, and Nora must make sacrifices.  Meanwhile, Isaac's young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Renee is finding great success, and he can't help resenting the fact that for her, photography seems far easier and more natural than it does for him.<br /><br />Exploring the creative life in detail here, author Brian Morton demonstrates that for Isaac, \\"photography had [once] taken the place of prayer in his life\\" and for Nora, \\"it was the best way she had ever found to express her fascination with life, her quarrels with life.\\" The sacrifices and compromises one makes for art are nicely realized, and when Nora writes a story about a character named, symbolically, \\"Gabriel,\\" a story she is submitting to an Atlantic magazine contest, the stage is set for a confrontation with Isaac.  Billie's illness leads to a broadening of themes and to additional questions, not only about the creative life, but about how we find personal satisfaction and how we want to be remembered.<br /><br />Homely details and dialogue give insights into the relationships of the characters, while Morton's unpretentious style keeps the reader focused on the here and now.  The realism is leavened with irony and humor, at the same time that the author makes important points about who we are, as opposed to who we want to be.  Through small events and small details, Morton keeps his novel focused, showing real people learning or not learning from their experiences.

In this novel within a novel, Australian author Thomas Keneally returns to the political themes which won him prizes for The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, Voices from the Forest, and Schindler's Ark.  Keneally has always been at his best depicting ordinary people facing extraordinary pressures, especially from governments bent on totalitarian rule, and this contemporary allegory is no exception.  Taking place in an unnamed oil-rich country in the Middle East ruled by a tyrant who calls himself Great Uncle, the novel centers on a man calling himself \\"Alan Sheriff,\\" a short story writer given one month to write an \\"autobiographical novel\\"  for which Great Uncle will take full credit.  Sheriff, we learn in the opening chapter, is telling his story to a western journalist from a detention camp in an unnamed desert country, where he has languished for three years.<br /><br />Keneally increases the impact and universality of the story through his clever use of western names.  As Alan Sheriff tells the journalist, it is important for his credibility in the west that he be like a man you'd meet on the street, which is much easier with a name like Alan--\\"not, God help us, Said and Osama and Saleh.  If we had Mac instead of Ibn.\\"  Alan believes his \\"saddest and silliest story\\" will interest Americans, despite the fact that his country and the US are now enemies.<br /><br />Through Alan's story, the reader meets Mrs. Douglas, whose nephew, not careful enough of the pH level of Great Uncle's swimming pool, has been shot and hanged from the ramparts;  Mrs. Carter, whose son has been missing for six years;  Alan's beloved wife, Sarah Manners, an actress who has become unemployable;  Matt McBride, another writer who becomes head of the Cultural Commission where he works for Great Uncle; and Louise James, an American who would like to get Sheriff to come to Texas as a visiting professor.  All these characters contribute to a stunning conclusion as Sheriff tries to write the required novel.<br /><br />Easily the best Keneally novel in over a decade, this serious and thoughtful novel has significant political ramifications.  The characters are \\"ordinary people,\\" much like the rest of us, caught in extreme situations, and Keneally builds up enormous suspense as the long tentacles of the tyrant grab everyone in their path.  Though most readers will recognize the unnamed country and the tyrant, it is a tribute to Keneally that their specific identities are totally irrelevant to his themes and plot.  The author makes it clear that a government's manipulation of the people's perceptions through staged events is not limited to the Third World.

Winner of the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Anna in the Tropics recreates the Cuban-American community in Ybor City, Florida, in 1929,with its color, its cockfights, its close relationships, and its love of romance.  Santiago and his wife Ofelia own a cigar factory, where the sometimes illiterate workers roll cigars and, to keep from becoming bored, hire a \\"lector\\" to read to them.  Romantic stories spice up their lives, and since they have finished Wuthering Heights, they now look forward to a new novel, Anna Karenina, read by a new lector, Juan Julian.<br /><br />Conchita, one of the workers whose marriage with Palomo has grown stale, soon finds herself reenacting Anna Karenina, as she has a passionate affair with Juan Julian, and then tells Palomo about it.  Marela, daughter of Santiago and Ofelia, also fantasizes about Juan Julian.  Reality intrudes on romance, however, when Santiago's gambling on cockfights results in partial ownership of the factory going to Cheche, his half-brother, who now wants to introduce machines to speed up production.  He also wants to eliminate the lector, to the workers' further dismay.<br /><br />In language that is often lyrical and sometimes fanciful, the action unfolds, with discussions evolving about the nature and importance of literature, the enduring values of their culture, the importance of love, and the possible effects of \\"progress\\" on traditional values.  The characters, though not fully drawn and sometimes too obviously following plot lines of Anna Karenina, are, nevertheless, interesting and unusual as they try to do the best they can during trying times.  To celebrate their happiness with the story of Anna Karenina, they decide to create a new cigar in her honor, and to have Marela serve as the model for the cigar box, but their happiness is as fragile and temporary as the idea of a \\"family\\" of workers making cigars without machines.<br /><br />When disaster strikes, it affects the entire factory, and the characters must decide to what extent it is possible to remain in a fantasy world when reality has reared its ugly head, and to what extent it is possible to hold on to the past when the survival of the factory may depend on progress.  The obvious themes, their rather thin development, and the plot lines which parallel Anna Karenina show playwright Nilo Cruz's desire to give significance to this tragedy, though the characters do not develop fully on their own.  Unique and unusual in its approach, however, the play beautifully captures a time and place in history.

Growing up in Nakuru, Kenya, in the 1950s, Vikram Lall and his sister Deepa, the children of Indian merchants, become friends with British children Bill Bruce and his sister Annie, and with Njoroge, a Kikuyu who lives with his grandfather, the family's gardener.  While Vic is secretly in love with Annie, Njoroge is secretly in love with Deepa, both childhood relationships ignoring the cultural and color barriers of the times.  The Mau Mau, a Kikuyu group dedicated to ridding the country of the British, are on the march, attacking and killing British men, women, and children. To Lall and his friends, who live in an area where violence has not yet struck, however, they are almost mythic creatures, until the violence strikes close to home, and Vic's life and perceptions are altered forever.<br /><br />Alternating points of view between the present, when Vikram Lall is in his fifties and living outside Toronto, Canada, where he is \\"numbered one of Africa's most corrupt men,\\" and the early 1950s, when he lived in a diverse Kenyan community, Vassanji shows how the Lalls are doubly alienated, first from their family in India, whose village, thanks to the British Partition of India, is now part of Pakistan, and from the majority population of Kenya.  His depiction of the Lall family, the Indian merchant community, and the African community's hostility towards British rule sets the scene for the action during the next forty years.<br /><br />When Vic, as a young man living in the ultimately independent Kenya, works in the Ministry of Transport and moves up the political ladder, he is powerless to resist orders from his superiors, even though his job is to launder cash coming in as bribes.  The story of Jomo Kenyatta and his successors, and the growing corruption which taints their governments--and Vic--becomes increasingly compelling as the stories of Vic, Deepa, and Njoroge continue to intersect and overlap.<br /><br />Vassanji tells a fully developed saga that stimulates the reader's emotions at the same time that it reflects historical realities, and the plot is filled with the excitement of change along with its problems.  Through intense and vividly rendered descriptions, he juxtaposes the natural world against the unnatural violence of the times.  Strong love stories, told realistically, run parallel to the action and keep the reader involved on a level beyond that of history and theme, as the characters evolve in response to the changing times.  Fascinating and involving on all levels, this novel, winner of Canada's Giller Prize, should win a broad new audience for M. G. Vassanji.

In one of the most elegantly written and carefully constructed love stories in recent memory, Nicholas Shakespeare introduces Peter Hithersay, who, on his sixteenth birthday, learns that \\"Daddy\\" is not his father.  In Leipzig, East Germany, for a vocal competition, his mother had met and loved his biological father very briefly, only to see him arrested, and taken away forever.  Curious about Germany, Peter spends his gap year in Hamburg and applies for and is accepted to its medical school, where he lives for the next six years.<br /><br />During his third year of medical school, members of a traveling mime troupe invite him to accompany them on a trip to Leipzig, where his unnamed father had been arrested.  Though he has been warned about the secret police, the constant spying on foreigners, and the dangers of going off on his own, the 22-year-old Peter, nevertheless, falls passionately in love with a young East German, whose Icelandic nickname, \\"Snjolaug,\\" sounds to him like \\"Snowleg.\\"  At the end of his four-day trip to Leipzig, however, he leaves her, only to spend the next twenty years dreaming about finding her again.<br /><br />Peter's search for Snowleg, and secondarily, for his father alternate with flashbacks and memories, as the relationship of Peter and Snowleg unfolds.  The role of the secret police in their separation and the conflicts between the original ideal of communism and its later cynical implementation are shown through Uwe and Hesse, two secret policemen,  who appear in the prologue and in the conclusion and provide fresh perspective on the action, elevating this novel above the typical love story.<br /><br />The vibrancy of Shakespeare's prose makes every page of this novel a delight to read.  Filled with irony and, often, humor, the dialogue comes alive.  Unforgettable descriptions, especially of the darkness, cold, and soot in Leipzig, reveal feelings as well as convey information.  To Peter, listening to the radio, a love song \\"had red eyes and ran furtively across his mind...It was a rat dressed up as a promise.\\"  Repeating motifs--a van with a fish painted on it, a dying deer, the story of Sir Bedevere, a fur coat, and the bones of a muskrat--echo throughout the novel and connect scenes symbolically.<br /><br />Like most romances, the story relies on coincidence and fortuitous accident, but Shakespeare's writing is so strong and the story is so exciting that even the most jaded reader will willingly accept the implausibilities.  In the UK, where the book has been out since January, the judging panel for the Man Booker Prize has selected this novel for its longlist for best novel of the year.

When Carnegie Wong's mother, the outrageous Mama Wong, discovers that Carnegie is going to marry Janie Bailey (\\"Blondie\\"), descended from Scottish/German immigrants, she tries, vainly, to bribe Carnegie to change his mind.  Fourteen years later, the happily married Blondie and Carnegie now have two adopted Chinese daughters and a biological \\"half half\\" son, and Mama Wong has died. Their home life is suddenly turned upside down, however, when Lanlan, a 46-year-old \\"cousin\\" from mainland China, previously unknown, arrives at their home through the machinations of Mama Wong--from beyond the grave.  Working as their part-time nanny, Lan quickly wins over the children, who respond to the fact that, like a \\"real\\" mother (and unlike Blondie), she looks like them.<br /><br />The life of this racially mixed family is examined in minute detail, and the reader sees Lan slowly undermining their relationship with Blondie.  Lan tells stories about life in China, fixes Chinese snacks, and introduces Chinese cooking, and the children try to understand and appreciate their cultural and racial identity.  In bright, breezy language, each of the main characters develops the narrative from his/her own point of view and reminisces about the past, revealing his/her own quirky personality, offbeat relationships, and search for personal and cultural identity.<br /><br />Despite the specific details, minute descriptions, and personal commentary, the characters are not fully rounded, and their motivations are unclear.  Carnegie, for example, has protected his marriage against his mother's meddling for years, and his attraction to Lan is both baffling and inconsistent with what we know of his marriage.  Blondie is a high-powered executive, an assured and self-confident businesswoman, yet she allows herself to be victimized by Lan, offering virtually no resistance, and we never really know why Lan resents Blondie so much.  Neither Lizzy (age fifteen) nor Wendy (age nine) is seriously rebellious, yet they inform Blondie they would prefer a \\"real\\" mother \\"like Lanlan.\\"<br /><br />In the last third of the book, the author introduces several new characters and shifts the focus from the limited story of Lanlan's effect on the Wong family to several subplots involving other \\"cultural\\" issues--episodes involving physical abuse and violence, the failure of a small business, and prejudice against immigrants in rural Maine.  These episodes are highly dramatic, even sensational, but they feel tacked on to provide a climax of greater significance than the domestic issues which have been the focus to this point.  With its multiple points of view, eccentric characters, and humor, however, the novel is lively and entertaining, and Gish Jen's emphasis on cultural identity will strike a sympathetic chord with a large portion of the American population.

Set in Donegal in 1936, during Ireland's change from an agrarian to a more industrial economy, Brian Friel's haunting ensemble drama of five sisters and their priest brother reveals the economic, social, and religious pressures in the rural community of Ballybeg on the eve of the harvest festival of Lughnasa.  Forty-ish Kate, who sees herself \\"in charge,\\" is the only real wage earner in the family. Rigid, severe, and completely lacking in humor, she believes pagan celebrations, such as Lughnasa, which provide fun and enjoyment in the countryside, are \\"uncivilized.\\" Her brother Jack, the priest, however, on furlough from his missionary work in Uganda, is now virtually a pagan himself.  His work has shown him the need of the poor for happiness, dancing, and community celebration, even if it is not church-sanctioned.<br /><br />The other Mundy sisters help illustrate the ironic chasm between Kate's attitudes and those of Fr. Jack. Maggie, the fun-loving, free-spirited, and most humorous of the sisters, constantly bursts into song and dance and longs to go to the town dance. Christina feels no shame whatever about her love-child and thoroughly enjoys the summer visit of his father, Gerry Evans, with whom she dances spontaneously.  Aggie and Rose, who earn small wages knitting gloves, work tirelessly as the family's sad, \\"unpaid servants,\\" constantly chafing against Kate's imposition of her own values on them.  When the local priest fails to rehire Kate because of Fr. Jack's apparent paganism, the family is devastated, but it is at that moment that they recognize the need to celebrate life itself.<br /><br />The narrator is Michael, Christina's love-child, now in his fifties, who sets the scene and comments on the action throughout.  Though Michael himself participates in the action as a child, the child is invisible to the audience.  The characters speak to him as if he were real, and the adult Michael responds, but to the actors on stage, it is the narrator who is invisible.  The message of the play is far stronger here than that of its film version, starring Meryl Streep.  In the play Kate is more hostile, and the fates of Aggie and Rose are revealed early, not withheld till the end.  Fr. Jack's paganism is not regarded as a mental aberration in the play, and the \\"clan of the round collar\\" is opened to scrutiny.  The play, though dark, is ultimately a joyful celebration of life itself, a life not bound by organized religion.

Mma Precious Ramotswe, proprietor of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency in Gaborone, is a much-respected, traditional woman (of \\"traditional size\\") who honors the customs of Botswana and tries to solve problems for her clients the \\"traditional\\" way--through her broad network of friends and family with whom she can sit down, drink bush tea, and \\"talk about very small things,\\" as she searches for clues. She is a warm and happy woman of good sense, and her detective agency is a huge success because of her discretion and care for her clients' feelings.<br /><br />In this novel, full of gentle humor and wisdom, Mma Ramotswe deals with two clients, one of whom committed a minor crime many years ago and for which he now wants to make amends, and one of whom is worried about a philandering husband. Both cases require the utmost in tact and sensitivity. Mma Ramotswe is also concerned with some personal matters. A rival detective agency, run by an aggressive man, opens an office in Gaborone to great fanfare, and he publicly demeans the #1 Ladies Detective Agency in a news feature. Mma Ramotswe's fianc&eacute;, Mr. J. L. B. Matakone still has not set a wedding date, though he clearly loves her, and one of the young orphans she and Mr. J. L. B. Matakone are mentoring, begins to have serious behavior problems. In addition, Mma Makutsi, Mma Ramotswe's assistant, who is barely making ends meet with her current jobs, decides to open a typing school for men after work. Mma Makutsi soon falls in love with one of her students, someone Mma Ramotswe finds inappropriate.<br /><br />Domestic issues and human relationships, rather than exciting plot lines, keep the focus on the characters--beautifully drawn, sometimes flawed, and always forgiven their faults. In a pace as relaxed as life in Botswana, author Alexander McCall Smith recreates the colorful everyday lives of these ordinary people, who treasure friendships, treat each other with respect, and possess inherent good sense. In simple, direct prose filled with homely details, the author celebrates a traditional lifestyle and its values during a time in which change may become inevitable. A warm, relaxing read, filled with the joy of life.

Neither realistic nor magical, Jha creates a whole new realm here, the world that exists between dream and nightmare, and between imagination and memory, which all of us inhabit for most of our everyday lives.  Motifs (a crow, a red dress, a brown dog, a house with a balcony that looks like a frown) appear and reappear throughout the three different sections, with each part recreating the inner world of a different character.<br /><br />In the first section, Amir, a young man who has been injured by a tram, is nursed back to health by Rima, a young woman who brings him back to her apartment, gets him a doctor, and makes sure that all his needs are met so that he can recuperate in peace.  In the second section, Mala, a young newspaper reporter, has gone to a distant village to investigate the death of a child, who has drowned in a canal after being raped.  The final section returns to the city where a neighborhood has suffered a rash of suicides.  A young child is worried that her parents might kill themselves and confides in a friend, who promises to follow her father and mother.<br /><br />Two italicized prologues and a brief conclusion summarize the novel thematically, while the first person narratives illustrate the sensual responses of Amir, Mala, and the child to what is going on around them and provide insights into their emotional states.  The novel requires the reader to form hypotheses about what is happening and how the characters connect, with the author confirming the connections and the meaning of the novel in the conclusion, which draws all the visual details and motifs together.<br /><br />Jha emphasizes the process by which we all bring order and \\"sense\\" to our lives, how we live our dreams, and how we deal with our fears and our memories.  The reader must be committed to letting this impressionistic novel unwind, accepting the mysteries that exist, as they do in our own lives, without worrying about the characters or the direction of the \\"plot.\\"  The author fills in any blanks at the end.  Unique in its approach and fascinating in its construction, this novel captures the essence of its characters' lives and connects directly with the reader's own inner life.  In this, it achieves a universality  rare in fiction.

In 1942, when the American army builds an air base near the small town of Strandvik, Iceland, less than a hundred kilometers from the Arctic Circle, the whole local culture comes under siege.  Isolated, even from other Icelanders, the community consists predominantly of fishermen whose wives assume a variety of low-paying jobs to make ends meet, and there is little opportunity for young people to explore alternatives to this life.  When the Americans invite only the women of the community to a Big Band Bash, the women dress to look like American movie stars and expect an evening on a par with a Hollywood event.  The men, however, are left out and understandably resentful.<br /><br />Focusing on Hildur, a mother, and two of her daughters--the beautiful Prila, who is a telephone operator/singer, and 14-year-old Sissa, described as a \\"half-wit,\\" the play shows how a family's values and beliefs can change when alternatives appear.  Sissa, for example, believes devoutly in the \\"hiddenfolk,\\" magical people whose stories have always provided both entertainment and cultural cohesion in this Land of the Midnight Sun.  Now, the magic of movies and movie magazines has made them less \\"influential.\\"  Two brothers, Peter, who is in love with Prila, and Kari, her former lover, who has just returned after a two years in Europe, illustrate conflicting dreams for the future, and when Prila is invited by Jim, an American, to sing at the dance, her own dreams affect those of the brothers. The rapid-fire dialogue, some of it joking, effectively conveys relationships and interactions, and portends equally rapid changes in their lives.<br /><br />The dramatic contrasts between the cultures play out against the pink light of Midsummer's Eve, as events born of desperation affect all the characters and take their toll, both physically and emotionally.  Often humorous, the play is also full of poignant moments, with the music, much of it written by author Maja Ardal, serving as counterpoint to the action.  When the cornet in a jazz tune drowns out the sound of trumpeter swans, the scene is set for the climax.  Beautifully structured and filled with ironies, this unusual play from 2001 raises questions both about the ubiquity of American culture and its effects on traditional lifestyles.

Seeing himself as \\"panther in the basement,\\" much like Tyrone Power in a favorite old film, Proffi, the 12-year-old son of activist parents in Jerusalem in 1947, is a member of an \\"underground cell\\" which he and two friends have formed.  Their objective, like that of their parents, is the ouster of the British, who have been mandated by the UN to set up a Jewish homeland.  Though the children enjoy \\"spying\\" and see themselves as glorious heroes, their plans of attack are distinctly childish.  When Proffi finds himself drawn to Sgt. Stephen Dunlop, a gentle, shy British soldier from Canterbury, who wants to learn Hebrew and to teach Proffi English, Proffi justifies this friendship as his chance to probe for information for his own \\"secret DOD agency.\\"<br /><br />Declared by his friends Ben Hur and Chita Reznik to be a \\"lowdown traitor\\" when this relationship is discovered, Proffi feels isolated, at a crossroads in his life.  Jerusalem is under constant curfews, the British are searching houses for weapons, his parents are involved in an underground movement, and he himself is beginning to become interested in girls--at least in Yardena, the nineteen-year-old sister of Ben Hur.  As we come to know her, the people of the neighborhood, and the people important to Proffi, such as Mr. Gihon, his teacher, we see Proffi's knowledge and insights to be those of a twelve-year-old child whose belief in a bright future is absolute.<br /><br />The powerful, often poetic language of this coming-of-age novel, along with its lively humor and warm understanding of human nature, make this an unforgettable novel of great universality.  Told by an adult narrator who accurately captures Proffi's youthful viewpoint, the novel paints a picture of a loving, scholarly family seeking peace and knowledge, even as they actively try to expel \\"perfidious Albion.\\"  As we watch their interchanges with each other, with Proffi, and with British soldiers, we see them as decent people who want to be left in peace in a homeland of their own, to recover from the traumas of the Holocaust.  Filled with gorgeous sense impressions and images (the description of the father's library is stunning), the novel draws in the reader with its contagious warmth and good humor.

Seventeenth century Hindustan with all its magnificence and cruelty comes radiantly alive in this dual love story which begins with the famed romance of Khurram, later Shah Jahangir, and Arjumand, later known as Mumtaz Mahal.  Her death in childbirth, after bearing over a dozen children, left Jahangir devastated-and determined to create a monument of such splendor that it would forever honor her memory, the Taj Mahal.<br /><br />Narrating the love story of Shah Jahangir and Arjumand and the building of the Taj Mahal, a project which required twenty-two thousand men working for eleven years, is their daughter, Jahanara, now a grandmother and widow.  As the book opens, she has brought her granddaughters to Agra to learn their heritage as the great-grandchildren of Shah Jahangir.  She cautions the girls that Alamgir, her brother, the current Mughul emperor, will kill them if he knows that they are her grandchildren, especially if he knows that they have a younger brother who may someday claim the Peacock Throne.<br /><br />Jahanara begins her tale as a young girl--her father's favorite child--and the narrative fills with colorful details of life in and around the Red Fort, where the royal family resides.  When her mother dies and her father decides to honor her by building a huge monument, he asks seventeen-year-old Jahanara to supervise the building of the Taj Mahal.  She soon finds herself drawn to Ustad Isa, the architect, toward whom she knows she must not betray even a flicker of interest, since she is married.  The period comes alive with its pageantry, misery, bloody wars, and internecine struggles.  Wartime battles alternate with battles for the throne, and Jahanara and Isa battle to sustain their love.  The completion of the Taj Mahal brings a final sense of peace to Shah Jahan, but offers the ultimate challenge for Jahanara and Isa.<br /><br />Though this is a romantic story, with its royal characters facing dramatic events and great danger, author John Shors avoids florid, exaggerated writing in favor of a formal, elegant, and more restrained style.  His vivid descriptions of life in the Mughul court help advance the action and reveal character, instead of existing for their sensational value.  Particularly effective in his pacing, Shors knows what to leave out of the story, wisely confining himself to specific years significant to the love stories and to history.  Speeding up the narrative by dividing the novel into sections, he avoids long transitional passages and lengthy digressions.  An exciting love story, the novel allows the reader to see love through the prism of an exotic time and place.

Author Richard Marinick, himself a local boy, developed his gritty writing style in a prison writing program when he was incarcerated for eleven years for armed robbery, and in this debut novel he presents a candid view of the petty criminals and not-so-petty murderers who operate in a seemingly \\"ordinary\\" urban neighborhood.<br /><br />Jack \\"Wacko\\" Curran and his brother Kevin deal dope to small-time pushers, often resorting to violence to teach other dealers a lesson. Wacko already has one murder to his \\"credit,\\" and he bitterly resents the fact that he has to pay the \\"Fallon tax\\" to Marty Fallon, the biggest boss in Southie.  Wacko is working on three separate projects, much bigger than his drug sales, trying to pull off a million dollar heist of diamonds from a jeweler in Westwood and two huge armored car heists, and he is determined to keep Marty Fallon from cutting into his take.<br /><br />The hard-boiled, supermacho dialogue, local slang, and odd nicknames (the Winger, Maggot, the Animal, Elbow) add realism to the story, as Wacko moves around town, introducing the reader to the complex interrelationships among these men who have decided that being \\"civilians\\" does not pay enough to support their tastes and lifestyles.  The life of a young criminal is a complicated chess game with moves and countermoves as Wacko tests his partners, gets the support he needs, practices split second timing, and plans where and how he will fence or hide his gains.<br /><br />Violent, suspenseful, and realistic, with a huge cast of characters, this masculine novel features only two women, one almost a saint, and the other, a sinner who must pay the price.  There are few hints of any soft, human side for these characters, and love seems not to enter into their relationships with women.  The reader sees how and why Wacko Curran and Kevin think as they do, but in their love of violence, they are not sympathetic characters.  Marinick creates a great deal of suspense, however, and the reader is alternately fascinated by their lives and repulsed by their actions, as they worry more about being betrayed by each other than about being caught by police.  Marinick's conclusion is realistic and satisfying, without being a cop-out.  Mary Whippleny soft, human side for these characters, and love seems not to enter into their relationships with women.

Fans of Tapply's Brady Coyne mysteries will find his new \\"hero,\\" Stonewall Jackson Calhoun, at least as interesting.  Stoney has been living for five years in the southernmost corner of Maine, working at a bait and tackle shop.  He has a woman who loves him, a best friend, a faithful Brittany spaniel, and a house that he has built with his own hands.  What Stoney does not have is a remembered past.  More than six years ago, he was struck by lightning and has lost his ability to call up memories.  All he knows about his past is what people have told him--that he is originally from Beaufort, South Carolina, and that he has an ex-wife about whom he has no recollection.<br /><br />When Fred Green, an out-of-towner, comes into the shop to hire Stoney to take him fishing for native Maine trout, Stoney begs off and calls a young friend, Lyle McMahan, to take his place.  Green, like many dedicated fishermen, knows a secret fishing spot, and when Green and Lyle set out, no one knows exactly where they are going.  When Lyle does not return that night or the next day, Stoney and Kate, who owns the shop, become worried, and Stoney determines to find him.  In a remote area, he finds Lyle's body at the edge of a trout pond, his \\"belly boat\\" deflated.<br /><br />Alternating back and forth in time, the narrative details Stoney's search for Lyle's killer, while revealing Stoney's own background, along with his present life and relationships.  We meet many unique local characters, and we learn about the wooded land Stoney has bought on Bitch Creek, about the Great Fire of 1947, and about the history of the area, the interrelationships of the people who live there, and the Down East spirit which imbues their lives.  Then the mysterious Man in the Suit arrives at his house, unannounced and uninvited, questioning Stoney about what he remembers from the past.<br /><br />The mystery here is well developed and exciting, with confrontations, gunshots, and fights, and Tapply will obviously be able to take Stoney in many new directions as Stoney deals continuously with his fragmentary memories of the past and the unexpected arrival of the Man in the Suit.  The details ring true, the characters are realistic, and the dialogue sounds like real Down East dialogue, filled with long pauses and \\"ay-uhs.\\"  The prose is descriptive, atmospheric, even lyrical--as unpretentious as the Maine woods--and Stoney Calhoun himself is just begging for a new adventure.

Rose Meadows, an orphan needing a place to live and work, answers a vaguely worded newspaper advertisement in 1935 and is hired for unspecified household work by the Mitwissers, for whom \\"disorder was...a rule of life.\\"  Jews who escaped Germany in 1933, they now live in Albany, New York, a place they find vastly different from the intellectual milieu of Europe.  Rudolf Mitwisser, the patriarch, spends his days closeted in his study, researching an obscure group of ninth century Jewish scholars, the Karaites, who reject Talmudic interpretations of traditional Judaism in favor of direct and literal interpretation of the Old Testament.<br /><br />Elsa Mitwisser, formerly a physicist and colleague of Erwin Schrodinger, is distraught that her family is now dependent upon others and regarded as \\"parasites.\\"  Unbalanced and confined to her room, she, like her husband, ignores the responsibilities of the family and their five children.  The Mitwissers have been \\"adopted\\" by James A'Bair, a young man with an independent income.  As the inspiration and model for the Bear Books, a children's series written by his father, James collects substantial royalties.  Believing himself to be a Karaite, James supports Mitwisser's research, provides funds for the family, and occasionally participates in their domestic life.<br /><br />Moving elliptically through past and present, the narrative explores the backgrounds of all the main characters, traveling forward and backward simultaneously.  Focusing on character and theme, rather than plot, Ozick creates an intense world in which each person seeks the fulfillment of personal dreams, which glimmer on the horizon like fireflies, fragile hopes that may die before they come to fruition.  Mitwisser, regarded as a great scholar in Europe, finds his research of little interest to Jewish scholars here.  Elsa Mitwisser, envious because her colleague, Schrodinger, ended up winning the Nobel Prize, believes history has wronged her.  Rose tries to give \\"symmetry, routine, propriety\\" to her life, but her past keeps intruding.

Thomas Mistler, the founder and CEO of a world-renowned, New York advertising agency, is not a very likable person.  A self-indulgent WASP who enjoys the high life, he is accustomed to getting his own way both in business and in his personal life.  Married  to an \\"appropriate,\\" pedigreed wife, with whom he has an appropropriate, conventional home life, he also pursues other women attracted to his \\"glitz.\\"  Suddenly, Mistler discovers that he has liver cancer, too far advanced to make treatment a viable option without interfering with the quality of his remaining days.<br /><br />With remarkable sang-froid, Mistler decides not to tell his family, feigning a business trip to Europe so that he can have a week by himself in Venice to prepare for the inevitable.  To his surprise, he discovers a young woman in his hotel room, a photographer he has just met at a dinner party who is attracted to him but also wants to work for his agency.  With Lena he revisits many of his favorite places, and indulges in sensual pleasures, fine wines, and foods before his insensitivity drives her away.<br /><br />Alone, Mistler explores his past and contemplates his relationships with his father, his father's mistress (Tante Elizabeth, whom he adores), his wife and son (who has escaped to the West Coast to become a writer), friends from school, and ultimately, \\"the girl who got away,\\" a Radcliffe classmate when he was at Harvard, who is now living in Venice.  Unsentimental, Mistler makes no excuses for what he gradually begins to see as his faults.  While he knows he will not change, at this point, he also knows, as an advertising man, that he has the power to affect how he himself may be viewed in the future if he acts appropriately now.<br /><br />The Venice setting is perfect for this book about a man contemplating death.  The canals are polluted and devoid of life, and the city itself survives only through an enormous effort to hold back the sea.  Resembling Hades and its series of rivers, Venice also features gondoliers in black boats who resemble Charon, the old man who ferries the dead across the River Styx to Hades, and when Mistler buys a black wherry from a boatman, all the imagery comes together.  Though the main character may not be someone with whom the reader will identify, his behavior and actions are consistent with his personality.  Author Begley conveys Mistler's formality and his inner feelings in elegant language, completely appropriate for Mistler, and his insights into life's big questions are thoughtful.

In this blackest of black comedies, Obie Award-winning playwright Christopher Durang tackles some of the saddest and most emotionally devastating issues in life and somehow wrests  humor from them.  Focusing on the marriage of Bette and Boo as the linchpin around which all the action turns, he shows them apparently following the examples of their families, as they marry without a lot of thought, and then suffer.  Their son Matt (Skippy) is the narrator for many of the scenes, sometimes commenting on events in which he could not have participated, as he tries to make some sense out of his family history.  \\"Life must be ordered and then carefully considered,\\" he intones in the opening scene, adding in the next scene that \\"when all the facts are not immediately available, one must try to reconstruct them\\" through \\"hearsay, gossip, and apocryphal stories.\\"<br /><br />The circumstances which are the grist for Durang's onstage humor are unlikely subjects for humor, to say the least.  Boo is an alcoholic and does not communicate.  Bette, who has an Rh problem (in the years before this was treatable), insists on believing her priest and not her doctor and gives birth to four dead babies during the play.  Her father, Paul, a stroke victim, insists on talking but can't be understood.  One sister, Emily, suffers a breakdown after leaving a convent but still believes in miracles.  Another sister has a disastrous marriage.  The priest, called on for help in several scenes, jokes about Paul's speech problems and even about an albino humpback with a harelip, and can never stay on-topic.  One character dies while eating cake and spends much of the play sitting in a chair, covered with a sheet.  Another dies of cancer.<br /><br />Because the play's thirty-three short scenes jump around in time and location, the author has included extensive notes at the end of the script, indicating how split-second scene changes can take place, how sets can be designed, how the costuming can be adapted from scene to scene, what music to include, and even how the characters can be played. A reader would find it helpful to read these first in order to imagine the production.  The humor is black, and the existential message of the play will not appeal to everyone, but for those fascinated by a writer's ability to turn even the darkest of subjects into a contemporary comedy, this is a play not to be missed.

When Valerie rents a remote cottage in a small town near Sligo, she hopes to find a place where she can rest and get a grip on her life and respite from the horrors that have enveloped her in Dublin.  Introduced to the Guinness-drinking regulars at the local bar by Finbar, who has rented her the cottage, she and they soon explore some of the big mysteries of life.  Irish playwright Conor McPherson uses Valerie's arrival at the bar as the pivot around which all the action turns in this 1997 play.<br /><br />The regulars have arrived at the bar before Valerie, and the audience observes the relationships among Brendan, the bar owner, who obviously respects and trusts his customers (enough to allow them behind the bar to put their money into the till on their own), and Jack and Jim, who obviously like and trust Brendan in return.  Their conversation is filled with the everyday smalltalk of local men of long acquaintance-whether the Guinness tap is working, what they are going to do the next day at work, whether Finbar is attracted to the new resident, and what she looks like.  When Valerie arrives, they vie to outdo each other in her eyes, telling a series of eerie stories, each involving ghosts and death in the locality and each story more dramatic than the previous one.<br /><br />When Valerie tells her own story, which is real, the ghost stories of the past pale in comparison.  The Irish love of story-telling, the concern with death and the afterlife, reports of visions and hauntings, and the desire to connect with others in an effort to avoid the loneliness of grief all magnify the impact of Valerie's story on her audience.  Told in plain, common speech (full of \\"ems\\" and \\"ers\\"), the play has a subtlety and elegance of concept that goes beyond the surface, as reality is shown to be even more dramatic than the fantastic stories the men have presented.  As Brendan, Finbar, Jack, and Jim make connections with Valerie, the need for humans to explain tragedy and to comfort each other in the face of  death and grief becomes a major theme.  Simple in presentation, this is a thoughtful story which plumbs the realities of Irish country life while it explores the big questions of humankind.

A distant and autocratic king, Charles fails to take into account the enormous religious changes sweeping both Europe and England and undermining his own power.  Puritanical grassroots movements have now sprung up, with many local leaders, both religious and civil, calling for reform and purification.  John Brigge, a coroner living in the remote countryside, is one of twelve reform-minded governors aiding Nathaniel Challoner, the Master, in his \\"Revolution of the Saints\\" and his project to \\"build a city on the hill.\\"<br /><br />Though he attends the prescribed protestant church, Brigg is in reality a \\"papistical malignant,\\" a man who walks the difficult line between the Puritanism of the Master, a lifelong friend, and his belief that \\"men must have mercy, for without mercy we are savages.\\"  When Brigge is suddenly called to conduct an inquest on an infant found dead in a local pub, he discovers that Katherine Shay, a Catholic deemed \\"prideful, brazen, and uncontrite,\\" has been arrested for the murder.<br /><br />With numerous subplots and much intrigue, the story of Katherine Shay's arrest and John Brigge's search for justice on her behalf evolves.  The period comes to life on every level of society as the author shows in realistic detail the kinds of gruesome punishments meted out for \\"sins,\\" the harshness of life for the homeless poor, the dependence of farmers on luck and weather, the fragility of life, the excesses of religious extremism, and the abiding power of love.  Realistically presented motivations for some of the extreme behavior in the novel make the Puritan characters come alive, as John Brigge, a man who sees more than one side to each issue, becomes a protagonist for whom the reader develops much sympathy.<br /><br />The elegant and formal language of the novel resembles that of the Bible.  Filled with observations of the harsh natural world but revealing the humanity of the main characters, the novel has a rare historical integrity and unity, with poignant applications to the present day.  Despite its forbidding subject matter, the novel is exciting--full of well-paced action and suspense. Many characters have biblical parallels, obvious in their names--Elizabeth, Deborah, Starman, and John Brigge, sometimes known as Germanus.  The religious parallels are unobtrusive during the body of the novel, but the ending is overtly symbolic and didactic, the book's artistry and elegance subordinated to message, and its thematic balance and restraint sacrificed to an overly obvious, religious conclusion.

As exciting as a police procedural, this novel is, instead, a \\"fireman's procedural,\\" tracing the story of a fire lieutenant's death twenty-five years ago in an arson fire, the failed hunt for the pyromaniac who set it, and the \\"pyro's\\" possible return to action in Seattle during a spate of recent arsons.  Twenty-nine-year-old Paul Wollf is the son of this lieutenant, who died when Wollf was only four, an event which destroyed his childhood.  His mother, unable to cope, descended into depression and alcoholism and neglected the children.  Six years later, they witnessed her murder by their stepfather, who was then murdered himself.  When a string of recent arsons keeps the station busy all night for several nights in a row, Wolff notices an odd \\"signature\\" to the fires, the same \\"signature\\" that appeared at the fire that killed his father twenty-five years ago.<br /><br />Determined to avenge his father's death, Wollf is often stymied by jealousies and bureaucracy within his own department.  An angry man who has never been able to form close relationships, perhaps due to his traumatic past, Wollf has no one in whom he can confide.  When his favorite film star of the past, the elderly Patricia Pennington, is the victim of one of these new fires, Wollf meets both her granddaughter and housekeeper, two women of markedly different temperaments, both of whom play key roles in the events which follow.<br /><br />A probationary firefighter, a stationhouse veteran, Patricia Pennington's granddaughter, Wollf, and the \\"pyro\\" himself all tell the story in first-person accounts, broadening the focus and casting new light on Wollf, the inner workings of the fire department, and the madness of pyromania.  Acutely psychological and intense in the search for the \\"pyro,\\" the novel also sheds light on some of the reasons firemen are drawn to the job and the games some are willing to play in order acquire power.<br /><br />For author Earl Emerson, himself a lieutenant in the Seattle Fire Department, realism is critical.  Technical aspects of fighting fires, venting roofs, using fans to drive out smoke, handling ladders, and saving lives are fascinating, fully described, and completely integrated into this exciting story.  The complexities of bureaucracy, the reality of public relations and publicity, and the difficulties of managing personal relationships are also part of the realism.  A fast-paced action novel filled with dramatic fire-fighting scenes, the novel is a tribute to the heroic men and women who risk their lives daily.  Mary Whippleis critical.

Focusing on the life of Henry James, Colm Toibin's The Master goes beyond the usual \\"novelization\\" of someone's biography. Toibin has done a tremendous amount of research and has obviously read everything James has written, but he has so distilled this information that he actually recreates Henry James. Most remarkably, he does this while using the third person point of view to tell the story, preserving the objective tone but bringing forth characters and events so vibrant with life that Toibin's James is the man we know from his novels, letters, and journals.<br /><br />When the novel opens in 1895, James's play, Guy Domville, has been booed on its opening night. James, now fifty-two, has hoped for a career as a playwright, believing success on stage will put an end to \\"his long solitary days\\" and allow him to spend more time among actors, whom he finds fascinating. Described as \\"a great stranger...observing the world as a mere watcher from the window,\\" James is a lonely, solitary figure throughout the novel, a man unable to form a committed relationship with anyone, either male or female, sometimes wanting companionship but not closeness, and always needing solitude to work. Through flashbacks, Toibin shows how James's early upbringing may have been partly responsible for his feelings of isolation.<br /><br />When James begins writing his stories and novels, he draws inspiration from the people he knows best and the events which have affected their lives and his own. His sister Alice is the model for a child in The Turn of the Screw, his cousin Minny Temple is the inspiration for several of his most important female characters-in \\"Poor Richard,\\" Daisy Miller, and Portrait of a Lady--and his brother Wilky's wounds in the Civil War provide James with details he includes in other stories. Virtually every aspect of James's life works its way into a story, and as he gets inside the psyches of his characters through his fiction, he reveals his own psyche, his sympathies, and his personal conflicts.<br /><br />Toibin's dual focus on James's life and its embodiment in his fiction give powerful immediacy and verisimilitude to this novel, and one cannot help but feel an emotional connection to James. His connections to great families and writers whose names are well known, and to people willing to accept James completely on his own terms provide Toibin with unlimited source material. It is Toibin's own talents in ordering this information, bringing it to life, and revealing its importance, however, which make this masterful novel so important.

Opening in 1955, when the French are battling insurgents for control of Algeria, Anna, a Swiss resident and former circus performer, and Nassreddine, a Berber from the mountains of Algeria, travel by bus from a remote mountain village to Algiers to formalize their marriage.  As the bus makes its way through the countryside, it is stopped by French soldiers, and Nassreddine is arrested, taken to jail, and tortured unmercifully.  Anna is forced to go on to the village without him, but when Nassreddine finally escapes and makes his way back, he finds his mother's house empty.<br /><br />Alternating back and forth in time, author Benmalek traces the lives of Anna and Nassreddine and their parents, separately and together, for seventy years, in the process giving the political and social history of Algeria.  Whether under the rule of the French in the 1950s or the Algerian Liberation Front (FLN), which defeated them, ordinary citizens live lives fraught with danger.  Armed Islamic fundamentalists, which fought both the French and the Liberation Front for control of the population in the 1950s, have, by 1997 become a major force.  Torture, murders, mutilations, and executions, for which the French were condemned, have continued into the 1990s.<br /><br />Into this atmosphere of civil war in 1996, Anna, now in her sixties, returns to Algiers from Switzerland in search of Nassreddine.  Hiring Jallal, a nine-year-old orphan who sells peanuts and individual cigarettes to act as a translator, and wearing a traditional haik, she is determined to make her way back to Nassreddine's home village, the place they had always agreed to use as their common contact point.  Anna's story alternates with that of Nassreddine and moves back and forth in time as both try to reach the village.<br /><br />This story of a great love that crosses boundaries is not for the faint of heart.  As the lives of Anna and Nassreddine, Jallal (the boy-translator), their parents, and their friends come to life, the reader is exposed to unimaginable horrors.  Though the novel is melodramatic, it is not melodrama for the sake of false emotion.  Life in Algeria is tenuous at best, survival seems almost accidental, and everyone is a pawn of someone else.  The ending will not satisfy all readers, but it is consistent with the demonstrated fragility of life throughout the novel.  Dramatic, horrifying, sensuously descriptive, but offering no promises of a glorious future, the novel is a grim reminder that when governments do not protect individuals, love and understanding are all that is left to give meaning to life.

Philip Roth, in this first of the Nathan Zuckerman novels, published in 1979, introduces Nathan as a twenty-three-year-old graduate of the University of Chicago who has had  four short stories published and is looking for a mentor.  Having contacted famed writer E. I. Lonoff, a writer living in rural New England with his wife of 35 years, he has accepted Lonoff's invitation to visit, but a snowstorm arises and Zuckerman finds himself spending the night with Lonoff and his wife.  His observations about the life of Lonoff leads him to imagine many stories--about Lonoff's past, his possible relationship with a young former student, and about his life in the countryside.  In addition, Zuckerman also reminisces about his own past, his relationships with his family, his feelings toward his own writing, his possible obligations to Jewish history, and the imagined past of Amy, Lonoff's former student, who resembles Anne Frank.<br /><br />Though Zuckerman is full of hopes for a broader relationship with Lonoff, he soon discovers that his idol is a petulant and insecure man who has used and, in some cases, emotionally abused, those around him, all in the name of \\"art.\\"  Spending a sleepless winter night on the couch in Lonoff's den, Zuckerman investigates Lonoff's library, especially Lonoff's collection of the writings of Henry James, whom Lonoff admires so much, tries to write a letter to his estranged father (who is appalled by one of Nathan's recent short stories, which, he feels, feeds anti-Semitic prejudice), and ponders the relationship between genuine creativity, editing and revision, and the possible responsibilities of a writer beyond his own creative impulse.<br /><br />A story about the writing of stories, this novella explores the fictional lives writers create from their own lives and the sacrifices they make.  As Lonoff's wife says of Lonoff, \\"Not living is what he makes his beautiful fiction out of.\\"  Lonoff himself says, \\"I turn sentences around...That's my life.\\"  And Henry James says in a motto Lonoff has framed in his den, \\"We give what we have.  Our doubt is our passion and passion is our task.\\"  When Zuckerman leaves Lonoff's house the next morning, he no longer sees Lonoff as an idol, but Zuckerman is still committed to his destiny as a writer, anxious to go to a writers' retreat to work on some new stories.  Thoughtful, imaginative, and great fun to read, The Ghost Writer is one of Roth's most tightly organized and revelatory works, essential reading for anyone interested in the creative process.

The rich story-telling tradition of the Middle East enlivens Turkish author Pamuk's novel about the residents of Kars, a town in the remote northeast corner of Turkey, once a crossroads for trade between Turkey, Soviet Georgia, Armenia, and Iran, but now a place of enormous poverty. Ka, a poet with writer's block, arrives in Kars at the beginning of a three-day blizzard, sometime in the early 1990s, to investigate a spate of suicides by young women forbidden to wear headscarves in school, but he is also there hoping to reconnect with his life-long love, Ipek, who is now single.<br /><br />All the conflicting political and religious movements of the country are exemplified in Kars--socialism and communism, atheism, political secularism, Kurdish nationalism, and the most rapidly growing movement, Islamist fundamentalism, and Ka comes into contact with all of them. As he investigates the girls' suicides and becomes reacquainted with Ipek, he also witnesses the coffeeshop shooting of the Director of Education, the man who has carried out the government's orders to ban the \\"headscarf girls\\" from school. His assailant is a young member of the Freedom Fighters for Islamic Justice, a group Ka comes to know. A military coup at the National Theater begins when soldiers burst in, shoot randomly into the audience, kill a number of people, then round up \\"dangerous\\" citizens, including some of the people Ka has visited. Ultimately, Ka's life is in danger, and Ipek must choose whether to go with him to Germany or to stay in Kars.<br /><br />Articulate in its depiction of almost inexplicable contradictions, Snow is not a western novel and does not adhere to western literary conventions of plot or character. The execution of the Director of Education, the army coup, and the follow-up are used primarily as vehicles for exploring the many competing philosophical and political movements, a focus on abstractions rarely seen in American literary fiction. The plot is absorbing for a reader who is interested in politics and religion, but the novel may be slow for readers looking for a plot- or character-based novel. The characters, while intriguing, are more representative of types than individuals.<br /><br />Published in Turkey and Europe before September 11, the novel has an ominous prescience to it. Rich with insights into rapidly rising fundamentalist movements and why they seek our destruction, this haunting novel is many-leveled, beautifully wrought, and complex. Packed with ironies, dark humor, and enough symbolism to keep a symbol-hunter busy for days, this realistic depiction of the environment in which extremist movements take root and flourish is a chilling reminder of how the world has changed.

Author Danticat introduces her story of Haitian immigrants and the lives they have escaped in Haiti with the story of Ka, a young sculptress whose parents think of her as a \\"good angel,\\" her name also associated symbolically with the Egyptian Book of the Dead.  Ka is in Florida with her father to deliver a powerfully rendered sculpture to a Haitian TV actress.  Ka's father, who served as the model for the sculpture, however, destroys it, confessing tearfully that he is not the man his daughter has always believed him to be, and admitting that the disfiguring scar on his face was not the result of torture in a Haitian prison.  He was \\"the hunter,\\" he says, and \\"not the prey,\\" one of the \\"dew breakers,\\" or torturers, who as part of the Tonton Macoutes, committed political assassinations and inflicted unimaginable tortures on orders of dictators Francois Duvalier and his son \\"Baby Doc\\" between 1957-86.<br /><br />In a series of episodes which resemble short stories more than a novel in form, Danticat illuminates the lives of approximately a dozen Haitian immigrants as they remember this traumatic period \\"back home.\\"  As the \\"novel\\" alternates between past and present, it is told from disparate points of view--those of Ka's mother and father, a young man visiting Haiti after ten years to see his blinded aunt, a wedding seamstress in New York, a Haitian-American reporter investigating a possible \\"dew-breaker,\\" a man remembering a Haitian friend's long-ago disappearance as he awaits his son's birth in New York, and a popular Haitian preacher whose arrest affects lives for many years.<br /><br />The novel gains much of its power from the horrors of vividly described torture and the overwhelming fear engendered by the Tonton Macoute militia.  By calling up such emotionally charged memories and presenting them in a series of episodes, the author can let the personal stories unfold without having to order events so that they lead to a grand climax.  What distinguishes this \\"novel\\" from a short story collection, however, is the repeating motifs that appear throughout these seemingly separate episodes (a man's widow's peak, a woman's fear of cemeteries, for example), and by the end of the novel the connections among all the characters become obvious.  A vivid documentation of many of the worst human rights abuses of the century, Danticat's novel is a moving testament to the Haitians' resilient spirit and a celebration of their survival.

The result is a surprising, ironic, and black-humored musical comedy in which the circumstances which defeated Willie Loman are given a sardonic, contemporary twist. Though the characters' actions often directly parallel those in the original play, they are viewed through a radically different lens and take on new interpretations, for which the author provides three totally different endings.<br /><br />In Margulies's version, Herbie Loman, the salesman, his wife Doris, and sons Stewie (age fourteen) and Mitchell (age eleven) live in a Coney Island high-rise. Stewie is about to have his bar mitzvah, and Doris has invited almost two hundred people to a celebration they really cannot afford. Stewie, fulfilling the role of Biff in the original play, has been told by his teacher that he is such a good student that he should not rule out attending an Ivy League college, eventually, though his mother declares, \\"We are City College. We're not like those people.\\" Mitchell, his brother, has just studied Death of a Salesman in school. He is writing a musical comedy version of the play as his school project, and he has already completed a couple of songs.<br /><br />Doris's Aunt Marsha fulfills the role of Willie's brother Ben in the original play and makes several ghostly appearances, as Doris becomes this play's central focus. When the question of how Herbie is to pay for the bar mitzvah becomes a emotional and financial crisis, the author changes the mood by launching into young Mitchell's musical comedy. In Mitchell's play, he suggests the family all go on a picnic, while he sings \\"What a perfect day for a picnic/ We'll toast marshmallows in the sun!\\"<br /><br />Music is used for ironic effect throughout, with \\"Autumn Leaves\\" opening the play, and the overture to \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Sunrise, Sunset\\" putting the action into perspective at other points. When Stewie does a soft-shoe dance in Mitchell's musical comedy, his song \\"Something funny with our dad...Planting carrot seeds by moonlight,\\" takes on a dark, mordant tone. The three endings each seem plausible, depending on one's own interpretation of the events. In giving new life and a new slant to the original play, Margulies may not please traditionalists, but he may succeed in reaching a whole new audience for whom the original play may feel a bit dated.

Grittier and less romantic than Shoeless Joe by W. P. Kinsella (and its film, Field of Dreams), this novel tells the story of Ethan Allen, known as E. A., the son of single mother Gypsy Lee.  Eight years old when the novel opens, E. A. lives in Kingdom Common, a rural Vermont town which may be the most baseball-loving town in America.<br /><br />E. A. is needier than many other local children because no one will tell him who his father is.  His mother, Gypsy Lee, who left college after her freshman year, now works as a one-woman escort service and part-time singer/songwriter, living with her crotchety mother, who took to her wheelchair and refused ever to walk again after the Red Sox's 1978 pennant loss when Bucky Dent hit a home run for the Yankees.  When E.

When Sam Richardson returns home to Wigton, a small village in Cumbria, after World War II, he recognizes his limited future there and the social barriers.  Because his wife Ellen and small son Joe have spent their entire lives there, however, he chooses to remain, rather than go to Australia to start a new life, and he must now learn to adapt to peace as effectively as he once adapted to war. Wigton, however, represents \\"his limitations, his predestined mediocrity, his inevitable failure to be at the full stretch of himself,\\" and he feels stifled.<br /><br />Small events and everyday life, not dramatic plot lines, become the focus of the novel as Sam works at the local factory, tries to reestablish his relationship with his wife Ellen, and serves as a masculine role model for his son Joe.  Sam is an Everyman--a man without an education who is dependent upon \\"the system\\" for his family's welfare, a man who must put up with slights and insults by his factory bosses if he wants to keep his job, a man for whom there is little or no opportunity for independent thought and action.  Sam's big decision to set up his own business is a decision he makes alone, even though it will require enormous sacrifices by the whole family.<br /><br />The daily lives of the Richardson family reveal the social, political, and economic issues of rural England from the end of the war through 1954. Dividing the novel into several sections, Bragg conveys the viewpoints of Sam, Ellen, and Joe through plain-spoken dialogues and interior monologues, short sentences, and simple vocabulary.  We see Ellen's joy at finally having a house of her own in Greenacres, a public housing development, but also her dislike of the distance from town.  We understand Sam's joy at having his business but recognize how hard the entire family works and how little privacy they have.  Young Joe, on whom much of the book focuses, suffers almost overwhelming fears, and we empathize with him because there is no one in whom he can confide and still be a \\"man.\\"  Bragg's interest is not in creating an artificially \\"literary\\" novel as much as it is in recreating real (ordinary) lives.  In this he is completely successful, creating a broad picture of the postwar era through the details of one family's struggle.

Exploring the lives of ordinary shop salesmen, both at home and at work, as they struggle to make ends meet, she juxtaposes them against some of their wealthy clients, highlighting dramatically the economic contrasts in their lives and the differences in their expectations. From her opening description of the raucous awakening of a small neighborhood, she presents the kinds of homely details which make the setting easy to visualize, despite the cultural differences.<br /><br />Ramchand, now twenty-six, has been working as an assistant at the Sevak Sari House since he was fifteen, doing the same job day after day, going to a small dhaba with some of the other assistants for something to eat at night and sometimes to the movies. He has little hope of improving his station and, with his parents dead and no family in the city, little opportunity to meet a marriageable young woman or change his lonely life. Through flashbacks, the reader learns about Ramchand's family background and how he came to live alone in Amritsar.<br /><br />As Bajwa slowly draws the reader into the lives of other characters, the reader empathizes with them. Kamla, the wife of Chander, another of the shop assistants, is an especially pathetic case, a young woman who has been victimized by society, her husband, and her husband's former employers. Rina Kapoor, daughter of the wealthiest man in Amritsar, however, is also, in some ways, a victim of her economic situation, as are the women for whom shopping for saris is a primary activity. Only a few women here seek independent lives, these being women for whom it is an option because of their economic privilege. Kamla has no such options. When the lives of Ramchand, Kamla, Rina, and Chander intersect in a shocking climax, lives change forever.<br /><br />The stunning ending is melodramatic, and Ramchand's change of character may not be completely realistic, but the story moves effectively from its quiet character study at the beginning into a compelling story of characters whose lives overlap, often unwittingly. Sometimes darkly humorous, the story has considerable charm because Ramchand himself inspires empathy. Intimate and thoughtful in its depiction of the various social strata which make up the community, the novel is more understated--less sensational and less political--than some of the more panoramic epics which have come from India in the past decade.

In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief.  Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate.  When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore.  Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"<br /><br />Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's staid pronouncements and failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims.  When Henry asserts that Porphyria Fire Insurance Co. is on the verge of collapse, Helen and Margaret persuade Leonard Bast, a young clerk they have befriended, to resign his position there, only to have him later \\"downsized\\" out of his subsequent bank job.  Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.<br /><br />Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on those over whom they have little control.  Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, must try to educate a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success.  When Helen returns from Germany, where she has been living, and Henry and his family discover she is pregnant, Henry's belief that her condition reflects negatively upon himself and his family inspires a disaster with far-reaching consequences.<br /><br />Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry.  Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it.  With the action centered around the Wilcox home at Howard's End, the reader realizes that the estate is a microcosm of the country and that its conflicts are those of the nation.  Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years.

As soon as Veronica Moore, a scriptwriter for the long-running daytime drama, \\"Ordinary Matters,\\" meets Alex, a new actor on the show, she is smitten, and their mutual attraction soon blossoms. There's only one problem. Alex is the unsuspecting father of her sister Lillian's unborn baby. Lillian, with both an MD and a PhD in neuroscience, has found her biological clock ticking and no prospective husband on the horizon. After glimpsing Alex at a bar, she has deemed him a suitable sperm donor, taken him back to the apartment, and afterward dismissed him, planning never to see him again.<br /><br /> As the story alternates between the present and the past, showing the Moores' bizarre family history, the story of Veronica and Lillian grows in depth and complexity. Their lives soon become more outrageous than anything Veronica ever dreamed up in a script. Every melodramatic cliche comes true in this plot--characters have hidden pasts, love goes wrong, a private investigator uncovers secrets, families are brought together and then pulled apart, \\"dead\\" people come to life, and people's remembrances prove faulty. Plot-wise, this is as over-the-top as any romance or melodrama you may ever read.<br /><br /> McPhee is a unique and surprising writer, however, with a firm grounding in science. She presents her wild plot not for its own sake or for sensationalism, but to illustrate true science, which underlies all behavior, even bizarre behavior. The soap opera-like plot combines with elements of biology and neurobiology, including details of Lillian's pregnancy, the neurology of the senses, the \\"neurobiology of humor,\\" the physiology and neurology of the brain, and the meaning of consciousness. A dominant theme is the inability of humans to predict events that can either open their lives to new opportunities or destroy their hopes.<br /><br /> Though the mixing of elaborate melodrama with pure science may seem strange, McPhee is largely successful, but the hard science within the novel requires explication, which she provides. This creates an analytical, objective tone, inimical to character development, since characters do not develop through their actions when both the characters and actions are used to illustrate specific (scientific) ideas. Although Alex remarks that \\"an audience does not expect a story to be literal,\\" Veronica's comments may be more appropriate: \\"It wasn't that she felt manipulated, it was that she hadn't been manipulated well enough.\\" This reader wished that the novel had manipulated her just a bit more effectively, but it is still great fun to read, often humorous, and full of ironies--and that, of course, is \\"no ordinary matter.\\" Mary Whippleplication, which she provides.

Though she recognizes him immediately as a writer whose works she &quot;loves,&quot; and though she has his most recent novel, The Unexpected Man, in her purse, she does not speak to him and is too embarrassed to take out his book. Each character speaks his thoughts aloud, the separate monologues constituting the &quot;action&quot; of the play. Parsky is bitter about life and thinks of himself as something of a personal and professional failure, preoccupied by minor health problems, the disconnects between himself and his children, and the remarks made about his books by critics and friends. Martha reminisces about her own life and how Parsky's novels parallel her real life experience and that of her friends, especially Serge, a dear friend who died at seventy-six.<br /><br /> While Parsky is mulling over comments on his work and thinking that his observations have &quot;no value in the practice of literature,&quot; Martha is silently conversing with him, telling him that &quot;you personally invent protective misunderstandings, because you're haunted by the fear of being understood.&quot; While he wonders if there is &quot;anyone in the whole world who might know how to read [The Unexpected Man],&quot; Martha is revealing her superior understanding of both him and his book, which she finally takes from her purse to read. When, at the end of the &quot;play,&quot; an awkward conversation finally begins, Parsky, not admitting his identity, tries to persuade Martha that the author of the book is irritating, selfish, and unable &quot;to turn a single moment into an eternity.&quot;<br /><br /> Published in 1998, and translated from the French by Christopher Hampton, Yasmina Reza's &quot;play&quot; is not a play in the traditional sense. Though the audience comes to know both characters through their monologues, they do not interact until briefly at the end, and though both may learn something, especially Parsky, the moment of recognition--in which light dawns on one of the characters as a result of the action in the play--is so brief it is almost unrecognizable. Witty and filled with thoughtful comments about life, eternity, and the meaning of literature, this subtle drama leaves most of the action up to the viewer's imagination, creating, ironically, &quot;a nostalgia for what's never taken place.&quot; Mary Whipplee end, and though both may learn something, especially Parsky, the moment of recognition--in which light dawns on one of the characters as a result of the action in the play--is so brief it is almost unrecognizable.

Scarred both physically and emotionally, Melissa lives alone, unable to work. Charlene Chase, Ronnie's mother, is also devastated by the accident, which contributed to her divorce, the loss of her job, and her binge eating. Though her older son Philip is recuperating at home in Radnor after a strange accident in which he fell from a fire escape in New York, Charlene has little interest in him, herself, or anything else. Suddenly, Charlene and Philip receive a middle-of-the-night phone call from Melissa Moody, whom neither of them has seen in five years. At two a.m., she arrives, nine months pregnant, announcing to Charlene and Philip that she is carrying Ronnie's baby, though Ronnie has been dead for five years.<br /><br />Alternating between the present and five years in the past, author John Searles establishes the relationship between Ronnie and Melissa, their activities on the night of the prom, and the relationship each has with his/her parents. At the same time, he reveals through specific, homely details, the hopelessness and squalor of Melissa's and Charlene's present lives--their lack of hygiene, their untidy living conditions, and their total disinterest in the present world. Melissa has taped Ronnie's photographs to the dashboard of her trash-filled car and still has her prom corsage in her freezer, while Charlene has made a shrine of Ronnie's room and refuses to let anyone enter it. Philip, the living son, is ignored, though he has been living an equally hopeless life in New York.<br /><br />As Philip and his mother try to deal with the mystery of Melissa's pregnancy and her insistence that she has had no lovers, the author introduces peripheral characters--Melissa's landlords, her parents, and Charlene's ex-husband--and soon real danger threatens their lives. The symbols, omens, and portents the author inserts into the narrative (especially the crows) are obviously used to increase tension and to highlight private secrets, revelations, and bizarre plot twists. The dramatic changes made by some characters, especially Charlene, strain credulity, since they come suddenly and with little preamble, but they are necessary to resolve the Gothic plot. Some readers may be put off by the intrusive personal detail, some of which seems unnecessary, and by the amount of coincidence, but, overall, this is a good summer read--a suspenseful popular novel which builds to a blockbuster conclusion.

Many of the local residents are working as extras for &quot;forty smackaronies a day,&quot; including Charlie Conlon and Jake Quinn, both in their mid-thirties, through whose eyes we observe the lives of the real residents of Kerry, a world dramatically different from what is being recorded on film. For the director and crew of the film and for Caroline Giovanni, the American star, the daily takes and on-set activity are, unfortunately, the only reality. When Sean Harkin, a dream-filled, 17-year-old local boy with crushed hopes, is humiliated by the film crew, and, depressed, puts stones in his pockets and drowns himself, this wry and exuberant social commentary tackles important themes and achieves a universality and significance that are rare in comedy.<br /><br /> Winner of the Olivier Award in 2000, this play by Marie Jones features fourteen characters played by two actors, whose role changes occur instantaneously. These include, among others, the roles of the film's star, Caroline Giovanni; Mickey Riordan, a 70-year-old local man whose only claim to fame is that he was an extra in The Quiet Man; Clem, a British Director; Jock Campbell, a Scottish security man; and Dave, a Cockney crew member. Requiring a variety of accents and quick-change artistry, this is a daunting play for all but the most ambitious director and most versatile of actors. The two actors reflect moods that range from satiric amusement at the silliness of the film industry to righteous anger at the insensitivity of the film crew, from poignant understanding of Sean's dreams to the guilt-filled helplessness of the friend who witnessed Sean's death, and from Charlie's hopeless cynicism about the possibilities of getting his own script produced to Jake's infectious optimism about &quot;taking on the real world.&quot;<br /><br /> As the village and the film crew come together at Sean's wake and funeral, the themes of real life vs. reel life, the importance of dreams and need to keep working for them, and the acknowledgment that genuine respect must underlie meaningful human relationships permeate the play but never intrude. This is a comedy, after all, and as Jake and Charlie come to new recognitions about themselves and think about their future lives, the audience is there with them, rooting for their success.

Coal is now as valuable in his country as gold, and whoever obtains it is likely to win the war. With ambassadors, government officials, and agents constantly changing sides and selling each other out, D. is unable to trust anyone. Formerly a professor of medieval French and an expert in the Song of Roland, D.'s world has been shattered. In the past two years, his wife has been killed, and he's been buried alive, tortured, and jailed. Soon he meets an attractive, young Englishwoman, is implicated in the deaths of two people, has his credentials stolen, and ends up on the run from both the police and his own compatriots.<br /><br /> Published in 1939, this is one of Greene's most exciting &quot;entertainments.&quot; A thriller of the first order, this novel also deals with big themes, not religious conflicts of his major novels, but the idea of justice, as a good man finds himself hunted for his political allegiances and learns that his own survival and that of his country depend upon his willingness to kill his enemies. A formal, courtly scholar, D. has discovered war is not glamorous, as it is in the Song of Roland, that innocent people are killed, and that survival is not a matter of divine intervention as much as it is a result of forethought and cleverness.<br /><br /> Told entirely from D.'s perspective, presumably the &quot;right&quot; perspective in Greene's mind, the reader sees D. as less heroic than he might be and the villains as less villainous. D. is well developed and realistic, however, and he wrestles with issues as his readers might. Set just before World War II, Greene here foreshadows some of the themes with which he struggles in his more contemplative novels--the nature of good and evil, man's constant struggle with guilt, the trauma of betrayal, and the fear of failure. Though there is a female love interest, Rose Cullen, the daughter of Lord Benditch, who owns the coal mines, she is neither plausible nor sufficiently thoughtful to add to the themes here. Ironies abound, and while the novel lacks the light touch and humor which make a novel like Our Man in Havana so successful, this is an exciting story which casts light on important ideas.

Mediocre sculptor Max Ogorodov miraculously creates a statue that is extraordinarily lifelike, seeming to breathe on its pedestal. Focusing on Aglaya and the statue, from the &quot;glories&quot; of the Stalin Era through Krushchev, Brezhnev and his successors, including Gorbachev, and on up to the present, the novel illustrates satirically the successive changes in Soviet philosophy and focus. These new visions of reality always involve some sort of terror.<br /><br /> When Stalin falls from grace, Aglaya falls, too, and when the party determines that the statue of Stalin will be purged from the square, Aglaya arranges with the salvager to convey the statue to her living room, which, with its 3-meter high ceilings, is just high enough for it. She becomes a reluctant part of the poor local community, as first one version of truth and then another comes into fashion and rules the country. By 1961, Aglaya finds that &quot;the party has been polluted by an alien element,&quot; but when Krushchev is deposed, she is saddened to learn there will be no return to Stalinism. For twenty years, as various philosophies come and go, she is like a sleepwalker, immune to her surroundings. Eventually, her party is disbanded, and, ironically, a casino is built on the premises. As the spirit of capitalism affects Dolgov and inspires some of its least admirable characters, a cottage industry in assassination evolves.<br /><br /> The novel illustrates fifty years of change in Soviet political theory through exaggerated characters. Because they serve a satirical purpose and their thinking and experiences are so different from our own, it is difficult to see them as humans and to identify with their actions. Aglaya herself is a caricature who does not change. The narrative is told in simple, often amusing, episodes, but the names of the characters follow the Russian tradition of three names and usually one nickname, and are difficult to follow. Although the prose is formal and the speaker is remote, this satire is often very funny, however, and ironies and absurdities abound. Thoughtful and full of profound observations, the novel should appeal to those with a strong interest in Soviet history and literature and a curiosity about contemporary Russian life.

In dual, compelling narratives, Patrick Neate reveals the progress of these pigeon wars, told from the point of view of Ravenscourt, a pigeon soldier supporting Gunnersbury, and from the perspective of Karen and six of her friends, ten years after college. Skewering the aimlessness of these &quot;twirty-somethings,&quot; who are so busy looking at the ground that they ignore the world above them, he reveals them to be much like the pigeons, living in the instant, lacking direction and purpose, reacting rather than thinking, and often fighting.<br /><br /> When the mysterious Murray, a Mephistophelean friend from college, arrives in town, he exerts the same vibrant spell on his friends as he did in the past, when he was famous for &quot;Murray-fun,&quot; or, perhaps, &quot;social terrorism.&quot; When he suggests his latest idea, all are ready for a change. Karen is in the midst of a bad love affair. Freya Franklin, a hat designer, is struggling with a new business. Tom Dare, an unhappy teacher, has had affairs with both Karen and Freya. Emma, a new mother suffering from some sort of wasting disease, is married to Tariq, whose business has failed. Kwesi, a poet of &quot;ghetto chic&quot; gives readings in which his delivery, manner, and accent are worse than his poetry, and Ami is a TV weather-girl.

Opening in October, 2002, and originally starring stage legends Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, this two-person play by David Hare is totally dependent on superior acting. Set on the Isle of Wight in a Victorian seaside house, now fallen on hard times, the action takes place in Madeleine Palmer's flat in the course of one day and night. The tension is established in the opening lines with Frances Beale's arrival. Madeleine is resentful and inhospitable, and Frances hopeful and a bit romantic. Frances, we soon discover, is an author who has decided to write a memoir, not her usual fiction, about the long affair Madeleine had with Frances's ex-husband, radical lawyer Martin Beale. She wants to talk with Madeleine about \\"literary ethics\\" regarding the proposed memoir.<br /><br /> A broad social satire in which the two women reveal themselves to be quite different in outlook but united in their desire for \\"the word the Americans use...closure,\\" they explore their separate relationships with Martin, their views of English and American society, and their views of writing, and fiction, in particular. They poke fun, superficially, at the legal profession (\\"Lawyers are like priests [in America].\\"), the American pre-occupation with diets (\\"Does this chicken have skin on it?\\"), retirement destinations for the elderly, gentrification, and the belief that because Americans are richer, they consider their \\"dramas\\" more significant.<br /><br /> It is in the women's attitudes toward fiction, well developed, that we also see the primary differences in their relationships with Martin. Madeleine, a realist, does not read fiction, believing that the most important story is who the author is underneath the story. Fiercely independent, Madeleine had met Martin in Alabama during the civil rights struggle but did not need him to \\"affirm her life.\\" Though Frances married him, had children, and was the perfect wife and mother, Madeleine believes Frances's life has not had meaning and that she has become a writer in order to \\"give things significance which do not have significance.\\" A novelist like Frances, Madeleine believes, \\"reorders...Things acquire weight, they acquire meaning,\\" that does not exist in everyday life.<br /><br /> Wry and full of hilariously ironic comments, the play is also a poignant story of two women who loved the same man. As they compare notes and come to new understanding of Martin, each other, and who they have become, the reader is entertained on many levels, not least of which is the sophisticated analysis of writing, fiction, and its place in our lives. The dialogue sparkles, and the tension-filled relationship between the women is plausible and convincing.

Each of the members is responsible for leading the discussion of one of Austen's six novels when the club meets each month. Fowler develops this into a clever conceit, using each of the six club members to illustrate characteristics of Jane Austen herself, and at the same time, developing parallels between the plots of the Austen's novels and the book club members' personal lives. For readers unfamiliar with all of Austen's novels, Fowler includes brief but helpful plot summaries at the end of the book so that the innumerable parallels are clear.<br /><br />Jocelyn, the founder, is single like Austen and much like Emma in personality, a woman who enjoys being in control and who has done some match-making. Allegra, a determined feminist with a female lover, is concerned with the financial implications of marriage in general and specifically in Sense and Sensibility. Prudie, a French teacher and former dancer, resembles Fanny Price in Mansfield Park when a student makes suggestive passes at her a la Henry Crawford. Grigg, the only man in the group, is a mystery to the members, but as the novel unfolds, we see his life paralleling The Mysteries of Udolpho (also summarized), on which Northanger Abbey was modeled. The forgetful Bernadette is naturally funny, a woman who enjoys the humor and happy endings of Pride and Prejudice. And Sylvia, whose husband has just left her after thirty years, is a genealogist whose life, as it unfolds here, contains parallels to Persuasion.<br /><br />The novel is genuinely funny, though some parallels with Austen are more carefully developed than others. Jocelyn's explanation of dog show behavior sounds very like Austen's depiction of aristocratic parties and dances. One chapter at a modern benefit dance may be a far cry from Austen, but it has similar complications. Romance, always full of complexities in Austen, is equally complex here, but happy endings rule in both. The novel's weakness lies in its fragmentation. With six intricate Austen novels to keep track of, and the backgrounds and relationships of six modern characters to examine for parallels, the focus is too broad to lead to any identification with the modern characters, except as they illustrate Austen. And while Austen's novels reflect universal human qualities, this one is firmly grounded in the eccentricities of its twentieth century participants. Though frivolous, the novel is still clever and great fun for Austen lovers. Mary Whipplecomplications.

Though he has sinned by committing adultery with Abigail Williams, he believes the witchcraft trials which have ultimately consumed him to be the result of human, rather than godly, forces. Playwright Arthur Miller sets the scene for this action in an Overture explaining the theocracy which controlled Salem. Powerful clergymen, some more rigid in their interpretations of Scripture than others, &quot;protected&quot; citizens by enforcing conformity with the church's teachings.<br /><br /> Through detailed character sketches inserted into the structure of the play, Miller broadens the realism, and when a group of hysterical young women makes accusations of witchcraft, resulting ultimately in the deaths of nineteen of their fellow-citizens, Miller has prepared his audience to accept the trials and the behavior of the characters as plausible. His straightforward prose, use of homely details, and simple sentence structure (despite its archaic tone) further add to the realism. When the affair between John Proctor and Abigail Williams, who precipitates and then promotes the hysteria among the young &quot;afflicted&quot; girls, is revealed within the play, the modern reader is given a &quot;hook&quot; with which to identify with characters and situations which might otherwise feel foreign.<br /><br /> Miller's play is a powerful revelation of themes involving mass hysteria, fear of the unknown, and a belief in the essential evil hidden within the hearts of men. As the accused are required to prove their innocence, questions regarding the role of individualism within this society, its intolerance of differences, its justice as defined by the state and by clergymen who differ, and the hysteria which grows from repression all surface within the dramatic action, leading to an intensity of feeling rare in modern theater. When John Proctor is faced with a choice of telling the truth and being sentenced to death or lying and being saved, the ironies of the play are fully revealed.<br /><br /> Written in 1952, slightly before the McCarthy era, Miller's depiction of these trials presages the McCarthy hearings and illustrates his belief that the fear of Communism is the equivalent of fear of the Devil in colonial times. Miller, however, has selected facts which illustrate his point of view and his themes, making no pretense of accuracy regarding the witchcraft trials themselves. In reality, Abigail Williams was eleven, and John Proctor was sixty, quite different from the dramatic circumstances here.

Life is a very &quot;full cupboard&quot; here.	In his fifth novel about the #1 Ladies Detective Agency, run by Mma Precious Ramotswe, author Alexander McCall Smith presents the full cupboard of Botswana life in all its richness.  For Mma Ramotswe, people and their relationships are paramount, and she believes that these relationships are facilitated by Botswana's traditional code of behavior, with its customs of greetings, sitting down together, drinking bush tea, and casually talking around a subject, rather than addressing it aggressively.  Life is a rich, full, and happy experience for Mma Ramotswe, who can find out everything she wants to know from her broad network of family and friends.  Engaged to the good-hearted Mr. J.L.B. Matakone, who has not yet set a date for a wedding, she helps him surreptitiously with his problems and cooks and cares for the two orphans he has taken into his home.<br />In this novel, full of gentle humor and wisdom, Mma Ramotswe and her friends face several &quot;difficult&quot; problems:  A woman who has made a fortune establishing hair-braiding salons hires Mma Ramotswe to find out whether her suitors want to marry her for her money.  Mr. J.L.B. Matakone finds himself tricked into &quot;volunteering&quot; to do a parachute jump, in order to raise money for the Orphan Farm run by the intrepid Mma Potokwane, who refuses to take no for an answer.  He is also disturbed to discover that First Class Motors, a rival garage, has sold improper parts and failed to service a classic old Range Rover correctly, and he has been procrastinating about confronting the garage owner or reporting him to authorities.  Mma Makutsi, the assistant at the detective agency, has been so successful running the Kalahari Typing School for Men at night, that her dream of renting her own house has now come true, and Mma Ramotswe is helping her to furnish all two rooms.<br />With an obvious lack of exciting plot lines, the reader focuses completely on the characters-- beautifully drawn, sometimes flawed, and always forgiven their faults.  In a pace as leisurely as life in Botswana, McCall Smith recreates the colorful everyday lives of these ordinary people, who treasure friendships, treat each other with respect, and possess inherent good sense.  Honoring the values that contemporary readers sometimes do not take the time to preserve, McCall Smith portrays complex social relationships in very simple and direct prose.  Warm, gently humorous, and loving, McCall Smith creates a kind of vicarious nostalgia for this way of life, a nostalgia which readers will continue to indulge and treasure as the series continues.

Students, deans, and faculty all examine their attitudes and behavior when Simon Brick, one of the few African-American students on campus, finds a hate note tacked to the door of his room.  Dean of Students Sarah Daniels, in whose office the action takes place, is quick to respond, as is the politically correct faculty and administration.  Though all have good intentions, everyone has an agenda, and the on-campus dialogue they hope to establish becomes increasingly emotional.  As in Little Black Sambo, the &quot;tigers&quot; soon begin to chase each other furiously around the tree, until they turn themselves into a pool of butter.<br />The characters are painted with a broad brush, and for each one we know only what will further the message or provide humor to leaven the didacticism.  Sarah Daniels's on-campus affair provides plenty of opportunities to hold male characters up to humorous examination for their sexual biases.  The administration wants to keep the racial incident out of the press.  The Dean of Humanities proposes innumerable campus meetings where students and faculty will publicly examine and confess their attitudes and biases.  A student founds Students for Tolerance because it because it will look good on his law school application, stating, &quot;Where I'm from, I do not think people are racists.&quot; (His declaration that he's from Greenwich, CT, is an example of the humor.)  Conflicts within the administration rise to the surface, and Sarah's good intentions of securing a large scholarship for a minority student, if he will declare himself &quot;Hispanic&quot; or &quot;Puerto Rican,&quot; rather than &quot;nuyorican,&quot; backfires.<br />Though this play was written in 2000, it feels more like something from the 1970s.  During the past thirty years, college campuses have dealt with so many demonstrations about race and bias that administrators are, by now, universally sensitive about these issues.  As a result, this &quot;message play&quot; feels dated, treating familiar issues of racism as if they were new, but offering few new insights into them.  Because the characters here are shallow, there is little sense of audience identification to give universality to the conflict or a sense of catharsis to the &quot;surprise ending.&quot;  The important, and still relevant, subject of bias is hidden within a play which seems unsure of whether it is serious, absurd, or both.

This contrast between American and European values, vividly dramatized here, is a consistent theme in James's novels, one based on his own experiences living in the US and England.  In prose that is filled with rich observations about places, customs, and attitudes, James portrays Isabel's European coming-of-age, as she discovers that she must curb her intellect and independence if she is to fit into the social scheme in which she now finds herself.<br />Isabel Archer, one of James's most fully drawn characters, has postponed a marriage in America for a year of travel abroad, only to discover upon her precipitate and ill-considered marriage to an American living in Florence, that it is her need to be independent that makes her marriage a disaster.  Gilbert Osmond, an American art collector living in Florence, marries Isabel for the fortune she has inherited from her uncle, treating her like an object d'art which he expects to remain &quot;on the shelf.&quot;  Madame Serena Merle, his long-time lover, is, like Osmond, an American whose venality and lack of scruples have been encouraged, if not developed, by the European milieu in which they live.<br />James packs more information into one paragraph than many writers do in an entire chapter.  Distanced and formal, he presents psychologically realistic characters whose behavior is a direct outgrowth of their upbringing, with their conflicts resulting from the differences between their expectations and the reality of their changed settings.  The subordinate characters, Ralph Touchett, Pansy Osmond, her suitor Edward Rosier, American journalist Henrietta Stackpole, Isabel's former suitor Caspar Stackpole, and Lord Warburton, whose love of Isabel leads him to court Pansy, are as fascinating psychologically and as much a product of their own upbringing as is Isabel.<br />As the setting moves from America to England, Paris, Florence, and Rome, James develops his themes, and as Isabel's life becomes more complex, her increasingly difficult and emotionally affecting choices about her life make her increasingly fascinating to the reader.  James's trenchant observations about the relationship between individuals and society and about the effects of one's setting on one's behavior are enhanced by the elegance and density of his prose, making this a novel one must read slowly--and savor.

When Reissig died, young Pedro was still a small child, and Reissig's legacy to him is a book he has written entitled Berkeley, a cult novel filled with symbolism.  By discovering the messages hidden in the book, Pedro believes he will discover his father.  Now in Rio Fugitivo on sabbatical to do research, he is staying with his Uncle David Reissig, the only survivor of the massacre.<br />&quot;Berkeley can be considered as a political critique of the media,&quot; David Reissig tells Pedro, &quot;And of history as well, starting with the telegraph.&quot;  Political use of the media, the dominant theme, is also a concern of Pedro, who writes political commentary for American magazines.  In addition, the drug kingpin of Bolivia uses the media to promote the idea that he is a Robin Hood-like hero, several of the revolutionaries whom Pedro Zabalaga befriends are involved in the media, and a popular contemporary rock band, named &quot;Berkeley,&quot; conveys revolutionary messages through its videos.  In a clever double irony, the author of this novel himself uses the clues of cryptograms to convey the history of the revolution to readers of this book.<br />Despite its well developed themes, this is not just a &quot;message novel.&quot;  Pedro Zabalaga's return to Bolivia is an escape from a disastrous affair with a student whom he still loves.  As the novel alternates between Bolivia and New York, tracing the relationship, the reader sees innumerable parallels between the lives of Pedro and his father in their unwillingness to commit themselves to the future.  The mystery surrounding Pedro Reissig controls  the action and direction of the novel-Who is he?  Who betrayed the group to the army?  What does his novel Berkeley mean?<br />This first-ever translation of a Paz Soldan novel provides insightful descriptions of people, their actions, and their politics.  The author's sensitivity to the contrasts between life in Bolivia and life in upstate New York is obvious, and his ability to create not one, but two less than admirable &quot;heroes,&quot; both of whom keep the reader engaged, is striking.  Despite the constant changes in time and setting, the novel is tightly constructed, using a mystery and love story as the framework for important political observations.

Ptolemy Soter, the first Greek Pharoah, is thought to have been the &quot;unnatural&quot; son of Philip of Macedon, and, therefore, the half-brother of Alexander the Great.  When Alexander dies in 323 B.C., after he has conquered the entire eastern Mediterranean in battle, his empire is divided among his many generals, who spend the next fifty years fighting each other.  Ptolemy Soter, who was always at Alexander's side, becomes Satrap of Egypt, Libya, and part of Arabia, and he and his heirs retain that territory, ruling as the Greek Pharaohs of Egypt, for almost three hundred years.<br />Battles with other satraps--in Syria, Gaza, Cypris, and Phrygia--occupy much of Ptolemy's life, his maneuvering for power sometimes facilitated through the marriages he arranges for his daughters--to the King of Thrace, the King of Macedon, the Tyrant of Syracuse, and the ruler of Syria.  His own succession, however, is uncertain, since neither of his sons, Ptolemy Keraunos and Ptolemy Mikros, possesses the qualities of kingship that he himself espouses.  His sons, daughters, and his wives, all of whom become well known to the reader, have a penchant for assassination, and the bloody violence which occurs in the wake of Ptolemy's own death, after forty years in power, is not surprising.<br />Author Duncan Sprott focuses on the political, social, and religious life of Alexandria and Memphis during Ptolemy's rule, using the sometimes mischievous voice of Thoth to tell informal tales about his characters, filling them with gossip, sex, and violence, and presenting a vivid picture of everyday life in the highest levels of power.  When he thinks that details may overwhelm the reader, Thoth, the narrator, berates and cajoles, while controlling the pace and continuing the historical background--&quot;Pay attention, Pupil-of-Thoth.  The god would have you know everything,&quot; he says at one point.<br />With maps, a chronology, a list of main characters, genealogies, and even a comprehensive glossary, Sprott and his editors have provided everything a student of the period needs to keep track of the characters and their fates.  Readable, often exciting, but filled with more characters and detail than some readers may want, this novel should keep those with an interest in post-Alexandrian history pleasantly occupied for hours.

They occupy the home of the mayor as a sign of their power and commandeer the local coal mine.  Mayor Orden has never before been a brave or very forceful man, but he is not a fool, and while he tries to keep order in the town, as the Germans demand, he refuses to use the power of his office to betray the ideals of his people.  Soon the locals begin to sabotage everything the Germans can use to prolong the war.<br />The narrative is dramatic, full of conversation and containing minimal description, which gives it the feeling of a simple morality tale. Steinbeck depicts the German soldiers, at first, as almost bumbling--organized, to be sure, but basically human, showing footsoldiers getting homesick, seeking understanding of the orders they must fulfill, complaining about the weather, and wondering if their mail will arrive on time.  Gradually, as Berlin exerts more and more pressure to take out the coal, the German occupiers must impose more drastic measures.  Local resistance becomes more violent in response: soldiers disappear and are found dead in snowbanks, small explosions blow up rail lines, and the miners have &quot;accidents&quot; which prevent the coal from being removed. Even the arrest of Mayor Orden and Doctor Winter cannot force the citizens to give in to tyranny.<br />Though the novel was published in 1942 expressly for &quot;propaganda&quot; in Europe's occupied countries (where it was quickly translated and disseminated secretly), it is a good story which transcends its original purpose and, as a result, it continues to find an audience.  The depiction of the Germans as ordinary but flawed humans--&quot;herd men who win the battles&quot;--rather than as terrifying monsters, makes their defeat seem possible.  Depicting the townspeople as resourceful but ordinary--&quot;free men who win the wars&quot;--rather than as heroes, makes their resistance seem a natural, and victory seem possible.  Though the characters are shallow, Mayor Orden does grow and change, and his references to Plato's defense of Aristotle in a crucial conversation with Doctor Winter put the relationship of the individual to authority into a wider context.  Simple, direct, concise, and humane, this may be the most effective piece of mass propaganda ever written.

No chapters interrupt or divide the stream-of-consciousness narrative, told by Jeremiah, as he drinks his way through a series of bars in Rapid City, South Dakota, the night before he is supposed to begin his roundabout trip home to Glasgow, by way of Seattle, Montreal, Newfoundland, Iceland, Amsterdam, and Edinburgh.<br />As he reminisces about his life, especially his life with his &quot;ex-wife&quot; Yasmin, whom he never married, and their daughter, now four years old, he shows himself to be aimless, &quot;a non-assimilatit alien...Aryan Caucasian atheist, born loser...big debts, nay brains.&quot;  A compulsive gambler, pool player, and heavy drinker, Jerry has held a series of dead end jobs, the only kinds of jobs, he tells us, that are open to immigrants with Class III Red Cards--primarily bar-tending and nighttime airport security work.<br />The novel follows no logical time frame, spooling out from Jerry's memories in more or less random fashion.  We observe his relationship with Yasmin, his &quot;ex-wife,&quot; and meet his acquaintances, including Suzanne and Miss Perpetua, two other security guards from the Alien and Alien Extraction Section who also patrol the periphery of the airport car park where he works; two down-and-out war vets, Homer and Jethro, who sleep wherever they can find warmth and space; and &quot;the being,&quot; a grocery cart pusher who frequently disappears into thin air and about whose gender bets have been made.<br />Obviously, plot is not the focus here.  In choosing to recreate Jerry's aimless inner life in such a realistic way, however, the author has created a character who does not change or gain the self-awareness that makes his life relevant to most readers.  As a character, Jerry does not really engage the reader, and that seems to be part of the author's point: Jerry is and always will be an outsider.  Humor, most of it dark, permeates the novel, and an episode with &quot;the being&quot; in the airport VIP lounge is hilarious, but the ending is startling in its abruptness and may surprise readers.  Kelman the iconoclast has, once again, produced an unusual and iconoclastic novel in which he experiments with form and structure, bringing to life a character who remains forever on the periphery, even for the reader.

Written in 1993 but just recently translated into English by the author's son, this final novel by Gert Hofmann reflects his background as a playwright and radio scriptwriter.  Dialogue, along with the main character's inner thoughts, constitutes virtually the entire novel.  Stripped-to-the-bone and lacking the descriptive paragraphs one would expect in an historical novel set in late eighteenth century Gottingen, the narrative is told in a simple style and in short sentences reminiscent of fables and children's stories.  The humor and the observations about life, however, are decidedly adult, and the insights into the strange life of Georg Lichtenberg, a real mathematician-astronomer-physicist, give a broad picture of scientific investigations and social life in Germany during the period.<br />A hunchback, who can not leave his house without being pestered by people who want to touch his hump &quot;for good luck,&quot; Lichtenberg is something of a dandy, affecting silver buttons and multicolored wigs.  Always fascinated by new observations, especially his own, he carries a &quot;waste book,&quot; in which he records his passing thoughts and dozens of aphorisms:  &quot;If a man has webbed fingers, he is unlikely to make a great flautist.&quot;  On one of his walks, he buys flowers from a beautiful thirteen-year-old child, Maria Dorothea Stechard, who eventually moves in with him, becoming his student, then his housekeeper, and finally his mistress.  Keeping &quot;the little Stechardess&quot; hidden from his friends for many years, he shares his scientific experiments on electricity, hot air ballooning, and phrenology with her, feeling &quot;doubly near&quot; her when he can share both his love and his science.<br />Reminiscent in some ways of Penelope Fitzgerald's The Blue Flower, this slim novel is far less descriptive, a story reduced to its absolute essentials with not an extra word.  Understated in the extreme, it is a peculiar story of seduction, often witty and often discomforting, giving a unique view of late eighteenth century academic, intellectual, and social life.

In this discomforting 1978 novel, Booker Prize-winner Ian McEwan shows all the promise that makes his later, more fully developed novels so compelling--the same intensity, the same psychologically intriguing characters, the same haunting darkness, and the same exploration of sexuality.  In the oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere of an old house, one of the few left standing in a London urban renewal area strewn with rubble, a family of four children, ranging in age from six to seventeen, try to survive on their own after the death of their father, first, and then, their mother.  Because the three younger children will have to go into &quot;care&quot; if their mother's death is known, they dispose of her body themselves in the basement of their decaying house and carry on as if their parents are still alive.<br />Seventeen-year-old Julie is ostensibly the adult in charge, though fifteen-year-old Jack has promised his dying mother that he will share the responsibilities.  Jack, who narrates the story, is filled with all the sexual angst of an isolated young boy, never part of the mainstream, trying to figure out who he is, at the same time that he has been thrust into an adult role that he cannot fulfill.  During the hottest summer on record, a new complication arises with the appearance of Julie's boyfriend, Derek, a man in his twenties, who upsets the fragile equilibrium of the family by investigating their secrets and seeking out the source of the sweetish smell emanating from the basement.  All the emotional and sexual tensions which McEwan has nurtured throughout the novel peak in a conclusion that is both repulsive and utterly compelling.<br />This novel is not for the faint of heart, sometimes so revolting and disturbing in its psychological details, all vividly rendered, that the reader may question whether to continue reading.  Ultimately, however, McEwan's concise and polished style, his ability to choose exactly the right word, and his sense of pacing kept this reader going, even as the family dynamics degenerated into a psychotic twilight zone.  The sense that each character is alone and that life is dark and unlikely to change for the better is a despairing commentary on life, a bleak and chilling reminder that no one can ever control fate.  Eerie, provocative, and suspenseful, McEwan uses all his talents here to create a novel of small scope and scale.  In later novels, thankfully, he applies these same talents to a broader canvas, leading to richer, more subtle, and better developed fiction.

A novel of huge scope and political intrigue, it is also a novel in which no character actually wins.  All must accept the ironies which fate has dealt them.  Setting the novel in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana, the story centers around a silver mine in the mountains outside of the capital, Sulaco, vividly depicting its allure and the price each character pays for its success.<br />When Charles Gould, returns from England to claim and reopen the rich silver mine he has inherited from his father, he has good intentions-- to provide jobs for the peasants and contribute to the economy of the town at the same time that he also profits.  Soon, however, he becomes obsessed with wealth and power, and as the political climate gets hotter, he must pay off government officials, bandits, the church, and various armed revolutionaries to be able to work.  Each of these groups is vividly depicted as working for its own ends and not for the good of the people, and with their goals focused on the real world, these characters have no self-awareness, nor do they develop it during the novel.<br />In contrast to these &quot;unrealized&quot; humans, Conrad presents several characters who develop some self-awareness through their experiences.  Nostromo, a local legend, is a man of principle who has always kept his word.  Martin Decoud, a newspaper man, is a nihilist who has editorialized against the revolution, though he has yet to test himself.  Dr. Monygham, captured during a past revolution, broke under torture, and is now seeking absolution by fighting against this revolution. And the good and long-suffering wife of Charles Gould, Dona Emilia, who has lost her husband to his silver mine, now devotes her life to helping others.<br />When Nostromo agrees to protect a load of silver from revolutionaries by taking it out to sea, he takes Decoud with him, leaving him on an island with the silver when they almost sink.  Decoud's reaction to his isolation, and Nostromo's reaction to the treasure that is suddenly &quot;his,&quot; provide a dark commentary on idealism and human nature.  In the conclusion, which includes a love story that feels tacked on, Conrad's darkest self is revealed, offering little hope of change and even less hope for man's redemption.  Rich in atmosphere, vibrant in description, filled with characters representing all walks of life and philosophy, and set in a country where revolution is a way of life, the novel is full of dark portents and bleak political outcomes.

Sonia and Henri, a married couple with a small child, are relaxing after putting their recalcitrant son to bed.  Suddenly, Ines and Hubert, guests whom they had expected the following evening, arrive for dinner, which, in this emergency, turns out to be &quot;chocolate fingers&quot; and &quot;crisps.&quot;  Henri is an astrophysicist who has devoted three years to a research project which is about to be published, and Hubert tells him that night that another researcher may have beaten him to the publisher.  Hubert, also an astrophysicist, may be able to help Henri professionally.<br />In each of the three acts, which replay this scenario, one or more characters changes, dramatically affecting the dynamics of the group and the outcome of the evening.  In Act I, Sonia is rigid and assertive, while Henri is the opposite, wanting to placate both their screaming son and Hubert, who can help him professionally.  In Act II, sexual politics becomes a focus, with Hubert and Sonia agreeing to an assignation, until Hubert's self-promotion and condescension, combined with intemperate remarks by Ines, bring the evening to a disastrous close.  In Act III, everyone is more relaxed and is conversing about &quot;unity theory.&quot; Both couples are patient with the child upstairs, Henri has more confidence, he is sanguine about the research of the other scientist, and Hubert, while insensitive in his relationships, is not a complete dolt.<br />As astrophysicists, both Henri and Hubert have been studying &quot;unity theory,&quot; a theory connecting the fundamental forces of the universe and explaining interactions, and the author illustrates this visually through the action on stage.  Like the four fundamental forces of nature, we have four characters, some weak and some strong, operating independently on some levels while interrelating on others.  As we see from the different outcomes in the three acts, minor changes or glitches, even random ones, can affect relationships, future directions, and the whole concept of &quot;unity.&quot; The characters are quite different in personality in each of the acts, not really unified as personalities, illustrating dramatically Hubert's observation about the gap between &quot;reality and representation,&quot; and between &quot;object and word.&quot;  Though the conceit is clever, the play stands as a sparkling, light comedy of relationships on its own--familiarity with science is not a prerequisite to its enjoyment.

Petrel, a delusional man in his 40s who is former mental patient.  Known at the hospital to which he was once committed as &quot;C-Bird,&quot; because of his last name, Francis reconnects, twenty years after his release, with Napoleon, another former patient at the hospital, who urges him to write about the murders that happened when they were both confined.  Francis is not sure he can write about these events. &quot;The trouble with being mad,&quot; he says, &quot;was that it was real hard to tell what was true and what wasn't.&quot;  Nevertheless, when he returns home, he discovers that the visit has &quot;startled emotions within [him].&quot; Lacking paper, he picks up his pencil and begins to cover the walls of his apartment with the story that becomes this novel.<br />Author Katzenbach is convincing in his portrayal of Francis, both as the barely functioning 41-year-old narrator who still hears voices and sees visions, and as a 21-year-old patient, who, though mad, is not nearly as mad as many others in the hospital.  When a nurse nicknamed Short Blond, is gruesomely murdered shortly after Francis arrives, a young prosecutor from Boston, Lucy Kyoto Jones, who was, herself, once the victim of a vicious crime,  arrives at the hospital to investigate.  Since she has no staff with her, she asks for help, and C-Bird's only friend, another inmate named Fireman, volunteers, believing his skills as an arson investigator could be useful.  Francis also agrees to help.  Soon two more murders occur.<br />Katzenbach brings the chaos of the hospital to life, creating a powerful and affecting portrait of the lives of the mentally ill, and taking us inside the mind of Francis at two different stages of his life, twenty years apart.  As Francis continues writing his story on the walls of his apartment, the reader hopes desperately that Francis will finish the story before the terrifying, satanic Angel he sees and the cacophony of voices he hears capture him and destroy him completely.  Because the plot is often unrealistic, the well-drawn main characters take center stage.  The sense of foreboding and palpable evil are strong, and Katzenbach's vibrant dialogue, eye for detail, ability to describe strange interactions within the hospital, and his unusual main character turn the traditional detective story on its head.

While many of us enjoy &quot;reading&quot; cookbooks, checking through recipes and making notes of new discoveries, this cookbook provides a totally different type of reading experience.  Authors Gelman and Krupp, both members of several book clubs, decided that instead of organizing a cookbook around the foods and recipes mentioned in particular novels, memoirs, or non-fiction (which has been done before), that they would start instead by choosing the one hundred favorite books of book clubs from around the country.  The list they developed includes the classics, such as Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence; current affairs, such as Reading Lolita in Tehran; contemporary fiction, such as Empire Falls; historical fiction, such as Ahab's Wife; history, such as No Ordinary Time; and memoirs, such as Wild Swans.<br />Having chosen the one hundred books first, the authors then checked to see if foods were featured in the book, and if so, they looked for the best recipes they could find for each of these foods.  If food did not play an important role in the book, they contacted the book clubs to see what they might have served in conjunction with their discussions of these books, sometimes tapping into favorite family recipes of club members and sometimes seeking recipes from specialty restaurants.  On occasion, they even contacted the authors of the books themselves.  In every case, they found recipes, some from well known sources, that compliment the books and their discussions.<br />Each of the one hundred books is summarized at the beginning of the section and accompanied not only by one or more recipes but also with a profile of a participating book club, noting the activities each club sponsored in conjunction with the book, and describing what makes each club unique.  The recipes are as varied as the countries of origin of the books and fall into categories ranging from appetizers to desserts and beverages.  Featured recipes include Artichoke-Jalapeno Spread on Baguettes with Tomato Bruschetta Topping, Shrimp Flautas, Biryani, Spiced Plum Kolaches, Hmong Eggrolls, and a to-die-for dessert called Death by Chocolate.  The only weakness I have found is with the index, which contains the standard breakdown into appetizers, desserts, etc., but simply lists the page numbers where a reader can find examples of these categories, and does not list the names of the recipes themselves, an omission that is time-consuming for the cook who wants to use this as a regular cookbook.

Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury.  Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.  Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.  Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world,.\\"  Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.<br /><br />Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.  Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions.  Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.<br /><br />Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion.  Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.  Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives.  Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

Gustav Metzger, the speaker, is one of Muntzer's followers, accompanying him during the trauma of the Peasants' Revolt (1524 - 26), which Luther opposes, and serving as an on-the-scene observer.  When the revolt fails, villages are leveled, the rebels are put to the sword, and many of the leaders of the revolt are arrested, tortured, and then beheaded.<br />The revolt fails, in part, because of a spy named Qoelet (Q), whose diaries and letters to Cardinal Gianpietro Carafa, reveal his duplicitous actions.  As the Anabaptist speaker escapes from one bloody crisis after another, changing his name whenever he changes locations, Q tries to track him down and to counteract the increasingly dangerous effects of Protestantism.  Each of the speaker's failures is related to Q's  countermoves, as the speaker travels throughout Germany to Switzerland and the Low Countries, following the spread of ideas.  Twenty-five years after surviving the Peasants' Revolt and vicious reprisals against the Reformation everywhere he travels, the speaker, now known as Tiziano Rinato (Titian), arrives in Venice with the financing he needs to distribute &quot;heretical&quot; pamphlets.  He and Q finally meet for a showdown.<br />The authors' casual, slangy style, filled with profanities, conveys the frustration and trauma of these four-hundred-year old events in a language with which the contemporary reader can easily identify.  United primarily through the beliefs of the Reformation, the novel is episodic and not particularly suspenseful because the tension between the speaker and Q is not strong.  These men do not know each other, and neither the reader nor the speaker can see Q's maneuverings until after the fact.<br />The complex events of the early Reformation have shaped the intellectual and historical destinies of western civilization, and the novel reflects this complexity, with the narrative alternating from 1555 to 1517 and from 1538 to 1527, and back. The  reader must create his/her own timeline, though the events within each episode are clear.  Filled with exciting, hair's-breadth escapes from disaster, fascinating and memorable depictions of (real) historical characters, insightfully presented intellectual conflicts, and dramatic events coming fast and furiously for over seven hundred pages, the novel is a rewarding adventure for the reader with a serious interest in the Reformation.

Between 1894 and 1915, almost a million Armenians were killed in a series of massacres by the Turks.  Here author Mitchell seizes on the fact that many Armenian-Americans who fought in Europe during World War I were committed at the same time to finding and punishing the leaders of these massacres, many of whom had escaped to Europe.  One of these soldiers is Doubleday (Dub) Hagopian, an American who goes to war in Europe and stays on to work as a translator during the Paris Peace Conference.  He is part of a secret society of Armenians dedicated to capturing three leaders of the massacres who have escaped to Germany, along with a former police chief, now in Paris, who locked the doors of an Armenian church, then set it afire, killing scores of worshipping families.<br /><br />Yale White, formerly Yael Weiss, an adventurous eighteen-year-old from St. Louis, lies about her age and her religion to follow Dub to Europe, where she works as a \\"canteen lady\\" for the YMCA.  She and her unconventional best friend, Mary \\"Brennan\\" White, presage the \\"flapper\\" attitudes that will develop after the war, while Dub and Raffi Soghokian, an acquaintance from Providence, serve the serious cause of Erinyes, a secret organization seeking to avenge the massacres.  As the story develops, the author presents flashbacks which reveal the terrible history of the Armenians, not in generic terms, but as it affects individuals in the novel, a history that has remained relatively unknown to westerners. As Yale's love for Dub grows, she becomes a passionate and active supporter of his cause.<br /><br />The novel depends to a great extent on coincidences to resolve the action, with the right people being in the right places at the right times, and the story occasionally wanders.  There is little foreshadowing to provide unity, and while some of the characters begin to question some of their initial decisions, they do not change very much.  The author steps out of \\"character\\" to teach the reader history-the basics of how World War I got started, along with details of the peace treaties at the end of World War I, which promised sovereignty to the Armenian people.  Overall, however, the novel is fast-paced and exciting and pays long-overdue attention to the Armenian people, their history, and culture, a good debut novel from an author whose story reaches beyond pure plot.s of how World War I got started, along with details of the peace treaties at the end of World War I, which promised sovereignty to the Armenian people.

The characters are psychologically true for their 1930's setting, and they reveal themselves brilliantly through their dialogue.  The story is simple, the symbolism is obvious and readily understandable, the claustrophobic and depressing atmosphere is heightened by the fact that all the action takes place in a small apartment, and the line between reality and dream world, while clear to the audience, is tragically unclear to the players on stage.<br />Though the play may be structurally and aesthetically satisfying to an older audience familiar with this period, it may be less successful, after sixty years, to a contemporary audience.  Amanda is so meddlesome that her good heart, her dreams for her family, and her control over Tom are unrealistic by today's standards.  Tom, with his sense of obligation toward the family, sometimes appears personally weak.  Most difficult, however, is Laura, so pathologically shy and introverted that she is happy to stay indoors all day, polishing her glass animals and remaining completely dependent on her brother and mother to support and protect her.<br />This has always been one of my favorite plays, but reading or watching it now feels a bit like watching a costume drama.  Though it is brilliantly written, its characters and dramatic situations are so different from our twenty-first century lives, that the play and characters really come alive only when analyzed in conjunction with the social context in which they were originally presented. For a modern audience, Laura may be more pathetic than tragic.  Mary Whipple	2004-06-15

In this somewhat atypical Jane Austen novel, Austen abandons her precise characterization and carefully constructed plots, usually designed to illustrate specific ethical and social dilemmas, and presents a much broader, more complex picture of early nineteenth century life.  Though the polite behavior of the middle and upper classes is always a focus of Austen, and this novel is no exception, she is more analytical of society as a whole here, casting a critical eye on moral issues which allow the upper class to perpetuate itself.  Fanny Price, the main character, is the daughter of a genteel woman who married for love but soon found herself in poverty.  When Fanny's aunt and uncle, the wealthy owners of Mansfield Park, invite Fanny alone, of all the children, to live with them, Fanny enters a new world, where she is educated, clothed, and housed, but always regarded as an \\"outsider.\\"<br /><br />Through Fanny's two cousins, Maria and Julia, Austen shows the complex interactions of the upper class as they negotiate marriages, try to maintain the family's reputation and wealth, and react to those \\"beneath\\" them socially.  Fanny, having experienced both poverty and plenty, comments on what she sees, and though she lacks the witty charm of some of Austen's other characters (such as Elizabeth Bennett), she shows an intelligence and conscience lacking among her cousins.  Only Edmund, the youngest of the Bertram sons, pays genuine attention to her, and her love for him is real, though secret.<br /><br />This is a darker novel than Austen's others, showing conflicts between late eighteenth century rationalism and the growing romanticism of the nineteenth century.  Sir Thomas maintains his wealth through his possible participation in the slave trade, a business which created fortunes for a number of his contemporaries.  Often unfeeling toward his own family, Sir Thomas also shows cruelty toward Fanny when she rejects a marriage he has negotiated for her to a man she does not love.  Cousin Maria chooses to marry Rushworth for his fortune, but she succumbs to her passion for someone else, and introduces a romantic, new sexuality into the novel. Unfortunately, Fanny, though sweet and reasonable, is also quiet and predictable, while Edmund, the only other potentially empathetic character, is naïve and often appears to be weak.  Austen's light touch and quiet humor, which make her other novels vibrate with life and come to a satisfying ending, are less obvious here, and the abrupt conclusion leaves many questions unanswered.

There's only one problem.  Alex is the unsuspecting father of her sister Lillian's unborn baby.  Lillian, with both an MD and a PhD in neuroscience, has found her biological clock ticking and no prospective husband on the horizon. After glimpsing Alex at a bar, she has deemed him a suitable sperm donor, taken him back to the apartment, and then dismissed him, planning never to see him again.  <br />As the story alternates between the present and the past, showing the Moores' bizarre family history, the story of Veronica and Lillian grows in depth and complexity.  Their lives soon become more outrageous than anything Veronica ever dreamed up in a script.  Every melodramatic cliche comes true in this plot--characters have hidden pasts, love goes wrong, a private investigator uncovers secrets, families are brought together and then pulled apart, &quot;dead&quot; people come to life, and people's remembrances prove faulty.  Plot-wise, this is as over-the-top as any romance or melodrama you may ever read.<br />McPhee is a unique and surprising writer, however, with a firm grounding in science.  She presents her wild plot not for its own sake or for sensationalism, but to illustrate true science, which underlies all behavior, even bizarre behavior.  The soap opera-like plot combines with elements of biology and neurobiology, including details of Lillian's pregnancy, the neurology of the senses, the &quot;neurobiology of humor,&quot; the physiology and neurology of the brain, and the meaning of consciousness.  A dominant theme is the inability of humans to predict events that can either open their lives to new opportunities or destroy their hopes.<br />Though the mixing of elaborate melodrama with pure science may seem strange, McPhee is largely successful, but the hard science within the novel requires explication.   This creates an analytical, objective tone, inimical to character development, since characters do not develop through their actions when both the characters and actions are used to illustrate specific (scientific) ideas.  Although Alex remarks that &quot;an audience does not expect a story to be literal,&quot; Veronica's comments may be more appropriate:  &quot;It wasn't that she felt manipulated, it was that she hadn't been manipulated well enough.  &quot; This reader wished that the novel had manipulated her just a bit more effectively, but it is still great fun to read, often humorous, and full of ironies--and that, of course, is &quot;no ordinary matter.&quot;  Mary Whipple	2004-06-11

All the familiar characters, the small town setting, and the major racial themes of Harper Lee's classic novel are compressed in this faithful adaptation of the novel to the stage.  Scout is as spunky, warm-hearted, and curious about life here in the stage play as she is in the novel and film, and Atticus Finch is just as passionate an advocate for justice.  Tom Robinson is just as Job-like, and the Ewell family is as hate-filled and ignorant as we expect them to be.  The supporting cast, with their asides and small town gossip, convey the social setting of the 1930s, as the human tragedy of racial prejudice and unequal justice are brought to life.<br /><br />The magnificence of the novel and the film, however, depends in large part on atmosphere and the tension that develops slowly and irrevocably, as the townspeople, most of them basically good at heart, reveal the prejudices which they allow to govern their lives.  By reducing the scope of this story to the stage (and, unfortunately, also including an intermission halfway through the action), the mood and tension so important to this story, never really develop.  Miss Maudie's monologues to the audience throughout the play are an attempt to set the Deep South tone, but they \\"tell about\\" what is important, rather than show it dramatically. When Tom Robinson is arrested and jailed for the rape of a white woman and Atticus Finch is assigned to defend him, the message begins to feel didactic, rather than the inevitable, sad outgrowth of time and place. Without the necessary atmosphere and mood, the story feels like a morality play, and the audience does not connect emotionally to the action.<br /><br />Most disappointing in the play is the relative insignificance of Boo Radley.  A mystery throughout the novel and film, Boo, destroyed by real life, acts as a foil for the children and a counterpoint to the Ewells in the novel and film.  In the play he is simply the deus ex machina, showing up briefly in the last scene to resolve the action, and Scout's tender reaction to him is too brief to carry much impact.

An elderly brother and his three aging sisters, all physically and emotionally maimed, are required, under the terms of their mother's will, to share the rapidly deteriorating family estate, Durraghglass, near Cork, Ireland.  April, the only sister who ever married, is totally deaf but refuses to acknowledge it.  May, with a grossly deformed hand, compensates by making &quot;artistic&quot; pictures out of scraps of tweed--and by incidental shop-lifting.  June, severely dyslexic, actively manages the &quot;farm.&quot; Jasper, blinded in one eye by June in a childhood accident, runs the moldy kitchen and makes gourmet meals out of scraps, sometimes even borrowing from the dogs' meals to improve meals for the family.  Each of the Swift family members, firmly controlled by &quot;Mummie&quot; and her memory, leads an almost totally isolated, secret-filled life, unable to share feelings or care for anyone else.<br />Their already precarious lives are tested with the unexpected arrival of Leda, a formerly glamorous, half-Jewish cousin from Austria, whom they all thought &quot;perished in some cold, unnamed camp, most likely. Who wants sordid details?&quot;  Leda, once April's best friend, bears grudges that hark back to her teen years, when her closeness to the family was deemed threatening to April's mother and she was summarily removed from Durraghglass, never to return.  With subtlety and cleverness, author Keane slowly reveals elements of Leda's background and her connections to the family, using the dialogue, often at cross-purposes and always mordantly humorous, to reveal information, motivation, and character simultaneously.  Irony builds upon irony as Leda's actions and remarks, often misunderstood, succeed in turning one sibling against another.<br />The myth of Leda and the Swan plays constantly in the background, with numerous symbolic references to the swans on the pond at Durraghglass and to Leda's swan-like preening. The Swifts, to continue the bird imagery, are no competition for Leda.  As the tension of this domestic drama ratchets up and Leda wreaks her havoc, fate has a few ironies left in store.

After spending two years aboard commercial lobster boats, meeting scientists dedicated to conserving the lobster as a natural resource, and studying the research about the lobster's habitat, breeding habits, and possible endangerment, author Trevor Corson has produced a highly readable, balanced account of what is happening in the industry and the remarkable co-operation which has evolved between some lobstermen and scientists.<br />Little Cranberry Island, just south of Mt. Desert Island and Acadia National Park in Maine, is a lobstering community with the perfect lobster habitat just off its coast, its lobstermen as concerned about preserving their livelihoods for the future as are scientists (many working for the government) about protecting the coast from &quot;over-fishing.&quot;  Until recently, however, the two groups had not pooled their knowledge, and scientists had not done enough on-site studies of how and where the lobsters live and breed and what constitutes the true threats to their continued existence.  No one on either side really knew whether cyclical declines in the number of pounds caught were natural or induced by man.<br />Concentrating on the roles of individuals on the island and noted scientists engaged in unusual research, humanizing all of them and describing their day-to-day lives, Corson delves into seemingly arcane subjects, such as the lobster's mating rituals, molting and its effects, battles for territory (both by lobsters and fishermen), ocean currents that carry lobster larvae, natural &quot;lobster nurseries,&quot; and the role of the extremely large lobsters which sometimes live in very deep water.  The book is entertaining, and in a few cases humorous (a discussion of lobster courtship juxtaposed against the courtship of a lobsterman), but it is uncompromising in its attention to serious research and what has been discovered about the lobster's life cycle.  Filled with insights into how and why scientists, lobstermen, the government, and the lobsters themselves all continue to behave as they do, this well-written account is accessible to scientists and laymen alike.

When the Massachusetts Department of Public Works decides that the picturesque, wooden footbridge linking the village of Salt Cove to the mainland of Leicester is unsafe and will be summarily torn down, the three hundred full-time residents are outraged.  And when they see the proposal for the new bridge, a concrete monstrosity strong enough for fire trucks and wide enough for two-way vehicular traffic, they vote for all-out rebellion.  Stalwart, unbending Yankees with family histories rooted in the rocky soil of Salt Cove, they are not about to let outsiders tell them that they will benefit from this concrete assault on their aesthetic sensibilities.  The idea of two-way vehicular traffic is even less appealing, as it will bring outsiders into the village.  With New England determination and some hard-headedness, they decide to take on the state and wage a mini-war in an attempt to break a state-imposed siege of the village.<br /><br />Recording the events is Jessica Stoddard, a 73-year-old spinster and life-long resident of Salt Cove.  Fiesty and independent, Jessica fears no one and tolerates no nonsense.  Directing the rebellion is a quiet man in his early forties named Toby Auberon, a relative newcomer to the village, regarded as a hippie, who has leased the now-automated lighthouse and, until now, has kept his legal background a secret.  Jessica, Toby, and an additional thirty (or more) characters narrate their own versions of the events in Salt Cove, each of these beautifully realized voices unique and easily recognizable, and many of them hilarious.  Quirky imagery combines with these singlar voices to create especially memorable pictures of people and events.<br /><br />Told with tongue in cheek and a good deal of mild satire, this is a loving picture of village life by an author who respects his characters and sees them in the context of a wider world.  And however implausible the developing love story may seem between Jessica and the much younger Toby, Weller makes us understand and appreciate its sweetness, especially in contrast to the outside events. As the government escalates the siege to include Humvees, National Guard tanks, underwater demolition experts, the FBI, and SWAT teams, Salt Cove counters with its tireless citizens, a crazy militia unit from Missouri, a missile found in a fishing net, and plastique explosives.  The inevitable bloodshed is a jarring event, a harsh blow which comes just when the reader is loving the characters and smiling at their actions.  Full of New England eccentrics who willingly risk all, the novel realistically depicts governmental insensitivity to locally important landmarks but ultimately leaves the reader smiling.

More than sixty years have passed since the speaker first lived in Rabat Gan, and the passage of time has intensified some memories, eliminated the irrelevancies from others, and connected the fantasies of childhood with the perennial mysteries of adulthood.  As he begins to recall images from his life, the veranda on which his grandfather sat rises from memory, &quot;like that legendary bird rising from its ashes&quot; and becomes &quot;the veranda of the world itself,&quot; a symbol of the experiences of the family and, ultimately, the history of the Jewish people, a veranda with &quot;A broken railing.  Grillwork like Auschwitz.  A floor laid with tiles of pogroms...Nuremberg laws in the plaster...&quot;<br />Not a manifesto or catalogue of wrongs, this &quot;memoir&quot; is the vivid and poetic evocation of one boy's life, the people he remembers from a seemingly ordinary Israeli village, and his discoveries about dreams and the passage of time.  Impressions from past and present flow through the speaker's consciousness, unfiltered, with one idea reminding him of another from another place and time.  Gradually, the reader meets the speaker's grandfather, father, and deceased mother, the neighbors, his teachers, and his friends, all of whom have sought sanctuary in Israel from other places.  Words in Aramaic, Hebrew, German, Yiddish, and even Icelandic, are sprinkled casually throughout the story, a natural part of the speaker's memory and the collective memory of his village and country.<br />Though &quot;A butterfly big as a volume of Talmud stood above our heads&quot; throughout the speaker's childhood, the adults in the village have had more difficult lives, all of them having escaped from various wars.  Soon it is time for the speaker to serve in his own army and fight in his own war, an experience which marks him forever.  Nature imagery--of birds, animals, clouds, and the sky--permeate this impressionistic painting of a poet's life, giving depth and color to instants in time and to moments in history.  Through intense, compressed and sometimes elusive pictures, the story--and our understanding of the speaker--do gradually emerge, insinuating themselves into our own consciousness and speaking directly to us, a powerful communication between author and reader which transcends time and place.

For his discretion and loyalty, he earns their undying gratitude--and very large checks.  When Jimmy D'Ambrosio, a powerful, old-style Boston king-maker, approaches him to investigate the husband of Ellen Stoddard, a woman whose campaign for Senate he is managing, Coyne hires Gordon Cahill, an equally discreet private investigator, to check out Albert Stoddard, a history professor at Tufts University.  Within days, however, Cahill is dead in a car crash, and the state police think it may be homicide.  When Stoddard himself goes missing, his wife prohibits Coyne from telling the state police and from helping in the investigation of the death of Gordon Cahill, Coyne's friend.<br />Though there is occasional violence and some tough-as-nails confrontations, the Brady Coyne series offers a unique approach to the detective story.  Emphasizing the interrelationships of realistically portrayed characters more than hard-boiled action, author Tapply uses the characters' dialogue with Brady Coyne to give them life.  Though some of these characters are easily recognizable local stereotypes, he gives them credibility by mixing these fictional characters with real-life characters.  Jimmy D'Ambrosio is fictional, but he is described as having been the campaign manager of the real former mayor, Kevin White, a quintessential Boston politician.  The fictional Cahill worked as an undercover state policeman, investigating the Winter Hill Gang, a real gang, one of whose members is on the FBI Ten Most Wanted List.  And when Coyne goes to the North End to talk to Vincent Russo, a restaurateur and mob boss, he is talking to a fictional character with roots in real Boston history.<br />Tapply's folksy narrative style, the honest simplicity of his descriptions, and the incorporation of local color from Boston and the woodlands of southern New Hampshire, give the novel a breadth and &quot;charm&quot; missing from more action-oriented series.  Relatively simple in its presentation and style, the mystery is also simple, and while the reader will probably be surprised by one plot twist at the end, the chances are that s/he will not be very surprised by the ultimate solution to the mystery.

Arjun learns that poverty &quot;does not exclude cars, refrigerators, cable TV, and obesity,&quot; and that Virugenix features &quot;neat landscaping and plenty of designated parking.&quot;  A wry, satiric tone permeates the description of Arjun's life and his conflict of values, and American superficiality is skewered.  Kunzru furthers this satire with two subplots, alternating scenes of the &quot;real&quot; Leela Zahir's life as a Bollywood film star with scenes of Arjun, pointing up the excesses of the rich and famous and the contrast with &quot;real life.&quot;  A third plot line features a European &quot;marketing visionary,&quot; Guy Swift, who must keep international venture capitalists at bay while he enjoys the pretentious, international highlife.<br />As the Leela virus caused disasters to systems ranging from water filtration to airport security and international banking and business, the three plot lines come together in a clever conclusion which resembles the films Arjun enjoys.  Some readers may tire of the pervasive satire of materialism, since this is an old subject, addressed many times and in many ways.  Arjun's naivete, his vision of life as a filmscript, and his relationship with a woman as bizarre as Chris are somewhat implausible, though these may be excusable on the grounds that they open the story to more satire.

The well known, true story of Manjiro, a young Japanese sailor lost at sea, rescued by American sailors, and brought to the US, where he learned English and later worked as an interpreter, is the framework for this study of the opening of Japan to trade. The fictional Hikotaro, who became Hikozo, and later Joseph Heco, is thirteen in 1850, when he is rescued by an American ship from a rudderless and drifting Japanese fishing boat.  Hiko's observations about this strange ship, the Americans who have rescued him, and the cities of San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Macao, to which they travel, establish the cultural differences and the contrast between the Americans' overwhelming desire for trade and the Japanese resistance to it.  Hiko knows that he will not be allowed to return his own country because he is considered a criminal, his &quot;crime&quot; being  his exposure to the outside world and to Christianity.<br />Though he never stops wanting to return to Japan, Hiko does the only things he can do--he makes friends among Americans, learns the language, keeps his mind open to new ideas, and travels the world on American ships. Eventually he meets senators, President Buchanan, and even President Lincoln during the Civil War, before finally returning to Japan as an American interpreter when the shogunate opens the country to trade in the 1860s.  &quot;Faction samurai&quot; are as opposed to this as many Americans are to the Emancipation Proclamation, and bloodshed and fires directed at foreigners make life for Hiko and the American consular officers for whom he works very dangerous.<br />For someone interested in the opening of Japan, the novel provides interesting historical insights.  As a novel, however, the book is a challenge.  The plot has no real dramatic tension or focus, simply following Hiko around for many years.  Inexplicably, the narrative also splits several times, following the lives of other Japanese castaways whom Hiko meets as they, too, try to return to Japan.  Though this gives additional historical information, it further fragments the reader's already weak identification with Hiko, since he is not present in these side narratives.  Episodic and lacking in urgency, the novel feels more like an historical record than a plot which the author has directed.  With undeveloped characters, no love story, and no humor to change the tone or mood, this is a novel more geared to the historian than the lover of literature.  Mary Whippleto Japan.

Rose, the Irish wife of the oldest son Henry, is the sensible mother of twins who has worked to restore the estate and its gardens, make it a home, and, through her cooking, provide a sense of family warmth.  In sardonic contrast to her is Angela, the oh-so-upperclass wife of the second son Michael, who looks down on Rose and everyone else not of the family's &quot;class&quot; and breeding.  Arriving sometime later is the only daughter, Ermyn, young, schoolgirlish, and disturbed. Severely repressed and often ignored, she looks for answers in exotic religious expression, and like the sin eater of Welsh legend, believes she can take upon herself the sins of the Captain and the family.<br />Ellis wields language like a rapier, skewering family members for their caste-conscious concern with their &quot;blood,&quot; and showing with mordant humor their deliberate separation from the community.  The family is changing, if Rose, daughter of an Irish veterinarian, is any indication, just as Llanelys, now a tourist destination, has changed.  But though the family may deserve to be satirized for its meaningless rituals, the local population is not exempt from Ellis's dissection, either.  Phyllis, the caretaker for the Captain, saves the best of the family's food to feed her fat grandson, and he steals liquor and makes lewd, sexual overtures to Rose and Ermyn.  Other townspeople mock the family, show their rudeness, and even break their windows.<br />Stunning imagery, delicious turns of phrase, and lively dialogue make the narrative sparkle.  The hands of Rose's small twins are described as &quot;so delicate and fine they felt like broken toothpicks in little silk bags,&quot; while the sea is &quot;smooth and wrinkle-free, like the face of a saint or a psychopath.&quot;  Blood is carried as a motif throughout, and references to old Welsh legends connect the family with the past and offer dire portents of the future.  Despite the harshness Ellis exhibits toward some of her characters, the reader develops empathy toward Rose and understands that poor Ermyn needs more emotional help than she is likely to get, but Ellis never allows the reader to get  comfortable with this family's world.  She shows that just as the sin eater cannot take on the sins of others, life has no guarantees of happy endings.

In the taut, staccato style reminiscent of Raymond Chandler or John D. MacDonald, Lee Child presents his eighth Jack Reacher novel, a police procedural with a difference:  Reacher is an MP, an army Major at Fort Bird, North Carolina, obedient to a different set of rules and objectives.  Recently transferred from Panama to be MP Executive Officer, Reacher must immediately investigate the death of a two-star general who has died in a seedy, nearby motel, presumably with a prostitute.  His briefcase, containing the agenda for a top-secret conference in California, has disappeared, and when Reacher and his aide, Lt. Summer, go to break the news to the general's wife, they find her dead, too, bludgeoned to death with a crowbar within hours of the general's death.<br /><br />With almost military precision, dramatic complications unfold, and Reacher soon finds himself facing two new deaths, one of which is a gruesome butchering which takes place on the base.  Ordered by superiors to cover up the murder by calling it a \\"training accident,\\" Reacher and his aide investigate surreptitiously, soon discovering that his MP XO counterparts at twenty more bases throughout the world have also been newly appointed to their positions, all of them on or around December 29.  Obvious questions arise about who is pulling the strings, who has the power to transfer so many MPs to new posts, and why someone would want to do so.<br /><br />Child is a meticulous writer whose plot follows a strict chronological order and moves at a breath-taking pace, with one dramatic scene following hard on the heels of another.  Reacher and his aide Summer are not fully developed characters, but they do not need to be as they struggle to learn who is controlling the grisly chess game which has resulted in four deaths.  The action is resolved in an extravagant grand finale, with twists and turns and spectacular surprises.  Though the ending resolves the disparate threads, it may also be a disappointment to some readers, since the premise behind the plot and the motivation which led to the murders, when finally revealed, seems too unrealistic to justify the murderous extremes to which \\"the enemy\\" has gone.  Though Child is brilliant in creating an exciting story packed with action, the final pages feel cynical and reveal a view of humanity that is grim.

Setting his novel during this period, author Habila focuses on Lomba, a frustrated novelist and journalist who is now a starving political prisoner in a Lagos jail, where he has served two years without a trial.  Lomba has been keeping his mind alive by writing love poems and a journal, and when the writing is discovered, the jailer persuades Lomba to write love poems for the woman he is courting.<br />In a series of short story-like episodes, the novel then flashes back to the years before Lomba's arrest, showing the effects of Sani Abacha's dictatorial government on the ordinary citizens of Poverty Street in Lagos, including Lomba himself, as they try to maintain some semblance of hope in an increasingly hopeless world.  With no chance of getting his novel published, Lomba has taken a job writing for the Dial, for which he occasionally reports on political demonstrations.  In one of these demonstrations, led by Lomba's friend Joshua, unarmed people peacefully protest the neglect of their neighborhood, only to be attacked by fifty armed riot police with tear gas and truncheons.<br />Horrifying depictions of everyday violence are presented with almost journalistic clarity, and Habila adds further realism by referring to well-known historical events of the time:  the hanging of Ken Saro Wiwa; the death by letter bomb of Dele Giwa, the editor of Newswatch magazine; and the shooting of the wife of Moshood Abiola, Abacha's political opponent.  The author's inclusion of a character named Helon Habila in the action adds further drama through the suggestion that much of the story may be autobiographical.<br />In this paean to the spirit of democracy, Habila celebrates the lives of those courageous speakers and writers who have refused to be silenced, even when faced with death.  &quot;Every oppressor knows,&quot; a character says, &quot;that wherever one word is joined to another word to form a sentence, there'll be revolt.&quot;  This moving study of idealistic young people refusing to give up, even when faced with threats to their lives, is an unforgettable story of the human spirit waiting for an angel--and sometimes meeting the Angel of Death.

Joel King, a good but exceedingly naïve man, dedicated his life to serving Roanoke Baptist Church-until Christy, a 17-year-old temptress, claimed he seduced her.  Though he pled guilty when he was charged and served a six-month sentence, there is a gap between what Christy says happened, and what Joel knows happened.  He believes, however, that he is guilty because there's no such thing as a &quot;minor&quot; sin.  &quot;There's the straight, correct, narrow route, and the rest is just plain heathen mischief.&quot;  Learning that his wife has filed for divorce and that Christy has filed a $5M damage suit against him and the church, Joel, penniless, gratefully accepts help from Sa'ad X. Sa'ad, a lawyer friend of Edmund Brooks, a former parishioner now living in Las Vegas.<br />Edmund and Sa'ad X. Sa'ad are partners in a variety of insurance scams, and Joel is the ready-made, carefully selected dupe who gets sucked into a wild scam involving &quot;borrowed jewelry.&quot;  As the complexities grow exponentially, Joel never waivers in his religious faith but begins to question his interpretation of right and wrong and his understanding of his mission in life.  Striving to accomplish long-term right by taking expedient measures which he knows are wrong, he eventually comes to new understandings about real life and the difficulty of identifying a heavenly voice in the cacophony which surrounds him.<br />Joel King's spiritual crisis is a only a part of this hilariously funny tale which features crosses and double-crosses, misread motives, and scammers getting scammed.  The glitz and glamour of Edmund and Sa'ad's life in Las Vegas contrast with the simple life Joel has chosen in Montana, and the characters, while not fully developed, represent the full spectrum of humanity--the trusting and the cynical, the principled and the venal, and the charitable and the grasping.

But it is not &quot;just&quot; a romance.  In fact, the narrative moves along so precisely and with such unadorned language that it is as much a day-by-day journal of the restoration of an ancient house, which is at the heart of the action, as it is the story of a ghostly love.<br />Julian Beaufort, a young Briton on a 1914 graduation tour of the Middle East, falls in love with an old house in Damascus, once part of a large complex, and succeeds in buying it from the family which has occupied it for 210 years.  World War I and a civil war in Syria delay his return to Syria until 1926, and when he finally gets back, he discovers that his house is the only one in the neighborhood to have survived the bombings and subsequent fires in Damascus.<br />Aided by the maid of the former owner, a porter he meets at the railroad station, and his Arabic teacher, he begins the restoration of the house to its former grandeur, a project which takes twenty years.  The architectural drawings of various rooms and wings, and the sketches of details he plans to restore seem to grow larger and more vibrant while he is asleep, however, and we discover that Asilah, the missing daughter of the former owner, is &quot;helping&quot; with them from her hiding place, connecting psychically with Julian.<br />Hodgson, who is also an artist, has filled the novel with old newspaper photographs and stories, snapshots of Damascus, family portraits, Arabic writing, pressed flowers, transparencies, maps, close-ups of architectural detail, sketches, and even Julian's to-do lists. The reader does not need to &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; here because this detritus from Julian's daily life &quot;proves&quot; his existence.  Asilah, and the palace which she explores and describes to us, may or may not exist, but we are willing to accept her existence at face value because we &quot;know&quot; that Julian exists.  Fun to read, with illustrations which will fascinate even those who are not art historians, this novel is a welcome change of pace, a delightful and beautiful book satisfying on several levels.  The abrupt ending, designed to surprise, is not really unexpected, but that is a small quibble for a book that is so visually pleasing, a rare picture book for adults.

Three years after the author's previous novel, Plainsong, concluded, the author returns to Holt, Colorado, continuing the story of Raymond and Harold McPheron, elderly ranchers who lived in almost complete isolation until they agreed to provide a safe haven for a scared and pregnant teenager, three years ago.  With other familiar characters from Plainsong also returning in minor roles, the novel then broadens to focus on three additional  families, whose new stories the author deftly juggles and interweaves.  Somewhat more thoughtful and complex than Plainsong, Eventide quickly engages the reader with its unpretentious style, revealing dialogue, and often heart-tugging scenes of difficult lives.<br /><br />Luther and Betty June Wallace are some of Haruf's most beautifully drawn characters.  Extremely limited in their understanding, they receive professional assistance in everything from budgeting to parenting classes, anger management, and lessons in cleanliness.  DJ Kephart, a small eleven-year-old whose responsibilities make him seem much older, is an orphan, now living with his elderly, often bed-ridden, grandfather, for whom he does all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry.  He and his neighborhood friends, Dena and Emma Wells, whose father is in Alaska, spend their free time turning an abandoned shed into a playhouse, a peaceful, make-believe home where adults do not intrude.  Suddenly, separate acts of fate, involving the McPheron brothers and each of these three families, upend all their lives and set in motion a series of events which will change them forever.<br /><br />Death, illness, injury, abandonment, abuse, and the arbitrary harshness of fate all contribute to emotional crises the characters must find the strength to overcome.  As Raymond McPheron says, simply, these acts of fate and disaster are \\"things you don't get over,\\" but, as he notes while he is separating cows from their calves, \\"Every living thing in this world gets weaned eventually.\\"  Deliberately simple in style, but polished and graceful in its realization, the novel is full of the love and travail, the effort and failure, and the kindness and cruelty that fill the lives of these plainspoken, often endearing, characters.<br /><br />Vibrant, almost lyrical descriptions of the land and nature are seen in the context of sudden emergencies arising on the ranch, and every scene of tenderness and love is juxtaposed against scenes of cruelty and inhumanity.  A master at evoking emotion, Haruf tugs at the heartstrings of even the most stoic reader, drawing the reader into scenes of warmth and poignancy, only to jolt him/her with new scenes that kill the sentimentality.  Life can be cruel, fate can be capricious, and things do not always turn out \\"right,\\" but Haruf's characters somehow soldier on, with the reader right beside them, heartstrings thrumming.

Every Thursday evening, Weber opens his house to performers, composers, and singers, who entertain an always-enthusiastic audience and an occasional music patron.  It is at one of these soirees in 1777, that the 21-year-old Mozart and his mother, visitors from Salzburg, Austria, first meet the Webers.  This meeting is the first of many over the next three years, as Mozart falls desperately in love with one sister, lives with the family for a time in Vienna, and eventually marries another sister.  So close is he to the family that he writes compositions for the voices of two of the sisters and even creates parts in his operas for them.<br />Author Cowell portrays the domestic life of late eighteenth century Germany in careful detail, revealing the customs, the lifestyle, and the intellectual life of Mannheim, then Munich, and eventually Vienna.  Every homely detail, from the type of stockings the girls wore, to the rags they used to curl their hair contributes to the realism, while on-going, personal insights into the tenuous and highly competitive life of a budding composer, like Mozart, and the role of the prince-bishop as a patron make the music world come alive.  The Mozart we see here is very different from the Mozart in Amadeus.  Young and in many ways naïve, he is not the petulant and sissified dandy we see in the film.  He is, however, somewhat clumsy in his personal relationships and unsure how to obtain the kind of support he needs for his prodigious talent to flourish, and he often has few choices open to him.<br />Lovers of romance will find plenty to admire here, as the Weber girls individually explore their own world, their potential futures, and their sexuality, while Mozart tries to find an outlet for the music in his soul.  This is a love story--showing the passionate love between men and women, and the quiet devotion of parent and child, in a long ago time and in an exotic, often rarified atmosphere.  Filled with sensuous descriptions, it is more a study of the four sisters than it is of Mozart, providing their woman's-eye views of music, the place of music in their lives, and the sacrifices they and their spouses must make for art.

A haunting story of four generations of a strange Norwegian family, each member of which is &quot;different&quot; in some respect, this is as complete a family saga as you will find.  Every character is fully delineated, and all his/her relationships and relevant past history are brought to life here, filtered through the mind of Barnum Nilsen, the son of a circus worker and grifter.  Barnum's unusual but ultimately close relationship with his brother Fred, the product of his mother's rape by a soldier, is at the heart of the novel, with Fred being huge, active, and very physical while Barnum is unusually small, more passive, and cerebral.  Two halves of the same coin, neither brother is very successful alone.<br />Four generations of the family live together, and some &quot;absent&quot; characters, who have affected the lives of family members, &quot;live on&quot; through objects that they have left behind with the family.  Barnum and Fred often seek a connection to the past by reading the last letter their great-grandfather sent from Greenland before he vanished. Vera's best friend Rakel leaves Vera with a treasured ring, just before she is taken during the Nazi occupation of Norway.  Barnum buys a ring for his first girlfriend, and it has meaning for him even when he is middle-aged.  &quot;We do not disappear without a trace,&quot; Barnum learns.  &quot;We leave a wake that never quite disappears, a gash in time.&quot;<br />As this immense story unfolds, the reader finds the action harking backward, forward, and in upon itself, with silence, disappearances, and deaths pervading the action.  Vera and Fred both go silent for months as a result of trauma.  The great-grandfather and Vera's father never appear, and Arnold Nilsen, Barnum's father, disappears periodically after his marriage to Vera, as does Fred, the half-brother. Permanent disappearance, i.e., death, occurs to the Old One and a host of other characters, and accidents involving still other characters cast a pall over much of the novel, highlighting the &quot;aloneness&quot; of each person, and the quixotic nature of fate.  Still, there is much humor here as the characters keep soldiering on.<br />This is a huge book, but the pages fly by, despite the fact that the author does not insert much paragraphing.  Whole pages continue without any breaks at all, and dialogue is simply imbedded within paragraphs.  With hundreds of well-drawn, memorable scenes, dozens of carefully presented characters whose entire lives and history you know completely, surprises buried within seemingly ordinary tales, and the creation of a complete and unique universe, this is a novel which will richly reward the reader who is not intimidated by its size.

Nathalie, the partner of Steve Ross and mother of their child, has always considered it an advantage to be adopted, to be &quot;chosen,&quot; but when her young daughter Polly needs surgery for a condition that may be inherited, her own adoption becomes an issue for her.  Asking &quot;What else don't I know about where Polly's come from?&quot; she suddenly comes to a life-changing realization:  &quot;I want to be like people who know where they come from.&quot;  She and her brother David decide to search for their birth mothers.<br />The rippling effects of the decision to search for birth mothers dominate this carefully constructed novel.  Nathalie's adoptive mother, not surprisingly, is devastated that both of &quot;her&quot; children need to find &quot;other&quot; mothers.  The birth mothers, by turn, have created new lives of their own, each dealing with her &quot;lost&quot; child in her own way.  Nathalie's husband, David's wife, and their children are also affected, not least by the fact that Nathalie and David choose to share their feelings with each other, rather than with their spouses.  As the ripple effects continue, other characters, even including employees, are drawn into the emotional vortex, and unexpected complications send the action in surprising directions with new twists and turns.<br />Trollope reveals the inner lives of her characters through beautifully realized dialogue, and she pays particular attention to the details of  personality and domestic relationships.  The reader is quickly drawn into the action and empathizes with the characters, who seem realistic, though they are not fully developed.  In fact, we learn about each one only what is necessary for the author to illustrate the myriad effects of adoption on the adoptees and the people who love them. The themes dominate, controlling both the action and the characters themselves. A vivid domestic drama with an unusual subject and characters, the novel shows us how relationships are tested and tempered.

Heroine Thursday Next, has saved Jane Eyre from disaster, imprisoned Jack Schitt in Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;The Raven,&quot; and ended the Crimean War, but she has also made enemies of some powerful criminals, one of whom has gone back in time and killed off her husband when he was just a small child.  Now, pregnant, she is the only person who can remember him as an adult, and her memory is failing.  Anxious for a rest, she decides to go with her dodo Pickwick to visit the Well of Lost Plots, where all book characters, plots, and settings reside until they are chosen for novels.<br />In this most literary of Fforde's three novels, Thursday is an apprentice agent-in-training for JurisFiction, the policing agency that works inside books, her mentor and guide being Miss Havisham from Great Expectations.  Living inside an unpublished crime thriller, Thursday explores the Great Library, where the Cheshire Cat is librarian, sees the workshop for backstories (some used, some not), meets generic characters (&quot;human canvases without paint&quot;) and &quot;orals&quot; (nursery rhyme characters), tours available settings (high-capped mountains, arched stone bridges, ruined castles), and watches as Miss Havisham joyrides in &quot;Chitty Bang Bang.&quot;  Holesmiths work there fixing holes in narratives, grammatacists try to prevent grammacites (gerunds) and mispeling vyruses from infecting novels, and pace-setters, moodmongers, and plot speculators work on new creations.<br />As the Well considers installing the UltraWord operating system, which will expand the basic eight-plot architecture into thirty-two plots, Thursday tries to preserve the memory of Landen, fight against her enemies, and win her trial for a fiction infraction. Fforde pulls out all the stops here, creating a carnival ride through books and the creative process with surprises and delights on every page.  Less plot-driven than the previous novels, this novel is episodic, with scenes ranging from a Star Wars-type bar scene to a group counseling session for the characters in Wuthering Heights.  While Thursday's exact role is not always clear, Fforde's ability to free the reader's imagination and keep him/her involved in the literary world with its infinite possibilities is daunting.

Pitting Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans of the Army of the Cumberland against the infamous Gen. Braxton Bragg of the Army of Tennessee, this devastating battle, in which both sides eventually claimed victory, cost the lives of 25,000 men in just three days.<br />Author Carter uses primary sources to recreate the minutiae of this horrendous battle, and he is precise in his discussion of troop movements, the order of events, and the real actions of real people.  Classified as a &quot;novel&quot; because the author recreates conversations which were not recorded and provides insights into what the participants may have been thinking and feeling, the book feels more like a comprehensive re-enactment than fiction.  There are no imagined subplots, no love story, and no great or fully developed hero (though Gen. Rosecrans comes closest).  Real events become the plot, and real battle movements and counter-movements become the &quot;rising action,&quot; with &quot;suspense&quot; depending on the reader's unfamiliarity with these events and the characters' destinies.<br />By including as much personal background and information as is known about each real character, Carter humanizes the many generals on both sides who had often been classmates and friends from West Point, showing their soul-searching and personal relationships.  Lower ranking officers and soldiers reveal the extent to which this was a &quot;generals' war,&quot; with one soldier suggesting that all the soldiers on both sides &quot;just go on home...leaving you officers to settle things among yourselves.&quot;  The inclusion of Ambrose Bierce, a Union map-maker who later used his war-time experience in his writing, serves as a fascinating motif throughout, as Carter shows the particular events which appear in Bierce's work.<br />By the time the novel is finished, the reader is emotionally spent.  Friendly fire accidents, the carnage of death by cannon, the misfires of ordnance, and the need to fire shells over the heads of their own men reflect the bloody reality of this war, while the moments of kindness which soldiers often extended to each other put a human face upon it. The descriptions are so precise, the devastation so total, the accidents so disastrous, and the role of chance so all-encompassing that the horrors of this war linger. Carter's novel is a huge achievement which should provide Civil War buffs with hours of serious study.

As dawn breaks, Daniel's father, a bookseller, takes him on his first visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a secret, maze-like library which preserves books &quot;no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time.&quot;  Each person who visits must adopt a book, guaranteeing that it will never disappear, and when Daniel sees The Shadow of the Wind, he knows it &quot;had been waiting for me there for years, probably since before I was born.&quot;  Captivated by this book by Julian Carax, Daniel tries to find out more about its mysterious author and locate additional novels, but he discovers that some other unknown seeker is also searching for Carax's books--in order to burn them.<br />Lovers of the Gothic romance will be handsomely rewarded by the action-filled plot, as a sensitive and loving young boy comes of age while trying to unravel the mysteries associated with the elusive Julian Carax.  A ghostly apparition in the misty lamplight, a faceless man who seems to have an inordinate interest in Daniel, a sadistic police inspector, and an incarnation of the devil himself all materialize as Daniel begins his search for information about Carax.  Heavy, sensual imagery creates a sense of foreboding, while night-time mists, storms, and winter cold add atmosphere to sensational scenes and coincidences.  A mysterious photograph, letters which go astray, false identities, an abandoned mansion with a sobbing ghost, a matricide, an evil stepfather, thwarted love, mysterious disappearances, revenge which never dies, and murder most foul all complicate the action.  The evil characters are truly villainous, Daniel and his father are truly virtuous, and the women whom Daniel and Julian Carax love are pure and true of heart.<br />Though the novel offers a good escape, it is almost six hundred pages long.  Extensive background information for virtually all the characters (and even a house) gives more information than the reader really needs, and many scenes could be compressed.  Occasionally, the mood is broken by mild profanity and bathroom humor.  This romance does achieve more relevance than some others, however, by being directly connected to the world of books, with a setting that reflects the political climate of Spain after the Civil War and World War II.  The characters are memorable, if relatively uncomplicated, and the parallels between Daniel's coming-of-age and the story of Julian Carax offer some sense of universality to this otherwise sensational melodrama.

Change, move, use it.&quot;	The bull-dozing, digging, grading, and construction in Ottawa in the 1970s serve as metaphors for the ambitions and dreams of two men, whose parallel lives exist on completely different planes until they briefly intersect at the height of their careers.  Jerry McGuinty, an up-by-the-bootstraps contractor comes from a family of plasterers, a man dedicated to giving good product for a good day's work.  Simon Struthers, the wealthy son of one of the &quot;Mandarins&quot; of Ontario, on the other hand, is a powerful administrator in the National Capital Division, an independent division of government formed in 1899 to plan the land use within Canada's capital.  While Jerry sees land as offering unlimited possibilities of houses, malls, and golf courses, Simon sees land as a resource to be conserved, not for the sake of conservation so much as to keep the demand high, his own power intact, and his importance enhanced.<br />Jerry's unpretentious and ungrammatical story alternates with that of Simon, and their paths cross when Jerry sets out to build a subdivision that will surround a golf course.  As Jerry's business becomes almost totally hamstrung by the red tape at the Capital Division, his home problems intensify with his wife's alcoholism and infidelity, along with his son's alienation and resentment.  Simon, unable to make any sort of commitment in his private life, also delays action on Jerry's permits.<br />McAdam has tried to make the construction industry an exciting subject for a novel by focusing on the emotionally limited characters in the story, rather than on the industry itself.  Unfortunately, Simon Struthers, one of the main characters, is a cipher with whom the reader will develop little, if any, genuine connection, while Jerry McGuinty commands our full attention and emotional involvement.  With the point of view alternating between Jerry and Simon, the author creates scenes reminiscent of one-act plays, often filled with humor and irony, and inspiring the reader's empathy with Jerry.  Several scenes consist entirely of dialogue and are easy to imagine on stage, but these dialogues also remind the reader of the inanities with which we pepper our everyday conversations, and some readers may become impatient with this conversational &quot;filler.&quot;  Ultimately, the novel focuses on the idea of land as potential, a parallel for the goals and dreams of the characters, which for Jerry is &quot;something big you can walk right past...your modest contribution to the bigness of the world.&quot;  Mary Whippleing the reader's empathy with Jerry.

Irene Wojtyla, the owner of Dancing Master House in Chelsea, is descended from Catholics who fled Russia and wandered across 27 lands and 30 countries before finally coming to rest in London, while her sister Berthe has landed Wales, where she is the Mother Superior of a convent.  Aunt Irene, the adoptive mother of a tubercular and malicious nephew Kyril, has also been adopted by Focus, a white cat, who vainly attempts to vanquish the rat which constantly taunts and torments him.<br />When the sometimes psychic Aunt Irene agrees to take in a postulant from Sister Berthe's convent, the beautiful, black Valentine, who seems to have mystical powers, Irene casually reclaims the room she has illegally rented to &quot;little Mr. Sirocco,&quot; leaving him homeless in order to provide a room for Valentine.  Mrs. Mason, whose derelict husband is constantly drunk, serves as cleaning woman in the household, while the nearby O'Connor brothers keep the house supplied with horsemeat and antiquities obtained through thievery.<br />As these eccentric characters move almost randomly around London, the author shows the transcience of life and the strange acts of fate which change lives.  Aunt Irene spends much of her time trying to avoid the tax man, Focus keeps trying unsuccessfully to catch the rat, Sister Berthe keeps waiting for an eternally fresh apple picked by Valentine to shrivel, Kyril keeps trying to figure out how to seduce Valentine, and death suddenly intrudes into people's lives.  Ellis's study of good and evil incorporates the supernatural as much as traditional religion, giving a fresh view of man's place in the cosmos.<br />As always, Ellis's dialogue sparkles, her characters amuse, and her plot startles with its ironic twists and unexpected turns.  Full of word play, literary jokes, and surprising imagery (the &quot;clutching clamminess of seaweed&quot; and the &quot;cash-like clink of pebbles handled roughly by the dying waves&quot;), the novel is full of humorous, sometimes satiric, observations:  When a woman is hanged for killing her lover, Aunt Irene wonders what she is doing in a country, &quot;where they wouldn't eat horses but they hanged their women.&quot;  In describing the Book of Genesis, she comments that Genesis is &quot;the only view that explained, for instance, mayonnaise.&quot;  More wide-ranging and less tightly focused, thematically, than some other Ellis novels, 27th Kingdom is still vintage Ellis, a pure delight to read.

He has arrived from his adopted home in America to help his cousin Bile, affiliated with a warlord in the south of the city, find and rescue his kidnapped daughter and a friend.  Because he belongs to the same clan as the warlord in the north, Jeebleh may be in a particularly good position to help if the child has been taken by a rival. The political situation is so tangled, however, that at times no one really knows who is allied with whom.  &quot;Here,&quot; someone says, &quot;we don't think of 'friends' anymore. We rely on our clansmen...sharing ancestral blood.&quot;<br />It is not accidental that Jeebleh has received his doctorate for his book on Dante's Inferno, the symbolic parallel for the existentialist nightmare we see in Somalia. &quot;We are at best good badmen or bad badmen,&quot; a Somali tells him as he tries to navigate the minefield of loyalties in Mogadiscio and stay alive.  As Jeebleh tries to figure out whether his cousin Bile is one of the &quot;good badmen&quot; or &quot;bad badmen&quot; and whether Bile's half-brother in the north is involved in the kidnapping, we learn about his family background, Somali culture and history, and the mysterious associates of various warlords who want to &quot;help&quot; Jeebleh.  The novel is filled with high tension as various characters, including Jeebleh, are pulled in different directions by circumstances over which they have no control.  His enigmatic dreams and nightmares are much like the reality of life in Mogadiscio, where the crows and vultures are now tame because they are so well fed by the violence.<br />Author Farah's own background as an exiled Somali makes this novel particularly vivid, and the cultural conflicts and the pressures placed on Jeebleh's family loyalties ring with truth.  As he represses his American values and makes some major decisions as a Somali, Jeebleh becomes part of the story of Somalia, &quot;I've taken sides and made choices that may put my life in danger.&quot;  Stressing that it is &quot;only when there is harmony within the smaller unit,&quot; i.e., the family, that &quot;the larger community finds comfort in the idea of the nation,&quot; Farah creates a taut novel in which the tensions within the family are a microcosm of the tensions within the country.  Realistic in its descriptions and allegorical in its implications, Farah's novel is a breathtaking and sophisticated study of violence and betrayal certain to receive international recognition.

Andrew Greeley uses the Midwest as the setting for a chilling examination of the Church's long-time cover-up of the sexual abuse of children by priests.  Though the book is fiction and the main character imaginary, all the details, according to the author, have actually  happened somewhere in the United States.  The novel opens with an eight-page &quot;partial transcript&quot; of the case of Todd Sweeney against the Church, a stunning testimony in which Fr. Herman &quot;Hugh&quot; Hoffman reveals that when he was a newly ordained &quot;farm boy, six weeks into his first assignment,&quot; he responded to a child's screams and witnessed Father Leonard &quot;Lucifer&quot; Lyon assaulting Todd Sweeney.  In surprisingly graphic detail Fr. Hoffman describes what he saw and the cover-up that evolved when he reported this crime to the Monsignor and Archbishop.<br />Having established all the above in the opening chapter, the author then examines the life of Hugh Hoffman from his childhood in a closely knit farm family through his school years, his genuine (and passionate) love for Kathleen Quinlan, with whom he had a two-year affair, and his college years.  His self-examination, his fears, hopes, and recognition of his own failings, show realistically the evolution of this &quot;farm boy&quot; into a committed priest.  A dramatic contrast with the pedophile priest, the author uses him to show how good priests, over the years, have had to reconcile the teachings of the Church with the imperfect reality of the Church's structure.<br />The author does not mince words, vividly describing the systematic psychological warfare waged against those who challenge the status quo, and he is uncompromising in his depiction of a seminary system which, in need of priests, accepts and often ordains people who have clearly shown their unsuitability to work with children.  The novel is absorbing, with plenty of action, and the author's decision to tell the story from Fr. Hoffman's point of view adds a new dimension to a problem which has been seen until now almost exclusively from the point of view of the immediate victim and family.  The author's comparative statistics regarding abuse by priests vs. abuse by married clergy of other denominations, in the conclusion, support his heartfelt belief in a celibate priesthood, but these statistics are not footnoted, and they change the tone of the novel and make the ending feel a bit didactic.  This is an honest and searching examination of a terrible problem, however, highlighting the difficulties faced by caring priests who have found themselves trapped within an unresponsive system.

Frans Claerhout's idealized vision of her in his paintings--as a colorful Madonna figure, the mother of children who will eventually change the world.  Niki has posed for many of Fr. Claerhout's paintings, a job which has helped her to feed her black son and her half-white daughter, even though she has often had to walk thirty-five kilometers to his studio in order to pose. Niki's story, from her teen years to old age, becomes the story of South Africa itself during the last half of the 20th century, a novel told from the perspective of a black author, and quite unlike the novels of Alan Paton, Nadine Gordimer, and J. M. Coetzee, though they cover the same time period.<br />Excelsior, the township in which Niki lives, is almost entirely black, yet all power in government and business rests in white hands.  Without resorting to melodrama or clich&eacute;s, the author shows in incident after incident, how black women are regarded as chattel, regularly harassed and even raped by their white  bosses, town officials, judges, and even clergymen.  Yet Niki never yields to self-pity, even when she and eighteen other women and the men who have used them are put on trial for violating the Immorality Act, a violation which has produced Niki's daughter Popi.  Imperfect, sometimes angry, and often calculating, Niki comes alive as a woman determined to hang on to her pride, using the only power she has, her sexual power, to control those who would control her.<br />Vivid scenes of South African life from the 1970s to the present bring Niki and her children to life.  As the children grow and become deeply involved in political movements, Mda gives us a clear-eyed picture of South Africa's transition from a restrictive, white-ruled government to a democratically elected government with room for both races.  The black people here are real, not idealized, people with hopes, dreams, and strategies for survival, and they evoke enormous sympathy from the reader, especially as their personal limitations and faults become clear.  Concentrating less on the national violence and battles for survival, and more on the individual conflicts of people in Excelsior, many of whom the reader has come to like and respect, he presents complex issues in a clear, uncomplicated narrative which throbs with life and offers both hope and caution for the future.

Summoned back to the beach house on the Texas Gulf Coast where his family lived and vacationed many years ago, Harry Buelle, a struggling, experimental playwright, is forced to confront his parents' aging, their declining health, and the barely hidden resentments he and his sister have borne against their demanding father for most of their lives.  Dee Buelle, the father, a highly successful playwright with an unbroken string of hits, was both physically and emotionally absent when the children were small, and is now a querulous and impatient man with major health problems, for which he is refusing his medication.  Sarah Buelle, Harry's sister, is a cinematographer filming an interview with her father, its purpose and agenda unclear at the start of the reunion.<br />In the tradition of the theater which dominates the lives of father and son, the author reveals most of the information about family dynamics through dialogue.  Instead of setting and describing scenes, Dressler brings the characters together and then lets them goad each other and bicker, creating clear, sharp moments of high tension as the children confront their parents and the reality of their family life.  Each person's reminiscences develop the family's collective history for the reader and reveal relationships, past and present.  The children's love and admiration for Jean, their stepmother, sets their problems with their father into sharp relief, while some ironically humorous scenes allow the author to control the pace and mood.  Despite the burdens placed upon it, the dialogue moves along smartly and sets a natural, conversational tone.<br /><br />Dressler incorporates a sometimes overwhelming amount of symbolism in this short novel as she subordinates description and plot to the themes:  The stormy winter setting at the beach parallels the cold, often stormy family dynamics.  Though the beach house has been built on stilts, Harry pointedly notes that the house shakes in storms.  A booby bird, being cared for in the house, remains oblivious to the two resident hunting dogs. Firmly rooted in the Southern Gothic tradition, the novel is filled with dark surprises, the most devastating of which come at the conclusion and are used in an effort to resolve the action.  Since this grand finale contributes little to the understanding of the characters, some readers may feel a bit betrayed by the last-minute introduction of two dramatic new elements which further complicate, rather than simplify the lives of Harry and his sister Sarah.

In this unusual story of the Spanish Civil War, author Cercas experiments with the voice of his main character and with the form of this novel, which he describes as \\"a compressed tale except with real characters and situations, like a true tale.\\"  The unnamed speaker, a contemporary journalist in his forties, is investigating the story of Rafael Sanchez Mazas, a \\"good, not great\\" writer of the 1930s, who, in the final days of the Civil War (1936 - 1939) escaped a firing squad and lived to play a role in Franco's Nationalist government.  The speaker believes that \\"forest friends\\" may have helped Sanchez Mazas survive the end-of-the-war turmoil, and he becomes obsessed with locating them, identifying the Popular front soldier who chose not to reveal Sanchez Mazas's whereabouts, and learning why they behaved as they did.  As he investigates the story of Sanchez Mazas and the complex political alliances of the Civil War, the speaker realizes that he actually knows very little about this war, \\"not much more than I know about the battle of Salamis.\\"<br /><br />The speaker, who is obviously Javier Cercas himself, soon begins to expand the scope of his tale, investigating more than the verifiable facts about Sanchez Mazas and musing philosophically about the passage of time, the transcience of youth, the dubious legacy of war, and the nature of heroes.  Wartime heroes live only as long as their friends remember them, and lives and memories are short: one must seize the moment and dance a paso doble in the time available.<br /><br />The complex history of the Spanish Civil War in the first part of the novel is slow, full of unfamiliar names, places, and political alliances, but as the story of Sanchez Mazas unfolds, the reader gradually warms to the speaker's quest to learn everything he can about the incident in the forest.  The scenes near the end of the book, set in a nursing home, are full of touching and emotional realizations, conveying powerful, universal messages about war and heroes from one generation to another (and to the reader) without being didactic.  Cercas's style is honest and full of self-mockery, though some readers may be put off by his syntactically complex sentences, which are sometimes a page long.  Focusing on what it means to be a hero, the novel is a tour de force in which the reader learns as much about the creative process of author Cercas as he does about the almost forgotten author Sanchez Mazas.

It is Christmas-time, and Mary Marsh is spending all her time sitting in a windowseat,  staring out at the quarreling birds while those around her prepare for the holidays.  Shattered by the death of her young son Robin, she is living in her mother's house after suffering a complete breakdown.  Surrounded by well-meaning but dense people who want to &#34;snap her out of it,&#34; Mary sees herself as Iphigenia, a woman willing to be a sacrifice if she can only escape the world and rejoin Robin.  Mrs. Marsh sees her, by contrast, as something resembling &#34;a toad's tummy.&#34;<br /><br />Despite the mordant tone and the genuine sadness one feels for Mary, Ellis has managed to write a tragicomedy that contains at least as much comedy, much of it satiric, as it does tragedy.  Mary's mother, the doughty Mrs. Marsh, regards herself as &#34;the keeper of the cage,&#34; seeing her daughter as &#34;the bird [that] had come back, if only to die,&#34; but she believes her own grief compares to that of Mary, since &#34;she permitted herself to weep a little each morning in the bathroom before she put on her eyeshadow.&#34;  Other family members also arrive with their baggage of problems.  Barbara, Mary's sister, is the hard-working wife of Sebastian, an academic, and in a hilariously described party which Barbara holds for her husband's colleagues, Ellis skewers the pretensions and one-upsmanship of academia while revealing Seb's infidelity with a woman nicknamed (in keeping with the bird imagery) &#34;The Thrush.&#34; Various neighbors and friends arrive at the Marsh household for the holiday dinner, and the predictable chaos and thwarted expectations result.<br /><br />As is always the case with Ellis, every page contains some marvel of observation, pithy remark, or unique description about people and their attitudes.  Sebastian, the academic, has dedicated his life to the proposition that words should be used &#34;with tremendous care..that anyone who couldn't say exactly what he meant should keep his trap shut.&#34;  Mrs. Marsh, however, &#34;liked the human comfort of the clich&eacute;.&#34;  Barbara suffers from &#34;grasping, tentacular nervousness.&#34;  One of the grandchildren &#34;had an ego like the liver of a Strasbourg goose,&#34; and another character has a head that &#34;looked as if it had been lightly buttered.&#34;  Dialogue is sparkling and crafted to reveal character, as Ellis's droll, ascerbic wit turns an essentially sad story into a black comedy of misread cues, with elements of Welsh myth and fantasy serving as counterpoint to the symbolism of Christmas and the realities of life.  Polished, provocative, and deliciously dark, this novel is one of Ellis's best.

In this unfinished (imaginary) biography of the now almost-forgotten Fanny Wright, Fanny Trollope uses flashbacks to explain Wright's development as a firebrand, her association with the intellectual leaders of the day, and the friendship between the two women.<br />Wright spent much time traveling the &quot;paradise&quot; of the United States, while the financially struggling Fanny Trollope remained in London and Paris, where she met Stendahl, Prosper Merimee, Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, William Cullen Bryant, and eventually the revered Marquis de Lafayette.  Fanny Wright and Lafayette had toured the United States together, and biographer Trollope records for posterity their travels and their meetings--with Thomas Jefferson about slavery, with Charles Bonaparte about the &quot;atheistic, utopian, communistic society [of] Robert Owen,&quot; and with representatives of the Haitian government about a possible homeland for freed slaves.<br />When Wright recruits Fanny Trollope to help her promote a 2000-acre colony called Nashoba, near Memphis, the relationship between Wright and Trollope (who brings three of her children with her) comes to life.  Wright intends &quot;to liberate the Negro&quot; and to show that &quot;white men and women can live together without God, money, marriage, or even occupation&quot; in an idyllic community, but Fanny Trollope is shocked by the reality of the Nashoba &quot;utopia&quot; on her arrival.  She notes &quot;the general slovenliness of the people&quot; and the poverty all along the Mississippi, and comments that she has to lift her skirts to avoid tobacco juice in public places throughout the US.  She is horrified that in Robert Owen's New Harmony, small children see their parents only once or twice a year and that many newcomers are freeloaders with no motivation to work.<br />As the two women and children travel throughout the country, the reader observes their increasingly fragile relationship.  Trollope sees life whole, while Wright sees life in ideal terms, failing to recognize people as individuals while setting goals for humanity in general.  Trollope is vividly drawn--resourceful, practical, and instinctively warm--while Wright, the subject of the biography, remains, unfortunately, aloof.  Filled with the intellectual, social, and philosophical debates of mid-nineteenth century Europe and the United States, this novel is a fascinating study of two thoughtful, intelligent women who tried to make a difference.

Barry Fisher celebrates here are men with whom he shared duties on a series of high-masted fishing schooners in the late days of the Depression and early World War II.  Growing up as a &quot;wharf rat&quot; on the Gloucester, Massachusetts, waterfront, Fisher and three ten-year-old friends were lured to the docks almost daily, where they reeled gill nets, stacked pen boards, and scrubbed galleys and fo'c's'les in exchange for fish, some of which they took home and some of which they peddled in the streets from homemade go-carts.  The &quot;fraternity of the wharf&quot; provided them with a view of real life they could not learn from books--the camaraderie and respect the fishermen had for each other, their rowdy humor and courage, and the grief they and their families felt when their friends were lost at sea.<br />Fisher eventually became a doryman, which was &quot;the highest word of respect and affection that one man could use for another.&quot;  In two-man dories (usually ten to twelve dories per schooner), men worked fourteen hour days, each dory crew baiting two thousand hooks on a series of lines which they would set into the water and later haul in by hand, filling their small boats with fish and then returning to the schooner.  They often did three of these &quot;sets&quot; a day, gutting and icing the fish between sets, and rebaiting hooks.  Helpful drawings and diagrams allow landlubbers to understand this fishing method, while historic photographs of children and fully rigged schooners make these now-abandoned fishing methods come alive.<br />Fisher's final tale, &quot;Mysterious Ways of the Lord,&quot; tells of a trip he and a few adventurous fishermen took in the fall, after the swordfish had supposedly migrated from George's Bank (the same sort of trip which Sebastian Junger describes in The Perfect Storm).  Here, however, the vessel was a schooner, and each swordfish was harpooned with an eighteen-foot harpoon by a single man hanging over the bow of the vessel, the rest of the crew standing in the rigging locating the fish.  On this trip, the captain &quot;finds religion,&quot; a tale that Fisher insists is &quot;No B.S., it's the clear truth, me sons.&quot;  A fascinating glimpse of a lost way of life, this account of a doryman's day is an important contribution to the lore of the East Coast fishing industry, written by a man who devoted his life to fishing and  to preserving its history.

On weekends he is aloft in his small plane, his &quot;private box seat in the world and completely outside of it, too,&quot; flying alone around Long Island, observing the apparent orderliness of the landscape without the &quot;pedestrian sea-level flotsam&quot; of everyday life.  Unfortunately, Jerry also lives his personal life the way he flies his plane, as if he's seeing it from a great distance.  Numerous personal catastrophes, enough to unhinge a man more sensitive to his surroundings, are now occurring around and to Jerry and his family, but Jerry's long experience in avoidance allows him to remain disengaged from these events.  Slowly, inexorably, the author develops the family's crises until they finally force themselves onto Jerry's personal radar screen, and he realizes that &quot;I cannot stay at altitude much longer, even though I have fuel to burn.&quot;<br />By focusing on character, especially that of Jerry, rather than plot, and telling the story from Jerry's point of view, author Lee has created enormous challenges for himself.  He must engage the reader's interest in a man who is not really interested in much of anything--a man who does not see family emergencies as the dramatic and heart-wrenching events that they would be to other people and who has no real interest in changing.  So successful is the depiction of Jerry's phlegmatic point of view that the reader, too, may not see these events as very compelling or dramatic until Jerry himself starts to respond to them.  Yet Lee's novel succeeds in its characterization.  His depictions of Jerry and his family strike chords of recognition as he explores the universal questions of how we become the people we are and how we affect the generations which follow.<br />Beautifully written, and full of penetrating observations and felicitous turns of phrase, the novel is a sensitive and often painful exploration of the human condition, filled with characters who are utterly isolated at key turning points in their lives.  Subtle in its development, and rich in imagery and obvious symbolism (Sir Harold Clarkson-Ickes's attempt to fly a balloon around the world, the Discovery Channel's story of the defeat of a lion king), this quietly complex novel by a prodigiously gifted author offers evidence that even a man as determined as Jerry Battle to remain above the fray must ultimately connect with the earth.

But she is also an understanding author, recognizing that their foibles and limitations stem from their upbringing and experience, as they muddle along as best they can, aided by each other, and sometimes the church.  This three-part novel concerns the imminent marriage of twenty-year-old Margaret to Syl, a man in his forties, and is told through three points of view:  Margaret, who does not love Syl but intends to go through with the wedding; Syl's mother, the sensible Mrs. Monro, who, abandoned by her husband, does not want the marriage to take place; and Lili, a friend of Margaret's mother from school in Egypt, who arrives in a whirlwind, determined to upset the status quo.<br />From Margaret we learn of her passionate first love and a shocking death that have occurred during the year she spent away at school in Egypt.  Devoutly religious, Margaret is torn between the concepts of romantic and religious love, and she cannot seem to reconcile the church's teachings regarding love, sex, sin, and death.  Mrs. Monro, an elderly lady for whom death is very real, if not imminent, is hiding secrets associated with her own past love life.  For her, too, love is associated with death and God, though in ways vastly different from Margaret's experience.  Into this mix comes Lili, half Egyptian, half English, a free spirit unconcerned with traditional, churchly definitions of sin, and sexually liberated in her own life.  Lili is determined to save Margaret from the &quot;pointless secular martyrdom&quot; of marriage.<br />A sensitive, philosophical exploration of love and sex, God and sin, and life and death, the novel is also an examination of the compromises people make, willingly or unwillingly, in order to find happiness during their lives and loves.  Sparkling dialogue and thoughtful interior monologues reveal the sadness, loneliness, and confusion within many of the characters, while Ellis's sense of irony and ability to create absurd scenes lift the mood with cathartic comedy.

In this broad saga of the New Territories, from Montana into Canada, Guy Vanderhaeghe brings to life the search of two Englishmen for their lost brother, Simon Gaunt, who has pursued a charismatic preacher in the hopes of converting the Indians to Christianity.  No word has been heard from him in over a year.  While twin brother Charles genuinely misses Simon, older brother Addington sees the search as a grand, selfish adventure-an excuse to hunt at his father's expense.  The three brothers share the same blood and have had the same upbringing, but they have taken very different paths in life, and the sojourn in North America provides the stimulus which allows each one to discover his own inner nature.  As Addington becomes more brutal and selfish, Charles becomes more sensitive and realistic.  Gradually, an image of Simon emerges, through Charles's descriptions, as a &quot;man dreaming so deeply as to be incapable of wakening to reality.&quot;<br />As the search party departs, every member is seeking some kind of love, acceptance, and a sense of connection to the wider world.  Jerry Potts, the scout, is half Scots and half Blackfoot Indian and yearns for his small son from whom he is estranged.  Lucy Stoveall is searching for the brutal killers of her 13-year-old sister Madge Dray.  Custis Straw, who loves Lucy, suffers from nightmares about the Civil War and the loss of his family.  Addington, who becomes deranged as time progresses, hunts and kills animals and Indians for the sheer bloodlust.  Constant motifs of blood and bloodlines pervade the novel, as the trip challenges each member to understand who s/he is by birth and who s/he has become through the accidents of history.<br />The great Northwest, with the power and grandeur of its scenery, its wildlife, and its rapidly changing weather provides for innumerable dramatic scenes.  The honorable and caring Lucy and the venal Addington are as much the personifications of good and evil as the heroines and villains in western melodrama.  Ultimately, all the plot elements unite in a satisfying conclusion which extends twenty-five years beyond the search for Simon and ties up loose ends.  Rousing and absorbing, this melodrama highlights the settlement of the frontier at the expense of Indian cultures, and one can almost hear echoes of a melancholy honkytonk piano in the background.

The death camps of the Reich provide the underpinnings of this intense and fast-paced novel in which the author draws new attention to the collusion of governments and institutions in protecting Nazi war criminals into the present day.  Gabriel Allon, the main character, is working peacefully as a fine art restorer in Venice when he is suddenly summoned by his mentor in the Israeli secret service to investigate the bombing of the Vienna Office of Wartime Claims and Inquiries.  Although the Austrian government has declared the bombing to be the work of an Islamist terrorist group, Allon believes it is more likely the result of current anti-Semitism within Austria.  An extremely conservative candidate for Chancellor is given a high likelihood of winning the coming election and, the author points out, bringing the philosophy of the Reich into the twenty-first century.<br /><br />As Allon searches for the perpetrators, the action careens from Vienna to Israel, Italy, Argentina, the US, and back to Vienna, and involves complex political, financial, and national security issues affecting a number of countries.  Always, the present is tied to the history of the Reich.  Erich Radek, a former Nazi, is still alive and active in Vienna, his war-time obliteration of the graves and bodies at Polish death camps so total that a new generation of Austrians is now asking, \\"Where is the evidence that the Holocaust ever happened?\\" Konrad Becker, a Zurich banker, has a mysterious client with over two billion dollars in assets;  a Catholic bishop who helped war criminals escape is still connected to governments and police;  successive governments in Argentina have provided aid to war criminals since the time of Peron; and American CIA agents have protected some war criminals during the Cold War.  As Allon narrows the search to one well-protected man, the violence reaches a crescendo.<br /><br />Silva's journalistic style is perfectly suited to his subject matter.  He presents information efficiently and without preamble, in short sentences which move the action along quickly.  Incorporating historical facts within his fictional framework, he provides testimonies from the Holocaust library at Yad Vashem, evidence from Auschwitz and Treblinka, and an account of Adolf Eichmann's capture to elevate the fiction, give it credence, and pack an emotional wallop.  Within this exciting chase to apprehend the murderer, Silva develops his thematic goal of bringing continuing injustice to light, and few readers will fail to be moved by his zeal and the power of his historical details. This is a strong novel which transcends the usual \\"thriller\\" designation because of its reliance on verifiable evidence.

Annoyed when her lover shows signs of weakness and has qualms about beheading the corpse, the woman begins the gory process herself.  The reader quickly becomes caught up in the action as a former official in the Justice Department, also spending the night at the same monastery, begins an investigation into the murder. Clever deduction, additional gory murders, threats to the life of the investigator, and his single-minded dedication to unmasking the murderers, while combatting professional jealousies among his peers, make this an exciting addition to the traditional murder mystery genre.<br />Only the structure of the novel is traditional, however, for this murder takes place in eleventh century Japan, and the detective is Lord Akitada Sugawara.  Seen primarily as a family man, he is fully drawn, a man with foibles and failings, in addition to high ideals of honor.  As Akitada investigates the murder, the author subtly develops the intellectual climate of the times: the use of hell screens in Buddhist monasteries to instill the fear of death, the value placed on antiquities and the scholarly life, and the integration of art (calligraphy, painting, elaborate embroidering, and flute-playing) into the lives of the characters.  Customs, including the payment of dowries, the leaving of paper messages at local shrines, the social separations between classes, funeral and mourning customs, and the obligations of the aristocracy to the court, combine gracefully with period details, even including the kind of straw raincoat and headcovering worn by travelers, and the number of finely made, colorful silk gowns worn under a woman's kimono.<br />Intelligent and impelled to action more by his passions than by his sense of duty, Akitada comes alive, while his &quot;helpers&quot;--Tora, a former soldier, and Genba, a former wrestler--add liveliness, spark, and comic relief to the novel.  Tora falls in love with an acrobat/actress, and Genba falls for the immense owner of an athletic training hall, a wonderful character named Miss Plumblossom, who is an expert in stick-fighting.  The author's ability to reveal emotion through gestures (a hand on a servant's shoulder and the servant touching the fingers in return) is matched by her ability to describe scenes of humor, love, and torment.  In short, she recreates life in its beauty and sorrow as lived by characters with whom the reader will feel a kinship, despite the unusual setting in another country over a millennium ago.

Aware that she depends on Robert, who is &quot;my mother and my child and without him I [am] desolate,&quot; she also chafes at the bonds of marriage: &quot;The thing about marriage is that it must be exclusive.&quot;  Lili and Robert are staying in England with an old friend of Lili's from school in Egypt, a woman who is planning the imminent marriage of her twenty-year-old daughter Margaret to a much older man with whom Lili has a history.<br />Through Lili's meanderings around town, we meet the various characters involved with the wedding and are exposed to their different attitudes toward marriage:  The gloomy bride does not love her fianc&eacute; but intends to go through with the wedding; the older fianc&eacute; needs to acquire the trappings and seeming stability of marriage but is still seeing other women;  the bride's mother, divorced from a man who has a horrifying secret, believes that &quot;only a fool would marry for love;  and the groom's mother, Mrs. Monro, divorced after her's husband's betrayal, has simply gone on with her life, alone.  Lili ponders whether her own need to associate with Mrs. Monro us because she is trying &quot;to gain her strength, to identify with her&quot; as she contemplates her own infidelity, secure in Robert's love.<br />Love and marriage are examined with reference to each character's strength or dependence, sense of commitment or  willingness to betray, and expectations and disappointments.  Echoes of the Adam, Eve, and Lilith story pervade the action.  Lili's complexity--her surprising vulnerability hidden behind the façade of liberation--adds weight to this sensitive and very funny examination of marriage as an institution.

In his delightful send-up of the art world, museums, their trustees, and conservators, author Giles Waterfield recreates one tumultuous day in the life of the BRIT, the Museum of British History, as it prepares for a major exhibition, the centerpiece of which is an almost unknown painting by Gainsborough, owned by the Chairman of the BRIT Board of Trustees.  The painting, &quot;Lady St. John Impersonating Puck,&quot; sets the tone for the novel, loosely based on Shakespeare's comedy, A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Oberon and Titania, the King and Queen of Fairies, become Auberon Booth, the Director of the museum, and his girlfriend, Tanya.  Helena and Hermia in Shakespeare's play are loosely represented here by Helen Lawless, the Asst. Curator of Art, and Hermia Bianchini, the Exhibitions Assistant.  Bottom, the leader of the &quot;rude mechanicals,&quot; is echoed in John Winterbotham, the Head of Security, who is trying to protect the Gainsborough.<br />The novel opens &quot;on the morning of Midsummer's Day of 2001,&quot; as Helen Lawless, in charge of the exhibition, manages to sneak a peak at the Gainsborough, previously kept hidden, and leaves with some questions about the dog in the left-hand corner.  Jane Vaughn, the Chief Curator, also develops questions. She has discovered a significant difference in the appearance of the dog between the current painting and an early photograph.  Eventually, Diana, Jane, and the head of the Conservation Department plot to view the painting without Security present so they can shine a UV light on it to examine the surface.<br />As other characters become involved in the action, the reader soon realizes that this is a study of egos and ambition as reflected in the clash between the trustees of the museum and the &quot;worker bees&quot; who run it.  Several &quot;thwarted in love&quot; scenarios add intrigue and color to the narrative, with the plot coming to a climax at the banquet celebrating the exhibition, when the Trustees' far too ambitious menu creates havoc among the catering staff (which has no kitchen in which to prepare four hundred meals), and a slapstick scene, worthy of Monty Python, results.<br />Beautifully executed and great fun to read, the novel does not require any familiarity with Shakespeare or with museums to appreciate the broad comedy, the farce-like disasters which befall the prideful trustees and administrators, and the author's gentle satire of pretension.  Wakefield, who has experience in the art world, chooses to walk the fine line between trenchant observation and biting satire.

In this most romantic of novels,  Susan Fromberg Schaeffer recreates eleventh century court life in Japan, revealing the refined aesthetic sensibilities and the bloodthirsty brutality, the sense of honor and the petty jealousies, the samurai code and the human need for love.  In language which compliments the spare writing style of ancient poetry, she reveals the everyday the lives of the courtiers, their relationships within the court, and their behavior during times of crisis--war, plague, sudden illness, and changes of fortune--concentrating especially on two characters--Lady Utsu, reputedly the most beautiful (and dangerous) woman in the court, and Lord Matsuhito, who comes to her as her bodyguard and soon falls in love with her.<br />As in all romances, the course of love never runs smoothly.  Lord Matsuhito goes off to war almost immediately after the love story begins, and returns, a samurai, to find her missing.  She, accompanied only by her pet fox, is in seclusion, believing that she is destined to kill everyone she has ever loved.  As the setting alternates between Lady Utsu and Lord Matsuhito, and between the court and the countryside, the author broadens her scope, incorporating bandits, peddlers, farmers, and wanderers, along with their daily activities, lifestyles, and concerns, bringing the eleventh century vibrantly to life.<br />Epic in scope, the novel contains many of the magical elements common to both epics and romances.  It is a story of &quot;lost children,&quot; heroism in warfare, unknown identities, and two lovers who may be fated to be together, at the same time that it is also the story of secret messages, dreams and memories coming to life, hidden treasure, coincidences galore, unexpected rescues, animals with human abilities and understanding, and even nature itself helping the heroes.<br />Though lovers of well written romance may not care about a few weaknesses, some readers may be distracted by the way the story moves from reality to dream and back, sometimes without warning or explanation.  The circumstances surrounding a battle and the significance of the outcome are not always clear, and the main characters sometimes seem to ramble around the countryside without much purpose.  The dialogue frequently sounds wooden, and the constant foreshadowing of the future can be distracting:  &quot;Her comment caused a chill to steal over [him], as if the sun had gone behind a cloud,&quot;  and &quot;A hawk was circling.

Unfortunately, the film is now just as gone as Gilbert, and Milano finds himself fielding questions from the local police.<br />Moving at breakneck speed, the story of Milano's search for the missing footage and the unknown killers moves from New York to Los Angeles and then on to Barcelona, Los Angeles, Boston, and back to New York.  Along the way Milano meets a motley assortment of film-connected characters: a murderous body-builder, a man of a thousand voices, a kleptomaniac producer's assistant, a second-rate producer who plans to remake two of Orson Welles first-rate classics, his hermaphroditic wife, the Spanish soccer team, and even an &quot;art&quot; photographer who photographs operating rooms, post-surgery.  Murder piles upon murder, and mayhem upon mayhem as Milano tries to recover the missing &quot;Ambersons&quot; footage and keep himself alive.<br />Klavan's background in theatre shows in his reliance on &quot;visual effects&quot; to provide both the drama and the humor, rather than on his skill with words or ability to describe or evoke atmosphere.  Because the author provides very little actual description as the narrative rockets from location to location, the success of the novel depends upon the reader's own ability to use his/her imagination to visualize the action and &quot;see&quot; the absurdity and irony of situations and their considerable humor.  The often clever dialogue is used to move the action forward, instead of developing characters.  With the underbelly of the film industry as its setting, its lightning fast action, knock-down-dragouts, and twists and turns galore, this could be a very funny feature film, offering humor, non-stop action, and mystery.

It's too good to be true...&quot;	Billed as a master of &quot;Cuban noir,&quot; Jose Latour presents a dark novel of gambling, the American mob, and violence in Havana in 1958, during the presidency of Fulgencio Batista, a friend of mob boss Meyer Lansky.  Lansky is deeply involved with the Casino at the Capri Hotel, having made deals with many of the employees, inspectors, and supervisors. Now, during the World Series between the New York Yankees and the Milwaukee Braves, he also expects to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars in bets on the games.  A motley group of locals, working for Elias Naguib, a businessman with ties to New York mob boss Joe Bonanno, has been planning a &quot;fool-proof&quot; robbery of Lansky's take, but ironically, the death of Pope Pius XII and the early closing of the casinos &quot;out of respect&quot; on the last night of the World Series changes the timing of the heist, and a bloody mess results.<br /><br />Tawdry Havana with all its neon tackiness and grubby glamour comes alive here.  Corrupt politicians, paid-off police, and mobsters control businesses ranging from prostitution and abortion to the international sugar, jewelry, gaming, and spare auto parts industries.  Massive collusion leaves the average citizen powerless to control his own destiny, as Latour recreates the atmosphere which propels Fidel Castro to power a few months after the novel concludes.  By alternating Lansky's activities with the play-by-play of each of the six World Series games, the author creates a sense of credibility and realism, and as the bodies pile up, the internecine rivalry among New York mob families adds external complications to the complex internal struggles for influence in Havana.<br />Latour is an extremely precise, controlled writer who has plotted his novel to the last microdetail, leaving no loose ends, and the novel moves along smartly, despite its complexity.  Developing drama and suspense through his careful selection of details and his ability to create a milieu by amassing specifics and piling them upon each other, he allows himself no forays into romantic description or heart-tugging literary pictures.  What you &quot;see&quot; here of Havana appears to be presented with almost journalistic impartiality.  Complex and exciting in its plotting and fully detailed in its depiction of 1958 Havana, this is a fine novel, bold and masculine in its presentation and full of the violence and uncertainty which presaged Castro's arrival into Havana.

In this fascinating novel there are many &quot;skeletons.&quot;  Every character, including the serious and thoughtful Mrs. Monro, is hiding some aspect of the past from others, and it is these skeletons from the past which support the structure of the book and determine the present action, the forthcoming marriage of Mrs. Monro's son Syl, a single man in his late forties, to Margaret, a young woman barely in her twenties.<br />Mrs. Monro recognizes that Margaret does not love Syl and may, in fact, loathe him, but since she herself had reason to marry someone she did not love, she does not condemn.  Instead, she empathizes silently with the bride, without understanding why she is going through with the wedding.  Eventually, Mrs. Monro reveals her own skeletons and her heartbreaking past, and when her son's &quot;skeletons&quot; are revealed, it is no surprise that several fianc&eacute;es have cancelled previously scheduled weddings.  The bride's father, divorced from her mother, has a horrifying secret, and Lili, one of the wedding guests, an acquaintance of both Mrs. Monro and the bride's mother from their days in Egypt during the Empire, has several secrets of her own.  As the date for the wedding approaches, all the skeletons come out of the cupboard with both humorous and poignant effects.<br />This is one of Ellis's more thoughtful novels, dealing with Mrs. Monro's intelligent and sensitive reflections on love and sex, God and sin, and life and death, both as these subjects have affected her own life and as they seem to be concerning other characters in the novel.  Grounded in reality, eminently practical, and honest in her assessments, Mrs. Monro is a contrast to the bride's mother and the younger characters, all of whom refuse to come to grips with the past.  Darker and more philosophical than many of Ellis's other novels, the novel stands on its own, offering insights into this aging woman, her difficult life, the compromises she has made, and their ultimate significance.

Unwilling to accept &quot;impossibilities,&quot; he has constantly challenged the status quo, often in wildly heroic actions. Seemingly fearless, he learned from his earliest childhood in Dutch Java that Fear dwelt in a Black Cave, but &quot;you must defy him, and a pebble in your mouth will protect you.&quot; Hazelhoff has spent his entire life with a pebble in his mouth, boldly marching past Black Caves which have swallowed lesser men.<br />A consummate writer whose first article was published when he was only sixteen, Hazelhoff vividly, often humorously, and always candidly recreates his childhood in Java and his various lives as a ranch hand in Argentina, as a law student in Leiden, as a friend of Queen Wilhelmina during her World War II exile in England, and as a member of the Dutch underground during the German Occupation. Eventually, despite poor eyesight, he became a pilot for the RAF, making many bombing runs over Germany as a Pathfinder pilot. An aide to Queen Wilhelmina after she returned to Holland, he also managed to work in Hollywood, where as Erik Drake, he had some screen roles. As a VP for the fledgling NBC, he worked both in news and in advertising, headed Radio Free Europe, wrote a book about his war experiences, and even engaged in oil exploration off the coast of Israel. In each of these &quot;incarnations,&quot; he had adventures galore, always defying fate and accepting whatever happened without complaints and &quot;what-ifs.&quot;<br />Throughout this exciting and beautifully written autobiography, Hazelhoff reveals his belief in core values. He defends his country, honors his word, shows genuine respect for those worthy of it, and refuses to take himself seriously. His autobiography reveals him to be one of the genuine heroes of the 20th century, though he would probably be embarrassed to be considered one, and his notes on his late years, in which he contemplates his own death, are both poignant and memorable for his revelations of what he has learned and the manner in which he will, some day, face the Black Cave. This is a book which has something for everyone, containing personal insights on history, observations about society, and revelations of the personal philosophy which has allowed him to become, over the course of eighty-plus years, an inspiration to men and women of all cultures and all ages.

It is your best weapon.&quot;	From his earliest beginnings in the hospitality industry, helping his father to run a family restaurant, to the culmination of his career, his twenty-seven-year stint managing Hawaii's Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, once named by Esquire magazine as the third-ranked hotel in the world, Adi Kohler dedicated his career to serving his guests and maintaining the highest standards in every area of the hotel business.  Author Catherine Tarleton describes Kohler's childhood in the Sudetenland, the family's post-war emigration to Germany, his growing commitment to the hotel business, and his eventual employment at the Hotel Crillon in Paris and a series of Rockresorts--Jackson Lake Lodge in Wyoming, Caneel Bay in St. John's, Dorado Beach and Cerramar Beach in Puerto Rico, and eventually Mauna Kea Beach in Hawaii.<br />Warm and good-humored, Kohler was always a consummate professional, a man who believed from the outset of his career that he should never say no to a guest.  He maintains his professionalism in this biography, talking about the hotel industry itself, especially the Rockresorts for which he worked, rather than the celebrities, Presidents, and foreign dignitaries who were regular guests at &quot;his&quot; hotels.  There's no dirty linen aired here.  Instead, the book emphasizes how Kohler and the other professionals hired by Laurance Rockefeller were able to help &quot;LSR&quot; achieve his vision.  At Mauna Kea, that meant turning a pristine beach and the bare, lava rock plain surrounding it, into a landscaped gem of architecture named by Fortune magazine as &quot;one of the Ten Best Buildings of 1966,&quot; its golf course regularly named among the nation's Top Hundred Courses, and its hotel service celebrated world-wide.<br />Always encouraged in his career by his wife Chacha, to whom he pays loving tribute here, Kohler clearly loved all aspects of his job, the hotel, and the Big Island.  Detailed anecdotes abound, showing the level of care and the respect with which his guests were always treated.  In 1988, Kohler was named &quot;Resort Executive of the Year by the American Hotel &amp; Motel Association for his dedication to excellence, an award which will not surprise the many guests who became his friends during the quarter century of his Mauna Kea career.

This powerful and richly atmospheric  novel, a classic in Spain for the past fifteen years but only now translated into English, captures the love of an old man for his land and for the village in which he and his ancestors were born.  It is also a study of the inexorable effects of time and the pressures it exerts on isolated communities and the human inhabitants who lack direct connection with a wider world.  Told from the point of view of the elderly Andres, the last remaining inhabitant of a crumbling village in the Pyrenees, the novel details his physical and emotional deterioration as he observes the parallel collapse of the town, &quot;whole buildings kneeling like cattle,&quot; the village itself a mangled and sad &quot;unburied corpse.&quot;<br />As the novel opens, Andres tells us that this is the last day of his life, describing what the men approaching from the nearest town will discover when they come to Ainielle for the first time in ten years.  Gradually, Andres reveals the history of the village and of his own family, capturing his own desolation and possible madness.  His confrontations with ghosts--of his mother, his three children, and wife Sabina--slowly reveal his life as a family man, along with his disappointments, his sometimes self-defeating behavior, and his never-ending desire to keep alive the village in which his ancestors worked the land.  He knows that when he dies, any remaining vestiges of the village and its way of life will disappear from the earth.<br />Andres's memories and his confrontations with ghosts add color, variety, and a sense of drama to what would otherwise be an interior monologue, showing the conflict between Andres and the forces of change.  His preparations for his own death and description of the images the approaching visitors will see on their arrival constitute the quiet climax.  The imagery is breath-taking.  Realistic and grounded in the stark reality of farm life in a poor, nearly dead village, the nature imagery reveals parallels between the inner forces which have driven Andres to become the last human in Ainielle, and the passage of time and the seasons--deep snow, the rushing water of spring, and the falling poplar leaves, which he sees as &quot;the yellow rain.&quot;  A haunting memorial to those people who are incapable of accepting the changes of time, the novel forces the reader to consider those values and aspects of the past which are lost from our heritage when the memories and experiences of the elderly are not preserved, when old villages disappear, and when future generations do not care.

Completely confident and controlled, she has no need to show off all her skills in every novel, and it is only by reading many of them that one notices her remarkable versatility and truly appreciates the magnitude of her individual talents.  In this novel she subordinates her always sparkling dialogue to the main character's ironic interior monologues and a more thoughtful analysis of her themes, the relationship between love, death, and God.  In the process she creates a sad and confused character with whom the reader develops enormous sympathy.<br />Margaret is a young woman planning her wedding to a much older, very boring man whom she does not love, &quot;someone who meant to [her] as little as his mother's dog,&quot; believing that she &quot;deserved nothing better.&quot;  Very gradually, the author reveals Margaret's past in Egypt six months before, a time in which she fell in love irrevocably with someone she &quot;loved more than [her] immortal soul.&quot;  Now she is back in England, under the control of her mother, who had controlled her life &quot;until about half a year ago, when I so briefly lived my own [life]and...destroyed it.&quot;  Her mother's friend Lili, a free spirit married to an artist, becomes the first person who offers Margaret a more positive and pro-active view of life, if only she will accept the &quot;truths&quot; Lili has gleaned during her own chaotic life.<br />Clothing imagery pervades the novel, with Lili believing, metaphorically, that &quot;clothes are the person,&quot; while Margaret wonders if the elderly have minds like old wardrobes, &quot;stuffed to overflowing with useless memories,&quot; which they can take out and look at and question.  As clothing, both real and symbolic, is discussed in relation to the wedding, the associated memories come out of the &quot;wardrobe&quot; and reveal the characters' attitudes toward life, love, and even the grace of God.  As Margaret's sojourn in Egypt is more fully revealed through her own memories, the reader becomes acutely aware of the contrasts between her naïve view of the world and that of her mother and her mother's friends, who while equally naïve in many respects, are also less thoughtful.  Complex in its thematic development,the novel saves its climactic revelations for the conclusion.  Finely crafted, exciting, and thoughtful in its depiction of love in all its manifestations, this is one of Ellis's more introspective and more serious novels.

Until that year, each batter had had to rely on a pitcher's stats and his own experience in trying to anticipate pitches.  Videotape existed, but using it to show a player his individual at-bats was a prohibitively time-consuming process.  By 1991, however, Pete Olivieri, Scott's father, had developed a computer program which would not only record each at-bat and each pitch but would allow individual players to call up at-bats instantly so they could be reviewed and studied.  Players could also use multiple screens to compare and contrast swings and hits. Without fanfare, the computer suddenly became an essential part of the game.<br />Olivieri's lifelong love of the team shines through here as he describes being a child growing up a few miles from Fenway Park, playing Little League with Jim Rice's number on his back, memorizing locker combinations by associating the numbers with Red Sox players' numbers, and watching or listening to every game.  Even as a youngster, however, he realized that &quot;the Red Sox, ultimately, are a symbol of disappointment.&quot;  Time after time, he watched a team &quot;with superb talent losing in ways screenwriters couldn't script.&quot;  His chance to make a difference, using a home-grown computer program to give an edge to the batter, not only allowed him the chance to meet some of his heroes but actually to help them to improve their hitting--and maybe the team's record.<br />Olivieri's descriptions capture both the romance the game and the tedium of the locker room, the camaraderie of the players and the excesses of the press, locker room &quot;etiquette&quot; and the public missteps of some of the players.  He himself is a respectful, &quot;background&quot; sort of person, careful not to call attention to himself so that the players can discover for themselves his program and its opportunities.  His opinions of Wade Boggs, Ellis Burks, Mike Greenwell, Phil Plantier, Roger Clemens, and the unfortunate Jeff Gray ring with truth and personal insight.  Red Sox fans, computer specialists, and lovers of baseball should be fascinated by this behind-the-scenes look at the interface between the computer and baseball--the beginning of a new era.

An &quot;empty vessel,&quot; he believes that if he can learn everything there is to know about someone through psychoanalysis, he can bring about a transferrence of identity and make his own life more complete.  When he hears the cries of Clementine, a village woman giving birth to triplets, he stops to give aid and ends up delivering her sons--Noel, Joel, and Alfa Romeo.<br />Though the birthing scene is humorous, the full satirical flavor and the allegorical construction of this novel do not unfold until Timortis travels into the village.  There he discovers that he has arrived just in time for the Old Folks Fair, at which old people are auctioned off like cattle and treated like them.  Later Timortis visits a shop where he sees a child being worked to the verge of death, then revived with icewater.  Farm animals, however, are given days off when they behave themselves and allowed to hitchhike if they need rides.  A scapegoat, named Glory Hallelujah, retrieves putrid, decaying things from a blood-red stream with his teeth, his job being to &quot;swallow the shame of the whole village.&quot;  The vicar announces that  &quot;God is not utilitarian.  God is a birthday present...a luxury, a tasseled cushion made of beaten gold.&quot;  A horse is crucified for his sexual depravity.  Additional bizarre episodes abound, leaving the reader to ponder the meaning of the non-stop action, at the same time that s/he is whisked along by the speed of Vian's prose to new and still more surprising events.<br />Puns, word play, and literary inventions fill the novel, even as Vian's often lyrical sentences and vibrant descriptions set the scenes.  Satirizing the existing world for some of its most obvious faults, Vian presents a remarkably open-ended allegory, which makes the reader think at the same time that s/he often laughs at the absurdities and winces at the truths.  But this is no full-blown alternative universe created to illustrate a serious and specific political or social agenda.  Here Vian symbolically smiles at the reader as he leads Timortis through this strange community from episode to episode, illustrating his own opinions in a more or less random way, having fun all the time, while making some serious points.  Not scholarly, though highly literate, this is a book for which one must buckle up, sit back, and just enjoy the ride.

Or be, sort of.&quot;	In his longest novel, written in 1970, Nobel Prize-winning author White examines the question of an artist's creativity, where it comes from, whether it can be controlled, and what obligations, if any, accompany it.  As he traces the life of Hurtle Duffield from the age of four until his death as an elderly (and successful) avant-garde artist, we see Duffield always as somehow different from his peers.  The son of a laundress and a bottle collector, Hurtle is from birth inspired, painting large images on walls as a toddler, but he recognizes at an early age that &quot;people look down at their plates if you said something was 'beautiful.'&quot;  To provide him with opportunities which will allow his genius to flourish, his parents sell him to the wealthy family for which his mother works when he is four years old.<br />As a member of the Courtney family, Hurtle travels and becomes educated, though he continues to see rather than think.  For him, the usual emotional traumas of adolescence are accompanied by unique questions of his identity, both because of his two families and also because of his view of the world.  Not religious, he sees God as the Great Vivisector, and men treating each other as animals, slaughtering each other in war.  When he himself goes off to war and returns to find that the family has gone in separate directions, he devotes himself, once again, to his art, using women who love him as vehicles for his own self-expression and behaving as a vivisector himself.  About his painting of one model, White says &quot;[Hurtle] disemboweled her while she was still alive.&quot;  As time passes, Hurtle continues to search for love, inspiration, self-expression, and some sort of balance in his life between his immense need to paint, his desire for personal connection, and his simultaneous need to be alone.<br />White's prose style is direct and concise, elegantly simple, and easy to understand.  He uses colloquial speech-words like &quot;smoodge,&quot; &quot;sook,&quot; &quot;slommacky,&quot; and &quot;mumped,&quot; which must be understood from context-and reveals character and action through dialogue.  The novel is old-fashioned, using a straight chronological narrative with no complex flashbacks, and it is quite romantic in its plot elements, despite its serious theme development.  The biggest problem for the reader is that the main character is not very likable, nor does he inspire a great deal of empathy--a difficult character to live with for approximately six hundred pages--and I'm not sure how typical he is of the artists he is supposed to represent.

Author Hunter wastes not a moment in drawing the reader into the complexity of Cuban life as he reveals the chances ambitious men, many of them Americans, are willing to take in the economic and political free-for-all which has accompanied Fulgencio Batista's seizure of the presidency in a recent coup.  American interests, including the interests of American mob boss Meyer Lansky, Batista's friend of more than thirty years, are being served by Batista's dictatorship.<br />Hunter recreates the tension-filled jockeying for power and the no-holds-barred violence which accompany it by presenting a large cast of characters representing the various elements contending with each other for dominance in Havana.  Earl Swagger, a former State Policeman from Arkansas and a Medal of Honor winner, has been hired to be bodyguard for the venal Congressman Harry Etheridge, who believes that the American gangsters in Cuba are trying to muscle in on contracts for all the services at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay.  Mob boss Meyer Lansky is now thoroughly entrenched in Havana, colluding with American corporations which need cheap sugar, labor, and fruit.  The Soviets have assigned a parolee from Siberia to &quot;handle&quot; Fidel Castro, whom they are trying to educate and groom for higher office.  American Central Intelligence has set up shop in Havana, though various station officers have formed &quot;off-campus&quot; alliances which will leave them independently wealthy.

A great yawn incarnate.&quot;	Though these words are spoken by a priest, they could have been spoken by any of the bored and guilt-ridden characters of this novel, all of whom are at loose ends, uncertain whether their lives have any meaning at all to anyone.  Bernard Leverson, a music examiner, is bored with his wife, telling her, &quot;After twenty years of marriage, you feel as if you're the same sex.&quot;  She, in turn, is having a tepid affair with a neighbor, engaging in &quot;the humdrum routine of deceiving their partners, not out of love but boredom.&quot;  The Leversons' fourteen-year-old son, craving genuine feeling and communication, instead sees indifference and seeks excitement in shop-lifting and misbehavior.  Nuns in the local convent and priests at the local church perform the routine requirements of their vocations, sometimes without genuine feelings of commitment.  Other characters atone for &quot;sins&quot; committed long in the past, wasting their present lives in the fruitless search for personal absolution.<br />Winner of the 1965 Miles Franklin Award for Best Australian Novel of the Year, The Slow Natives is Thea Astley at her most thoughtful and complex.  In compressed language and sparkling dialogue, she explores the meaning of love in all its permutations, along with the &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;guilt&quot; so often associated with it.  Unique and witty descriptions abound: A monsignor's soul, &quot;doily-neat, had scalloped edges of predictable pattern&quot;; two men lunching at an inn notice the dining room &quot;filled up with crustaceans--varnished hard-jawed mums and small-bit farmers coated with the same malty staleness&quot;; and one woman, annoyed at another, snaps, &quot;You know what they used to call [you] at school?  Alma Martyr!&quot;<br />As her characters interact and overlap, affecting each other's lives, though not necessarily inspiring their love, Astley evokes genuine feeling for them, allowing her readers to empathize with them.  The humor for which she is so often lauded is subordinated here--she does not poke fun at these sad, often earnest, and very &quot;normal&quot; people.  Revelations do come to them, often at a great price, and few readers will fail to be moved by the climactic ending.

Unlike them, however, she was more interested in stones than bones.  Though she was the discoverer of Zinjanthropus, one of the most important of the early hominid skulls; thousands of other fossilized hominid bones; and the little hominid footprints at Laetoli, more than three million years old, she was looking for artifacts when she found them.  She believed that it was man's early tools and the insights they gave about early man that were the keys to understanding what man was like at various stages of evolution.  While Louis was looking for bones, Mary was often tracing and recording the art of the rock shelters she discovered or looking for handaxes.<br />The daughter of a well-known artist who had an interest in archaeology, she was also a descendant of John Frere, an 18th century British archaeologist, who reported on extinct animals sixty years before Darwin published his theory of evolution.  Though she had only two or three years of traditional schooling, she traveled through Europe with her parents, crawling through pre-historic caves in France; collecting flint tools, end scrapers, and bone points among the spoil heaps of Peyrony's excavations in France; and eventually working on excavations in England herself.  It was her artistic talent which brought her to the attention of well-known archaeologists, including Louis Leakey, who needed someone with background in archaeological excavation who could also illustrate.<br />She candidly shares the personal details of their relationship throughout the nearly forty years of their marriage, during which time they raised three sons, all of them eventually making discoveries of the own, with Richard making more discoveries than both of his parents combined.  Generous in crediting other researchers for their contributions, and genuinely curious and hard-working, Mary betrays none of the ego and competitive sense here which seem to dominate this research field.  In fact, it is only when Donald Johanson, working in Ethiopia, uses her discovery of a jawbone 1000 miles away to draw what she considers erroneous conclusions about his much more complete (and quite different) Lucy skeleton that we see her ferocious temper, not out of jealousy but because she believed his book to be &quot;lightweight,&quot; inaccurate, and misleading in its conclusions.  Her own autobiography, by contrast, is always painfully honest, carefully considered, and modest in its assessment of her own contributions, a fascinating story of a woman who marched to her own drumbeat.

Abel Jones, a Welsh immigrant, is a soldier for the Union Army, seriously wounded during the early campaigns of the Civil War.  Sent home to Pennsylvania to recuperate and rejoin his family, he is soon called back to service, this time in an investigative capacity.  His high moral standards and his trustworthiness have brought him to the attention of President Lincoln, who has asked him to investigate the murder of General Carl Stone so that Lincoln and the country can avoid an international incident. The Germans and Russians are clamoring to know who killed Gen. Stone in Heckschersville, a community of Irish miners, and why.  Gen. Stone has been recruiting Irish miners in Pennsylvania to the Union cause, and an Irishman has confessed to killing Gen. Stone.<br />The Civil War is raging, and local boys are dying.  Wealthy mine owners are building personal empires while their workers endure abominable conditions. Revolutionaries and republicans are vying for political influence, churches and parishioners are trying to reconcile Darwin's Origin of the Species with their traditional beliefs, and women who have been the sole support of their families during wartime are being forced into subordinate roles when their men return from war. All these issues, well researched, play a part in the drama and add realism to the novel.  Vivid personal glimpses of Lincoln, Sec. of State Seward, and other historical personages, combined with personal observations by Abel Jones, also develop a sense that these are real people engaged in real problems, subject to real, personal limitations.<br />This is not strictly a historical mystery, however.  A strong sense of Gothic melodrama infuses the action, and a number of scenes are positively macabre.  A gruesomely described exhumation, a visit to a madhouse, and necrophilia, incest, cannibalism, and bloody self-torture play as much of a role in the novel as accurate historical detail.  These bizarre details distract the reader from the complex history, some of which, such as the role of  labor activists (known as Mollie Maguires), is hinted at but never fully developed, making the author's focus feel a bit fuzzy.  Parry is a fascinating writer, however, with many strong gifts.  His vibrant characters, dialogue, unpredictable plot twists, and breath-taking narrative of the Battle of Fredericksburg make the reader hope he will find a balance between the excitement of real historical events and the sometimes disturbing melodrama he often creates to accompany them.

A Kindness Cup, which received the Australian Book of the Year Award in 1974, focuses on the evolution of a small outback town, from a place ruled by entrenched and narrow-minded elders who define their own &quot;justice,&quot; to a more civilized community which recognizes change.  A former teacher returns for a homecoming celebration twenty years after brutal events showed him the evil within the hearts of the town's rulers.  Here he confronts his own role in the events and attempts to avenge the wrongs done to an old friend.<br />The Acolyte, which won the Miles Franklin Award in 1972, focuses on the influence of a blind pianist and composer on those who admire and work for him, &quot;the yes-men who can't do a thing ourselves.&quot; As the young &quot;acolyte&quot; finds himself becoming middle-aged, still in the thrall of a demanding and insensitive artist, Astley raises questions of independence vs. dependence and the factors which make some people willing to subordinate themselves to others.<br />Both novels illustrate the great difficulty many people have in separating themselves from those with influence and power, whether that be the result of sociological pressures, as in A Kindness Cup or the result of someone's personal magnetism, as in The Acolyte.  In both novels disasters occur because of a main character's weakness or helplessness.  But whereas A Kindness Cup is dramatic, excruciatingly tense, and plot-driven, The Acolyte is more character-driven and philosophical, sometimes satirical, and full of religious symbolism.  In this pair of novels, the reader sees Astley handling a wide variety of narrative styles, developing complex themes within concise limits, and peppering her narratives with dialogue ranging from colloquial to formally elegant.  An excellent introduction to the immense talents of this Australian novelist.  Mary Whippleist.  Mary Whipple	2003-12-21

Taking pot-shots at the advertising business, the press, psychiatrists, school systems, nuts-and-granola nutritionists, marriage, parent/child conflicts, and the tendency of people to avoid getting involved--Ellis crafts a hilarious tale based on the discovery in a nearby canal of a body which matches the description of the missing neighbor Barbs.<br />No one knows who the victim is, and the police, in fact, do not know that Barbs is missing.  Her neighbors have not reported her absence for fear of being wrong--&quot;we do not want to make idiots of ourselves.&quot;  As days pass and Barbs remains missing, each of the neighbors comes up with reasons for believing that her absence is temporary and that she will return.  It is not until the teenage children of the main characters decide to have a dinner party in Barbs's empty house, discovering many clues in the process, that the matter of her absence gains critical importance.<br />Revealing most of her information about character through their actions and unusually clever dialogue, Ellis presents a series of intimate dramatic scenes, usually between two characters whose conversations and reactions to each other's comments show the author's psychological astuteness--parents and children miscommunicate, married couples avoid issues, friends tell each other what they want to hear.  Not a word is wasted in this very witty, very wry, and beautifully wrought tale, one of the funniest pieces of ironic writing in recent memory.  Mary Whipple	2003-12-18

Nothing's funny in Hell.&quot;	In a weak moment, sardonic journalist Lydia, recovering from a faithless lover, invites an emotionally needy acquaintance, to accompany her to a primitive cottage in rural Wales.  Never particularly fond of Betty, &quot;the human equivalent of sackcloth and ashes,&quot; Lydia finds herself alternating between resentment of Betty's good sense and optimistic outlook, and toleration of her desire to be helpful and, not incidentally, do the cooking.  The two women have decidedly different temperaments, with Lydia often cynical, worldly, and full of snide comments, while Betty is honest, direct, and patient.  Their conversations, often hilariously ironic dialogues, show two people who have nothing in common, stuck with each other for a vacation and toughing it out.<br />Hywel, a dour farmer;  Elizabeth, his fearful wife (with a secret lover);  Beuno, Hywel's brother, who is studying to be a priest;  and randy Doctor Wyn provide Lydia and Betty with their only real social life--a dull dinner party given by Elizabeth, visits by Beuno (whom Lydia regards as &quot;one of her own kind&quot;) to discuss philosophy, trips to the Fair and to a concert, walks in the countryside, and eventually a grand finale of a picnic, all of which offer a marked contrast to Lydia's lively, intellectual life in the city.<br />In brief dramatic interludes, interjected throughout the narrative, Hywel's sister Angharad, a deformed and mute &quot;free spirit&quot; (or demon) who roams the countryside, comments poetically on what she observes of these people and their behavior when she looks through windows and eavesdrops on conversations in the woods. Drawn to nature instinctively, she notes the contrasts between human nature and the life she sees in the woods and countryside.  &quot;If the land was a graven image, then Angharad was its priestess.&quot;  Mysterious, &quot;unexplained laughter,&quot; heard only by Lydia, adds mystical overtones to the novel, though the laughter is usually associated with observations made by Angharad.  Gradually, Lydia begins to learn more about man and nature, love and betrayal, and good and evil, especially the nature of Satan, whom she calls by the much less threatening name of  &quot;Stan.&quot;  Dry, ironic humor contrasts with genuine sadness, and cynicism with sensitivity here, as Lydia's farcical intrusions into the country life lead her to new understandings and a greater appreciation of the real world.

An energetic and inconstant lover, Jasper has an affinity with Donne, a &quot;serial philanderer&quot; whose poems reflect his changing attitudes toward love and sex as he ages, from his early celebration of variety in lovers, to a later, more mature discovery of the new world which opens when one finds and/or loses &quot;true love.&quot;<br />Jasper invites us into his life from the opening paragraphs, creating interest and suspense by telling us in an intimately casual way that &quot;atrocities&quot; had occurred while he was touring the Tate Gallery of Modern Art. In a farce worthy of Monty Python, a gallery-clearing fire alarm allows him to exchange of e-mail addresses with a potential new lover.  Some days later, a second, even more slapstick burlesque occurs as Jasper tries to prevent Lucy, his lover of one year, from entering his apartment and discovering his &quot;Tate Modern flirtation&quot; in his bedroom.  The humor throughout is broad, bold, and masculine, and the succession of wild scenes is easy to visualize, though female readers may cringe at Jasper's casual duplicity as he lures gullible women into his bed.  Eventually, however, Jasper begins to reflect the signs of true love which Donne has described in his poems, a love that may turn out to be his &quot;deal with the Devil.&quot;<br />Jasper's casually vulgar speech and his willingness to share his inner life with the reader are an effective counterbalance to the formality of Donne's poetry, which begins each chapter.  The author creates and sustains suspense throughout the novel, leading to an exciting story of relationships, with the end result always in doubt.  Docx's descriptions add immeasurably to the pleasure of the action, and his wry commentary on people and places is irresistible--i.e., &quot;talentless men and women&quot; at a club engage in a &quot;ceaseless search for the dwindling plankton of each other's personalities.&quot;  In view of the cleverness with which Docx reveals Jasper's relationships, the ending of the novel is disappointing, however--contrived, unrealistic, and full of coincidences. The subtlety with which Donne's poetry has provided the intellectual underpinnings of the novel vanishes in a wild, plot-driven grand finale, which feels artificial within the context of this study of Jasper's emotional &quot;growth.&quot;  Still, the novel is great fun--full of broad humor, sharply observed social commentary, and the vagaries of love and sex across the ages, a stunning debut for a very talented new author.

The Naylors' niece Lois is nineteen, a bored young woman without goals, impatient to get on with the job of finding a husband so that she can fulfill her apparent destiny.  Her cousin Laurence, an Oxford student who would rather be in Italy or France, also has little to do, a condition he shares with a married couple, Francie and Hugo Montmorency, who visit friends like the Naylors regularly, having no home of their own.<br />A British army unit is garrisoned nearby to protect their loyal subjects-and, not incidentally, provide a ready source of young men for garden parties and tennis matches.  With an acute eye for detail, ironic detachment, and a sometimes caustic wit, Bowen reconstructs the lives of these aristocrats. One comments that it would be &quot;the greatest pity if we were to become a republic and all these lovely troops taken away.&quot;  Laurence remarks cynically that he would like to be present when &quot;this house burns and we should all be so careful not to notice.&quot;  When an informer tells the family that guns have been buried on their property, they are blas&eacute; about it-they don't want to tell the soldiers because it might result in the trampling of some new trees.<br />Throughout the novel, Bowen's prose remains formal and detached.  When Lois and a young soldier begin to think they are in love, there are no passionate scenes-both are a product of their time and upbringing, and kisses are reserved for the engagement.  When nearby estates are attacked, the Naylors simply change their schedules and limit their travel.  Bowen's book has the ring of truth-she herself was part of the Ango-Irish tradition in County Cork,  and she wrote the book in 1929, when the revolution was still fresh.  Though she puts an iconoclastic spin on attitudes and values, she offers no apologies, preferring to present the facts, create the scenes, and allow the reader to judge for himself/herself whether Ireland was better off before or after The Troubles.

Finlayson has managed to create a cookbook of slow cooker recipes that are so savory and intriguing that you really could use many of them for more formal dinners than what &quot;crockpot cookery&quot; usually suggests.  Tortilla Soup with Corn and Chilies, Mixed Mushroom Soup with Creamy Goat Cheese, and Chicken Mulligatawny Soup are just a few of the outstanding soup recipes.  A very well-seasoned Curried Lamb with Apricots, a Cuban-Style Flank Steak (shredded and served with cheese inside tortillas), Sausage and Barley Jambalaya (with Shrimp added at the last minute), and African-Style Braised Chicken in Peanut Sauce would satisfy even the most discriminating palates.<br />Readers should be aware that this type of gourmet cookery comes with a price--you will spend more time in preparation for these meals than the &quot;dump-everything-in-the-pot-and-open-it-up-ten-hours-later&quot;-type of slow cookery.  Some recipes call for two cooking sessions, one to slow cook the meat, and an additional 3 - 4 hours the next day when you add the vegetables and other ingredients.  Nearly all recipes require you to partially cook some ingredients in a skillet before adding to the slow cooker, and quite a few call for ingredients which may not be part of one's ordinary pantry--dried ancho, New Mexico, and pasilla chili peppers, in addition to a wide variety of fresh chili peppers (usually available in large supermarkets and ethnic food stores) and fresh herbs and spices.  Many of the recommended meat cuts are very high in fat, though the fat can usually be skimmed off after cooking.<br />Dessert recipes look intriguing, including a cheesecake which is put into a springform pan in the slow cooker with 1&quot; of water used to steam it, but unless you have no oven available, I can't imagine using these recipes in preference to the tried and true favorites. All in all, this is for the cook who wants really outstanding taste and is willing to do the extra preparation that these slow cooker recipes require.  Mary Whipplecooker recipes require.

Once again, Dave Robicheaux is the local homicide detective who tries to sort out crimes and bring evil-doers to justice, as he has done in previous Burke novels.  This time, however, we see Robicheaux as a darker, more vengeful investigator, a man willing to do whatever is necessary to bring guilty parties to justice within this notoriously corrupt political and judicial system.  Alone in the city, and without the family support system which previously &quot;humanized&quot; him, he is now a man with nothing to lose.<br />Accompanying Fr. Jimmie Dolan though Toxic Alley, a wetlands area where waste disposal contractors have poisoned the groundwater and sickened dozens of young black children with their illegal dumping, Robicheaux visits the granddaughter of Junior Crudup, a blues singer and guitarist from the 1950s, who disappeared in Angola Penitentiary. Determined to discover what happened to him, Robicheaux also wants to know who is responsible for the recent beating Fr. Dolan, the Catholic priest.  While this plot is unfolding, three seventeen-year-old girls die in a car crash, shortly after stopping at an illegal &quot;drive-by daiquiri store.&quot;  The manager of the store soon shows up dead, and his connections to other, supposedly legitimate local businessmen come under scrutiny.  The business of pornography and drugs bring Mafia hitmen into the city, and soon bedlam breaks out, as the local police, county police, state undercover agents, and the FBI all lay claim to investigation.<br />Successfully incorporating a great deal of historical background into the action, Burke shines a spotlight on the criminal activity, showing the reader its scope and giving some perspective on how and why the social problems we observe in the novel came into being.  Marauding white street gangs of the 1950s, the systemic sadism of the penitentiary and its Red Hat Gang of the '50s, virulent racism, the rise to power and wealth of men engaged in dishonest businesses, the collusion of police and their reward of lucrative payoffs, the activities of organized crime syndicates, and the ability of those in power to manipulate both the political and legal systems are all shown to be contributing factors in the corruption we observe in these plot lines.

In his newest and most complex novel to date, McCabe gives the reader another disturbed young main character, trying to survive alone in a hostile world.  Joseph Mary Tallon, the main character here, uses his personal journal to reveal his life in a small town on the border of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The journals begin in 1976, with brief narratives about a Provo murder and a suicide, suddenly shifting without transition to Joey's revelations about The Seeker, a deceased friend with whom he discussed Carlos Castaneda and listened to Santana.  Again without transition, he describes his long-time relationship with someone named Mona, with whom he lives in a trailer at a sometime gypsy camp, though we also discover that he worships someone named Jacy from afar.<br />Because Joey does not always explain background or identify characters, the reader is not always sure who the characters are, their roles in his life, or how events are connected.  He is \\"scattered,\\" shifting quickly from Provo activity, to a priest's plan for a peace rally, and to his own search for nirvana, all of which keep the reader constantly energized and involved in deciding what is real and what is fantasy.  Clearly unstable, he is an unreliable narrator who tells us about the world from his very limited perspective.<br />Unlike McCabe's earlier characters, Joey is intellectually curious, reading Hesse, T.S. Eliot, Gogol, Ginsberg, and Burroughs, and he is a compulsive writer.  Despite his delusions, and his impulsive actions, resulting at one point in a jail sentence of several years, he achieves considerable success, writing stories, plays, screenplays, and even a novel. This allows McCabe to expand his scope beyond that of dramatic plot twists to show how one becomes a writer, how writing attempts to bring order to the world, and how writing, ultimately, can be misunderstood.

He takes it one step further, however, finding golf particularly revealing of a President's personality and values.  &quot;Nearly every person in a president's privileged life says yes...Only the golf course says no.&quot;<br />Accumulating fascinating anecdotes from his research into the golf games of the Presidents, and combining these with his own experience as a reporter, which includes more than two years spent covering President Clinton, he shows how a President's golf game reflects the inner man.  Fourteen of the last seventeen Presidents were golfers to one degree or another, and no reader, whether a golfer or not, will be disappointed in the unique insights and revealing anecdotes the author gives us of Presidents at leisure.  What makes this book different from so many others, is that Van Natta is a real writer, carefully choosing his quotations (including on-course remarks), narrating anecdotes so that they have real climaxes, and emphasizing details that are so telling that no reader will fail to see parallels between the man's golf and his Presidential administration.<br />Though JFK is adjudged the best player of the fourteen, with an &quot;effortless swing,&quot; few citizens knew how addicted he was to the game, something he kept secret because, after Eisenhower's administration, golf was considered a political liability. (Ike left cleat marks in the floor leading from the Oval Office to the practice green outside his window.)  Ike, JFK, FDR (who was a passionate golfer until he was stricken with polio at age 39), and Gerald Ford are considered the purists of the game, and none of them were ever caught lying about a score, using mulligans (extra shots off the tee), or tossing the ball out of the woods.  Not surprisingly, Bill Clinton is considered among the White House's &quot;most polished and prolific golf cheats.&quot;  As one observer noted, &quot;You don't have to subpoena Whitewater documents.  Just watch him on the golf course.&quot;  He elevated the mulligan to such a new level that it was referred to as a &quot;billigan.&quot;  Nixon, LBJ, and Warren G. Harding, were also considered cheats.<br />With a final section devoted to the Bushes, father and son, Van Natta closes his analysis of Presidential golf games with particular panache, since the Bushes so often play together.  The book is pure delight, providing a unique take on Presidents, who, on the golf course, face the same challenges as the rest of us, with some of them responding more gracefully to the challenges than others.

They had to dub.&quot;	Harriet Browning, a novelist with an obsession for old-time movies, lives in Ottawa with her husband Lew Gold and their two children, ten-year-old Kenny, who likes to dress as Frank Sinatra, complete with fedora, and twelve-year-old Jane, who fantasizes about being a movie star.  Lew, a &quot;heritage architect,&quot; is far more pragmatic than the rest of the family, having very little interest in the movies, especially as an escape, and he is worried about Harriet's retreat into films.  Tall and serious, Harriet is often thought to resemble Greta Garbo, and Lew sees her as &quot;a woman without a romantic bone in her body, until she [sits] down in front of a movie.&quot;<br />Harriet herself &quot;shares&quot; her day-to-day concerns with her favorite film critic, Pauline Kael, writing unsent letters and using Pauline as a sounding board as she tries to work out issues in her own life.  The lives of the Gold-Browning family are thrown into an uproar when Leah, Harriet's aunt, once married to a Hollywood figure, announces that she and her stepson Jack Frame are coming to Ottawa to stay for several months.  Since &quot;even a calm letter from Leah was like a missive from Liza Minnelli,&quot; Harriet must prepare herself to cope with their arrival and with the fact that she has depicted Leah unflatteringly in a recent novel.<br />Hay's style is energetic and fast-paced, and the novel is filled with lively but realistic dialogue.  Harriet and her family sound like real people with real personalities engaged in real problems, and Hay successfully avoids the pitfalls of being cute.  Harriet's neighborhood comes to life in all its humanity, and becomes a microcosm of the real, outside world-her close friend Dinah battles cancer, lonely senior citizens long for love, a neighbor dies, and spouses start to be attracted to other people.  The movies offer a way to escape from the immediate complications, however, even for Kenny, a victim of schoolyard bullying.<br />Hay incorporates a great deal of nature imagery, using it to enhance her themes, and eventually, Harriet is forced to confront the workings of nature in her own life.  &quot;Life couldn't compete with the movies, but death could,&quot; she discovers.  Themes of romance and reality, love and friendship, life and death, and the &quot;wonderfulness of modest lives&quot; are all revealed here within the context of one Ottawa neighborhood, illuminated by the movies that give excitement to their lives. Like the life cycle of nature and the change of seasons, this novel has beginnings and endings, and growth and change, all revealed within the unique context of old movies, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, and Frank Sinatra.

Eventually Vesper becomes part of Holberg's milieu, a transcriber of Holberg's compositions, confidante of his wife and sister-in-law, friend and admirer of Holberg's iconoclastic, elderly aunt, and a member of the &quot;hideous Greek chorus of yes-men who can't do a thing ourselves.&quot;<br />The relationship between Holberg and Vesper and the parallel relationships between Vesper and the other members of Holberg's &quot;family&quot; are fascinating for their psychological insights, and Astley develops them with sophistication and elegance.  The debilitating effect of Holberg on those surrounding him is obvious, but just as obviously, most of those involved with him are unable, for a variety of reasons, to break clear of him. They are, as Vesper says, &quot;like the slaves who built tombs for the pharaohs,&quot; until, of course, the tension builds to a life-changing climax for all.<br />More character-based than many of Astley's other novels, this novel is filled with details which the reader must filter and evaluate in order to figure out what is happening.  Astley is distanced from the action, requiring the reader to draw conclusions on his/her own.  A certain archness or self-conscious cleverness, which may be appropriate in telling about a character like Holberg, nevertheless requires the reader to &quot;translate&quot; what she's saying into real-world terms, and it sometimes feels artificial and off-putting.  Mordantly satirical in parts, the novel is filled with religious imagery, and as the tension between Holberg and his acolyte, Vesper, increases, the reader finds the boundaries between savior and sinner increasingly blurred.

It's certainly a coming-of-age novel, tracing, as it does, Melissa Dickinson's life from age 17 - 19, and it's certainly a political novel in the sense that it focuses on her relationship with her father, a conservative senator from Pennsylvania and former two-term governor, a proponent of the death penalty who oversaw several executions.  It's also a &quot;suspense&quot; novel in that it involves research into possible corruption, with a grand climax in the last ten pages.  Thin on character, it is also more theatrical than subtle--easy to imagine as a film or TV program.<br />The third child in a political family which does not have enough time for her, Melissa Dickinson is a bright student who goes off to a fine university in Connecticut.  There she immediately meets a handsome young man who, for reasons she cannot fathom (but which the reader will immediately guess), sweeps her off her feet and engages her in an overwhelming, passionate affair.  She soon discovers that he is the son of a lawyer who represented a convicted murderer executed during her father's term.  He wants to &quot;research&quot; her father and collect data about him, and she, resenting the family dynamics, which do not recognize her as an individual, agrees to help her lover.<br />Romantic and melodramatic, the novel depends on the reader's belief that the daughter of a two-term governor who is now a senator and friend of the President really could be as naive as Melissa is.  Though she is seventeen, supposedly has scored 1460 on her SATs, and has attended fine schools, she apparently has no curiosity whatever about government or education in basic civics, referring, at one point, to the Secretary of the Interior--&quot;whatever that meant.&quot;  Her point of view is reflected in short, simple sentences, like that of a much younger teenager, until she begins her relationship with Blake Ackerman, when her sentences get longer, though she continues to think in cliches: &quot;She felt as if he were the only person she had ever known who saw what she needed.&quot;<br />As the data-gathering on her father continues, Melissa still remains completely naive, suspecting neither motives nor actions, even when they involve computers, hidden keys, floor plans, and vows of secrecy.  Most readers, however, will guess the plot complications before they happen.  Though some sympathy may be generated for Melissa, she and the other characters are stereotypical, rather than unique, and they behave according to form.  The grand climax, when it happens, may be less grand for some readers than they had hoped.

The Wall dividing East and West Berlin has just come down, and Germany is in the process of reunification, attempting to erase the invisible walls still dividing the people of Berlin and of Germany as a whole.  Arthur Cape, an American reporter for Sense magazine, has been in Berlin since 1989, documenting the story of the reunification and the surprises which have accompanied it.<br />On his way to a Halloween party in 1992, he sees a ghostly stranger and knows instinctively that this messenger comes with information about Marta, a former lover whom he has not seen or heard from in three years.<br />Through Marta's story, the history of the ethnic unrest in Yugoslavia unfolds.  The daughter of a movie star who has married three times, each time to someone of different ethnic background, Marta is a Muslim, though her sister Dubravka, who occasionally visits her in Berlin, is a Serb, whose allegiance is to the Christian Orthodox church.  Her brother Mato is a lapsed Catholic.  As the story alternates between Berlin and Mostar, and between Arthur and Marta, the reader observes the growing brutality among the various groups, with Marta's brother offering the chilling conclusion that there are only two kinds of people-&quot;those who have slit the throat of another human being and those who haven't.&quot;  In a unique and thought-provoking thematic twist, Marks draws parallels between what is happening in Yugoslavia and what has happened in Berlin.<br />The novel gets off to a quick start with the appearance of the Halloween &quot;revenant,&quot; and  Marks's crisp prose and perfect, illustrative details advance the action and keep the story moving at breakneck speed.  The peaceful reunification of Berlin offers a poignant contrast to the growing violence of Mostar, with Marks presenting a clear picture of the conflicts through the action, never allowing the complexities of historical background to overwhelm his story.  Irony abounds, especially when a German, Hans Kreichler, becomes the European administrator of Mostar during a temporary cessation in the violence.  Most of all, however, this is a moving love story about two fully drawn people for whom love and war exist on parallel planes.  As they struggle to reconcile the tension between their hopes and disappointments, dreams and torments, and aspirations and earthly cares, the reader sees their struggle as a universal one-one waged by thoughtful individuals, enlightened governments, and philosophers and clerics the world over.

Lady Eleanor Oliphant, through whose journal the story unfolds, accompanies her brother Henry to India when the family fortunes plummet and the King appoints Henry to be Governor-General in India, his base to be in Calcutta.  Reflecting the attitudes of the early British colonialists, Eleanor tells us that she has twenty-seven servants, five of whom are needed whenever she washes her hands.  More reflective than some of the other Englishwomen she meets, she admits that &quot;The danger of this place is that I am learning to deny myself nothing.&quot;  By contrast, her sister Harriet, also on the trip, finds India to be exhilarating, freeing her from the restrictions placed on women of her station in England and allowing her to make a real, independent life for herself.<br />Charged with winning over Afghanistan for Britain and preventing it from falling under the influence of Russia, Henry and his entourage travel from Calcutta to the Punjab to win the help of a raja there.  Accompanied by ten thousand traveling companions, including his sisters and his household staff, Henry's caravan involves ten miles of beasts and men.  As they travel in relative comfort west across the subcontinent, Eleanor records outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever, drought, and starvation so severe that 400,000 local people die in one area alone.  Many deaths occur en route, and crippling loneliness sometimes overtakes the travelers, but Eleanor finds herself unexpectedly growing from the experience.  In Delhi, where they meet the Emperor, Eleanor admits, &quot;I find I am no longer very fond of Englishmen.&quot;<br />One Last Look is character-driven, rather than plot-driven, and Moore's depiction of the language and attitudes of the times is flawless--formal, restrained, and often self-indulgent.  Though real memoirs were used as resources, Moore compresses time and scenes in ways uncommon to real memoirs, employing a novelist's sense of drama and a psychologist's sense of observation to lend the novel a real beginning, middle, and end.  Lovely observations and descriptive passages revealing the vastness of India provide a welcome contrast to the smallness of the lives of the British aristocracy, whose insensitivity is presented with considerable irony.  Though Eleanor grows enormously from her time in India, she never becomes a character with whom the reader feels immense sympathy, and it is clear that that is not Moore's intention.  When Eleanor admits that &quot;Nothing will ever be the same&quot; after her India experience, the reader can only think of the extent to which that is the case for her Indian &quot;hosts.&quot;  Mary Whippleed as resources, Moore compresses time and scenes in ways uncommon to real memoirs, employing a novelist's sense of drama and a psychologist's sense of observation to lend the novel a real beginning, middle, and end.

He exposes the corrupt government of Rwanda, the venal politicians, the self-serving Belgian security service, the ineffective public prosecutor, the weak Canadian general and the UN functionary who refuse permission to seize huge arms deposits, and the French, who not only sell arms to the terrorists but train them to be more efficient.  Adding to the problems is the AIDS epidemic.  Yet somehow, within this environment, a Canadian in his forties finds a fragile and beautiful love with a Rwandan in her twenties.  Bernard Valcourt is a Radio Canada producer setting up a TV station in Rwanda.  Gentille is a waitress at the hotel, a beautiful young woman who approaches Valcourt, begging him for help.  A Hutu by birth, she looks like a Tutsi-tall, pale, and fine-featured, and no one, including Valcourt, really believes her Hutu ethnicity.  Then the genocide begins.<br />Courtemanche's lyrical nature imagery and poignant love story are in sharp contrast to the horrors of the torture and genocide of Tutsi men, the rape and mutilation of their women, and the maiming of their children.  He is brutally honest and graphic in his depiction of the cruelties, telling a powerful story which has received little attention, especially in fiction.  The AIDS epidemic and its devastation, as seen in stories of Valcourt's friends, add further darkness to this sad, continuing saga.  Atrocity gains a human face here, and love takes on new meaning and value.  Though some readers may question Valcourt's actions at crucial moments near the end of the book, no one can question Courtemanche's courage in telling this story and in naming names.

In this homage to literature, the literary life, and the power of literature to influence a reader's life, Tobias Wolff focuses his attention on a small New England prep school in 1960, a school in which students live and breathe \\"the writing life.\\"  The headmaster has studied with Robert Frost, and the Dean is thought to have been a friend of Ernest Hemingway during World War I. To the boys, the English Department is \\"a kind of chivalric order,\\" where they practice the \\"ritual swordplay of their speech.\\"<br /><br />For these students, the highlights of the school year are the three-times-a-year appearances of literary luminaries.  When a writer visits, one boy has the opportunity to have a private audience with him, an honor for which the boys contend in vigorously competitive writing contests.  The speaker/narrator, a scholarship student, is desperate to win an audience: \\"My aspirations were mystical,\\" he says.  \\"I wanted to receive the laying on of hands that had written living stories and poems.\\"  As various writers--Robert Frost, Ayn Rand, and finally, everyone's idol, Ernest Hemingway--are scheduled to appear at the school, the reader observes the growth of the boys, especially the speaker, as they are influenced by and react to the contest, to each other, to the visiting writers, and to the writers' speeches.  In the contest to meet Hemingway, the novel reaches its peak, and in a shocking way, the speaker's life changes forever.<br /><br />Wolff's novel is most remarkable for its point of view and for its conciseness.  We never know what the speaker looks like or even his name, since it is through his eyes that the entire novel is filtered.  He is interested in poems and short stories and philosophy and writing, all of which he talks about in detail, not in the observation of his surroundings.  The limited setting of a New England prep school expands as the speaker ages and moves from school to the crueler outside world, and in later chapters, in which we see him as a mature writer, we also see how he uses some of his school experiences in his fiction, some of which appears within this novel.<br /><br />Old School is a novel which students of writing will treasure--for its revelations of what it means to be a writer, its insights into the thinking of a perceptive teenager who is both idealistic and pragmatic, its irony, and its remarkable narrative voice.  The themes are beautifully realized, and not one word is wasted or rings false.  Though Wolff says that \\"No true account can be given of how or why you become a writer,\\" he comes as close here to illustrating that process as in any other novel I've ever read about the writing life.

Brennert focuses on the human tragedy, both of individual sufferers and of their families who, suffering guilt by association, were ostracized by their neighbors and employers.  But he also emphasizes the personal triumphs of these patients, recognizing their dignity and celebrating their achievements. Though a leper colony can never be free from profound sadness, Brennert avoids turning this novel into a ten-hanky tearjerker, focusing instead on the lives the patients create for themselves and on their attempts at normalcy.<br />Rachel Kalama, the main character, is a typical 5-year-old growing up in a loving family in Honolulu when her mother first sees a sore on Rachel's leg which will not heal.  Although she keeps Rachel's condition a secret for a year, Rachel is eventully seized by the health inspector, who receives a bounty for capturing her, and sent to a secure Honolulu hospital.  A year later, she is sent to Kalaupapa, on Moloka'i, and her isolation--at the age of seven--is total.  The &quot;family&quot; she develops in Kalaupapa, her friendships with other young children, and her refusal to let the disease (or any of the nuns) control her spirit make her life bearable, and the reader will admire her pluck even while dreading what her future holds.<br />Yet Rachel is one of those in whom the disease develops very slowly, and her story continues through her teen years, her marriage, and well beyond.  Through her, Brennert shows the history of the settlement, the history of treatment for Hansen's disease, and the history of Hawaii itself, including the seizure of the Queen and the annexation and colonization of the islands by the American sugar barons (events which clearly parallel Rachel's story).  Brennert enriches his novel by incorporating events described in real documents and journals into his story, from its lawless, &quot;wild West&quot; atmosphere at the outset, to its final development as a &quot;home&quot; for the people who live there.  He memorializes many real people among the fictional characters, including Robert Louis Stevenson.<br />Though there is melodrama and sentimentality here, and Rachel's life at Kalaupapa may be more rosy-colored than it was in reality, the emotion flows naturally from the subject and the author's desire to present the full historical record.  Few readers will remain unchanged by Rachel's story.

Conscientious and dedicated to his job, Christian tells us in the opening pages that he is haunted by ghosts of the past--both of Klara, his lover, and of his wife Elizabeth, with whom he has four children. He abandoned all of them, years ago, to seek a new life. As Olafsson depicts Christian's early life in Iceland and his escape from it, he simultaneously portrays the glittery life of William Randolph Hearst and, peripherally, his relationship with the omnipresent actress Marion Davies.<br />The reader quickly sees innumerable parallels between the lives of Christian and Hearst, both in their love affairs and in their financial affairs, the differences being those of scale. Both hope to create new personal worlds in San Simeon. Olafsson shows through the symbolism and nature imagery which permeate the book, however, that this desire runs counter to nature, and he  implies that no matter how much control Hearst may try to exert over the outside world as he builds his castle, that he will be unable to overcome the natural desolation of its gravelly soil and dry creek beds.<br /><br />Christian's life, too, is closely linked with nature. He abhors the confinement of Hearst's zoo animals and once rescued and released a mouse from inside the house. He is particularly sensitive to birds, and the bird imagery which fills the book is associated with old memories and freedom. Yet despite his apparent romantic empathy with the birds, Christian cannot overcome his personal nature and his inborn selfishness. When he wants to draw a hawk, he tells us &quot;I shot it yesterday. It had been making a nuisance of itself.&quot;<br />The symbolism and the parallels that exist between Christian, Hearst, and nature sometimes feel a bit forced, as if the author is molding his plot so that the parallels with nature will work, and some readers will reject the romantic concept that nature takes a direct interest in man. Other readers may be disappointed by the dominant theme that man is incapable of changing his nature. Still, the story of Christian Benediktsson is fascinating, the nature imagery vividly imagined, and the tie-in with William Randolph Hearst both effective and appropriate to the thematic development.

Using a real literary fraud from Australia as the basis for his main plot, Carey introduces the reader to Lady Sarah Wode-Douglass, the editor of a small English poetry magazine, always on the verge of financial collapse.  Persuaded by John Slater, a poet and friend of her deceased parents, to accompany him from England to Kuala Lumpur in 1972, she is recollecting her encounter there with Christopher Chubb, a refugee from Australia where he had, in the 1940s, perpetrated a major literary hoax, designed to protest the trends in modern poetry.  Chubb had written and succeeded in getting published a series of \\"poems,\\" supposedly by a man named McCorkle.<br />The fraud, which took place in the 1940s, is told in flashbacks from the 1972 trip, mainly by Lady Sarah and Chubb.  Its wry humor and social commentary are fun to read, with Chubb mocking the state of literary awareness in Australia at that time and providing information about the obscenity trial which resulted from his hoax.  When Chubb cleverly shows her one page from another work by \\"McCorkle,\\" Sarah sees it as a masterpiece akin to \\"The Wasteland,\\" and tries to obtain the whole manuscript, the publication of which would save her magazine.  Sarah's life in 1983, and shocking revelations by John Slater about Sarah's parents, their marriage, and her mother's death in the late 1930's widen the focus and time frame.  The reader quickly recognizes, as all the characters play their parts and the story develops, that all are guilty of some sort of fakery.<br />The second half of the book, however, becomes a wild, often wacky adventure story as separate new plots develop, the time frame changes to World War II, and several new characters, unrelated to the main plot, tell their own stories.  Sarah and Slater play no real role in the action as Chubb tries to rescue his daughter from a suddenly real, seven-foot-tall McCorkle, who has kidnapped her and run from island to island in Indonesia and Malaysia, where the Japanese have invaded and have begun vividly described atrocities.<br />Separate, virtually unconnected plots in four time frames--1983, 1939, 1972, and World War II--revealed by four or five different narrators, in settings that include England, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Australia all contribute to a confusion of focus.  The characters, events, and plot line from the beginning of the book have little if any overlap with the characters, events, and plots in the middle.  Though the several sections are exciting and imaginative separately, they did not cohere for me, and I found myself thinking of the first half as a stand-alone novella, with the remaining episodes connected to it as a series of memorable, separately developed short stories.

Loosely paralleling Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, with its themes of love and betrayal, honor and adultery, this novel of manners is also a morality tale in which Auchincloss shines the spotlight on a prestigious New York law firm in 1953, along with its internal workings and the elite families which run it.  With a smoothly elegant style, he traces the history of  the law firm of Vollard, Kaye, and Duer, meticulously recreating the pedigrees and family connections of his characters--who is married to whom, which families have merged through which marriages, and whose fortunes are rising and whose are falling.  As the marriages of the principals of Vollard Kaye are negotiated, consummated, and/or dissolved, the reader is brought into living rooms and board rooms to watch as the characters wrestle with their overlapping family responsibilities and business obligations, and to observe them dealing with important issues:  What, exactly, is justice, and on what inalienable truths, if any, does it rest?  Does the concept of right change as times change?  Is idealism possible in a pragmatic, nuts-and-bolts world?<br /><br />Auchincloss's style is refined and formal, with sentences which never lose their way, even when the sentence structure itself is convoluted.  Old-fashioned in his approach to his characters, Auchincloss conveys the impression that he does not want to invade their privacy by showing them in their weakest moments.  His is a buttoned-up sort of characterization, one which is appropriate to a novel in which ideas are more important than the uniquenesses of character.  As a result, the characters are somewhat wooden--illustrative of traits, rather then real, breathing humans--and their actions are sometimes hard to fathom.  He has a tendency to announce, rather than show through the characters' actions, the ideas he wants to convey.<br /><br />Auchincloss is a confident and practiced story-teller, however, with a clear belief that fiction is capable of conveying ideas at the same time that it is entertaining.  His themes are clearly illustrated, and his characters, with their foibles and worries, share many of the same concerns as the rest of us, despite their elevated social status.  Though the ending is a bit melodramatic, the story is intelligent and fun to read-a fascinating reflection of life and mores of just fifty years ago.

An ancient legend says that Robert Harvard, father of John Harvard, for whom the college was named, lived in Stratford-on-Avon and was a friend of Shakespeare.  Supposedly, Shakespeare gave him a hand-written manuscript of a now-lost play as a wedding present, sometime around 1605.  Author Martin uses this legend as the fulcrum around which the book turns and speculates about what might have happened to the play over the course of almost four hundred years.<br />A dozen generations after Shakespeare gave the manuscript to Robert Harvard, a  member of the Wedge family engages Peter Fallon of Back Bay to try to confirm the existence of the manuscript and ascertain its whereabouts.  As Fallon begins his research into the story of the Isaac Wedge, thought to have received the manuscript from John Harvard, he introduces us to such luminaries as Cotton Mather, a religious zealot who began Harvard at age 11;  George Burroughs, who was executed in the Salem Witch Trials;  Caleb Wedge, who fought in the Revolutionary War;  Theodore Wedge, a friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau;  and eventually to Joseph Kennedy, Harry Widener, John Kenneth Galbraith, Robert Oppenheimer, and President Franklin Roosevelt.  We witness the horrors of King Philip's War and the religious excesses of the Salem Witch Trials, the Great Boston Fire, the Civil War, the sinking of the Titanic, two world wars, and the opening of the college to Jews, blacks, and women.<br />Martin's concern is to make history lively and understandable, his characters sympathetic and often noble.  He humanizes even the dour Puritans and the earliest settlers, observing the commonplaces of their lives.  A great deal of humor enlivens the novel, which even includes chases reminiscent of slapstick farce.  He emphasizes basic ideas, rather than the minutiae of history, entertaining his readers, rather than bogging down in complex details.  Ultimately, Martin explains how succeeding administrations at Harvard have ensured that the brightest students from all walks of life will have the same opportunities for intellectual growth, regardless of income level or sex.  This huge and entertaining novel is a tribute both to Harvard and to the men and women it has educated--popular history at its best.  Mary Whippleslapstick farce.

Few western readers will find anything really incendiary here.  No specific criticism is made of any individual nations or governments, and the political debate which features so prominently in the action is characteristic of young college students around the world.  Yet several Middle Eastern countries have banned it, and four fatwas calling for the death of the author have been issued.<br />Published in the Middle East in 1998, this novel recreates the awakening of a bright and idealistic Arab student to intellectual and political realities.  Hisham al-Abir is only fourteen when a young teacher first inspires him to think critically, and he soon begins to read voraciously in history, political theory, philosophy, and literature.  He devours works by nineteenth century Arab nationalists, Marxists, and existentialists, and studies the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Writings by Che Guevara, Engels, and Lenin compete for his attention with literature by Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Gorky, and even Dickens, Pearl Buck, and Flaubert, and he becomes an active debater in his school.  Contacts made by an older student and by the school monitor soon lead him to become a &quot;freedom fighter&quot; and member of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, a clandestine organization dedicated to resisting oppression, though he is told, ironically, &quot;Anything I say you must do immediately without discussion.  Act first, talk later.&quot;  It is not long before his exposure to competing ideas causes him to question his commitment to the movement.<br />Al-Hamad's novel humanizes young men like Hisham, showing his aspirations to many of the same goals as the rest of us.  His love for his family, his desire to honor his parents, his idealism, his natural curiosity about the opposite sex, and his commitment to his own heritage show him to be like teenagers around the world.  His unquenchable thirst for knowledge of the wider world brings him into direct conflict with the needs of those in power, however, and the author successfully conveys the emotions of this young man and the disillusionment he feels.  While the book is a bit didactic and the plot somewhat predictable by western standards, it may offer new realms of thought to the young people who obtain it via the underground in the Middle East.  Those of us reading this book in English will appreciate anew the freedom of the press, while perhaps gaining new insights into the conflict between ideas and reality in other parts of the world.

From the opening paragraph, a woman's description of being struck by lightning, the reader of this book learns to expect the unexpected-and gets it.  Dorcas Mather, the narrator, is a librarian in Frome, Rhode Island, who quietly catalogues books while a  hurricane bears down on the town.  Fortified with some scotch she has brought for the occasion, she is bent on cataloguing one particular book, her own personal &quot;hurricane&quot;--entitled In the Driver's Seat: The Abigail Mather Story by her twin sister, Abigail Mather, and a  ghostwriter, Hilda DeVilbiss.  With delightful mockery of the book publishing process, Dorcas reveals that this book is making her sister into a national heroine for not only surviving her &quot;marital horror&quot; but for doing something about it.<br />Exaggerated, over-the-top paragraphs from the novel written by Abigail and Hilda alternate with Dorcas's iconoclastic and sometimes cynical tales about the real Abigail, as the dual history of the Mather sisters unfolds.  Because the narrative moves back and forth between the events as told in Abigail's book and Dorcas's much later reflections on these events, the plot is not linear.  The reader learns in the first twenty-five pages that Abigail has committed a &quot;savage act of assertive self-realization,&quot; otherwise known as murder, but it is the circumstances which led to the murder and the divergent views and lifestyles of Abigail and Dorcas which provide the interest and intrigue for the reader.  As Dorcas tells us, &quot;Abigail and I divided up the world.  Sacred and profane.  Spiritual and physical.  Mind and body.&quot;  Abigail, sexually liberated since the age of 14, is, according to Dorcas, an &quot;amoral exhibitionist.&quot;  Dorcas, by contrast, &quot;knows what it feels like...to experience desire,&quot; but she has rejected it completely, finding love-making &quot;ridiculous.&quot;<br />The novel is a light, breezy, and often satiric send-up of New England values, the literary life, family interdependencies, our pre-occupation with &quot;self-image,&quot; and the cruelties we humans perpetrate upon each other.  Firmly rooting the novel in its Rhode Island setting, with its storms, hurricanes, and blizzards racing up the Atlantic coast, author Jincy Willett recreates the tumults and storms of her characters' daily lives, leavening the action with humor at the same time that her characters both create and meet their own disasters.  Uncomplicated in its plot and simple in themes, the novel chooses to amuse and entertain rather than provide new insights for the reader.  It is a lively look at two peculiar sisters, whose opposing views of life and conflicting values may not seem so peculiar in the end.

Miller Packard, a police sergeant with an eye for easy cash, is a man who enjoys high stakes golf games and does not hesitate to associate with questionable playing partners and opponents when he's &quot;on his game.&quot;  Packard is called to investigate a brutal double murder and rape aboard a boat in Newport Beach, a crime which echoes throughout the novel when he becomes involved with the young widow of the murdered man.  Alternating with the story of Packard, his investigations, and his love life is the story of Lionel Walk, known as Train, an 18-year-old black caddy at the exclusive Brookline Country Club.  Conscientious and anxious to do a good job, Train is at the mercy of the world, a young man with a good heart who never seems to catch a break, and Dexter is particularly effective in bringing him to life.<br />Although Dexter remains faithful to the third person narrative, he tailors his language and points of view to the specific plots he is developing.  The action at the golf courses involving Train's life is told from a caddy's-eye view and is described in a deceptively plain-spoken and ungrammatical style.  The story line involving Packard is related in more grammatical terms, though Packard is earthy and often uncritical in his observations.  The club members' rampant bigotry, casual cruelty, disrespect, and complete disregard for the feelings of the all-black caddy staff and grounds crew are reflected in scenes involving both Train and Packard, with vividly realized dialogue which stings and insults.<br />Golfers will enjoy the lively accounts of games in which money changes hands, along with colorful descriptions of dress, mannerisms, and players' temperaments.  A very fat player in pastel golf pants is described as having thighs that look like &quot;children hiding in the curtains&quot; when he walks.  Exaggeration, absurdity, irony, and black humor fill every page.  At times exciting, suspenseful, and darkly humorous, this novel is also brutal, violent, and pessimistic.  Though Train and Packard both profit when their lives come together, no reader will be surprised by the outcome.  As the author has made abundantly clear, the world is a &quot;hungry place...and whatever kind of thing you is, there's something out there that likes to eat it.&quot;  Despite the fine writing, lively dialogue, unique descriptions, and oddball characters, some readers may be put off by this bleak view of life and human nature.

Tom Dorahy, a former teacher now in his sixties, has been invited back to The Taws, a frontier area of New South Wales, Australia, &quot;where masculinity is top dog,&quot; to celebrate the growth of the town during the past twenty years.  His &quot;homecoming&quot; is not the warm, nostalgic experience one would expect.  Twenty years previously, Dorahy and his friend Charlie Lunt had observed brutal events, which convinced them of the inherent evil within the hearts of the town leaders.  The killings of an innocent aborigine population were only part of the problem.  The town's leaders refused to recognize any crime or to feel any guilt, and Dorahy was too weak and ineffective to bring about any change .  Now returned, he is determined that the town's leaders, still in power, will at last acknowledge what they have done, and he sets in motion the forces which result in a showdown.<br />With a sharp eye for the telling detail, a prose style which bends and adapts to reflect the thinking of her characters, a keen ear for dialogue, and an uncompromising integrity in carrying her themes forward, Astley creates a rough frontier world in which justice is relative-whatever works in carrying forward the goals of the community is &quot;right.&quot;  As the story moves back and forth in time through Dorahy's memories and Lunt's experiences, the reader observes sadistic town leaders encouraging violence and vengeance and a compliant population going along.  As Dorahy tries to come to terms with his own role in the events and avenge the wrongs the town has done to Charlie Lunt, he is also hoping that in the end his own life will &quot;add up.&quot;<br />Fast-paced, dramatic, and excruciatingly tense, this thirty-year-old novel examines the power of the majority, the nature of justice, and the roles of vengeance and forgiveness.  As the town celebrates its twenty years of &quot;progress&quot; during the homecoming with songs and stories, the reader is haunted by the supreme irony of the words of Auld Lang Syne as they ring out:  &quot;We'll take a cup of kindness yet for Auld Lang Syne.&quot;  Mary Whipplerony of the words of Auld Lang Syne as they ring out:  &quot;We'll take a cup of kindness yet for Auld Lang Syne.&quot;  Mary Whipple	2003-10-05

John North, like Schmidt, faces a crisis of conscience, questioning every aspect of his life while trying to avoid the messy consequences of his betrayal of his wife and his marriage.  In this elegantly written novel, Begley presents North as a New York writer whose novels have won prizes, but who has endangered all he values in life by succumbing to the sexually voracious appetites of Lea Morini, a French journalist who has interviewed him for the Paris Vogue magazine. Totally committed to preserving his marriage, North also believes that he can continue his relationship with Lea because adultery is wrong &quot;only if it is discovered.&quot;<br />In a bar called, L'Entre Deux Mondes, a &quot;place between two worlds,&quot; or no-man's-land, North tells the story of his dalliance with Lea to his alter-ego, a &quot;man so like me in appearance and demeanor.&quot;  Hypersensitive to nuances and observant of the smallest details, however dense he may be about his personal life, North gives insights into the creative process which ring with truth, however much he may rationalize and temporize about his emotional weaknesses.  His satirical comments about literary awards, the juries which determine the prizes, and the play-acting which accompanies the prize announcements provide a sense of realism.<br />Although North leads his companion (along with the reader) to think that he succeeds in solving the problem of Lea in the end, the reader cannot be sure that this is really the case, or that the concluding plot twist is truthful. North, the writer, believes that it is &quot;a colossal mistake&quot; to tell his story, as he has been doing, when he could be writing it.  &quot;That is how I could give it a proper conclusion,&quot; he tells us.  The writer succeeds by &quot;inventing: erasing what's inconvenient and bringing in whatever is useful and getting rid of what is improbable,&quot; he explains.  The irony, of course, is that in the end, the story of North, Lydia, and Lea IS written and the reader has just read it.  One can only wonder how much of the &quot;inconvenient&quot; has been &quot;erased&quot; here, either by Begley or by North, so that the dilemma of Lea can be resolved--if it is resolved.

In this sensitive portrayal of love and war, author Itani reveals the life of Grania O'Neill from her earliest days in Deseronto, Canada, through her marriage to Jim Lloyd, who serves in the Ambulance Corps during World War I.  Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap.  Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using.  When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex.  By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her \\"voice.\\"<br /><br />The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium.  Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share.  In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming:  pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers.  As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they \\"revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.\\"<br /><br />The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes.  The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends.  Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying.  As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader.

The fictional Reece interviews Ava Gardner, Lana Turner, Jean Peters, and other Hughes contacts, filling the novel with detail as he personalizes the reclusive Hughes.  All the interviews, notes from Hughes's &quot;diary,&quot; quotations by Richard Nixon, memos by an FBI field agent, transcripts of tape recordings, and comments by Hughes's former employees are imaginative and often hilarious creations of the author, not real at all.  Although some readers may question the propriety of basing the entire &quot;biography&quot; on invented quotations purportedly made by real people, the book is clearly label as fiction, and the basic information about Hughes's life is largely factual.<br />Modesty, self-effacement, and humility are not biographer Reece's strong suits, as we note from the opening pages. His first book, Melville and the Whale, was successful, and, he tells us, he secured a seven figure advance for the Hughes biography.  His assistants do the &quot;tedious aspects of research,&quot; he doesn't get along with people at the Hughes Archives, and he accepts money from Fox TV, though, ultimately, things don't &quot;work out.&quot;  He likens his experience with the prestigious MacArthur Foundation to &quot;dealing with a seventeenth-century French king handing out Christmas Lagniappes.&quot;  As Reece recreates the downward spiral of Hughes's life, from the Hollywood days, through his confrontations with Bugsy Siegel, and to his use of a double to confuse the U.S. Government, the reader notes a parallel deterioration in Reece's own life.<br />For anyone intrigued with the Howard Hughes story, this novel provides some unique, albeit fictional, glimpses into what might have been Hughes's thinking and into events which might have shaped his decisions. Humor, much of it slapstick, keeps the reader grounded in (fictional) reality, however much Hughes and Reece might be losing their touch, and as the novel comes to a wonderfully ironic close and author Steven Carter has the last laugh, even the most jaded reader will laugh along with him.

In one of the most ambitious novels in recent memory, Jonathan Lethem recreates the sights, sounds, textures, and tensions of one block of Dean Street in Brooklyn from the 1970's to the present.  Dylan Ebdus, the white child of artistic, hippie parents, and his best friend, Mingus Rude, the son of a cocaine-addicted black singer, face school and neighborhood dangers together.  Their world of spaldeens, skully, stickball, wallball, and  stoopball exists side by side with the bullying, shakedowns, and outright theft which Dylan must face every day on walks to his school, \\"a cage for growing, nothing else.\\" Together they collect comic books about superheroes, who, unlike them, have the power to conquer injustice and escape from all threats.<br /><br />Though they admire Spiderman, they do not like Superman, whom they consider a \\"flattened reality,\\" an ineffective presence living in his \\"Fortress of Solitude,\\" much like Dylan's artist father living in his studio.  When a homeless man in the neighborhood, jumps from a three-story building and injures himself in an attempt to fly like Superman, Dylan begins to think about Superman as a real, not comic book character, actually emulating him in real life. Descriptions of the neighborhood, the attempts at gentrification, the inadequate public school system, the drug scene, the racial conflicts, and eventually even the prison system all add depth and color to the novel, and Lethem expands this scope even further by presenting a detailed view of pop culture.  His unique images are a constant source of surprise and delight.<br /><br />The novel is a huge and imaginative recreation of growing up in the city in the '70's, but it is not seamless.  Dylan's early life is traumatic and is drawn very realistically, so the reader is startled when, at the relatively mature age of thirteen, Dylan becomes obsessed with Superman and wants to emulate him, and when the author segues into the magic realism of flight shortly thereafter, the reader is unprepared for the contrast with the earlier naturalism of the novel.  Dylan's lack of curiosity about what happens to Mingus after a horrifying incident at age fourteen leaves the reader wondering about the depth of his feelings, and occasionally the mini-essays, which give color and life to the neighborhood, act as a brake on the action.  Dylan as an adult is not very interesting, and Mingus becomes almost a footnote.  Still the novel adds a new dimension to Lethem's rapidly growing portfolio of outstanding novels and enhances his reputation as one of America's most exciting young novelists.

Ten years before the novel begins, a man named Wafer &quot;had the wax on his wings melted from flying too close,&quot; not to the sun, but to &quot;the local grandees.&quot;  Gabby Jerrold, the artist-narrator, who was present at the time that the &quot;wax melted,&quot; has now returned to Allbut, an Australian wilderness town, &quot;a mere speck on the world's glassy eye&quot; to recollect the past and her own responsibility, if any, in the events surrounding Wafer's last Christmas in Albut, a town with a &quot;barbaric Christmas tradition.&quot;  Here &quot;beer-gut belchings&quot; rule, and &quot;schooner glasses discover the Christmas crib and soothe the infant with whack yoicks.&quot;<br />Astley packs all the above information into the first two hundred words on the opening page, instantly establishing a tension-filled mood, which grows as the narrator remembers Wafer, her feelings for him, and the heat, isolation, and constant threat of violence in Allbut.  Wafer is a &quot;blow-in,&quot; seeking, ironically, a place of peace, a place where he can live away from the pressures of society, surrounded not by people but by the bigness of nature.  Somewhere in the hills on the way to Allbut, however, he has discovered a gigantic sapphire, which he has kept, not because it has any monetary value to him but because it is beautiful.  This stone becomes his curse.  With her compact, understated style and the ability to choose exactly the right word, Astley recreates the dismal everyday life of Allbut, and the pathetic characters who populate it--several violent psychotics, undernourished and abused black aborigines, a sadistic cop, a power-mad councillor, Gabby's own uncommunicative, cold family, and the people with whom Wafer shares his &quot;farm.&quot; All see the gem as their ticket out of Allbut.<br />With echoes of Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust, Thomas Tryon's Harvest Home, and Katharine Anne Porter's &quot;The Lottery,&quot; the novel edges its way to the inevitable, violent conclusion.  Though the story is presented simply, it reverberates with reminders of classical mythology and religion, as Wafer (whose own name has religious connotations) reflects the tension between dreams and reality, the spiritual and profane, and the role of the individual within the community of man.  The narrator faces crises of conscience as she considers her own responsibilities, her own dreams, and the sins of omission for which she seeks repentance.  Powerful in subject and style, the novel carries a one-two punch the reader will not soon forget.  Mary Whippleinevitable, violent conclusion.

Readers who embrace a literal interpretation of the Bible may be offended by the premise and plot of this novel, in which Jesus and four other pilgrims seek spiritual enlightenment in separate caves in the bleak wilderness.  Each, including Jesus, faces personal demons as s/he wrestles with solitude, starvation, and thirst.  For those who regard events in the New Testament as symbolic, rather than literal, the novel offers a surprising new way of experiencing and interpreting the trials in the wilderness, the death and burial of Jesus, and ultimately the influence of Jesus on succeeding generations.<br />Crace's descriptions of the natural world are breathtaking.  Using vivid verbs, musical cadences, unique metaphors, and acutely perceived observations about man, nature, and the spirit, he brings the wilderness into sharp focus, often personifying nature and its creatures without a trace of romanticism. &quot;The clouds came down to sniff the hills, to scratch their bellies on the thorns,&quot;  &quot;Clouds and lightning moved away, banging on their shields,&quot; and sounds of wind that &quot;could be mistaken for the vast percussion of the storm-pressed, canvas billows of a ship&quot; are among the hundreds of vibrant and unique images which bring nature to life and illustrate man's closeness to it.  With a similar focus on men as humans within nature and the wilderness, he attempts to recreate the quarantine experience and man's desire to connect with a higher power.  Jesus, like the other pilgrims, is human here, a man rooted in the real world of his day and subject to the same urges as other men.  He is different from them, however, in his determination not to yield to privation as he seeks union with God through his visions and hallucinations.<br />This is not a book that will appeal to everyone.  Though Crace's purpose is not to debunk, he does challenge our understanding of what happened between the forty days in the wilderness and the resurrection and its significance.  The language is stunning, the characters are fascinating, the imagery is unique, and the power of nature is overwhelming--but one's enjoyment of the book ultimately depends on one's willingness to consider alternative interpretations of some of the basic tenets of Christianity.

Her speaker, Alice Moore, is eight years old when she journeys from England to Ireland and spends a year living with her grandmother and great aunt at Ballydavid, an Anglo-Irish estate near Waterford.  Bright and unusually perceptive, she experiences, first-hand, their refined and mannered Edwardian life, while also observing and commenting on the events taking place as the Irish rebellion begins in distant Dublin.  Her family, like so many others, knows that changes are coming, but they behave as though &quot;the world as [they] knew it would continue if enough of [them] pretended nothing irreparable had taken place.&quot;<br />Describing the life of the Anglo-Irish with sympathy, understanding, and no apologies, the author is as polite, polished, and distanced from the action as Alice's family is.  When the rebellion begins, its impact is enhanced by the innocence of Alice, through whose eyes the ironies are observed. The plot may seem to lack excitement, at first, as Alice and her family, concerned with domestic conflicts and personal tragedies, pay little heed to the incipient revolution, but this quietude is misleading.  When the family hosts a large, tennis party at the end of the summer of 1916, only a few weeks after the leaders of the Easter Rising have faced the firing squad, all facets of society-gentry, servants, British soldiers stationed in Ireland, local residents, and revolutionaries-come together in one tumultuous afternoon which changes the lives of all participants.<br />Clever and subtle in its structure, this is a novel in which the most significant action-the end of this way of life-takes place offstage, after the novel has concluded.  The author, having recreated this genteel, lost lifestyle in all its details-even including the strictures which govern the eating of a tea sandwich and the difference between dresses of full mourning and &quot;half-mourning,&quot;-brings the family just to the moment of its own climactic awakening and no further.  Wisely, she lets the reader fill in the blanks, guided at the end by Alice, many years later, reminiscing about her early life and &quot;the course of history [that] swept away the very foundations of the way we lived.&quot;  Restrained and understated, this story of the Irish rebellion may be unique in its quiet acceptance of the rightness of change.

In this impeccably controlled novel, prize-winning Australian author Thea Astley combines her irrepressible good humor and wry view of people and the world, telling an offbeat story of feisty characters in search of their spiritual &quot;centers.&quot;  Main character Belle grows up on her grandfather's marginally successful sheep farm, Perjury Plains, &quot;outside a lost townlet called Drenchings.&quot;  Her assertive but impractical mother Bonnie works as a drummer in an all-girls' band, playing gigs at local church halls and sheep-farming conventions, her absent, trumpet-playing father having sought his own career in the United States.<br />Sent to boarding school at the age of seven, this lonely but remarkably self-sufficient child grows up longing to know what it is like to have a family, a solid, emotional center in her life-&quot;I want love,&quot; she says. As Astley follows her from her birth, at which her grandmother &quot;only just managed to intercept grandfather as he dialed the vet,&quot; through her childhood and eventual marriage, we see Belle choosing friends, forming relationships, and making decisions, always attempting to find someone, real or imagined, who will serve as &quot;a center in which [she] can merge.&quot;<br />Humorous but pithy observations fill this novel as feisty Belle, Bonnie, and their friends make do the best way they can, always hoping that happiness is just around the corner, if only they can free themselves from their present circumstances.  Astley astutely manipulates the tone and point of view to match various stages of Belle's life.  Belle's flippant and youthfully cynical point of view as a child changes gracefully to a more serious and conventional point of view when she becomes an adult, and to a controlled magic realism when she fantasizes about a character she is researching in her role as an archivist.  Unique descriptions abound:  Belle describes her mother's alternative lifestyle as &quot;like living in a Longfellow ballad,&quot; and, when she is tired of her husband's smiles, devoutly wishes that &quot;Seb's teeth would go black.&quot;  Filled with literary delights, high spirits, and much good sense, this is a novel to savor.

Two families, two sons, and the devastating complications that engulf their lives during one weekend in April, 1961, provide a unique perspective on international gamesmanship in Berlin during the Cold War.  These are tense times, border incidents are frequent, and the Berlin Wall is only days away from construction.  At age seventeen, Michael Montgomery and Rick Healy are less concerned with the complications of the Cold War than they are with their rebellions against their fathers.  Both are &quot;trying on&quot; new political ideas--in Rick's case, the idealistic goals of socialism and the philosophy of Marcuse.<br />In alternating sections, Paul Montgomery, the father, and Michael Montgomery, the son, each reveal their thoughts and hopes for the future, and as the story unfolds, Carroll creates two entirely separate worlds, each fully drawn and presented as truth.  The reader, moving back and forth between the generations, has the advantage both of hindsight regarding the Berlin crisis and insight into all the characters, and the story comes alive in the best narrative tradition.  When Michael, Rick, and their friend Katharine Carson decide to skip school and go to East Berlin for the May Day parade and weekend festivities, Rick takes his stepfather's duffle bag, which, unbeknownst to him, contains some important film. The ensuing turmoil, which traps them in the eastern sector, involves both families as they try to avoid a potential international cataclysm.<br />Through his focus on families affected by the Cold War, Carroll achieves more universality than one usually expects of the thriller genre.  The emotional context he creates for the international intrigue leads the reader to identify with both the adults and the young people and to observe the &quot;wall&quot; existing between them. The title, suggesting a &quot;secret father&quot; lurking in the background, tantalizes the reader with infinite possibilities and plot complications throughout the novel, but exactly how this person affects the conclusion may come as a surprise. Though the book is sometimes a bit melodramatic, it is a thoughtful thriller, full of betrayals, threats, murder, and international skullduggery,  and it brings the traditional Cold War espionage story to new life.

Anyone accustomed to some of Keneally light-hearted work, such as Jacko: the Great Intruder, or his narrative adventures, such as Victim of the Aurora, may be shocked by the depth and seriousness of this strange allegory of sin, responsibility, and the inability of generations to communicate about basic issues.  Damian Glover, age seven, and his sister Barbara, age thirteen, are young people living on a remote farm in Australia when Barbara reaches puberty, an event for which she has received no advance preparation and which convinces her she is dying.  Her harsh, fundamentalist parents are unprepared to deal with the emotional aspects of this event, and Barbara's coming of age ultimately transforms their lives, as she becomes a frightening force with whom they must reckon.<br />The growth of Barbara and Damian into independent people responsible for their own decisions takes place against a background of family secrets and trauma as they come to terms with sexuality and love and try to understand how and why their most basic instincts are considered sins by the moral authorities.  Their parents have always simply accepted the values imposed upon them by the One True Church, and they offer neither guidance nor example to their needy children as Damian and Barbara try to answer questions about Nature and figure out how it ever came to be associated with Rightness or Sin.<br />This is neither an easy nor a pretty story.  Its subject matter is sometimes bizarre and discomforting.  The characters' behavior makes them hard to like and difficult to identify with, and Keneally's point of view is off-putting.  Scenes are set and events are described in the usual third person, but all references to Damian, the character through whom we observe the action, are in the second person.  A statement, such as &quot;You are Barbara's brother Damian, sweating by the gate,&quot; may be descriptive, but it holds the reader at arm's length.  Originally published in 1971, this allegory deals with some of the conundrums with which Keneally must have dealt during his years in the seminary and establish many of the themes which have informed his novels for the past thirty years.

Memnon's mission is to prevent Alexander the Great of Macedon from taking the important Persian city of Halicarnassus as easily as he has taken other Persian cities in his southward march through Asia Minor.  With vivid sense imagery and a keen eye for detail, Doherty brings color and drama to the maneuvering by both sides as they get ready for the siege of Halicarnassus, a city of strategic importance, which overlooks the Aegean and the Greek islands.<br />Using primary sources for much of his research, Doherty recreates the story of this ferocious and bloody battle.  Ignoring the lofty, epic rhetoric of classic battles, he chooses instead a conversational tone, creating a sense of urgency and rapid movement in the narrative which matches the speed and drama of the action.  His research, however serious it might be, is fully integrated into an exciting story, not imposed upon it, and gives a sense of harsh reality to events. His characters on both sides are memorable despite their large number, and his stunning descriptions of costume, customs, weaponry, and the frenzy of battle keep the reader almost breathless with anticipation.<br />While the battle rages, both sides try to decipher a mysterious manuscript by Pythias, the architect of the walls around Halicarnassus, in which he supposedly reveals a secret weakness in the walls and the location of a treasure.  Scribes and cryptographers work non-stop, the breaking of the code providing an underlying motive for a series of murders which take place within the battle drama.  The murder mystery adds intrigue and excitement to the historical setting, but it is the siege itself, and the details of the war, which really bring the narrative to life.  Catapults turning men and horses into torches, and the euthanasia of wounded men and horses convey the brutality of warfare, while the formality of movements and the parades of warriors in battle dress show the choreography within this brutality.  In this testament of one of Alexander's most ferocious battles, the reader sees that though he can be brutal and quixotic, &quot;Alexander has a genius.

Taught from the day of her birth that &quot;fighting against one's Fate can weaken the blood,&quot; or even be fatal, she accepts the miserably lonely existence that fate has bestowed on her in a London council flat.  Nazneen's only contact with home is the letters she exchanges with her sister Hasina, whose own fate back home in Dhaka changes throughout the fifteen years that this novel takes place.  Through these letters, author Ali shows the similarities and contrasts in the lives of Nazneen and Hasina, both subservient to their husbands, and, like other Bengali wives, powerless to control their fates in the culture in which they live.<br />With warmth and sensitivity, author Ali draws us into Nazneen's world, showing it in all its earthy details.  The reader sees her increasingly cluttered apartment, hears the constant excuses and boasts from Chanu, gets lost with her on a walk in the city, and feels Nazneen's confusion and frustration with the isolation of her life, as she continues to act the dutiful wife, cutting Chanu's corns and trimming his nose hair while planning mini-rebellions.  Her sister, eventually alone in Dhaka, struggles to support herself, doing whatever she has to do to stay alive in a culture in which her life has no value.  But, as their mother once said, &quot;If God wanted us to ask questions, he would have made us men.&quot;<br />Speaking directly to the reader in unpretentious but vividly descriptive prose, Ali recreates the minutiae of Nazneen's life, showing how the seemingly unimportant decisions she begins to make acquire new meanings in her life.  Through striking details, the reader watches her gradual acceptance of a new culture (which some would call &quot;growth&quot;), while her husband Chanu remains anchored in the traditions of the past.

As connected to the earth as the orchardist who is one of the main characters, this powerful novel weaves the intimate details of everyday lives in rural Door County, Wisconsin, into a riveting domestic tragedy.  In simple, spare language author Larry Watson depicts the lives of two couples, very different from each other, each trying to fulfill dreams and cope with the silences and miscommunications which arise in their marriages, then brings the two couples together to make connections with each other.<br />Henry House is the orchardist, laboriously tending his apple trees and harvesting his crop, a hard-working man living close to the earth.  He and his wife Sonja have been devastated by the death of their four-year-old son from a blow to the head.  Consumed by grief, they are unable to reach out to each other in their need, each reliving the trauma separately.  Ned Weaver, their neighbor, is a talented and respected artist who is willing to subordinate all other aspects of his life to his art.  Despite his reputation for womanizing and his many betrayals, especially with his models, his wife Harriet loves him and has found some satisfaction in the role of caretaker of his creative flame.<br />Watson tells his story of these four people and their interactions obliquely, moving back and forth in time, building the drama and tension to a high pitch as the reader is presented with vivid scenes of danger and violence which sometimes have no context.  We do not know, at first, who the characters are, how they may be connected, why they are behaving as they do, or in what order these scenes take place, and it is not until late in the novel that some of these mysterious events are explained.  Contemplating how the scenes are connected, the reader becomes intimately involved in the narrative, an involvement which never lets up as the story becomes more complex.<br />Watson is an exceptionally &quot;clean,&quot; no-frills writer, creating many layers of meaning in homely details and images which advance the themes and intensify the emotion. In one of the most unusual scenes in modern fiction, for example, Ned, sun-burned and peeling from an afternoon of painting along the lake, asks his wife to peel his back, a scene laden with far more significance than the simple need to scratch an itch. Themes of love and betrayal, freedom and control, suffering and redemption, innocence and guilt-all universal themes from the beginning of human history-are seen through the prism of an artist's life and his desire to leave a lasting legacy.

Visually programmed by his father so that his mental image of the perfect golf swing became part of his psyche as an infant, he doesn't have to think about what he's doing right or wrong with his own swing.  Introduced to Buddhism by his mother when he was a small child, he knows how to meditate and relax.  Taught by coaches how to focus on where he wants his shots to go, rather than what's going on with his swing or his score, he knows how to get into &quot;the zone.&quot;  And he may, according to Andrisani, employ a post-hypnotic code (through very slow eye-blinks) to keep himself from being distracted.<br />The book does not, however, give the reader a way to &quot;learn the secrets of Tiger Woods's mental game and think your way to lower scores,&quot; as the jacket suggests.  While Tiger's methods work for him, it's probably too late for the rest of us to learn and apply these methods, and the pointers  about imagining where you want your shots to go and trying to relax are not new.  Andrisani's admiration for Tiger and his &quot;handlers&quot; is overwhelming, and it's hard to take seriously the statement of his first teacher (after his father) that he felt &quot;a little like a house painter being asked to redo the ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel&quot; when he was asked to help the eleven-year-old Tiger to improve.  While the development of Tiger's mental game may, indeed, resemble &quot;the forming of a diamond,&quot; and &quot;the making of fine wine,&quot; some of us would be happy with cubic zirconia and plonk.

Very much in the tradition of the old-fashioned mystery (which includes John D. MacDonald and his Travis McGee series), Diamond Head is the first of the John Caine mysteries, all set in parts of Hawaii that the tourists do not see, and featuring a repeating cast of characters.  Caine is a former Navy SEAL, now living on a sailboat outside Pearl Harbor and working as a private investigator, a haole (outsider) in the multicultural milieu of Hawaii.  Macho in the extreme, he is the consummate hero, willing to perform superhuman deeds to protect someone's honor, fulfill an obligation, and right the wrongs of the world.  (No one ever said he had to be realistic.)<br />When his old commanding officer tells him that the daughter of a respected admiral has been found murdered, Caine finds himself investigating the island's big business of pornography and the disappearances of the young women who are its stars.  Knief's dialogue is terse and unadorned as Caine begins his fast-paced investigation into the Hawaiian counterculture, using all his resources, some of them illegal, and his considerable martial arts expertise to get answers.  The bad guys are really bad, and Caine is larger than life, a huge hero of almost epic proportions.  Being handcuffed, thrown overboard by crooks, shot, and attacked by sharks ten miles from shore, barely slows Caine down in his pursuit of justice.  Knief is not trying to blaze new trails in detective fiction here, and that is part of the novel's nostalgic appeal.  His hero is from the old tradition in which men were men, crooks were evil personified, and justice could be found at the end of a fist.  Mary Whipple	2003-08-07

A wild concoction involving a completely disjointed narrative, multiple points of view, farce, satire, and parody, this &quot;novel&quot; offers any student of Irish literature unlimited subject matter--and equally unlimited laughs.  In this unique experiment with point of view, author Brian O'Nolan has used a pseudonym, Flann O'Brien, to tell the story of the novelist/student N, who tells his own story at the same time that he is writing a book about an invented novelist (Trellis), who is himself developing another story, while Tracy, still another author, tells a cowboy story and appears in the previous narratives.<br />Believing that characters should be born fully adult, one of the writers tries to keep them all together--in this case, at the Red Swan Hotel--so that he can keep track of them and keep them sober while he plans the narrative and writes and rewrites the beginning and ending of the novel.  But even when the primary writer stops writing to go out with his friends, the characters of the other (invented) fictional writers continue to live on in the narrative and comment on writing.  Before long, the reader is treated to essays on the nature of books vs. plays, polemics about the evils of drink, parodies of folk tales and ballads, a breathless wild west tale starring an Irish cowboy, the legends of Ireland, catalogues of sins, tales of magic and the supernatural, almanacs of folk wisdom and the cures for physical ills, and even the account of a trial--and that's just for starters.<br />Totally unique, O'Brien's creation defies the conventions, both of its day and of the present, and even the most jaded reader will be astonished at the unexpected twists the narrative takes.  Steeped in the traditions of the Irish story-teller, O'Brien keeps those traditions alive by creating multiple narrators to tell multiple stories simultaneously, while also skewering the very traditions of which he--and they--are a part.

Herself the daughter of Motiba's son Prabhakar (Pete) and Lois Christensen, the Danish-American cowgirl he married while a student in the United States in the 1960's, Kamdar is especially sensitive to nuances of culture, and she brings her Indian family to life within the context of the country's history--her grandparents' marriage, her grandfather's adoption of the values of Mahatma Gandhi, the emigration of the family to Burma to manage their businesses there in the 1930's, the bombing of Rangoon by the Japanese during World War II, the return to Bombay, and eventually, the emigration of several of Motiba's children to the United States.<br />As she describes her own life, the author shifts her focus to that of the American immigrant experience.  The tales of Indian history which infused her life as a child visiting in India eventually give way completely to tales of her life in the United States, as she moves with her parents and siblings throughout the west following her father's job changes.  The significance of the death of Gandhi on her grandmother's life yields its place to the effects of the death of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King on her parents' and her own life.  Her father's desire to have his family &quot;fit in&quot; becomes more important to him than teaching them the language and culture in which he grew up.<br />Rich, warm, humorous, and earnest, Motiba's Tattoos recreates the universal story of an immigrant family's metamorphosis from one whose primary allegiance is to another culture to one in which opportunities to assimilate are recognized and embraced.  In the process of becoming American, uniquely personal values may evolve and be treasured, while retention of the old traditions must become a conscious effort.  What was an integral part of their family life, historically, evolves into pleasant memories and echoes of the old way of life as new generations appear--the final result of the Indian diaspora, which began in the mid-20th century and which continues, unabated, to the present day.

Focusing on the last fifteen years of Frederic Chopin's life, this biography of the composer shows how his relationship with the &quot;liberated&quot; author George Sand, her household, and her children dominated Chopin's life in France from shortly after his arrival there in 1831 until his death from tuberculosis in 1849.  Carefully researched and footnoted, the biography describes this unlikely relationship, sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes strained, either from Chopin's increasing debilitation from his devastating illness or from Sand's promiscuity and desire for excitement.<br />Confining herself to those details which can be historically verified, author Eisler documents her vivid account of their life together primarily through references to the letters of the participants and eyewitness accounts.  Unlike writers of fictionalized biography, she presents the facts and avoids drawing conclusions, even when they seem obvious to the lay reader.  The one arena in which she allows herself some imaginative  leeway is in analyzing some of the creative works of Chopin and Sand, relating them to events in their lives.  For Chopin she suggests that the mood or form of a work might be related to particular events or circumstances, while for Sand she suggests that it might be the subject matter itself.<br />Straightforward and scholarly, the biography presents facts, rather then bringing events to life, and while some insight can be gained into the participants from their letters, there are some gaps in the historical record which sometimes leave the reader wishing for more transitions, especially as the Chopin/Sand relationship deteriorates and eventually ends.  While music history scholars may be familiar with much of this material, Eisler's story is, for the novice, a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of these romantic artists, their friends, and patrons in Paris near the mid-point of the 19th century.

In this warm and complex study of friendship, love, and roots, Kamila Shamsie focuses on the interrelationships of a group of vividly realized, upper-class residents of Karachi, particularly Raheen and Karim and their friends, only thirteen years old as the novel opens.  Raheen has always regarded Karim, her one-time crib-companion and blood-brother, as her best friend, someone who knows her so well he can complete her sentences. Their parents, too, are close friends, and as the story evolves, we learn that Raheen's father was once engaged to marry Karim's mother, and that Raheen's mother once pledged to marry Karim's father.<br />The story behind the exchange of fianc&eacute;es, though revealed as an intimate personal story, has wider implications, since it is tied, obliquely, to the ethnic unrest of 1971, when civil war broke out between East and West Pakistan, and Bangladesh came into being.  Unaware of the conflicts which occurred before they were born, the children are also unaware of the reasons for the fianc&eacute;e-switch.  It is only after they have grown up, attended college, and gained new perspectives that this mysterious situation begins to haunt them, influencing both their relationships with their parents and their unique and special relationship with each other.<br />Acutely sensitive to language and story, Raheen, now 23, is writing about her damaged relationship with Karim in an attempt to understand it.  Straightforward and perceptive in her thinking and speech, she conjures up imagined conversations from the past with a deft, often humorous touch.  Precocious, articulate, and somewhat rebellious as a child, she is, as an adult, somewhat detached and even blase about emotional issues, including the continuing violence in Karachi.  Karim, on the other hand, demands accountability.  He is a map-maker, accustomed to evaluating and correcting what he sees.  Ultimately, the two must map the past in new ways, filling in the uncharted territories of their lives, and creating new boundaries and borders.<br />The emotional resonance of this novel is enhanced by strong subordinate characters.  The parents of Raheen and Karim are insightfully drawn, and their story, as it unwinds, shows the fragility of relationships and the insidious prejudices that can creep into people's lives.  As the exchange of fianc&eacute;es is revealed through the eyes of the participants, the reader observes parallel events in the lives of Raheen, Karim, and their friends.  Major themes are illuminated in the small details of everyday life, rather than in great historical moments.  Through unique observations and insights into human character, this rich, thought-provoking novel creates maps of the human heart, ultimately achieving a universality and depth one does not often find in novels of personal relationships.

It's late in the season, and it looks as if this will finally be the Big Year, the year in which the Red Sox will overcome the Curse of the Bambino and bring home a World Series championship--if they can only keep the world from discovering that one of their players has a few unusual problems with his control--he is a serial murderer!  Desperate to win, the front office is willing to rationalize and cover up even multiple murders (&quot;Those murders, they're over and done with.  Nothing we can do to change that&quot;) to end the agony of watching the team go down to defeat yet again.<br />Ferrell writes a fast-paced baseball thriller filled with absurdities and told from a wryly casual point of view.  In the opening pages, Ferrell offers a few red herrings about who the murderer might be from the large collection of dysfunctional players on the team, but the suspense disappears almost immediately as the killer is identified in the first third of the book. This is not a novel in which characters are individualized or undergo any major epiphanies.  We know only a few characteristics about each one, and we don't identify with manager &quot;Fish&quot; Sharkey as much as we empathize with the frustration he's experienced--the same frustration fans have experienced with all the Red Sox &quot;almost&quot; teams over the years.  The action and the murders both proceed in relatively straightforward and uncomplicated fashion, and as the bloody season progresses, management never seriously questions whether there are any values more important than winning.<br />The author is clearly a Red Sox fan of long duration who recognizes the symptoms of Boston's communal frustration and understands the lengths to which some rabid fans and supporters might be willing to go for the first World Series victory since 1918.  He pokes good-humored fun at management, the press, agents, players, and desperate fans, and his clear inclusion of himself among the fans makes the book less a hard-edged satire than an amusing meditation on &quot;what if.&quot;  Screwball will probably not win any prizes for its mystery or its complexity, but in its depiction of the excitement of baseball and the lure of October's biggest baseball prize, it is a delightful way to spend a warm summer afternoon--if one can't get out to the ballpark. 3 stars for mystery and style, 4 stars for fun.

A coarse, business- and trade-centered culture of commercialism was replacing what they saw as America's old values as the country rebuilt, and they sought solace and inspiration in a completely different, aesthetic world.  In this story of the remarkable interactions of Japanese and American intellectuals from 1868 - 1913, Benfey shows how the two cultures viewed each other, learned from each other, and influenced each other's future, focusing on the literary, artistic, and aesthetic legacy, rather than on the hard political realities.<br />Like a wave spreading outward in concentric circles, the intellectuals of New England radiated their enthusiasm for Japan and its traditions.  The American travelers knew each other, learned from each other, and influenced each other.  Edward Sylvester Morse of Salem, Massachusetts, was one of the first to make a life commitment to Japan, attracting in his wake Isabella Stewart Gardner, William Sturgis Bigelow, Percival Lowell, and artist Ernest Fenollosa.  Isabella Stewart Gardner, in turn, introduced T.S. Eliot, Edith Wharton, and Henry and William James to Japanese art and thought, while historian Henry Adams and painter John La Farge attracted William Morris Hunt, architects H. H. Richardson and Frank Lloyd Wright, and others. Kakuzo Okakura, journeying to the U.S., had similar influence.<br />Benfey brings American and Japanese cultural history to life, creating real people with real emotions, problems, and commitments.  His insight into the creative process adds verisimilitude to his portraits, and his ability to describe and evoke moods, whether they be in his recreation of samurai life or his depiction of a tired climber's first glimpse of Mt. Fuji, give a liveliness to the prose usually more characteristic of fiction than non-fiction.  His nature imagery is so vibrant that the reader experiences journeys to the countryside alongside the participants.<br />In an Epilogue, which focuses on the year 1913, Benfey ties up the loose ends and finishes the stories of the characters on whom he has focused. His limited time frame has allowed him to explore America's influence on Japan in great detail, along with the &quot;Japanese phenomenon&quot; in this country, bringing to life the individuals who were responsible for it and illustrating the long-term effects.  The book is a thoughtful and lively account of one of the most important cultural exchanges in history, and Benfey makes it both understandable and exciting.

With these words the random killing begins in the hijacking of an Air France flight to New York in September, 1987, a five-day ordeal which results in hostage taking, the release of poison gas, and, ultimately, explosions and death for more than 400 people. This fictional but very realistic depiction of the hijacking and the questions it raises about responsibility combine with Turner Hospital's atmospheric and richly detailed imagery to produce a novel that is powerful in its impact and almost surreal in its intensity.<br /><br />In a style somewhat reminiscent of John LeCarre, Turner Hospital tells sinister, overlapping stories about the victims on the flight, the children who were released by the hijackers and survived to adulthood, and the family members who were left behind to mourn and search for answers.  The narrative shifts back and forth through different speakers and points of view, from 1987 to the present and back, building a multi-layered and suspenseful story that is haunting in its emotional effect.<br /><br />Though the plot is exciting, the focus here is as much on the characters' psychology as on dramatic action.  The now-adult children of the hijacking victims tell their stories in the present as they recall events from the past and the questions which torment them still, while the actual participants in the 1987 hijacking tell their stories up to the moment of their deaths.  As the survivors investigate the hijacking, they learn that it is not only possible but likely that members of US security agencies helped engineer and implement the catastrophe which claimed their parents.  They believe a man called Sirocco commanded the hijacking, but they are also seeking Salamander, his American \\"controller.\\"<br /><br />Turner Hospital's eye for detail is unerring, and she uses metaphors with skillful effect to reveal a character's state of mind or create atmosphere.  One child/survivor when dreaming, experiences \\"a terrible intrusive slash of sound, white at the center with red capillaries rivering out.\\" Another character \\"moves in a weather of anxiety.\\"  The author broadens her historical perspective by showing that this kind of violence also existed in Sodom, Gomorrah, and more recently, Nagasaki  From literature she cites Boccaccio, Defoe, Camus, and others, pointing out that these writers were condemned  \\"to tell the stories of those who haunted them as an act of propitiation.\\"  Smoothly integrated and thought-provoking, these references add to the novel's impact and widen its scope.  Though the author relies somewhat heavily on coincidence to resolve the story and create an ending that echoes with \\"happily ever after,\\" the novel is thoughtful, vividly written, and hypnotic in its spell.  4.5 stars.

Writing in the style of hard-boiled mystery writers such as Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett, Bradbury sets his story in Venice, California, in 1949, presenting as his main character a 27-year-old struggling writer, much like himself.  Returning to Venice late one night on the last trolley from Los Angeles, he finds himself alone in the car, except for a mysterious, alcohol-fumed vagrant, who whispers in his ear, &quot;Death is a lonely business.&quot;  Convinced that he has met &quot;Death's friend,&quot; the speaker gets &quot;chicken skin,&quot; which gets worse when, upon arriving in Venice, he glances into an old canal and discovers, inside an abandoned lion cage, a body bobbing up and down on the tides.<br />The city of Venice in 1949 is a place for the down-and-out, its pier and amusement park crumbling, its rollercoaster lying on its side &quot;like the bones of a vast dinosaur,&quot; old animal cages abandoned in the canals and filled with fish, and the oil pumps looking like &quot;great pterodactyls&quot; as they creak and groan.  Inhabited by &quot;the lonelies,&quot; old people with no futures, Venice is a dark and dismal place in those final days before the pier is demolished.  Bradbury's hypnotic descriptions of this decrepitude provide dramatic contrasts with the young speaker who still has hopes, dreams, and a future.<br />With veteran detective Elmo Crumley as his mentor, the speaker tries to save lives and outwit a mysterious stalker, as more and more sad, old people meet their deaths. Hollywood performers, an opera singer, a lady who once raised canaries, a tarot card reader, an inept barber who knew Scott Joplin, and the owner of an old cinema all contribute to the color, atmosphere, and action in this unusual story of people and places which have outlived their usefulness.<br />Bradbury's writing, as always, is witty, descriptive, imaginative, and atmospheric.  These separate elements do not seem to jell into a coherent whole, however.  The speaker and Crumley are supposed to be &quot;hard-boiled,&quot; but their genuine tenderness and naivete work at cross-purposes with the sometimes gruesome deaths they investigate.  Unlike the classic detectives, they seem to care more about the sad, old residents  than they do about catching the killer.  Elements of the supernatural impinge upon the realism, and the reader is not always sure whether strange events should be taken literally or figuratively.  When the killer is finally identified, it's almost an anti-climax, since he is less developed and far less interesting than his victims.  Ultimately, it's the inherent &quot;niceness&quot; of Bradbury's characters and his clear belief in life's hopefulness which work to undermine the drama and fear engendered by the bizarre murders.

I press Rewind and Fast Forward.&quot;	Writing this first novel from the point of view of an autistic 15-year-old, Mark Haddon takes the reader into the chaos of autism and creates a character of such empathy that many readers will begin to feel for the first time what it is like to live a life in which there are no filters to eliminate or order the millions of pieces of information that come to us through our senses every instant of the day.  For the autistic person, most stimuli register with equal impact, and Christopher's teacher Siobhan, at the special school he attends, has been trying to teach him to deal with the confusing outside world more effectively.  At fifteen he is on the verge of gaining some tenuous control over the mass of stimuli which often sidetrack him.<br />When the dog across the street is stabbed and dies, Christopher decides to solve the mystery and write a book about it.  His favorite novel, The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, becomes his model as he investigates the crime, uncovering many secrets involving his own family in the process.  Innocent and honest, he sees things logically and interprets the spoken word literally, unable to recognize the clues which would tell him if someone is being dishonest, devious, or even facetious.  As he tells his story in a simple subject-verb-object sentence pattern, Christopher tries to communicate and give order to his world, and the reader can easily see how desperate he is to find some pattern which will enable him to make sense of it.<br />Christopher's investigations eventually require him to make some remarkably brave decisions, and when he faces his fears and moves beyond his immediate neighborhood, the magnitude of this challenge is both dramatic and poignant.  Strange places have always been traumatic for him, and he has difficulties with his emotions.  \\"Feelings,\\" he says, \\"are just having a picture on the screen in your head.\\"  He responds either with logic or with the anger which sometimes overwhelms him as result of fear or frustration, and the reader cannot help aching for him and empathizing with his family.<br />Christopher's coming-of-age story is most unusual, if not unique, and he ends the book a much more mature 15-year-old than he was when he started.  With warmth and humor, Haddon creates a fascinating main character, allowing the reader to share in his world and experience his ups and downs, his trials and successes.

Tuvia, Asael, and Zus Bielski, three brothers, had managed to establish a well-organized community in the forest which lasted for almost three years, protecting hundreds of Jewish citizens while wreaking havoc on their German occupiers.  Author Peter Duffy places this extraordinary story of survival in context by describing the Bielskis? lives and achievements, quoting from Tuvia Bielski?s previously unknown journal, and revealing the sociopolitical history, including the anti-Semitism, of Belarus, a region south of Lithuania.<br />In establishing their forest community, open to all Jews, the Bielskis had to fight &quot;wars&quot; on four fronts:  the immediate threat from the Germans and the local police; the danger from local peasants and collaborators; the suspicions of Soviet partisans who questioned whether the Bielskis were sufficiently dedicated to their cause;  and most of all, internal dissension.  This was no &quot;utopian community of enlightened democratic and egalitarian governance,&quot; and many readers may cringe at the extremes to which the leadership occasionally resorted in order to eliminate dissension.<br />At its height, the forest village consisted of long, camouflaged dugouts for sleeping, a large kitchen, mill, bakery, bathhouse, tannery, school, jail, theater, and two medical facilities.  Tailors, seamstresses, shoemakers, watchmakers, carpenters, mechanics, and experts in demolition provided the 1200-member community with necessary skills, and about sixty cows and thirty horses provided food and transportation.  Many of the men served as part of the armed contingent which secured food and engaged in sabotage and the murder of Germans officials.<br />By concentrating on one family and its life during the war, Duffy creates a powerful documentary about Jewish life.  Breaking the narrative into six-month installments, he  details the progress of the war throughout the region, relentlessly revealing cold statistics--the thousands of people killed in a single ghetto in a single day. As the numbers mount, the reader?s horror at the immense scale of the genocide grows, the victims? utter helplessness becomes obvious, and the reader?s amazement at the Bielskis? achievement increases.  None of the Bielski brothers ever received public recognition for these heroic efforts, and Duffy?s attempts to rectify this historical omission by telling their story will resonate with readers.

Originally published in 1977 as McGarr and the Politician's Wife, and reissued in February, 2000, after the Peter McGarr series became popular, this first novel may be particularly interesting to those who are already familiar with Peter McGarr, Chief Superintendent of Detectives of the Garda Soichana, and his staff.  Although Gill writes a competent mystery and introduces all the characters who become so familiar to fans of his later McGarr mysteries, he is clearly feeling his way here as he decides how to develop them and his plots.  The character quirks and foibles we take for granted in the later novels are just hinted at here, the character of McGarr is outlined but not fully developed, and the role of Noreen, McGarr's wife, and her involvement in his career are much stronger here.<br />The mystery is straightforward.  When a battered, unconscious, and nearly drowned boat captain is pulled from shallow water at the Killiney Bay Yacht Club, McGarr and his staff--Hugh Ward, Liam O'Shaughnessy, Bernie McKeon, and others who become regulars in the series--find themselves involved in a mystery involving a politician, his promiscuous wife, the influence of the IRA on local politics, gun-smuggling from the U.S., and plots to discredit  McGarr.  The mystery is not very complex, and some readers may find that their primary interest is in seeing how Gill develops and presents his plot here, as opposed to his later, more fully developed novels.<br />Unlike the much smoother and subtler style in the later novels, Gill's foreshadowing here is still a bit clumsy.  (&quot;Very shortly, McGarr would need every friend inside the Castle he could muster.&quot;) He sometimes states the obvious: &quot;The stakes [McGarr] was gambling with were his reputation, career and spotless criminal record.&quot;  He tells the reader what is important, rather than letting the reader discover for himself: &quot;Little could Hubbard have known how important the play was to McGarr.&quot;  The wry and sometimes dark humor which we take for granted in the later novels are not much in evidence here, while the wild flights of Irish good spirits and camaraderie, and the fine description which gives color and depth to the Irish settings, while present in a few scenes, are not yet fully incorporated.  The novel may fascinate long-time fans of the series who want see how the series started, while newcomers may prefer to start with one of the later novels.

Winning an incredible twenty-one of his twenty-two races, he was only a few inches away from having a perfect record, losing that one race &quot;by a nose.&quot; Horse of the Year in 1954, Native Dancer was an unprecedented choice to grace the cover of Time magazine in May, 1954, just before he retired from racing as a four-year-old.<br />Author John Eisenberg reports here on the horse, the stable, and all the individuals who were part of his illustrious career, explaining the circumstances which made Native Dancer the darling of the country. Seen by more race fans than any other racehorse in history, thanks to America's recent discovery of the joys of television, he stood out visually from the pack and became &quot;America's first matinee idol.&quot; When he began racing in 1952, World War II had been over for only a few years, and the fifties were a decade in which &quot;institutions were to be admired, not challenged.&quot; Americans &quot;saw their country as wealthy and invincible,&quot; and Native Dancer became a symbol of this power. He was, in fact, so big and so powerful that when he ran, &quot;you could draw a horizontal straight line from his airborne back feet to the tips of his forelegs,&quot; his stride measuring an incredible twenty-nine feet.<br />Having thoroughly researched every conceivable aspect of his story, Eisenberg writes with the journalistic brio of a true lover of horse-racing, and makes the horse, his stupendous bursts of speed out of the pack in the final seconds of his races, and the people surrounding him live again. Through newspaper accounts, photographs, step-by-step reconstructions of the races, interviews with the participants and their heirs, and personal stories by people who remember the horse and his quirks, he turns back the clock to a simpler era and recreates the spirit of the fifties when all the world looked bright. Though Native Dancer was never as lovable as Seabiscuit (and, in fact, once bit off the finger of someone he did not trust), he was a huge and positive presence, an immensely powerful racer who had a tremendous desire to win and the intelligence to know how hard he had to work to accomplish that win.

Naeem Murr, a story-teller extraordinaire, speaks to the reader so directly it's as if he's sitting at your elbow, whispering into your ear.  The feeling that the author is carefully constructing his tale, which is so often a part of literary  novels, is absent here--the construction being more subtle and hidden in the background, as if the author and reader together are &quot;discovering&quot; the story--the mysterious events from childhood about which Daniel Mulvaugh still feels guilt as an adult and which ultimately threaten his sanity.<br />Growing up in a &quot;council estate&quot; as a child, Daniel and his best friend escaped into vivid, imaginary worlds in an effort to cope with their bleak and frightening lives.  Neurotic and timid, Daniel suffered from panic attacks and acrophobia, sometimes fainting with fear, constantly worrying about his mother and the friend on whom he depended.  As Daniel's story moves back forth between childhood and his life as a thirty-eight-year-old social worker, we see that he still suffers from acrophobia and panic attacks and that he is unable to &quot;feel&quot; and respond appropriately to the needs of his adored wife Sally, who suffered a breakdown three years before.  Now recovered, she has chosen to remain in the caretaker's cottage on the grounds of the hospital, rather than return to Daniel.<br />Then, into his life comes Amos Radcliffe, an elderly client living in the apartment that Daniel and his mother once shared.  Amos tells him stories of his life as a sailor, the people he's met, the sins he's committed, and the guilt he's felt, and the parallels between his own life and that of Daniel are unmistakable.  As the nature of his crime is revealed to Daniel, the reader observes their parallel searches for love and communication and their mutual need to confront the past and themselves.  While some readers may question whether Amos is &quot;real&quot; or a figment of Daniel's imagination, Daniel himself believes he is real and acts on that assumption.  The parallels between their lives are unmistakable, the coincidences are extraordinary, and the similarities in their relationships with others are clear.<br />Murr stirs the reader's immense sympathy for his characters, showing their humanity as they deal with the past.  His observations are acute, and his descriptions, sometimes appearing almost as &quot;throw-aways,&quot; are unique.  A group of men has &quot;simple lizard brains; they had to blink to swallow their food,&quot; and a woman is &quot;an impeccably maintained cul-de-sac of feeling.&quot;  The dialogue, through which Murr reveals much of the story, is lively and natural, sometimes filled with black humor.  The ironies of plot and character are striking, and Murr's comments about the nature of imagination and the nuances of language are insightful.  This is a beautifully wrought, carefully constructed, and totally absorbing novel about selfhood, our need to deal with our pasts and our guilt, and the role of imagination in making life bearable.

Like the movement of a crab, this insightful and cautionary novel by Nobel Prize winner Gunter Grass \\"scuttl[es] backward to move forward,\\"  telling the story of the World War II sinking of the \\"Wilhelm Gustloff\\" on January 30, 1945,  and its long-term effects on three generations of one German family.  Ten thousand passengers, including thousands of women and elderly men, and four thousand infants and children, were aboard.  Nearly all of them perished.<br />Moving, crab-like, back and forth, following the seemingly random order of speaker Paul Pokriefke's recollections, Grass brings his story and characters to life, expanding our view of the war and its aftermath, and showing how Germany's sociopolitical thinking has changed (or not changed) from the war to the present.  Actively involving the reader in deciphering Paul's memories and imposing some order on them, Grass reveals the lives of the historical characters involved in the disaster, provides intense and moving descriptions of the disaster itself, and establishes the on-going saga of Paul and his family, all directly affected by the disaster.<br />As in previous books, Grass is concerned here with the effects of the past on the present. Gustloff, Frankfurter, and Marinesko, characters involved in the history leading up to the sinking of the ship, have committed their lives, rightly or wrongly, to different political and military interests during the war.  The speaker's family, too, has a variety of political commitments, though these have evolved largely after the war.  The grandmother, Tulla, has always been a Socialist;  Paul, the speaker, has been a moderate;  and Konrad, Paul's son, has become a neo-Nazi.  Paul is concerned that the collective memory of the country has dimmed over time and that the present generation, including his son, has gained little knowledge from the past while his mother seems to be stuck in it.  When he discovers his son's hate-filled web site, he exclaims, \\"Good [gracious]!  How much of this has been dammed up all this time...growing day by day, building pressure for action.\\"  When Konrad \\"kicks up a storm,\\" commits a hate crime, and goes on trial, Grass brings his themes full circle.<br /> The past and our willingness to learn from it, our changing definitions of  \\"martyr\\" and \\"hero,\\" the nature of punishment and atonement, and the impermanence of monuments and memorials are all major themes here, related both to the sinking of the Gustloff and to the events in the lives of the Pokriefke family. As is always the case with Grass, the themes are fully developed, the novel is fascinating for its insights, and it is often dramatic and moving.  Grass's assessment of the current generation, as seen through Konrad, is both startling and alarming in its implications.

In a careful, thorough, and balanced manner, she describes the circumstances which resulted in the division of Ireland into the twenty-six counties of the Irish Republic, heavily Catholic in religion, and the six counties of Northern Ireland which have remained part of the United Kingdom, the population being 45% Catholic and 55% Protestant. With the Irish Republic having as its goal the reunification of the island, paramilitary groups on both sides have long resorted to violence and retaliation.<br /><br />The author draws many parallels between the deep-seated religious conflicts in Ireland and Northern Ireland and conflicts regarding race in the United States. By examining legal cases and decisions in the United States regarding matters of civil rights, she explains the similarities and differences in legislative and judicial procedure between the U.S., Ireland, and Northern Ireland. She analyzes the terms of the Good Friday Accords of 1998, the events which led up to them, the various factions which had input in crafting them, and the personalities and relationships of the people from both sides which agreed to them, showing clearly the tenuous nature of the agreements and the immense patience which will be necessary on all sides if peace is to have a chance.<br /><br />As the author points out, the Irish conflict involves many more issues than religion. With sensitive attention, she examines additional emotional issues including the release of prisoners, the reorganization of the police, inequities in housing, discrimination in jobs, the decommissioning of paramilitary groups, the inequality of schools, and even issues such as the routes of parades during the summer marching season, the use of British vs. Irish symbols on uniforms, and the choice of name for the police force. Her interviews with over twenty of the participants in the Accords are enlightening and give a human dimension to this enormous effort at peace, and she spends considerable time analyzing the newly established Human Rights Commission, the Committee on Administration of Justice, and the Equality Commission, all vehicles which are in place to redress past grievances if present behavior can be channeled in positive directions.<br /><br />Author Rasnic has performed an immense service, especially to legal scholars, in explaining in clear, unambiguous terms the nature and history of the Irish conflict and the terms of the Good Friday Agreements which attempt to resolve it. By making connections to American civil rights law, she puts it into a context which may allow Americans to understand the complexities more clearly. Her personal anecdotes add insight and liveliness to discussions which challenge the reader with their complexity. Anyone interested in exploring in detail the Irish/Northern Irish conflicts and their possible resolution will find this book to be a thorough and balanced guide.

Recreating the day-to-day existence of Amir and his father (Baba), a successful merchant in Kabul in the 1970's, Hosseini creates a warm and emotionally involving story of childhood, its traumas, and the importance of family. Telling of two families--Amir and his father, and Hassan and Ali, their servants--he depicts two different worlds.  Amir and Baba are Pashtuns, while Hassan and Ali are Hazaras, descendants of the Moguls who are also Shi'a Muslims, and it is in these parallel tracks that we come to see the variety of life in Afghanistan, its mores, traditions, and its hierarchies.<br /><br />Best friends, the boys grow up together, though Hassan, the servant, bears the burden of being different in appearance, both because of his Mogul heritage and because of his unrepaired hare-lip.  When the boys are twelve, an incident leads to a serious rift, and, six years later, the emigration of Amir and his father after a Communist coup leads to a permanent separation.  When Amir gets a phone call from his father's former business partner, twenty years later, he returns to Afghanistan to put to rights his relationship with Hassan and his family.<br /><br />Hosseini's narrative is fast-paced, and his sensitive portrayal of childhood with all its fears and tensions is striking.  The glimpses of Afghan family life and values are captivating, particularly because they have been virtually unknown in American fiction.  But it is the author's focus on the humanity of the characters that gives the novel its universality and appeal.<br /><br />The contrasts of the two families, one in the U.S. and one in Afghanistan, are emphasized dramatically when the Taliban seizes power.  This dual focus creates a few structural problems at the end of the novel, however, as the author reconnects the families.  Relying heavily on coincidences, some of them unnecessary to the plot, he ties up loose ends and resolves conflicts.  Occasionally, details seem artificial, inserted only to provide irony or obvious parallels with earlier events.  Despite some narrative clumsiness, however, the novel is a moving and dramatic read, fascinating for its setting, its father-son relationship, and it study of guilt and its effects.

Christopher Moore's brand of humor, while always irreverent and sometimes off-color, also bursts through the constraints which might limit it to the real world.  Moore has often explored other realities, and in this novel, we discover the underwater world of singing whales and the researchers who study them. Far more \\"straight\\" and less frivolous than in most of his earlier novels, Moore is clearly fascinated by cetacean biology and the research on which he focuses here.<br /><br />Nate Quinn is a PhD. researcher who studies the subsonic songs of humpback whales and works the channel between Maui and Lanai, identifying and following individual whales, recording whale songs, and converting the songs into digitized computer programs in an effort to decode them.  Three other researchers and numerous other wacky characters, allow the author plenty of room for hijinx at the same time that he is exploring serious issues.  An old woman gets a phone call from a whale wanting a hot pastrami on rye with mustard, a researcher remains underwater for sixty minutes without breathing, an absolute ruler wants the navy to \\"nuke the goo,\\" and mutants who look like aliens, known as whaley-boys, walk the land.<br /><br />As Moore shifts from science to science fiction, the line between reality and fantasy disappears.  The reader willingly suspends all disbelief and succumbs to the spell of Moore's non-stop flights of imagination as he explores underwater life. His famous sense of the absurd, his irony, and his humor, some of it black, never flag, and his imagination, given free rein, soars in this wild fantasy.<br /><br />However playful it may be, this novel also marks a significant new direction for Moore.  He is clearly fascinated by whales and the threats to their existence, and while the book is great fun  and often very funny, it also has something serious and important at its heart--it is not frivolous entertainment.  In an unprecedented move, Moore adds three separate Author's Notes at the end of the book, updating the reader on current whale research and acknowledging some of the world's great whale researchers.  Readers will come away from this novel with broad smiles, a new appreciation for Moore's talents and his willingness to take risks, and, most significantly, new understandings of whales and the ecosystem in which they flourish.

From his home in New York, an elderly man, whose name we never know, looks back on his life in the Soviet Union and remembers the physical and moral agonies he endured during the Siege of Leningrad in 1941.  In a spare and finely crafted story, he tells of his moral choices, decisions, and actions and how he came to survive the siege while others around him starved.<br />When the siege begins, the speaker and his wife Alena are both botanists at the Research Institute of Plant Industry.  Their goal has been to collect unique seed and plant specimens from all over the world, to preserve species, and to develop new strains of better plants.  As the siege develops, the institute holds a meeting to discuss the preservation of its collections, including several hundred tubers, which could, conceivably, feed some of the city's hungry people.  Ultimately, they decide that they will preserve the institute's collections at all costs.  The speaker, who has not supported this decision wholeheartedly, wonders whether the decision has really been made out of moral bravery and intellectual courage, or if it is purely the result of naivete--is it right for people who have never known starvation to make such decisions for others to follow?<br />As the siege takes its toll, the speaker constantly fantasizes about food and the trips he's made around the world to gather specimens, and he often associates the exotic meals he's had abroad with the lovers he's taken during these trips.  Imagery of food and love, seeds and fertility, propagation and new life, and fruitfulness and barrenness fill the novel, with clear parallels drawn between the overwhelming urge for food during times of extreme starvation and the desire for love-making during times of plenty. Always these images are counterbalanced by the realities of people starving during the 900-day siege.  When the  speaker finally succumbs to hunger and eats some seeds at the institute, he feels sadness but no remorse. \\"I was justified to take what I needed,\\" he says. \\"I barely took more.\\"  By eating the seeds, he survived to continue his research.<br />Every image is perfect here, not a word is wasted, and the multi-leveled themes are developed with both delicacy and precision.  Despite the subject matter, the author resists the temptation to tug on the heartstrings, preferring to present events factually and without elaboration, enhancing their power by juxtaposing contrasting scenes.  Scenes of deprivation are contrasted with scenes of plenty, ugliness with beauty, barrenness with fruitfulness, and starvation with love.  References to ancient Babylon provide a wider historical perspective and contribute to a fully satisfying, beautifully crafted novella.

In this account he searches for King Solomon's legendary gold mines, armed with books and research he acquired in preparation for his trip and a \\"treasure map\\" he purchased in Jerusalem.  King Solomon had built a lavishly appointed temple there three thousand years ago, using gold which the Queen of Sheba had brought from Ophir.  No one knows from what direction she came or where the legendary Ophir actually was, however, with different researchers claiming that it was in Zimbabwe, South Africa, or even Haiti or Peru.<br />A sacred Ethiopian text claims that the son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon is the ancestor of the Ethiopian emperors, and since Ethiopia's gold is also one of its richest resources, Shah accepts the idea that the legendary Ophir was probably in Ethiopia.  Hiring a guide and translator, he checks out many mines, both legal and illegal, where gold is so close to the surface that men, women, and children dig for it with their hands.  Always, Shah seeks some connection to Ophir.<br />The author keeps the reader constantly intrigued with the fascinating characters he meets during his many side trips.  When he hears that hyenas guarded Solomon's gold, Shah travels to Harar seeking out Yusuf, the hyenaman, who handfeeds wild hyenas each night so they will not steal the town's children.  He meets Noah, a powerful miner at a dangerous, illegal mine;  Rachel, an elderly woman, who is the last survivor of Beta Israel, the group of Ethiopian Jews who were airlifted to Israel;  a \\"miracle man,\\" who performs four miracles;  and Kefla Mohammed, leader of a salt caravan, who weeps when he must euthanize one of his camels.  And Shah also includes wonderfully revealing photographs of these people and the artifacts he finds.<br />Occasionally, Shah, a member of Afghan royalty who grew up in London, betrays an unfortunate sense of entitlement in his attitudes toward the people around him.  He does not give his devoted interpreter a \\"sick day,\\" even when he is clearly very ill, and he does not always share his supplies and equipment, once hiding from his employees to eat canned food.  He also fails to offer assistance at the site of a terrible road accident--something which he says never occurred to him.  His unflagging sense of adventure is admirable, however, and he brings fascinating and unique Ethiopian cultures and people to the attention of readers who would not otherwise be exposed to them. In providing rare glimpses of a world which few tourists have seen, he provides a service for which we can all be grateful.

Private detective George Webb allows the reader to &quot;tag along&quot; during one day of his life in 1997, talking to his readers about aspects of his life as they impinge randomly on his consciousness.  Description is not a big part of George's life, and it takes the reader some time to understand all his references in this lengthy interior monologue.  We don't know, at first, why Nov. 20 is a significant date to him or where he goes every other Thursday, nor do we know about his personal relationships with the women introduced at the beginning, or the reason he's buying flowers, or why he's had a woman's handbag in his possession for two years.<br />As George's recollections, memories, and observations expand, however, we gradually come to know him and his past, including his relationship with his father, his own broken marriage and the circumstances surrounding it, his alienated daughter, his womanizing, the scandal which has resulted in his leaving the police force, and his decision to specialize in &quot;matrimonial work.&quot;  We learn, too, that George's client, Mrs. Nash, is now in jail, the reasons for this unfolding even more gradually, as we come to know her, her husband Bob, and the privileged life they've led.  Always, however, our opinions of these characters and their relationships are colored by George's point of view, and we, as objective observers, learn as much about them from what George does not say as we do by what he does say.<br />All of George's memories are concerned with the vulnerability of people who are in love, as Swift raises questions about whether we choose the people we love, or whether we are chosen by them.  Does love just happen?  What makes it last?  What happens to lovers who are &quot;unchosen&quot;?  And can we love too much?  Although a mystery story is not usually the framework for such a serious, philosophical analysis of love in all its permutations, Swift manages to make this work through his beautifully wrought character study of George, buffeted every which way by the loves in his life. In the lean, unemphatic prose style he first employed in Last Orders, Graham Swift presents a sensitive investigation of love with all its mysteries and ineffable sadness.

U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule, arrive on Shutter Island, a secure facility for the criminally insane in Boston Harbor, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Rachel Solando from her locked and guarded room.  While looking for Rachel, a woman who has murdered her three children, Teddy also plans to investigate rumors that the hospital is performing radical brain surgery as part of its experimental treatments.  He has a secret personal motive for this trip, however--to find the arsonist who started the fire in which his own wife died, a man believed to be incarcerated on the island.  As Teddy and Chuck begin their investigations, with a total lack of co-operation from the hospital staff, the worst hurricane in thirty years bears down on the island.  If the power fails and the generators don't kick in, the electric locks and electrified fences will no longer protect Teddy, Chuck, and the staff from the hospital's murderous inhabitants.<br />In the hands of a lesser author, this might be the setup for a melodramatic and gore-filled pot-boiler, but Lehane artfully creates and maintains a tension-filled atmosphere, full of foreboding, without giving in to the easy temptations of sensationalism as his plot becomes more and more complex.  At one point, Teddy describes his fear, as a &quot;sparrow's ghost, pass[ing] through the center of his chest and flapping its wings,&quot; a unique metaphor which epitomizes Lehane's vibrant prose and makes it a lot of fun to read.  The hospital's orderlies have &quot;deadened faces, as if they hadn't been fed enough as babies,&quot; and Teddy, in trying to grasp a partial memory from the past, likens it to a &quot;melody he was trying to remember while the radio played a completely different tune.&quot;<br />Lehane's characters, Teddy and Chuck, are simultaneously tough and vulnerable, able to attract the sympathy of readers because they are so normal, in contrast to the devious hospital staff and the murderous patients.  Dialogue is snappy.  Revelations come slowly, and are constantly thrown into doubt by later revelations, which raise the suspense. As the tension grows, the &quot;sparrows' ghosts&quot; begin flapping their wings faster and faster.  This is a well-written can't-put-it-downer, with a story full of unexpected twists and turns, deceitful characters, life-threatening danger, and a blockbuster ending that will satisfy anyone looking for a novel that is out of the ordinary.

The 1946 World Series match-up between Boston and the St. Louis Cardinals went to seven games before Boston finally lost the championship, and Halberstam makes this seventh game come alive in all its frustrating excitement.  The book is unique, however, not because of its rehash of old ball games, but because it brings back an era, more than a half-century ago, when close and supportive friendships developed between players who spent their whole careers on the same team.  Telling the story of the sixty-year friendship of baseball greats Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky of the Boston Red Sox, Halberstam shows the kind of friendship which was possible in an era in which players were people, not commodities.<br /><br />Warm and nostalgic, the book opens in October, 2001, as Dom DiMaggio, accompanied by Boston writer Dick Flavin and Johnny Pesky, makes a melancholy car trip from Boston to Florida to pay a last visit to Ted Williams, who is dying.  As the men drive from Boston to Florida, they reminisce about their playing days more than fifty years in the past, recalling anecdotes about their friendship and talking about their lives, post-baseball.<br /><br />Halberstam uses these memories as the framework of this book, describing the men from their teenage years.  All were from the West Coast, all were about the same age, all arrived in Boston to begin their careers within the same two-year period, and all shared similar values.  Ted Williams, \\"the undisputed champion of contentiousness,\\" was the most dominant of the group.  Bobby Doerr was Williams's closest friend and roommate, \\"a kind of ambassador from Ted to the rest of the world,\\" Doerr himself being \\"very simply among the nicest and most balanced men.\\" Bespectacled Dom DiMaggio, the brother of Vince and Joe, was the consummate worker, a smart player who had been \\"forced to study everything carefully when he was young in order to maximize his chances and athletic abilities.\\"  Johnny Pesky, combative and small, was also \\"kind, caring, almost innocent.\\"<br /><br />Stories and anecdotes, sometimes told by the players themselves, make the men individually come alive and show the depth and value of their friendship.  The four characters remain engaging even when, in the case of Williams, they may be frustratingly disagreeable.  There's a bittersweet reality when Halberstam brings the lives of Williams, Doerr, DiMaggio, and Pesky, all now in their eighties, up to the present--these icons are, of course, as human as the rest of us, subject to the same physical deterioration and illnesses.  In Halberstam's sensitive rendering of their abiding relationship, however, we see them as men who have always recognized and preserved the most important of human values, and in that respect they continue to serve as heroes and exemplars to baseball fans throughout the country.

In this sensitively imagined and astutely observed novel, Babu, son of veterinarian Dr. Dam, reminisces about his father's life, trying to understand him--at least to the extent that sons can ever understand their fathers.  Acutely aware that every generation views events and experiences through knowledge gained during own lifetimes, Babu recognizes that though he and his father have shared many events, their views of these events are vastly different, in each case conditioned by their separate, though sometimes intersecting, pasts.<br />The Dam family is Bengali, managing to escape the 1979 civil war there by fleeing to Assam, a remote, northeastern province of India nestled between Bangladesh and Bhutan.  Supporting his elderly parents and several brothers and sisters, and marrying and starting a family late in life, Dr. Dam has spent his career as an honest civil servant within a corrupt Indian government.  Babu, born in India, has never known the places which shaped the lives of his father and grandparents and which still live in their hearts.  Separated by both temperament and by dissimilar backgrounds, Dr. Dam and Babu are remote from each other until they are brought together dramatically through Dr. Dam's debilitating stroke.<br /><br />Deb's straightforward and often elegant prose is particularly effective for its subtlety.  Lacking the lush description so frequently found in novels with Indian settings, the novel concentrates instead on universal values and the father-son search for understanding.  The novel is less exotic, despite its unusual setting, than some other Indian novels, but more accessible to readers from other cultures and more potent in its observations about life.  In an ironic twist, the author uses his clear, unadorned prose to provide Dr. Dam's personal history in a chronology which, though linear, moves backward in time, as Babu, aged seventeen, recalls what he knows of his father and the events and people which have influenced him.<br />The reverse chronology is much like the history we all create for our parents whenever we try to mine our own experiences for insights into their lives in an effort to find common ground and understand who we think they are.  We recall past events in their lives which we think are important based on our own experiences, not theirs.  With its focus both on a man coming to terms with his father's life, and on everyone's yearning for a homeland, even after it is gone, Deb provides observations which expand our own view of what forms our characters, and gives us new insights into universal truths.

With this toast Chief Superintendent Peter McGarr of the Garda Soichana salutes his New York counterparts for helping him investigate IRA fund-raising in the U.S. to finance terrorism abroad. A seemingly straightforward investigation of the murder of a young Irish woman, stabbed to death with a wooden pitchfork on the Cliffs of Moher, has quickly turned into an international conspiracy involving secret cells of the IRA, money-laundering, and plans for a major terror attack in the Emerald Isle. McGarr's investigation of the murder of May Quirk, a reporter for a New York newspaper, reveals the wide variety of people affected by her death and their interactions--educated young Irish emigres now living in New York, sad and frustrated old folks tending small farms in County Clare, owners of local dance halls and pubs in Lahinch, misguided supporters of the IRA, crooks threatened by May's investigations, and even her German boyfriend with his Irish roots.<br />McGarr, his wife Noreen, and his officers--Hugh Ward, Bernie McKeon, and O'Shaughnessy--whom we know from previous novels, continue to develop their personal relationships in parallel with the ongoing IRA investigation. McGarr, who is not averse to having a jar with the lads, even the bad lads, is an honest investigator who shows his emotions and is willing to get \\"down and dirty,\\" if necessary. He himself admits to interpreting the law on terms that are \\"somehow fairer than the cold print on the pages of the law books,\\" in order to effect a just outcome. The action is fast, the plot is exciting, and the characters, with all their quirks and idiosyncrasies, are unforgettable.<br />Author Gill's eye for revealing detail, his colorful dialogue with all its colloquialisms, his perceptive recreation of unique settings and atmosphere, and the loving humor of his observations make this novel a lively and memorable evocation of characters and places we have come to know as part of this fifteen-book series. Originally published in 1978 as McGarr and the Cliffs of Moher, this is a new reprint following the untimely death of the author in the summer of 2002.

Inspiring readers to pay more attention to the world around them, Atwood offers cautionary notes about the environment, bioengineering, the sacrifice of civil liberties, and the possible loss of those human values which make life more than just a physical experience.  As the novel opens, some catastrophe has occurred, effectively wiping out all human life.<br />Snowman (known as Jimmy in his youth) is the lone survivor, a man on the verge of starvation in this desolate new world, now living in a tree for protection against &quot;wolvogs&quot; (part dog, part wolf) and serving as the protector of a bioengineered strain of humanoid children.  As Atwood alternates between the unexplained disaster in which Snowman finds himself at the outset of the novel and flashbacks to his youth and early adulthood, which he shared with his best friend Crake, she brings a dismal future-world to life.  Not surprisingly, Oryx, Snowman's love, has been involved in the devastation, as has Crake, though Atwood saves till the conclusion an explanation of the catastrophe, something which may frustrate some readers.<br />Because we never see Jimmy/Snowman engaging in the kind of personal conflict which would have led to such a grand-scale disaster, we never really experience the intense reader involvement which might have developed from observing such a conflict.  Most of the real conflict, in fact, takes place in the past and is revealed only in flashbacks.  Snowman's primary conflict is his final, lonely battle with the environment to stay alive, something which advances the message at the expense of dramatic tension.  Characters also are subordinated to message.  We know only as much about Jimmy/Snowman as we need to know in order to empathize with him in his predicament as possibly the last man on earth.  Crake is an anti-hero, remote and distanced, and Oryx remains a mystery.<br />Despite its grim subject and cautionary message, the novel has a great deal of humor.  With trenchant satire, Atwood pokes fun at aspects of our contemporary lives carried to extremes. Not hard science fiction, the novel is a vividly described picture of science and scientists run amok in a society which has failed in its guardianship of the environment and of life itself.  More light-hearted than terrifying, and more allegorical than heart-stopping, the novel carries an environmental message of great relevance.

From her childhood though her arranged marriage twenty-five years later, author Narayan shares her own memories, recalling the foods which made them rich and vivid.<br />Filled with sense impressions, her earliest years are characterized by memories of Raju, the milkman who milked Tiger, his cow, on demand;  Chinnapan, who set up his iron and ironing board under one of their trees and kept the iron hot by loading it with coals he picked up in his bare hands;  and Jaya, his wife, whose face was bright yellow from the turmeric paste she habitually applied.  In school Narayan and her friends would barter their lunches, trading back and forth in the currency of their mothers' specialties.  Holidays and vacations were filled with memories of pungent family feasts.<br />During her college years in India, she applied surreptitiously to Mount Holyoke College for a fellowship and won it, only to run into significant opposition from her family. Her uncle suggested that if she, who had never cooked a full meal, could cook a vegetarian feast like those her mother cooked for the extended family, and have them like it, she might go.  She did, and she went.  Two years later, she won a scholarship to graduate school at Memphis State, this time cooking up a feast for potential donors in the U.S. in order to raise some of the extra money she needed.  Later she would learn to cook traditional foods for her husband in the traditional ways.<br />Narayan's memoir is charming and sensitive, both to the cultural differences between South Asia and the United States, and to the realities of family life in both places.  Through food she bridges the differences between our cultures and makes day-to-day life in each place understandable and accessible to people of other backgrounds.

The best-of-nine series between Boston and Pittsburgh was tied, one game apiece, when Game Three of the 1903 World Series began in Boston, a city delirious about its new American League team.  Third-baseman/manager Jimmy Collins was enormously popular, star pitcher Cy Young was just one of three Boston pitchers with more than twenty wins during the season, and, best of all, tickets to Game Three were only fifty cents.  When those were gone, ticket sellers kept selling admission, and when the seats were filled, spectators jumped the ropes to line the baselines.  When those became crowded, they lined the outfield, occasionally reaching the diamond itself.  The crowd was so large that short fly balls were declared ground rule doubles, as were homeruns, the overly enthusiastic crowd causing Boston to lose the game with its excessive enthusiasm.<br />Ryan is immensely skillful in bringing the Series alive by characterizing the players for both teams, showing what makes them unusual and memorable.  Among these are 36-year-old Cy Young, catcher Lou Criger (sickly already with the early stages of tuberculosis), the elegant and intelligent Jimmy Collins (a consummate player and respected captain/manager), the hot-tempered Hobe Ferris (later infamous for kicking a teammate in the face), and shortstop Freddy Parent of Sanford, Maine, who lived to become a 92-year-old commentator during Boston's 1967 World Series. For Pittsburgh, the legendary Honus Wagner and pitcher Deacon Philippe, who pitched in five of the eight games, sometimes with only one day off, are especially vivid.<br />He devotes an entire chapter to Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss, \\"the greatest ball fan on earth,\\" a generous man who declared that he would take no profit from the Series and that every penny would go to his players.  Numerous contrasts, both overt and implied, exist between Dreyfuss, whom Ryan believes belongs in the Hall of Fame, and Boston owner Henry Killilea, for whom the team was a business which he oversaw from out of state.  Killilea eventually modified his original demands and agreed to a 60-40 split with his players, who as winners of the Series earned significantly less than the losers.<br />Comparisons and contrasts between between the games of 1903 and the present abound.  As early as 1903, Globe writer Tim Murnane suggested a designated hitter. Boston's Royal Rooters began the concept of the traveling fan club, and their use of a song to upset the opposition was a deciding factor in the Series.  Scalpers became a major problem in Game 8, the last game of the Series, and Ryan suggests that it was someone in owner Killilea's employ who was responsible.

When the \\"potato famine\\" of 1847 was over, two million residents of Ireland had died agonizing deaths, most of them from starvation.  The events which led to the famine, the people who were directly affected by it, and the steps taken to ameliorate or escape it are the subjects of Joseph O'Connor's intense and heartfelt novel, Star of the Sea, named for the British-owned \\"famine ship\\" which is the center of the action here.<br />O'Connor presents four main characters who recall the pivotal experiences of their lives which lead them to make this fateful, 27-day journey.  The reader becomes emotionally involved with their stories, acquiring a broad background in Irish social history--and its tragedie--in the process.  Thomas David Nelson Merridith, Lord Kingscourt, is the ninth generation of his Protestant family to govern Kingscourt, with hundreds of workers dependent upon him.  Now bankrupt, he and his family are going to America, first-class.  Their nanny, Mary Duane, has recently joined the family, and her stories of her past loves, her marriage, and her loss of her own children illuminate the bleak prospects available to this warm and intelligent, but desperately poor, woman.<br />G. Grantley Dixon is a caricature of the liberal American do-gooder, whose reports about the plight of the Irish poor are influenced by his own socialism and by the reform-minded traditions of his family.  Self-centered in his attitudes and limited in his social graces, he is detested by Merridith.  Pius Mulvey is a mysterious ex-convict who comes from the same town as Merridith and Mary Duane, directly connected to both of them.  One of over 400 passengers who have paid $8 per person for passage, he is crammed into the fetid and dangerous quarters known as \\"steerage,\\" expected to stay alive on one quart of water a day and half a pound of hardtack.<br />O'Connor pulls out all the stops here in this big, broad melodrama, but an honesty of emotion and a fidelity to the facts here saves the novel from bathos and gives the reader cause for thought.  Moments of both ineffable sadness and high drama arise, and O'Connor's imagery, especially his sense imagery, is arresting.  Occasionally, his compression of time, for the sake of story, leads to anachronisms--several mentions of evolution, with parallels between monkeys and Irishmen, ignore the fact that Darwin's Evolution of the Species was not published until twelve years after this famine.  Still, O'Connor presents a compelling story with many unforgettable details of Irish history.  The ending is preachy, but the author does provide a follow-up on the characters after their arrival in America. The fact that at least one character becomes a politician (later accused of misappropriation of funds) will surprise no one accustomed to politics.

This bittersweet novel is as fresh and charming today as it was when originally published in 1976.  Telling the story of Raman, a conscientious sign-painter, who is trying to lead a rational life, the novel is filled with busy neighborhood life and gossip, the alternating rhythms and sounds of the city from morning till night, and the pungent smells and tantalizing flavors of home cooking, as Narayan portrays everyday life in Malgudi.  The city is growing and changing, as its inhabitants try to carve out some individual successes within the juggernaut of &quot;progress.&quot;<br />Raman, a college graduate, brings a sense of professionalism to his sign-painting, taking pride in his calligraphy and trying to create exactly the right sign, artistically, for each client.  Living with his aged aunt, a devout, traditional woman whose days are spent running the house and tending to her nephew's needs and whose evenings are spent at the temple listening to the old stories and praying, Raman prefers a rational approach to life.  Then he meets Daisy.  A young woman devoted to improving the lives of women and the standard of living of the country through strict family planning, Daisy becomes his biggest customer, commissioning signs for all the family planning clinics she helps establish through the city and outlying rural areas.  Ram soon finds his attraction to Daisy more powerful than this desire to remain &quot;rational.&quot;<br />Narayan is a master of domestic scenes, presenting the major and minor conflicts of family life through the different points of view of the participants.  Respect for his characters and a good-humored (and often humorous) presentation of their issues give warmth to his scenes and allow the reader to feel real empathy with the characters.  Raman's belief in his own rational enlightenment and his simultaneous vulnerability to Daisy's manipulations provide the author with unlimited opportunities for dramatic irony.  Scenes between Ram and his devout, elderly aunt provide a glimpse of the conflicts between old and new India, in addition to the generational conflicts every family faces between its young and its old.  Scenes between Ram and Daisy reflect the changes in the role of women in society, as women become more assertive and liberated.  Though he is presented as a unique, individualized character, Ram, the painter of signs, is, in a sense, Everyman, facing his coming-of-age as all men before him have done in cultures around the world.

Padilla raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of selfhood here, as men appropriate each other's names, accept or reject the past which is connected with those names, and hope, ultimately, to change their destinies by living someone else's life.  The reader must constantly question whether each character is who he says he is, and whether he really is who we think he is.  Main character Thadeus Dreyer goes through several incarnations as Padilla connects him to seminal events of the 20th century: the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and World War I, the rise of German Socialism and World War II, and ultimately, the war crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann.<br />Four speakers give four overlapping views of the characters and action.  Franz Kretzschmar, the first speaker, is living in Buenos Aires in 1957, as he recalls the history of his father, Viktor Kretzschmar, who lived another man's life after assuming another man's name. On a train going from Austria to the eastern front in 1916, he had played a life-or-death chess game with another man and had \\"won.\\"  The winner became \\"Viktor Kretzschmar\\" and lived out the war as pointman on the Salzburg-Munich train line; the loser became Thadeus Dreyer and faced almost certain death in battle.<br />Richard Schley, the second speaker, is a seminarian in 1918, when he sees \\"Thadeus Dreyer,\\" whom he once knew in Vienna as Jakob Efrussi.  Another chess game leads to another identity switch.  A third speaker, Alikoska Goliadkin, is an associate of Dreyer during his rise to power in the Nazi era, and he connects Dreyer with Adolf Eichmann and with Kretzschman's son Franz, who may be part of a Nazi project to create look-alikes of powerful Nazi leaders.  The fourth speaker, Daniel Sanderson, is an heir of Baron Blok-Cissewsky, who has left coded information in a chess manual in 1989, explaining some of the final projects of the Hitler era.  The Baron, not surprisingly, is yet another of seven incarnations of Dreyer, and as Sanderson investigates the trial and execution of Eichmann and his connection to Dreyer, questions arise as to the true identity of the man executed as \\"Eichmann.\\"<br />Padilla's plotting is obviously complex, but despite constant changes of identity, and twists and revelations throughout, the novel never loses its way-nor will the careful reader.  The tight story line maintains its tension, and the author's ingenuity in manipulating characters and historical events provides constant surprises.

Phillip Fairaday, a Loyalist who is master of the schooner at only twenty years of age, finds his ship boarded but his own men still in control--in the storm-tossed boarding, Lt. Eliot Marlborough of the Royal Navy has been wounded by his own sword.  Fairaday saves Marlborough's life, and the two men begin an association which the author plans to develop into a series about the Revolutionary War.<br />Battle action on sailing ships is fast and furious here, and White successfully conveys the excitement of these dangerous times, illustrating the conflicted loyalties of the colonists, the determination of Royal Navy officers to protect their own positions and reputations, the lure of wealth from privateering, and the difficulties of managing a war in which one cannot always be certain who is friend or foe--or even who is in charge.  The Royal Governor in Virginia frees a number of slaves and presses them to form a militia to fight the rebels in Williamsburg, and former sea captain Fairaday and his brother both accept short term commissions leading these freed slaves against the rebels in an effort to protect their way of life and their father's wealth.  The action alternates between land and sea as the battle for Norfolk begins.<br />White has done a great deal of research, though this novel is not an exact reconstruction of the historical record.  The vocabulary of ships and sea, the general tenor of the lives of the seamen (many of them pressed into service against their will), the brutality of cannon fire and hand to hand combat, and the overall confusion and lack of organization as the revolution proceeds all add to the excitement of the action here.  The plot line ranges widely as Fairaday moves from the sea to his father's estate, on to an army garrison, where he participates in land battles, and then returns to sea again.  The characters, which are not fully developed, may grow as the series continues, with the author providing  hints of future relationships and surprises to come.  The abrupt ending of this novel sets the scene for another novel, which may begin where this one leaves off.

Investigating the 1984 murder of Mickalou Maugham, a Traveler well liked and admired for his gentleness of spirit and his playing of the uillean pipes, Chief Inspector Peter McGarr focuses on Desmond Bacon, known as the Toddler, who is the sadistic head of the drug trade in Ireland.  Mickalou, missing for weeks, has been found dead at the top of a giant sequoia tree in County Wicklow, and Biddy Nevins, his wife, a former addict and sidewalk artist, has fled from Ireland, fearing both the Toddler and the possibility that one or more Garda members may be working with him. Twelve years later, Des Bacon catches up with her, and shootouts, home invasions, car chases, and a high body count result, as he tries to protect his turf and avoid prosecution.<br />As he does in the rest of this series, Gill develops stories on two levels--the immediate action and excitement of a specific mystery, focusing on some lesser known aspect of Irish life (in this case, the Traveler community), and the stories and relationships of his continuing cast of characters as they develop during the series.  Ruthie Bresnahan and Hugh Ward, whose discovery of each other was a huge and often hilarious part of an earlier mystery (Death of a Joyce Scholar), have now had a years-long relationship, which is about to be tested during the action of this novel.<br />Gill's intensely realized descriptions--of the abuse of a Traveler by the Tod, of an addict in need of a fix, and of a teenager trying to fit in at a dance, for example--make his scenes come alive,  while his understanding of the vagaries of police procedure gives a sense of reality to his less than perfect detectives.  McGarr is a strong and caring main character whose sense of justice and honor are paramount (even if it means bending the rules), while his well developed cast of likable and amusing subordinates, who continue to grow in successive novels, provides the reader with long-term rewards throughout the series.

The streets of Edinburgh in 1886 run with blood as a series of bizarre deaths and dismemberments, possibly by some huge wild animal, haunt the public imagination and send the police force into high dudgeon. A frail young woman, Evelyn Todd, is thought to be at the root of these horrifying crimes. Evelyn grew up in an institution in the mid-1860's, where the administrator reined in her imagination and punished her especially for the stories about a lamplighter, with which she entertained the other children. Later, when James Ainslie, Laird of Millenhall, claimed to be her father, she lived at his estate, a frightened and solitary child who took refuge in her paintings, in which she usually included an avuncular gentleman in peaked cap, blue jacket, and gray scarf, whom she referred to as \\"Leerie,\\" a lamplighter.<br />An 1886, Evelyn, now in her twenties, comes under investigation for a series of murders. Evelyn has had vivid and revelatory dreams about each of the murders, though she insists that she has not been present; has no real, firsthand knowledge of any of the murders; and does not know about them ahead of time. The murdered men are all members of a secret society, the Mirror Society, whose membership also includes James Ainslie, Evelyn's \\"father.\\" Of the murders, Evelyn says only that she believes them to have been committed by \\"the lamplighter.\\"<br />In an unusual narrative twist to this Gothic and atmospheric novel, O'Neill employs two sets of characters to track Evelyn and ascertain her relationship to these murders. Carus Groves and his assistant, Pringle, are trying to solve the police cases involving the law and its penalties, while Professor Thomas McKnight, Professor of Logic and Metaphysics, and his friend Canavan are trying to solve the larger questions of who Evelyn really is, why she is able to see details of the crimes in her dreams, and whether she may represent the \\"devil inherent in all of us. A primeval instinct, a fundamental component of evolution.\\" The reader cannot help wondering if the lamplighter, who carries fire to the lamps of the city, is, in reality, Lucifer, whose name, literally translated, means \\"carrier of fire.\\"<br />Eventually, McKnight and Canavan follow Evelyn into Hades in an effort to rescue her from the devil they believe resides within her, and the reader is drawn into a metaphysical and theological debate regarding the nature of selfhood, the existence of evil, its connection both to the imagination and reality, and the extent to which mankind exercises free will in the desire to control outcomes. O'Neill uses the vocabulary of religion and the new perceptions which resulted from Darwin's Origin of the Species to try to explain those aspects of human nature which Freud and the psychoanalysts later developed into a new science at the turn of the century. O'Neill is a fine writer whose use of vivid verbs and lively description helps to animate this serious philosophical debate. The reader's job is figure out what is real and what is not, a task which is not as easy as it may seem in this complex and serious novel.

Set from 1949 to 1950, with an epilogue which brings the characters up to date in 2001, the novel uses the political tensions of the mountainous area where Kashmir, the Soviet Union, Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Afghanistan, and China converge as the catalyst for the action.  Aidan Shaw, a Chinese/American journalist with Socialist/Communist leanings, disappears while on a story, and his wife and young son find themselves at the mercy of consulates, embassies, and intelligence services, none of which can give adequate information as to his fate.<br />Packing up her young son, Aidan' wife Joanna goes to Srinagar in search of information.  Lawrence Malcolm, the Australian friend whose &quot;hot tip&quot; to Aidan inspired him to undertake his journey, accompanies her, bringing along Kamla, a street child Joanna has &quot;rescued&quot; and whose original home may have been the mountains through which they are traveling.  Kamla's story parallels that of Joanna.  Her first person account of life on the streets of Delhi and her &quot;rescue&quot; by Joanna broaden the scope and show the contrasts between those who hold the life of one individual to be paramount, such as Joanna, and those for whom survival is such a struggle that soft feelings, or &quot;impossible goodness&quot; are regarded as a weakness.<br />Coincidence plays a big role in this romantic, and at times melodramatic, novel, which uses the search for Aidan as the vehicle through which the plot progresses.  The action moves from Delhi to Srinagar and the mountains around Sinkiang, and eventually includes Hong Kong, Calcutta, Milwaukee, and Washington.  Liu keeps the pace moving smartly, with important details revealed at each location so that the search for Aidan never flags.<br />As in any plot-driven novel, we learn only as much about the characters as we need to know: the author does not dwell on psychological motivations.  Aidan remains a cipher, and Joanna's transformation from idealist to more self-absorbed pragmatist is not explained in any detail.  Of greater consequence is the author's belief that &quot;Truth, in the end, requires...fact, illusion, faith--alone each is equally incomplete.&quot;  The conclusion, which mirrors this belief, destroys the reader's own illusions as the facts unfold, and it is not one in which everything is resolved as the reader might expect or hope.  Ultimately, what matters most, according to Kamla is not right or wrong. &quot;It was not politics or fidelity or even understanding...It was simply our mutual ineptitude at love.&quot;  For readers who believe that fidelity and understanding should be paramount values, the ending will be a surprise, and perhaps not a welcome one.  Book clubs should have fun analyzing the author's choice of ending.  Mary Whippleneed to know: the author does not dwell on psychological motivations.

Thursday Next, a member of the Literary Detective Division of Special Operations in England, lives in looking-glass universe in which all the \\"givens\\" of our world are turned upside down.  The Crimean War has just ended after 150 years, Thursday has a pet dodo, and Neanderthals have been reintroduced to the world.  Her father, a former ChronoGuard, travels through time and can alter both the past and the present, and her uncle Mycroft has invented a Prose Portal, which allows people from the \\"real\\" world to travel inside books, an invention that the evil Goliath Corporation covets.<br />Thursday has just solved a difficult case, The Eyre Affair, in which she saves characters in Jane Eyre from murder and gives the book a better conclusion, and she has trapped the unscrupulous Jack Schitt of the Goliath Corporation inside Poe's \\"The Raven.\\"  In this sequel, the Goliath Corporation teaches Thursday a lesson, eradicating her husband, Landen Parke-Laine, by manipulating time so that he dies in an accident when he is a baby.  Thursday, who has just found out that she is pregnant, now finds that she does not know who the baby's father is--because Landen never existed after the age of two.  Blackmailed by Goliath, she must free Jack Schitt from \\"The Raven\\" if she ever wants to see Landen again.  Miss Havisham from Dickens's Great Expectations, a long-time employee of Jurisfiction, takes her as an apprentice and tries to teach her how to get inside fiction without the Prose Portal and perhaps figure out a way to retrieve Landen.<br />Like The Eyre Affair, Lost in a Good Book is the wackiest of pleasures, with off-the-wall literary characters performing outrageous deeds in which none of the \\"rules\\" of our universe apply.  The plot and intrigue gain in complexity with the discovery of Cardenio, an unknown, and possibly phony, play by William Shakespeare, while pink slime threatens the existence of life on earth. The action is here episodic and the subplots do not really mesh, but each change of scene and subplot sets up opportunities for Fforde to show off his prodigious literary knowledge and wacky humor.  The reader quickly becomes so caught up in the hullabaloo, that weaknesses, such as a looseness of plot and a lack of dramatic tension, can be excused.

Now approaching his sixtieth birthday and wanting to escape from cell phones, answering machines, the daily newspaper, and being \\"put on hold,\\" he is determined to travel from Cairo to Cape Town.  He believes that the continent \\"contain[s] many untold tales and some hope and comedy and sweetness, too,\\" and that there is \\"more to Africa than misery and terror.\\"<br />Traveling alone by cattle truck, \\"chicken bus,\\" bush train, matatu, rental car, ferry, and even dugout canoe, he tries to blend in as much as possible, buying clothing at secondhand stalls in public markets, carrying only one small bag, and avoiding the tourist destinations.  He is an observant and insightful writer, and his descriptions of his travails are so vivid the reader can experience them vicariously.  His interviews with residents are perceptive and very revealing of the political and social climate of these places, and his character sketches of Sister Alexandra from Ethiopia (a nun who \\"has loved\\") and of two charming Ethiopian traders, a father and son, who take Theroux to the Kenyan border, are delightful.<br />For most of the countries of Africa, however, he has no kind words.  Kenya is \\"one of the most corrupt...countries in Africa,\\" everything in Kampala, Uganda, has changed for the worse, and in Tanzania \\"there was only decline--simple linear decrepitude, and in some villages collapse.\\"  At the U.S. embassy in Malawi, he finds an \\"overpaid, officious, disingenuous, blame-shifting...embassy hack\\" and, in pique, he wonders, \\"Had she, like me, been abused, terrified, stranded, harassed, cheated, bitten, flooded, insulted, exhausted, robbed, browbeaten, poisoned?\\"<br />Theroux has become curmudgeonly over time, and it is difficult to \\"travel with\\" a man who sees himself as a hero for making the trip at all, but who also refuses to give an apple to a little girl when she observes it through the window of his train compartment and begs for it.

Unsophisticated and incurious, he has been content to let life happen to him. When his friend Charles suggests that he give up his job and go to the Solomon Islands for a year, he demurs, but Charles is an executor of the will of an Englishman known as the Commander, who has left money for the benefit of the islanders, if someone will go there to develop a reliable industry that will provide the villagers with income they can use for community improvements. Eventually, Randall finds himself agreeing to go, not making a decision so much as just going with the flow.<br />Randall experiences a delayed coming of age on New Georgia Island, a process he documents in this good-humored tale, filled with delightful characters and observations about life in a community in which there is little change. Ingenuous and unambitious, he enjoys the lullaby rhythms of life in the tropics, but he eventually determines that raising chickens would both provide income and expand the limited diet of the villagers. Describing how he sets up this business, he also comments on village mores, including the cannibalism which existed until the early 20th century. He briefs the reader on the World War II history of the nearby island of Guadalcanal, retells the story of JFK and PT-109, which went down in the Solomon Islands, and describes his own personal disasters, mocking himself at one point, after he falls overboard in shark infested waters and watches as his motorized canoe continues on its way.<br />Far more interested in telling a story than in contemplating his inner growth or making weighty observations about what he has learned, Randall pokes fun at himself and at the one or two &quot;villains&quot; he encounters with the chicken-business, and he concentrates on telling amusing episodes rather than developing any deep or universally meaningful conclusions. His decision to return to England comes suddenly, with no fanfare and even less explanation, and he offers few clues about what he has learned or why he has chosen this particular time to leave.<br /><br />Though the author is very entertaining, he sometimes mixes metaphors and similes into a colorful but almost incoherent jumble. At one point, he describes Honiara, the capital, as &quot;the unsightly boil in the navel of the islands.&quot; In the next sentence, he says Honiara is &quot;reminiscent of the cardboard set of a low-budget spaghetti Western,&quot; and describes it also as &quot;slouching like a hungover vagrant against the foothills of Tandachehe Ridge.&quot; Despite such confusions in imagery, however, he succeeds in writing an enjoyable, good-natured, and often charming story which will amuse readers of all ages.

Heaven's Edge is unique--it is not a romance, not a war chronicle, not a religious allegory, not a plea for ecological responsibility, and not science fiction, though it contains elements of all these genre.  Marc, a young college graduate from London, has returned to an unnamed island, much like the author's island of Sri Lanka, on a mission to connect with his father's memory.  His father, a military pilot, left the family in England when Marc was a very young child and returned to the island where he died while on a mission.  Marc's doting grandfather, who raised him, never understood what drove his son to return to the very island he himself had escaped.<br /><br />The novel opens with Marc's arrival at the island by boat, and Gunesekera quickly establishes the mood and the themes of freedom and repression, and past and present, as the boatman, upon his arrival, releases two flying fish, accidentally netted during the trip.  The island is under military control, and the hotel where Marc stays strictly limits his movements.<br /><br />In an intensely romantic scene, Marc escapes the stultifying restrictions one day and meets Uva, a young woman who is trying to repopulate the forest with native birds and animals, all of which have disappeared during the long war.  When Marc is suddenly rendered unconscious and Uva disappears from his life, the mood changes instantly from romance to surreality, as Marc finds himself in captivity, enduring a regimented life more akin to science fiction than the heights of romance.  Mind-numbing violence, brutally perpetrated by the military to remove any question of free thought and independent activity in the population, is the only constant in the lives of the characters, as Gunesekera explores our need to remain connected to our pasts and the ways in which our futures are outgrowths of our pasts.  The graphically described violence further sets into sharp relief themes of personal identity, the desire for beauty, and the need to protect and preserve the natural world.<br /><br />Sometimes enigmatic and even a bit preachy, the novel is at once magical and nightmarish, full of myth and allegory at the same time that it offers haunting, cautionary tales about the past and the use of violence to change the present and affect the future.  Echoes of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, the fall of man, legends about peacocks and leopards, and episodes telling the importance of love and respect pervade the novel, giving it immense color and depth as Marc tries to connect with the past.  Clearly a pacifist, Gunesekera says, \\"The art of killing cannot be our finest achievement...Nothing is inevitable.\\"  But Gunesekera does not believe in being completely passive or non-violent when faced with true threats to life.  \\"Sometimes you have to sacrifice your innocence to protect this world,\\" he says.  In this memorable novel with its stunning depictions of nature, especially birds and butterflies as they try to survive the depredations of man, he makes a powerful, ecological and political statement, presenting characters who try to create gardens of their own out of the decimated gardens of their pasts.

Axel Vander tells us from the opening of this sensitive and tension-filled study of identity that he is not who he says he is. A respected scholar and professor at a California college, Vander is recognized for his thoughtful philosophical papers and books, especially his ironically entitled The Alias as Salient Fact: The Nominative Case in the Quest for Identity. Just before he leaves for a conference on Nietzsche in Turin, however, he receives a letter from a young woman in Antwerp, questioning his own identity and asking to meet with him. As the novel unfolds, we come to know more about the \\"real\\" Axel Vander and more about his mysterious correspondent, the emotionally disturbed Cass Cleave.<br />Like Banville's narrators in other novels, the elderly Axel Vander of Shroud is unreliable and often dishonest, self-concerned but not self-aware. Consummately venal (though beautifully realized), he is a character who blithely takes advantage of whatever circumstances arise, with no concern for the consequences, except to himself. Cass Cleave, the daughter of Alexander Cleave, the narrator of Banville's previous novel, Eclipse, has visions and seizures, and Vander regards her as mad, but she and Vander develop a relationship of almost religious significance. He is a depraved and amoral old man living a life of personal un-truth, while she is a sick, avenging angel, striving to connect the disjunctions in her life so that she can become an integrated, whole person.<br />In Turin, where she joins Axel, Cass sees religious symbolism in common events, finding an ordinary breakfast a form of communion. Artworks, especially crucifixion scenes by artists from the various settings in which the novel takes place (Cranach, Bosch, Memling, and Van Eyck in the Low Countries; and Tintoretto, Mantegna, and Bellini in Italy) further develop the symbolism. Always present in the background, of course, is the Shroud of Turin, which may be the real burial cloth of Jesus--or may not be. Parallels and contrasts between Vander and Jesus abound.<br />Banville's novel is intense, highly compressed in its development of overlapping themes, and filled with suspense, both real and intellectual. Every plot detail expands his themes of identity and selfhood, the relationships we create with the outside world, and our desire to be remembered after our deaths. Banville's prose is exquisite, creating mystery by introducing details at a snail's pace, conveying attitude, and acutely observing sensuous details and physical reactions. He juxtaposes unlikely events from different times to convey information, providing voluptuous descriptions which contain both an idea and its antithesis simultaneously. Major surprises occur in the final five pages, not inserted as literary tricks, but generated naturally out of the action and interactions. This is a challenging and fascinating novel, beautifully crafted and rewarding on every level.

With single-minded determination, born from years of mental discipline, thirty-seven-year-old Clara Wieck Schumann, dressed in black, took the arm of her friend, Johannes Brahms, and was escorted to the piano, where she would begin a new phase of her life, as a widow and the sole support of the eight children she bore composer Robert Schumann.  Clara was well schooled for her life of self-denial and duty.  A brilliant pianist and former child prodigy, she had been controlled by her domineering father, and she had had to sue him so that she could marry Robert Schumann, an unstable composer whose own demons exerted control over her life.<br />Robert Schumann's instability, according to the author, began at a very early age.  As a young man, he believed that he was inhabited by two people, Florestan and Eusebius, and he often alternated marathon composing sessions (once producing 27 pages of music in a single day) with times in which he could find no inspiration at all.  He had to have silence when he was working, and he was inconsistent in his behavior, often blaming Clara for small infractions over which she had no control.  She had no life of her own.  She was the primary bread-winner in the family, giving concerts regularly, despite the arrival of eight babies and the difficulty of practicing without disturbing Robert.  Unappreciated and unrecognized by the public, Robert became frustrated and depressed, eventually admitting himself to an asylum, where he died in 1856, at age 46.<br />The ill-starred love story of Clara and Robert Schumann is as romantic as the music of Schumann and his contemporaries, but Galloway keeps this novel on a factual level, as much as possible.  There are no flights of fancy here, no imaginative soaring into the stratosphere of romance, and no attempt to recreate the passionate feeling of their love or of their music.  She has done enormous research into their lives and presents her novel as if time and circumstance are being filtered through the consciousness of Clara, her father, or Robert.  Her recreation of domestic situations and scenes, combined with what the various participants have said about them in their (real) diaries and journals allow her to reflect their inner turmoil while remaining fairly objective as a historian.<br />Galloway's novel is thoroughly researched, full of information about the Schumanns, and sympathetic to Clara's enormous personal burdens.  She is largely successful in bringing Clara to life.  We never see Robert as a \\"normal\\" person, however, and the reader remains at a distance from him, observing, rather than feeling, what is happening to him.  Yet Clara lived for forty years after Robert's death, and this reader would have appreciated a brief Afterword telling what she did during that time.  Tied inextricably to Robert throughout their marriage, one can only wonder if she eventually found happiness on her own after his death.

Published as McGarr and the Sienese Conspiracy in 1977, this early McGarr mystery, newly reprinted with a new title, is most unusual in that it takes primarily in Italy, not Ireland.  Here Gill captures the mounting tension, the rich pageantry, and the centuries-old traditions of the Palio in Siena with the same kind of lush, colorful description and eye for detail one has always admired in his Irish settings, making this frantic horserace around the piazza sound as thrilling and irresistible as it must be in reality.  The fact that the former chief of SIS, now Ambassador from the UK to Italy, is shot down before McGarr's eyes during the race certainly dampens McGarr's enthusiasm about his return to Italy, where he had previously served with Interpol for five years.  He was supposed to be guarding the Ambassador.<br />This is the third such murder of a former SIS chief in the space of two weeks, the first two having occurred on a country farm on the windblown shores of the Dingle peninsula at the southernmost tip of Ireland.  Leaving the Irish investigations to others, McGarr delves into the Siena murder, which is connected to an Italian oil company drilling for oil off the coast of Scotland, disputed oil claims, the leader of the Italian Communist party, and shady relationships between politicians, the police, and cutthroat oil executives. Siena with all its radiant splendor, its Italian palazzos, its exuberantly described food, and its Beautiful People with their romantic dalliances and smug self-confidence offers sharp contrasts with the site of the earlier Dingle murders, where some residents still cook over peat fires and haven't quite figured out how to use the telephone.<br />Lovers of the McGarr series will enjoy the complexity of this mystery despite its differences from the rest of the series.  McGarr is as psychologically acute and as insightful in his interactions as we have come to expect, in addition to being as quick to abandon by-the-book procedure in the name of justice.  Many detectives from the Garda station in Dublin who make the later mysteries so vibrant have not yet been introduced to the series, however, and the women (including McGarr's wife Noreen) tend to be stereotypes (doing a lot of shopping and staying almost completely in the background).  Some ethnic insensitivity, including slurs and racial stereotyping not present in the rest of the series are startling here.  The new title, too, is a mystery--Cummings, the victim, is the Ambassador from the UK to Italy.  He is not an Irish Consul at all.  Mary Whipplein the name of justice.

Kolya Gribshin, a young cameraman working for the Pathe Freres Cinematography Company, arrives at the railway station in Astapovo in 1910 to cover the last days of Count Leo Tolstoy, who is dying in the stationmaster's house. Reporters from all over the world have gathered to record his final moments, but only Gribshin is recording the events on film, a new medium. Gribshin knows that printed word is inaccessible to the illiterate masses, but that film can provide immediate \\"truth\\" by \\"ripping away the veil of lies thrown up by language.\\" As we see Gribshin travel between the darkness of the unlit countryside, where he is staying with an illiterate peasant family, and the artificial, arc-lit brightness of the media-mad town, the author uses vivid imagery from black and white photography to show the contrasts between the lives of illiterate peasants living in darkness and concentrating on their next meal, and the lives of an \\"enlightened\\" media conveying news to the outside world.<br /><br />Like Gribshin, revolutionaries such as Josef Stalin also recognize the power of the visual image to \\"educate\\" illiterate people and shape and control public opinion. Part II takes place nine, war-filled years later, after Russia has faced the horrors of The Great War, the Bolshevik revolution, and the civil war, and Stalin is putting some of these principles into effect through the Commissariat of Enlightenment. Gribshin, now known as Comrade Astapov, is working with him as they attempt to control the masses by controlling visual images--governing theater productions, film projects, and even city planning. Here the imagery of darkness and light, introduced in Part I, becomes a constant motif, as the Commissariat plans to \\"extend the enlightenment to every remote..village in the tundra,\\" destroying churches and the images (icons) within, if necessary. In 1924, the Commissariat's ultimate image-control occurs when the body of Lenin is preserved \\"uncorrupted,\\" allowing the state to display publicly a man who never \\"dies.\\"<br /><br />Kalfus has dared to think big in his debut novel, and his talents are legion. His parallels between black and white photography and his symbols of darkness and light keep the reader constantly aware of the darkness of illiteracy and the light of truth which film can provide. But this is also a cautionary tale about the ability of images to be manipulated and controlled, and all Kalfus's plot elements are subordinated to this single, overwhelming theme. Gribshin, the \\"lens\\" through which the reader views events, never really comes alive, and we do not know his motivations or see him wrestling with inner conflicts. He is, ultimately, a cog in the apparatus of the Commissariat of Enlightenment, a vehicle through whom the author advances his theme, not a thinking human. The novel is very tight, however, with no loose ends, and when Kalfus observes that the West, too, is creating an image-ruled empire by presenting so much imagery and meaning that \\"the sum [becomes] unintelligible,\\" the reader will pause and ponder.

He was a sculptor, not a painter, and Pope Julius II had angered him by postponing his commission to build the Pope's tomb after Michelangelo had bought all the marble.<br />Unpracticed in the difficult technique of fresco, he accepted the commission reluctantly.  Illustrating stories from Genesis in the brightest and most costly pigments available, he created powerful visions of a terrifying and vengeful God in twelve panels, which depict stories of crime and punishment, prophets crying in the wilderness, and doomed sinners facing hanging, beheading, flood, and plague.  Halfway through his commission, Michelangelo decided that his earliest, most tumultuous panels were too &quot;busy,&quot; with too many figures painted too small, and he changed his style significantly.  Beginning with the famous Creation of Adam, he painted simpler, more powerful designs with larger figures, dramatically foreshortening and contorting them.  God, who appears fully robed in classical attire in the early panels, becomes far more vigorous, muscular, and &quot;human&quot; in the later panels, appearing with his chest bare, his poses contorted and foreshortened.  Eventually, he appears to &quot;tumble down&quot; toward the viewer from the ceiling.<br />Full of fascinating, memorable details, King's text tells how Michelangelo constructed the scaffold for the fresco (which did not require him to lie on his back), how his first panel was ruined by the build-up of salts and efflorescence and six weeks' labor had to be laboriously chipped away, how a child in one panel is &quot;making the fig\\"&quot; (an obscene gesture), and how the fingers of God and Adam at the Creation are not the work of Michelangelo or of his assistants but complete restorations.  A helpful &quot;map&quot; of the ceiling allows the reader to locate particular details, though the colored pictures of the ceiling itself, reproduced almost in its entirety, are extremely small.<br />When the ceiling was completed in 1512, the world was dumbstruck, according to Vasari, and Michelangelo's figures were said to surpass those of the ancient Greeks.  Never before had the human form been used with such &quot;astonishing invention and aplomb...or with the brute force of Michelangelo's naked titans.&quot; Writing with enthusiasm and insight, in addition to careful scholarship, King tells the intriguing human story of this artwork, which is as fresh and relevant today as it was when it was painted almost six hundred years ago.

The bloody Siege of Krishnapur in 1857 is the pivot around which the action revolves in this Booker Award-winning novel by J. G. Farrell, but Farrell's focus is less on Krishnapur and the siege than it is on the attitudes and beliefs of the English colonizers who made that siege an inevitability.  He puts these empire-builders under the microscope, then skewers their arrogant and superior attitudes with the rapier of his wit, subjecting them to satire and juxtaposing them and their narrowly focused lives against the realities of the world around them.  Remarkably, he does this with enough subtlety that we can recognize his characters as individuals, rather than total stereotypes, at the same time that we see their absurdity and recognize the damage they have done in their zeal to spread their \\"superior\\" culture.<br />From the opening pages, Farrell builds suspense as the English colony ignores reports of unrest in Barrackpur, Berhampur, and Meerut.  The flirtations of the single women, the amorous attentions of the young men, the boorish and insensitive behavior of the officials, the gossipy whispering of their wives, and the unrelenting efforts to maintain the same society they enjoyed at home--with tea parties, poetry readings, and dances--all attest to their degree of isolation from the world around them.  When violence breaks out in Krishnapur and all the inhabitants take refuge in the colonial Residence, Farrell turns it into a microcosm which illuminates their misplaced values and goals as they interact with each other and face dangers from without--and from within.  The siege continues for more than three months, with bloodshed, disease, starvation, lack of water and medicine, and the summer weather taking their toll.<br />Farrell's dark humor is unparalleled.  Using irony, understatement, and a sense of the absurd, he conveys his disapproval of colonialism without resorting to the harshness of polemics.  By concentrating exclusively on the English in the Residence and not on India's local population (ironically reflecting the approach of the colonizers themselves), he makes their behavior appear ridiculous in its own right, rather than ridiculous in comparison to other cultures.  Mr. Rayne, the Opium Agent, calls the sale of opium, \\"progress.\\"  The Padre cannot understand why the Bible was originally written in an obscure language like Hebrew, rather than English, which is \\"spoken in every corner of every continent.\\"  A dying man offering up his last, heartfelt prayer is told by the Magistrate, \\"Yes, yes, to be sure, don't worry about it.\\"  The heads from a collection of small sculptures of the \\"great minds of Europe\\" are used as deadly explosives when shot becomes scarce.<br />Through his precise imagery, his acute eye for memorable and revealing details, his unerring ear for dialogue, his ability to maintain pace and suspense, and his humor, Farrell creates a historical novel with the enduring qualities which make it as relevant today as it was when published thirty years ago.

When William Adams and his dying crew arrived in Japan in 1600, after nineteen months at sea, they became the first Englishmen ever to set foot on what was, for them, a completely uncharted, unknown land.  The duplicitous Portuguese, who had already set up a trading post there, informed the Japanese that Adams and his men were pirates, and the Japanese imprisoned Adams for six weeks, but they did not crucify him, a common punishment in those days.  Tokugawa Ieyasu, the most important ruler of the country, had been impressed, both with Adams's navigational skills and with his frank admission of dislike of the Portuguese and Jesuits, who were undermining the political and military stability of the Ieyasu's domain.<br />After learning the Japanese language, adopting Japanese customs and dress, and maintaining an unfailingly respectful demeanor, Adams became Ieyasu's interpreter, becoming so valuable to him that he was accorded samurai status and rewarded with a large country estate.  Stranded in Japan with no means of escape, Adams became \\"Japanese.\\"  When English ships finally arrived more than ten years later, Adams helped them establish bases and become trusted trading partners, but he never returned \\"home,\\" living his remaining 23 years in Japan, an honored and much respected man.<br />In this extremely fast-paced historical narrative, Milton uses primary sources to show how Japan came to be \\"discovered,\\" what its values and culture were, and why the intrusion of the Europeans and the lure of trade were eventually rebuffed and the country \\"closed\\" in 1637.  Though he clearly does not agree with the sense of quick justice, the immediate executions, and the brutality carried out by the Japanese in the name of justice, Milton graphically illustrates his admiration and appreciation of their courage and sense of honor, their loyalty and respect for authority, their diligence, their beautifully constructed and aesthetically pleasing gardens, and the grandeur of the palace in Edo (now the Imperial Palace in Tokyo), along with more mundane characteristics, such as their concern for hygiene and bathing and their medical practices (including acupuncture).<br />He sets up dramatic contrasts with the mores of the Europeans, clearly illustrating the much higher level of \\"civilization\\" that existed in Japan without the influence of the west, and it is easy to see why Ieyasu's grandson eventually banned all westerners in order to preserve his own society.  Though Samurai William Adams is the real-life role model for James Clavell's Shogun, I found him far more true to life and interesting in this book.  Neither romanticized nor idealized, he exists here as a man with flaws, often speaking in his own voice.

For those of us who have shared Peter McGarr's life and his many professional challenges as Chief Superintendent of the Murder Squad of the Garda Siochana in Dublin, this novel comes as worthy sequel to Death of an Irish Sinner and a satisfying farewell to McGarr and his associates, with whom we have shared personal and professional tribulations.  With the death of Bartholomew Gill this past summer, this series is at an end, though three out-of-print and hard-to-find early McGarr mysteries are now scheduled for reprinting.<br /><br />This novel takes place two years after Gill's previous novel, Death of an Irish Sinner, in which McGarr and his associates investigated Opus Dei, an extremist Catholic group, and experienced profound changes in their personal lives as a result.  Here we see how McGarr, Hugh Ward, and Ruthie Bresnahan have coped with their changed circumstances and how they have continued their lives.  We also see the return of Charles Stewart Parnell Sweeney, an Agnus Dei supporter and tabloid owner whom McGarr believes is at the heart of much illegal activity in Dublin.  Though this novel is fully able to stand on its own merits, those who have read \\"Sinner\\" first will more fully appreciate the intricacies and revelations in plot and character which this sequel provides.<br /><br />Here McGarr and his squad are called to investigate the theft of the Book of Kells and two other illuminated manuscripts from their hermetically sealed cases at Trinity College.  The manuscripts' importance in Irish Catholic culture, the history of the Celts before the arrival of Christian missionaries, and a growing political party called the New Druids, a gang of former IRA thugs involved in organized crime and the torching of churches, are well detailed and dramatically impact the exciting and unusual plot.  Skinheads, the tabloid press and its excesses, the growing use of Oxycontin, and the political machinations of Irish politicians add contemporary complications to the efforts to retrieve the ancient manuscripts.<br /><br />As always, McGarr remains a practical, no-nonsense investigator, willing to throw the niceties of procedure out the window, if necessary, to achieve justice.  His loyal staff, familiar to  McGarr fans, all appear here, and McGarr's obvious affection for them and for his daughter gives real warmth to this novel.  As McGarr, wounded professionally,  emotionally, and physically wraps up the case, the reader is left with the feeling that though the novels will not continue, that McGarr will continue to work his way out of difficulties, as always, and that, emotionally, he will be OK.  After two years his nemesis has been destroyed, he has made some new friendships, and most tellingly, he has resumed work on his much-loved garden.  Though I'm saddened that the series has ended, I'm confident that McGarr will endure.  Mary Whippleieve the ancient manuscripts.

The ebb and flow of the journal creates its own narrative movement and conveys both the vibrant excitement of Ralegh's days as a young man and the melancholy self-reflection which dominates his old age.  Sensuous descriptions and self-deprecating wit characterize his revelations about his younger days, while the privation and trauma he experiences at the end of his life elicit both sympathy and admiration as he tries to redeem his pride and reputation while walking a tightrope between his mutinous crew, his duplicitous king, and his Spanish enemies.<br />Though very exciting and full of fascinating period detail, Nye's novel is more than a biography, however.  Ralegh tells us that his journal is ultimately a log of three voyages: first, the voyage of the ship Destiny--his present, day to day life; second, the voyage of his history--his past and his fortunes; and, third, the Voyage of Destiny, not his life or his ship but something more than the present, the past, or both together.  This third journey is an internal one, and we observe Ralegh making an effort to achieve deeper understanding, not only of himself, but of the real values which give meaning to man's existence, not the values imposed by society.  He is accompanied, on both his real and his symbolic journey, by an Indian named Guayacunda, a mysterious man whose tribe was wiped out a hundred years earlier, and whose ancestral heritage, language, culture, and even real name have vanished completely, leaving him without the ancestral values he thinks would give meaning to his existence.  As they share their dreams, they search for an understanding of truth which will give value to their separate realities.<br />Multi-leveled and totally satisfying, The Voyage of the Destiny uses the fascinating life of Sir Walter Ralegh to illuminate the search of a thoughtful man for truth and meaning in life beyond what society and its values have imposed, not one truth at the expense of others, but truths which come from a life lived with respect and humility, not with pride or a need for recognition.

Most readers who come to this book will already be familiar with the basic story of poet Sylvia Plath, her doomed marriage to author Ted Hughes, and her suicide at age thirty. In \\"Wintering,\\" one of the Ariel poems, written in the four months before her death in February, 1963, Plath depicts the \\"real and bloody sacrifice\\" of this marriage, according to author Kate Moses, \\"not bodies piled in a mountain pass but her life...the truths fanning out a page at a time.\\"<br />Kate Moses recreates the heart, soul, and psyche of Sylvia Plath in her extraordinary debut novel, Wintering. In preparation for this novel, Moses read virtually every piece of Plath's writing, and most, if not all, of the resource material about Plath. So completely has she distilled this material and incorporated it into the book that the reader feels as if s/he is actually entering the mind of Plath, a Plath who is speaking and reminiscing, conjuring up events, aching, dreaming, and hoping. Astonishingly, Moses achieves this without ever deviating from a third person narrative and without ever speaking as Plath herself.<br />Organizing the novel around the poems which make up the Ariel collection, all written in the last four months of Plath's life, Moses creates a fictional narrative using as chapter titles the names of poems from Ariel, each chapter including some of the imagery from these poems and the subject matter from Plath's life which parallels them. Moses does this naturally, without calling attention to this specific image in that poem, or this event at such and such a point in Plath's life, simply letting the narrative unfold in parallel with the essence and imagery of the poems, a process which feels, remarkably, as if it's unfolding of its own accord. The poems which serve as the impetus to each chapter live on after forty years, continuing to speak to the reader across time and space, and Moses wisely keeps her own narrative in the present tense, suiting her style to that of Plath's poetry. Like the poems, the chapters sieze on images and events in random order, making Moses's achievement in creating a real and memorable narrative out of the creative chaos truly daunting.<br />This not really a novel about Plath, so much as it is a novel in which Plath reveals herself, something she does to even greater effect in her poetry. Because of this, I would strongly urge the reader to find a copy of Plath's Ariel to read in concert with Moses's Wintering. Images from the poems take on added significance when they are repeated and expanded in Moses's narrative; likewise, events from the narrative shed light on some of the intense but sometimes unfocused feeling in the poems. When one knows about the lives of Plath and Ted Hughes and can see the significance in their lives of the repeating images of bees, apples, the moon, food, the earth, and life cycles, their symbolic importance in both the poems and narrative grows, and the reader gains new insights. This is a remarkable novel based on the life and poetry of Sylvia Plath, one which will undoubtedly bring new readers and new appreciation to Plath on the fortieth anniversary of her death at age thirty.

There's nothing and no one to blame for whatever good or bad luck we may have in life.  A person may choose to enjoy the good times, seek out happiness wherever possible, and live life to the fullest or sit back passively and just endure whatever happens.  Logan Mountstuart is one of the former types, a man who recognizes that \\"Every life is both ordinary and extraordinary--it is the respective proportions of those categories that make life appear interesting.\\" But Mountstuart also believes that one can look for and find the extraordinary within the ordinary.<br /><br />Through his personal journals, begun in 1923, when he is seventeen, and continuing to the time of his death in 1991, we come to know Mountstuart intimately, both as an individual, growing and changing, and as an Everyman, someone who participates in and is affected by the seminal events of the 20th century, after World War I.  Because he is a writer, he is able to travel and to know other writers and artists of the period.  When he meets Aldous Huxley, Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, Cyril Connolly, Evelyn Waugh, and Ian Fleming, the reader has the vicarious fun of being there and meeting them, too, since Mountstuart, as a person, appears to be very much like the rest of us.  He buys early paintings by Paul Klee and Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso draws a quick portrait of him and signs it.  He engages in intellectual discussions about Braque, Picasso, James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the Bloomsbury group and keeps the reader aware of literary and artistic achievements of the era.<br /><br />It is in his depiction of the historical moment that Boyd shines.  By describing events through Mountstuart's experience, he is able to give a human face to people and circumstances which have influenced our history, and his choice of small details, often unique, offers a new slant on some familiar events.  Boyd is particularly good at showing simultaneous events--Franco at the gates of Barcelona while Hitler is entering Prague--and his explanation of Neville Chamberlain's giving up of the Sudetenland resonates as an honest and even logical attempt to avoid the desperation of war.  When Ian Fleming, who works for the Secret Service, gets Mountstuart a job in Naval Intelligence, the reader is introduced to the colorful world of the Duke of Windsor, as Mountstuart \\"spies\\" on him to make sure that the Duke's German sympathies do not make him a pawn of the enemy.  Post-war, Mountstuart continues to be involved with the world of artists and writers--and world events--eventually living in Nigeria before retiring to France.<br /><br />For the reader the book is a fast read, despite its length, filled with personal stories and colored by world events.  Mountstuart's belief that life is just the aggregate of one's good luck and bad luck--that things simply happen--leads, of necessity, to a story which is not organized by a hidden, underlying theme.  Befitting its philosophy, it is episodic and random, using the passage of time as its primary framework.  Mountstuart himself accepts what happens to him, though it often saddens him, and does not agonize over what he might have done differently--he does not believe that he could have changed things.  In that regard he remains one-dimensional, in many ways an Everyman for the history of the times.  Fun to read, the book offers a new \\"take\\" on events which have shaped our own times, offering no lessons for the future, other than to live life, despite its ups and downs.  As Mountstuart himself points out, life ultimately is a yo-yo, \\"a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child.\\" Mary Whipplen unique, offers a new slant on some familiar events.

The indescribable heat of summer in Calcutta was especially oppressive for officials of the British Empire, accustomed as they were to cooler weather at home, and when word reached them in September, 1833, that a ship carrying ice from Boston had arrived at the mouth of the Hooghly River, many regarded this as a huge practical joke.  The temperature that September day was over 90 degrees, and any ice from New England would have had to be cut from rivers or ponds at least six months earlier.  No such shipment of ice had ever been attempted before, and the journey from Boston to Calcutta would have taken 120 days, even if the weather had been good.  How could ice possibly survive so long without refrigeration in the hold of a ship?  Nevertheless, fifty tons of ice were soon unloaded and sold to the astonished British inhabitants.<br />For Frederic Tudor the successful shipping of this ice to Calcutta in 1833 was the culmination of a thirty-year dream.  A &quot;diminutive, pig-headed Bostonian,&quot; he had dropped out of school at thirteen and had been seen as a family maverick, always doing something different from what was expected.  Boston financiers refused to help him finance his wild dream of shipping ice to the tropics, and it was Frederic's own family and connections which had to subsidize his initial experiments in 1806, when, at age twenty-two, he made his first shipment of &quot;frozen water&quot; to Martinique.  By selling an easily available, free commodity--ice from New England's frozen rivers and ponds--to other parts of the world, however, Frederic Tudor eventually became one of the great American entrepreneurs of the nineteenth century, ultimately earning a long-term profit of almost a quarter of a million dollars in the Calcutta trade alone.<br />The Frozen Water Trade is a fascinating story of entrepreneurship, engineering, marketing, and Yankee ingenuity, and Weightman's contribution to our understanding of this little known industry is immense. With fascinating illustrations and many old photographs, he documents how Massachusetts ice, if heavily insulated with sawdust, could last in icehouses for several years, and, with similar insulation, could be shipped throughout the world for most of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth.  The author, a British journalist, has gathered information about the unique and almost-forgotten New England ice industry from archives all over the world, turning his research into a truly compelling narrative which is great fun to read.  His ability to highlight details which keep the reader enthralled while learning something new makes his scholarly research accessible to even the most reluctant reader of history.With fascinating illustrations and many old photographs, he documents how Massachusetts ice, if heavily insulated with sawdust, could last in icehouses for several years, and, with similar insulation, could be shipped throughout the world for most of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth.

Originally published in 1970 and newly reprinted, Troubles, the story of Ireland's fight for independence from 1919 - 1922, illuminates the attitudes and insensitivities which made revolution a necessity for the Irish people.  Farrell also, however, focuses on the personal, human costs to the residential Anglo-Irish aristocracy as they find themselves being driven out of their \\"homes.\\"<br />Edward Spencer, a conservative Protestant loyalist, runs a decaying 300-room hotel on the coast of County Wexford.  Regarding himself as a benevolent landowner, he nevertheless demands total submission of his tenants and the signing of a loyalty oath to the King.  His ironically named Majestic Hotel, lacking maintenance during the war and its aftermath, is now too costly to repair.  When British Major Brendan Archer, newly released from hospital, arrives at the Majestic to reintroduce himself to his fianc&eacute;e Angela, daughter of the proprietor, the reader quickly sees the Majestic as the symbol of a faded aristocracy which has outlived its usefulness.  The windows are broken, the roof is leaking, and decorative gewgaws and balconies are hanging loosely, threatening to crash.  Walls, floors, and even ceilings, are swelling and cracking from vegetation run wild, and the hotel's ironically named Imperial Bar is \\"boiling with cats,\\" some of which live inside upholstered chairs and all of which subsist on a diet of rats and mice.  Irish rebels live just outside the hotel's perimeter.<br />With wry humor and a formidable talent for description, Farrell conjures up nightmarish images of life in the hotel, selecting small, vivid details to make the larger thematic picture more real.  Homely details enlarge his canvas and bring his symbolism home to the reader as the rebellion by the Irish poor continues to grow and affect life within the microcosm of the Majestic.  The reader's feeling of claustrophobia and the need to escape builds, and one is not surprised when violence strikes.<br />By injecting small news stories throughout the narrative, Farrell informs the reader about the progress of the rebellion.  He also sets up global parallels, widening his scope by reporting problems in India, South Africa, and other parts of the Empire, along with the Chicago Riots and the Bolshevist attacks in Kiev.  Humor and sometimes satire leaven even the most emotional moments, and Farrell paints his characters with a broad brush which makes one constantly aware of their absurdity.  Clearly delineating the emotional issues behind the drive for Irish independence, Farrell makes the reader see both sides with empathy.  When Edward and the Major finally begin to shoot the Majestic's cats in preparation for a large ball, the reader is prepared for a final round of violence at the Majestic and almost welcomes it.

Such a pragmatic thought would be amoral in most contexts, but this is by no means an ordinary context.  Rob Dewar and his climbing partner, Jamie Matthewson, are clinging by their fingertips to the North Face of the Eiger, one of the most difficult and dangerous of all mountaineering challenges, as this thought takes shape.  Simon Mawer, a former mountaineer himself, recreates not only the drama of this \\"sport\\" but also the personal psyches of the climbers, those inner forces which impel climbers to face \\"Time and Death...the great parameters.\\"  With vibrant sensual descriptions of the mountain, the acts of nature which make the mountain so treacherous, and the agony of the climbing experience, many readers will feel the \\"chicken skin\\" which accompanies vivid writing and turns fiction into a vicarious, personal experience.<br />As exciting as the mountaineering passages are, this is not primarily an adventure story.  With its title connoting the fall of Adam and Eve, the novel deals with huge, complex questions of love and loss, life and death, and truth and responsibility.  The story of whether Jamie's death was accidental or suicide, which seems so straightforward and plot-driven on the surface, becomes far more intricate, as the reader is guided back and forth in time, sharing the lives of Rob and Jamie as young teenagers, the lives and interrelationships of their mothers during World War II, the life and loves of famed mountaineer Guy Matthewson (Jamie's father), and the lives of Rob and Jamie and their lovers when they are in their twenties.<br />Because of the many interrelationships among the characters--love affairs, seductions, pregnancies both planned and unplanned, and even sexual abuse--some of the most sensational events in the novel take place not on the mountainside but in the bedroom.  These scenes often combine the imagery of sex with that of falling, and contrast the subjective reality of love and life with the objective reality posed by danger in the mountains, especially with its death and loss.<br />Heaven and hell, sin and redemption, love and loss, honesty and betrayal, and ultimately life and death are all combined here in a vibrant novel which provides fast action and crises both on the mountain and in the personal lives of the characters over two generations.

Swimming with sea lions, petting giant tortoises, observing birds who have no fear of man...These Edenic images, promoted by tour companies, have led many of us to dream of traveling to the Galapagos Islands someday and walking in the footsteps of Charles Darwin.  But while these images may have been true forty years ago, when small tour boats brought the first tourist-adventurers to the islands, they are far from true today.  In this sad chronicle of the Galapagos, 600 miles from Ecuador, which both claims and governs them, Michael D'Orso documents the devastating changes which have taken place in the past ten years and focuses on the immediate crises of the past three years--crises which threaten the very existence of this irreplaceable natural resource.<br />Several astute and eccentric long-time residents of the islands serve as D'Orso's first person commentators, giving him insight in to the islands' history, explaining how they have changed, and commenting on the ecological disasters now unfolding.  The disasters are many, and they are getting worse, according to D'Orso.  In crisp and unambiguous prose, which he sometimes wields like a truncheon, he excoriates corrupt local officials, judges, and members of the national government.  Many of these, he points out, have financial interests in the oil, fishing, boating, and tourism industries, but they also want to be seen as \\"populist\\" supporters of the poor immigrants who have flooded the Galapagos looking for a piece of the tourist action.  The government, he says, is \\"so horrifically convoluted and corrupt that onlookers have taken to calling this country 'Absurdistan.'\\"<br />The introduction of non-native animal species (rats, feral dogs and cats, pigs, goats, and burros), along with foreign insect life (wasps, roaches, and fire ants), and foreign plants (blackberry, lantana, and wild guava bushes) has already permanently changed the environment on which much of the Galapagos wildlife depends.  Fishing regulations are wantonly ignored, and penalties are not assessed for violations.  Sea cucumbers and other marine life continue to be harvested willy-nilly; fishing boats with long-lines up to 75 miles long continue to hook and kill protected species; and rustbucket oil tankers, never inspected and often owned by highly placed public officials, carry nearly raw petroleum to the islands.  They are already responsible for one major oil spill in the formerly pristine islands.<br />Most threatening, however, is the massive influx of economic refugees from the Ecuadorian mainland who have brought the permanent population to twenty thousand (to be thirty thousand by 2010).  With a lack of fresh water and adequate sanitation, and the immigrants' single-minded determination to tap into the underwater riches of the Galapagos, the ecological disaster is not just threatening--it's already happened.  In a recent uprising, these immigrants physically destroyed the national park and station offices, along with the personal homes of the directors, even ripping out their toilets.<br />D'Orso is passionate in his desire to awaken the world community to the disaster that is taking place before the islands have been totally destroyed.

With his clever title, implying, simultaneously, Gutenberg's justification of his life as it nears its end, his judgment by posterity, and a typesetter's spacing of words so that both left and right margins are even, Morrison sets the tone for this fascinating story about Johann Gutenberg and his development of the first printing press.  Probably the invention which was most responsible for the spread of knowledge from about 1460 till the development of the computer five hundred years later, the printing press was a far more clandestine and potentially subversive invention than one might imagine, and its creation, as Morrison shows, was fraught with peril, financially, legally, and intellectually.<br /><br />Beginning as the first-person recollections of Gutenberg as an old man in 1464, as he thinks about his end-of-life exile in Eltville, not far from Mainz, the novel establishes both Gutenberg's desire to be remembered and his loneliness.  Life for the inventor of something as revolutionary as the printing press has not been easy.  Always in debt, never able to repay his creditors, willing to sacrifice the woman he loves for his ambition, and at the mercy of both the guilds, who have a vested interest in having his invention fail, and the church which fears the potential power of a secular press, Gutenberg's entire life has been a fight.  Creditors constantly take him to court, and he often has to start over.<br /><br />In clear, deceptively simple, and sometimes lyrical prose, Morrison recreates the physical, social, and intellectual environment in which Gutenberg and his acquaintances operate.  Gutenberg's first person recollections are sometimes ingenuous, usually honest, occasionally apologetic, and always driven by his ambition \\"to help words fly as far as doves,\\" by promoting the successful development of his press.<br /><br />Though the actual Johann Gutenberg is something of a mystery, Morrison adds muscle and tooth to the skeletal framework of what is known, creating a character which, if not realistic, is certainly plausible.  Though parts of the book, such as a section about the making of type may not be intriguing to all readers, Morrison sandwiches the technical sections between more personal dramas, like Gutenberg's love interests and the machinations of his enemies to gain his machines.  Homely details add color to what might otherwise be a black and white exposition about an arcane subject, while the archaic and formal language helps to create a sense of time and place.  Every person who loves or buys books celebrates in some way, however distantly, the achievements of Gutenberg.

Dancer is an extraordinary novel, affecting me more profoundly than any other novel I have read in a long time.  Vivid and hard-edged, rather than lyrical and beautiful, it fuses fact and fiction seamlessly, bringing to life ballet star Rudolf Nureyev and the many secret worlds he inhabited.  From his first public performance, when, at the age of five he performed an exuberant dance in a hospital ward for Russian soldiers wounded in World War II, he was considered more athletic than subtle, and as he grew older, his legs were regarded as the source of \\"more violence than grace.\\"<br />Nureyev's \\"wild and feral\\" style of dance meshes perfectly with McCann's prose.  Paralleling the athleticism and drive of Nureyev, McCann's writing is bold and straightforward, characterized by short, powerful, descriptive sentences, often in a simple subject-verb-object pattern.  Avoiding all frills and sentimentality, McCann favors strength over lyricism, and power over prettiness.<br />Through the first person observations of almost two dozen characters who touched Nureyev's life in some way, McCann shines light on Nureyev's personality and his development as a dancer.  His family, teachers, lovers, and even a schoolboy bully, a stilt-walker, and the captain of an airplane, who filed an \\"incident report\\" about his atrocious behavior aboard a plane, all comment on his actions and the choices he makes, personally and professionally, as his career soars.<br />The deprivation and sadness experienced by most of these sensitive observers in their own lives contrasts vividly with the excesses and hedonism of Nureyev's adult life and illuminate, without need for authorial comment, his arrogance and boorishness.  At the same time, however, these multiple viewpoints also humanize Nureyev in many ways by showing the extent to which these other characters are connected by love to others and to their history, while Nureyev becomes a \\"living myth...cared for and coddled and protected by the mythmakers.\\"<br />Filled with intriguing characters, ranging from simple Russian peasants to Andy Warhol, Tennessee Williams, John Lennon, Truman Capote, Mick Jagger, Jimi Hendrix, and the stars of ballet, the novel is a monument to the power of the creative spirit and a testament to the dangers inherent in a life from which all other controls have been removed.  Rudi always \\"tore [a] role open...by the manner in which he presented himself, a sort of hunger turned human.\\"  McCann brings this voracious human to life.

His meetings with cutely named townsfolk--Francis Scott Keister, Tater and Ace Crouch, Jerky Baum, Pecan Flagg, Blowy Cluck, Coolbroth Fronk, and Waldo Beautyrooms--and his discovery of their stories constitute the loose primary plot of this novel, which more closely resembles a quirky collection of short stories than a fully developed novel.  &quot;Eccentricities were valued and cultivated&quot; here, but none of these earthy folk are eccentric enough to want more hog farms.<br />Proulx raises some big issues here, such as the alarming depletion of the water table in the Panhandle, the pollution from oil fields and chemical plants, and the illnesses associated with proximity to hog farms, but she keeps her narrative from becoming polemical by weaving these into other threads about windmill-building, quilting, cock-fighting, social life in the local diner, and plans for the upcoming Barbwire Festival.  She keeps things light and amusing, using the eccentricities of her characters and the setting to spice up her narrative about their not-very-exciting lives.<br />Proulx is a real pro in controlling the pace of the novel.  Whenever it starts to bog down or threaten to become dull, she gives us a new, outrageous name or an amusing digression (like the one about a lightbulb cemetery), or references to Bob's uncle's collection of &quot;art plastic,&quot; or the visit of Bob's ex-con friend who, with some friends, made a recording of flatulent &quot;Rock Hits From Prison.&quot;  All these save the novel from being prairie-flat, as Bob tries to save his job without hurting the people he meets.

Byatt offers huge challenges to the reader in this complex intellectual novel set in a university, a hospital for the insane, a religious commune, an Anti-University, and, finally,  a London TV studio in the late 1960's.  Continuing the lives of characters she has established earlier in Virgin in the Garden, Still Life, and Babel Tower, Byatt spends little time here developing them further or in creating an action-filled plot.  Instead, she concentrates primarily on further developing the themes and philosophical questions which have occupied her earlier novels, using the characters and plot in an almost allegorical sense to illustrate these issues.<br />This is not light entertainment or escape reading.  In the first hundred pages, Byatt introduces approximately forty characters, their roles, and their interrelationships, all of whom figure in the action in the novel.  Frederica Potter, the main character in the previous novels, is the main character here, but other characters also receive close attention.  All of these are deeply concerned with some aspect of memory, learning, creativity, or spirituality as it impacts issues of good and evil, reality, nature, love, and language.<br />Luk Lysgaard-Peacock and Jacqueline Winwar, engaged in pure science, are studying the population genetics of a variety of snail.  Sir Gerard Wijnnobel,  running the University of North Yorkshire, is planning an important Body-Mind Conference in which Hodder Pinsky, famous for cognitive psycho-linguistics and the use of computers to explore \\"the deep structure of linguistic competence\\" will debate Theobald Eichenbaum, a man who differs in his ideas of the learning process and of the growth of societies.  Other characters include an institutionalized, charismatic visionary who practices Manichaeism, a sociologist who goes undercover at a secluded commune, several characters whose lives have been touched by violence, and a man working to destroy the traditional university system.  Frederica herself, as hostess of a television program, \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" believes that the ability to change the world and its politics rests with the language of television, which \\"might take the place of the hearth in 19th century fiction.\\"<br />Challenging and thoughtful, the novel is far more compelling in its ideas than its action, much of which is talked-about, rather than recreated.  Long sections of academic papers, detailed letters between two researchers, the full agenda for the Mind-Body Conference, and descriptions of places and even furnishings severely limit the dramatic tension, however much they may illustrate the themes.  Hugely conceived and richly imagined, this novel never lets up, giving the reader an intellectual workout rare in modern fiction.

As the book opens, an unnamed narrator has returned, after twenty years, to the small Italian village in which he grew up, alone and unloved.  A foundling abandoned on the cathedral steps, the narrator was brought up, for a fee, by a destitute farmer, who treated him more like a workhorse than a person with a soul.  Eventually escaping as a youth to the United States, he worked his way to California, but when an accidental fortune leaves him \\"rich, big, fat, and free,\\" he returns to Gaminella, where he confronts the harsh memories of his childhood and the even harsher wartime events which traumatized the town after he left.<br />In cold, realistic, and unemotional prose, the author alternates bleak memories of the boy who was always an outsider with his observations about his later life in the U.S. and his growing awareness of the atrocities that happened in Gaminella during the war.  As the speaker reconnects with the characters from his past, particularly Nuto, a friend and musician, he notes the sameness of their days, their lack of hope, and the emptiness at the heart of their lives.  The speaker has always believed that \\"a town means not being alone, knowing that in the people, the trees, the soil, there is something of yourself, that even when you're not there it stays and waits for you,\\" a belief which acquires enormous irony as the town's collusion in events during and after the war become clear and as bodies mysteriously surface.<br />In language which is both understated and rigidly controlled, Pavese creates a world as bleak and cold as the moon, a world of secrets, a world in which there seem to be no dreams.  His detached, almost off-handed presentation of horrors sets them in high relief and heightens their impact.  Only when Pavese describes the attraction of the speaker to his employer's two daughters do we get a feeling that there's a heart beating within him, yet he remembers his \\"place,\\" something which makes the daughters' fates doubly affecting and ironic for the reader.  The moon and the bonfires, men and the land, nature and spirit, and ultimately life and death all combine here in a story about a small town, and, Pavese points out, \\"one needs a town, if only for the pleasure of leaving it.\\"  Mary Whippleand ironic for the reader.

When things are really hectic, the crock-pot seems to take on a life of its own, slowing simmering away while the garlic and artichoke chicken, or vegetable curry, or pork roast with apricot/mustard glaze do their own thing, unattended.  And there's nothing quite like coming home after a busy day to the down-home aromas of a dinner already cooked and ready to serve!<br /><br />The Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes, like most Better Homes and Gardens products, is full of reliable, well-tested recipes, but this book seems to have more interesting recipes than the stews one finds in the average crock-pot cookbook.  I was surprised to see a dozen recipes calling for parsnips in place of carrots, for example, while nine include artichoke hearts and six suggest eggplant.  Several recipes are enhanced by a variety of gourmet mushrooms--shiitake, crimini, and oyster mushrooms--while the pasta selections range from mostaccioli to orzo and tortellini.<br /><br />The herbs and spices are well chosen, and most recipes call for more than one seasoning, giving interesting highlights to these dishes.  I did find that I needed to use more of these than the recipes called for in most cases, though there are some curry recipes that call for a hefty tablespoonful of curry powder.  Many of the recipes are heavy on tomatoes, tomato sauce, or tomato paste, and these sometimes seemed overpowering--in the Beef and Borscht Stew, for example--but adjusting downward to suit your own taste is not difficult.<br /><br />Though the book calls its 59 pages of \\"one-dish\\" casserole dinners a \\"bonus,\\" I was mystified as to why these were included here--none of them use the slow cooker at all!  By contrast, only 24 pages of vegetarian main dishes for the crock-pot are included, despite the fact that beans, lentils, and chickpeas are at their best when cooked slowly.  Over all, however, this is a tasty and unusual collection of recipes, many of which are sure to become family favorites.  Mary Whipple	2002-12-04

The paralyzing heat at 5:00 a.m. on a July morning in Toturpuram, on the southeast coast of India, is depicted in intense, sensual imagery from the opening of the novel and becomes a metaphor for the lives of the Rao family.  Three generations living together in a large and decaying house which they cannot afford to maintain, the Raos constantly carp at each other and seethe with long-standing resentments, the emotional temperature rising in concert with the heat, which &quot;[hangs] over the town in long, wet sheets.&quot;<br />Author Badami carefully selects her details to reveal both the realities of her characters' lives and the emotional climate they inhabit. The grande dame and grandmother of the family, Ammayya, is a slightly senile, mean-spirited, and caste-conscious woman, who controls her son Sripathi, her daughter Putti, and her long suffering daughter-in-law Nirmala.  With unusual and homely similes and metaphors,  Badami establishes the tone.  Nirmala is &quot;like a bar of Lifebuoy soap, functional but devoid of all imagination.&quot;  Nirmala and Sripathi are &quot;like a pair of bullock yoked together, endlessly turning the water wheel round and round, eyes bent to the earth.&quot;  The cloudy sky is &quot;curdled milk.&quot;<br />Romance is the heart of the action.  The problems in the marriage of Ammayya and her husband, and of Sripathi and Nirmala are described in detail.  By contrast, Sripathi's daughter Maya has happily married an American and lives in the U.S, but she has been banished from Sripathi's life for defying his wishes.  When Maya and her husband Alan are killed in an accident, leaving an 8-year-old daughter the Raos have never met, they bring this silent and traumatized orphan to India and into their uncertain lives.<br />Predictably, the family learns from each other and begins to communicate, but the events which bring about these changes are either telegraphed early in the book (the fate of Putti, Sripathi's sister, for example) or result from external chance and not from their own actions.  Additionally, the responses of the child to her strange, new environment do not ring true.  Already traumatized and silent, this fragile child faces additional traumas after her arrival in Toturpuram, including some very dramatic ones at the end of the book, yet she seems to suffer no ill effects.  Badami tells us the book is about &quot;the chanciness of existence, the beauty and the hope and the loss that always accompanies life,&quot; themes she has abundantly illustrated, but the warm and fuzzy ending owes more to chance than what we or the characters would expect.

Eliot's bleak vision of the future doesn't even begin to include the gloomy prognostications revealed in this book.  That terrorists will either acquire or develop biological weapons capable of destroying all human life is not just a possibility, it's a probability, as Preston makes abundantly clear in this update on biological weapons development.  This book is the ultimate wake-up call.  Even if you want to sleep after reading this, you may not be able to.<br />Of the several biological weapons which have been under development in the past twenty-five years, smallpox is by far the most lethal and contagious, and irresponsible scientists have genetically engineered it in the past few years to make vaccination useless against it.  Antidotes are unknown because humans are the only hosts for smallpox, and there is no way to run a test study of their efficacy.  Preston points out, \\"It has taken the world twenty years to reach roughly fifty million cases of AIDS.  [A single case of smallpox in an unprotected population] can reach that point in ten to twenty weeks.\\"<br />A massive research and development program for weapons grade smallpox and plague, along with the MIRV missiles and warheads to deliver them abroad, continued, unknown and unmonitored, in the Soviet Union for twenty years after smallpox was officially eradicated in 1978.  The whereabouts of the twenty tons of \\"hot,\\" genetically altered smallpox are currently unknown.  According to a defecting Russian scientist, even the Soviet researchers do not know where it went, but \\"they think it went to North Korea.\\"  Iran and Iraq are also believed to have \\"benefited\\" from this research and to have ongoing, active bioweapons research programs.<br />Preston's focus on the people who are actively fighting potential biological terrorism in this country gives a human face to this frightening prospect, while his descriptions of the individuals who fought for their lives in the world's last cases of smallpox make the horror an all too vivid reality.  His analysis of the anthrax outbreak last year, and the delivery systems which make possible such outbreaks of anthrax, Ebola, and plague are enlightening.  Forcing the reader to acknowledge the reality of a new kind of war, one more lethal and uncontrollable than ever before in history, Preston illuminates the tenuous nature of human life in the twenty-first century.

Groaning under Spanish rule for ten years, ever since England failed to defeat the Spanish Armada in 1588, London citizens have endured the Inquisition, the continued imprisonment of Elizabeth in the Tower of London, the use of Irish barbarians as thugs and enforcers by the Spanish occupiers, and a constant sense of uncertainty born of religious and political turmoil.  The pageantry and spectacle of an auto-da-fe, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, open this novel of alternate history, its horrors made real by the cry of a condemned man, begging for help from an acquaintance in the mob, William Shakespeare, who can do nothing to help, and whose own life is endangered by the man's pitiful appeals.<br /><br />Shakespeare here is a hero at the height of his powers as an actor and playwright.  Sharing one-third of a room in a boarding house, eating and writing by firelight in a pub, dealing with the egos of his acting company, and associating with people from all walks of society--from mysterious characters like Nick Skeres and the \\"witch\\" Cicely Sellis, to Francis Bacon and Lord Burghley (Sir William Cecil)--Shakespeare is the pivot around whom all the action revolves.  In counterpoint to him is Lt. Lope de Vega, an unpublished Spanish playwright, sent to infiltrate Shakespeare's theater and its productions and unmask any traitors to Spanish rule.  When Lord Burghley secretly hires Shakespeare to write a play called Boudicca, planned as a call to the populace to throw off their Spanish yoke and avenge themselves, Shakespeare finds himself in mortal danger--he has also been hired by the Spanish to write a play in honor of Philip II, the dying Spanish king, a play to be produced as soon as Philip dies.  Writing and rehearsing both plays simultaneously with a less than reliable troupe, Shakespeare must walk a fine line to avoid discovery as the mood in London becomes increasingly threatening.<br /><br />Writing in the language and style of the period, author Turtledove casually (and very skillfully) incorporates innumerable Shakespearean quotations into his text, often with humorous intent.  Puns, the off-color wordplay which so often provides comic relief in Shakespeare's plays, dialogue in which characters talk at cross-purposes, and a character who constantly misuses \\"big words,\\" are a delight for any language-lover and admirer of the Bard.  Quotations from Shakespeares Boudicca, which feel like quotations from a new and undiscovered authentic work, are brilliantly crafted from works of the period by Shakespeare and several contemporaries, and the opening night of that play is a stunning literary coup by Turtledove.  All the talk and intrigue do lead to a plot which is a bit thin and short on action--until the bang-up conclusion, filled with arquebuses, rapiers, poleaxes, pikes, and even chamberpots.  Lovers of language will thrill at Turtledove's achievement here, even while wishing, perhaps, that the book were a hundred pages shorter.

As any golfer knows, at least 100 different parts of the golf swing have to be working in concert for the mythical perfect shot to happen--sometimes it does, more often it doesn't.<br />Puett and Apfelbaum make golf's secrets a bit more accessible to the average player by providing a handy reference book for reviewing the basics of all shots and explaining away some of the mysteries.  Straightforward information, broken down into understandable components and accompanied by good drawings and some helpful swing thoughts, offers a frustrated golfer the chance to review the \\"rights\\" of the swing before s/he becomes too frustrated.  Too comprehensive and detailed to be read as a text, it's the perfect book to use as a refresher, to pick up and put down as the need arises, and I've never failed to find some helpful reminder here which makes a difference after a less than wonderful round.<br />Barbara Puett's only teacher was the legendary Harvey Penick, so positive in his approach that she \\"never knew [she] ever did anything wrong in the golf swing.\\" By accentuating the positive and reinforcing the fundamentals, she aims to continue his legacy and is largely successful in this book.  The one thing that this positive philosophy does not address, however, is the fact that golf is a mental game, too, and not all of us are gifted with this inherently upbeat outlook.

With candor and a sense of immediacy, Ha Jin illuminates the pressures and frustrations of Chinese academic life, as seen by Jian Wan, studying for his Ph.D. entrance exams in literature, and by Prof. Yang, his mentor and academic advisor.<br />When Prof. Yang, who is also Jian Wan's future father-in-law, suffers a serious stroke, Jian Wan is the one who must tend him in the hospital.  Half-crazed and irrational, Prof. Yang has moments of lucidity in which he speaks urgently to Jian and offers heartfelt advice, but most often Jian finds him singing songs from his childhood, recalling nightmarish events from the long-buried past, and reliving conversations and recent events which have dramatically affected both his personal relationships and his career.<br />As Jian listens to Prof. Yang, he finds himself examining his own life and goals with a more critical and discerning eye, becoming more and more disillusioned by the injustices he sees all around him, both within the academic community and in the countryside, where poverty is still rampant, the people are utterly powerless, and life is a hopeless search for a way out.<br />Filled with fascinating insights into the nature of life in a totalitarian state, the novel is both moving and enlightening, though it is sometimes didactic.  In clear, efficient prose which avoids all frills and flourishes, Jian tells his story in the first person.  The scope expands as the maunderings of Prof. Yang, along with his symbolic stories and recollections, reveal the history of the Chinese Revolution in personal terms.  Numerous aphorisms constantly remind the reader of the universality of the characters' observations and of the author's themes:  \\"We're all automatons without a soul,\\" \\"Intellect makes life insufferable.

It is 1897, and a motley group of British functionaries is running a concessionary station, only marginally successful, in Ukassa Falls in the Congo Free State, trading and exploring, mapping new areas of the country for further exploration, and using natives to strip minerals from quarries. Individually, however, their primary mission is protecting themselves and their jobs, while keeping an eye on a more lucrative Belgian enterprise across the river and on the slave-trader Hammad, who fancies himself the potential emperor of a future, native-run country. When gunfire signals the arrival of an unexpected visitor, Capt. James Frasier hopes it means the return to British jurisdiction of his friend, Nicholas Frere, who, missing for 51 days in the wilderness, is now in Belgian custody, awaiting trial for killing a native child.<br />At an agonizingly slow pace, Edric builds the tension and an ominous sense of mystery. Though he readily admits his guilt, Frere refuses to defend himself, simply accepting whatever fate has in store. He is almost certain to be turned over to local authorities in Brazzaville for trial and hanging, eventually, but he will not tell anyone, even Frasier, the circumstances of the child's death.<br />Edric's characters come to life through their conversations, conflicts, and actions, rather than through passive descriptions or long biographies. The reader, too, must be active, accumulating important details on his own by observing the action, some of it intense, and participating in it, however reluctantly. Several grim and explicit scenes of atrocity attest to Edric's abhorrence of the mistreatment of indigenous people (the subject also of his novel Elysium, set in Tasmania) and of the destruction of birds and wildlife. His opposition to colonial arrogance, religious fanaticism, mindless bureaucracy, and lock-step adherence to rules and regulations underlies all the action here.<br />Describing the wilderness as \\"more permanent and invincible than anything else I can imagine, something as potent and as indestructible as evil or truth itself,\\" Edric transmutes it into a living force which dramatically affects all its inhabitants. The river, with its traffic, both unites and divides, and when, at flood tide, it scours its banks and destroys pilings and jetties, one cannot help but see parallels with the interrogations of the steadfast Frere. Images of light and dark and echoes of Heart of Darkness are constant, and when \\"the horror\\" is finally revealed at the end, it out-horrors anything Conrad ever dreamed of. With a conclusion full of literary pyrotechnics, this is a chilling recreation of the worst nightmares of colonialism and of man's inhumanity to man.

Setting the novel in the flamboyant atmosphere of pre-revolutionary Havana, where virtually anything can be had at a price, Greene establishes his contrasts and ironies early, creating a hilarious set piece which satirizes both the British government's never-satisfied desire for secrets about foreign political movements and their belief that the most banal of activities constitute threats to national security.<br /><br />Ex-patriot James Wormold is a mild-mannered, marginal businessman and vacuum cleaner salesman, whose spoiled teenage daughter sees herself as part of the equestrian and country club set.

Encouraged to recruit other agents to provide more information (and earn even more money), he chooses names at random from the country club membership list and fabricates personas for them, featuring them in fictionalized little dramas which he churns out and forwards to his \\"handlers.\\"  Always careful to fulfill their expectations exactly, Wormold becomes a more and more important \\"spy,\\" his stories become more creative, his \\"enemies\\" find him and his \\"agents\\" to be dangerous, and his friends and the real people whose names were used as fictional agents begin to turn up dead.<br /><br />Skewering British intelligence for being such willing dupes of a vacuum cleaner salesman who never wanted to be an agent in the first place, Greene betrays both his familiarity with the inner workings of the intelligence service, of which he was once a member, and his rejection of Cold War politics.  In a conclusion which will satisfy everyone who has ever become impatient with political maneuvering, Greene carries the absurdities of power to their limits, orchestrating a grand finale which shows British politicians at their most venal--and most ridiculous.

In this metaphysical and surrealistic novel, Saramago transforms Plato's Allegory of the Cave into a contemporary novel about Cipriano Algor, a man in his sixties who lives in a small village, where he practices his trade as a potter.  Living in tune with nature as he digs clay from the earth, works it with his hands, and fires it in an old, family-owned kiln, Cipriano suddenly finds himself without a livelihood when a mysterious and all-powerful Center rejects his real pottery in favor of longer-lasting plastic. And when Cipriano's real life in his small village is also sacrificed for a totally controlled life in an apartment in the Center, Saramago vividly illustrates how the shadows of artificial things are often mistaken for reality in contemporary society, which does not favor &quot;inquisitive ones,&quot; searching for life's essence.<br />Despite the novel's allegorical structure and didactic message, Saramago creates warm characters who inspire the belief that the good, kind, and sensitive souls of the world can survive, and perhaps triumph on some level.  Love and family matter here, despite Cipriano's belief that he is &quot;merely the largest of the bits of clay [in the yard], a small dry clod that will crumble with the slightest pressure.&quot;  Though he is a molder of clay, he recognizes that there are also forces being exerted on him.<br />Filled with meditations on literature, reading, the creative process, experimentation, and individuality, the novel is both intellectually exciting and very challenging.  Unfortunately, Saramago's style is more daunting than his message.  Omitting all quotation marks, question marks, and the conventions of paragraphing and sentence structure, he challenges the reader to distill the reality of his message from the shadows of his style.<br />Dialogue involving three characters, internal comments on the dialogue by the author, shifts in point of view (even including the dog's view, on occasion), in addition to the on-going developing action, often take place within a single, page-long sentence. Page after page of unbroken, gray type give the reader little &quot;breathing room&quot; and often require rereading, a process reminiscent of Cipriano's working in his pottery and reworking his clay to get it right.

Labeling this book a \\"novel\\" does it as much of a disservice as labeling the main character's son Paolo \\"disabled.\\"  In both cases, the labels are limiting.  And limits are what the book is all about--the limits Prof. Frigerio feels in his ability to help his son, the limits of the public institutions set up to help the family, the limits of everyone's patience, the limits of Frigerio's ability to identify with his son's problems, and his son's limits in helping the world to know him and his abilities.<br />More a memoir about Paolo's childhood than a novel, the book sensitively and uncompromisingly portrays the difficulties of raising a child whose abilities are limited in some areas but normal in others.  A medical mistake at Paolo's birth has left him unable to walk or talk like other children, though he is intelligent, and Professor Frigerio and his wife must take the lead in finding help for him and for themselves.  Early on, a doctor tells Frigerio, \\"These children are born twice.  Their second birth depends on you, on what you are able to give to them.\\"  Taking this to heart, Frigerio works to find therapists, support groups, a nurturing school environment, psychologists, and whatever else it takes to ensure that his son has the best possible chance for success.<br />By turns philosophical, humorous, resentful, and highly sensitive, Frigerio is an acute observer of the reactions of other people, including the medical profession, toward his son, and he speaks to the reader in uncompromising terms.  Intentionally or not, however, he remains at a distance, as much an observer as a participant in his son's life, and his wife and older son Alfredo, who are as directly affected as Frigerio, appear infrequently.  Paolo's brief appearances late in the book, as he deals with a crank phone call from a teenage girl, with a vacation trip, and with an opportunity to appear on stage give the reader an opportunity to know him a bit as a person, rather than as the almost silent inspiration for this book.  The author's dispassionate approach is successful in maintaining the dignity of all the characters, an unusual (and welcome) approach in these tell-all times, though it does come at the expense of some reader involvement.

Weird happenings within an even weirder family combine with the \\"fusty, drunken perfume of Magnolia\\" to fill this southern Gothic novel with bizarre behavior and pervasive threats of death and revenge.  Forces of evil are at work, according to Charlotte Cleve, a mother of three, who believes the mysterious hanging death of her nine-year-old son Robin resulted because she changed her traditional Mother's Day celebration from noon to six o'clock on the day he died.<br />Twelve years after Robin's death, his fiercely independent sister Harriet, now twelve herself, investigates the circumstances of Robin's death, bent on identifying and punishing his murderer.  Bearing little resemblance to Scout, the endearing heroine of To Kill a Mockingbird, single-minded Harriet recognizes no limits and is willing to do anything, including using a gun, to accomplish her goals. Confronting ex-cons who run a crystal meth lab, ditsy great-aunts who know what's \\"right,\\" redneck children who lurk in the bushes, two snake-handling preachers, a mother who turns her house into a maze filled with piles of rotting, old newspapers, and a sister who sleeps seventeen hours a day (\\"I only get bored when I'm awake,\\" she says), Harriet takes more comfort from her plans for revenge than from traditional southern values.<br />Tartt's themes of death and punishment achieve some sense of universality through her use of numerous symbols and parallels, often with animals, but these are frequently sentimental. The euthanasia of a beloved pet cat; Harriet's accidental killing of a blackbird stuck in tar, snakes handled by hillbilly preachers; and the vicious dogs of the Ratliff family haunt the narrative.  The old family home is called Tribulation; Harriet's heroes are Sherlock Holmes, Harry Houdini, and Captain Scott, the explorer; and she spends much of the novel looking for a pair of red gloves given to her by her black housekeeper, whom she loves but treats with casual cruelty.<br />The plot strains credulity, even for southern Gothic, and Harriet, as a twelve-year-old protagonist, is too wild and out-of-control to inspire much empathy as a character.  The narrative focus of the novel gets lost, and many episodes, only peripherally related to the original search for justice, seem to become narrative ends in themselves.  Filled with dense imagery and melodrama, this novel will appeal to those looking for fast escape reading.

No matter where you come from, Hassler's Staggerford feels like home, and his characters like the old friends (and nemeses) you probably grew up with.  With an unerring eye for the universally mundane, and an ear for the commonplaces we all expect in conversations with old friends, Hassler brings Staggerford, Minnesota, to life during the &quot;flood of the century,&quot; as the Badbattle River overflows and inundates the town one spring.<br />There's nothing like a good emergency to inspire Agatha McGee, the 80-year-old spinster who taught most of Staggerford at St. Isidore's School.  Ignoring ill health, she takes charge among her neighbors and friends, inviting seven unlikely people to ride out the storm in her house on the highest land along the river.  With warmth and great good humor, Hassler recreates their long-standing friendships and loyalties, along with the gossip, resentments, and long memories which make life in any small town a community activity.<br />For Hassler's long-time readers, this novel is like a reunion--everyone in the old gang, from all the previous novels, is here, older, perhaps, but still going strong.  Beverly Bingham, the sad teenager who found refuge with Agatha in Hassler's first novel (Staggerford) returns as the mature mother of a schizophrenic son.  Lolly Edwards, the radio gossip who held her own memorial service so that she could hear what people would say about her (The Dean's List) and her son, Leland, now President of Rookery State (Rookery Blues), are back, along with Fr. Frank Healy (North of Hope).  Agatha's shy nephew Frank Lopat; her best friend, ditzy Lillian Kite, and her termagant daughter, Imogene; and Janet Raft Meers, the young woman who looks after her; and many others, continue their stories here, along with several new characters.<br />The characters are believable, the dialogue is pitch perfect, and the community dynamics show Hassler's sensitivity to and love for the subtleties of small town life. The behavior of the characters is completely consistent with their personalities as we know them, and their ability to remain individuals while also acting for the good of the community is one of Hassler's greatest achievements.  Hassler is careful to explain past histories here so that new readers can enjoy the novel almost as much as devotees of the previous novels, but new readers are urged to start with one of the earlier novels first in order to enjoy this one and its characters more fully.

This whimsical, light comedy of \\"ancient Irish revolutionaries and mad archangels, all having [weird] fits,\\" is just made for the screen!  Telling the tale of famed Irish revolutionary Michael Collins, \\"The Big Fellow,\\" who died in an ambush ten days after becoming head of the Irish Republic in 1922, McEvoy improbably brings him to life in New York City in the present day.  Having spent these years since his death in Purgatory, Collins is the beneficiary of some \\"pull\\" by Sean O'Connell and Padraic Pearse with the Archangel Michael, who gives Collins one chance, at last, to make it into heaven.  All he has to do is perform one earthly deed--spring Martin Twomey, an innocent man, from jail and prevent his deportation by INS to face trumped-up murder charges Britain.<br /><br />Although author McEvoy includes a serious and helpful \\"Fenian's Who's Who,\\" along with a prologue explaining the history of the Irish revolution, this is a far-from-serious, slapstick novel, relying on all the tried and true tricks of comic film for effect.  Collins in New York is a man out of time, unfamiliar with everything that has happened in the world since 1922, allowing McEvoy to poke fun at his ignorance of modern inventions, clothing styles, politics and World War II, and changes in religion and social behavior.  Throw-away lines about JFK, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Mayor Koch, about the fact that Collins looks like Liam Neeson (who played Collins in the recent film), and about Michael Collins, the U.S. astronaut, are only a few of the comic references which keep this story hopping.<br /><br />As is characteristic of broad comedy, much of the humor relies on stereotypes--the Bing Crosby-type priest, the huge and good-hearted bartender, the rapacious double agent, the down-on-her-luck vagrant with a heart of gold, the arrogant and boozing British official with a secret life, and even the archangel Michael appearing in thunderclaps and whirlwinds to remind Michael Collins of his mission.  The humor is far more visual than literary, and the book is loaded with sentimentality, easy aphorisms, and moralizing, something one is more likely to accept in a light-humored film (where a character can raise an eyebrow when things sound preachy) than in a novel.  As long as a reader can accept the premise--that a revolutionary like Collins, responsible for the execution of the entire British secret service in Dublin--is (like Colonel Klink on Hogan's Heroes) an appropriate subject for humor, the reader will be mightily entertained by this fast-paced spoof.

Despite the fact that he covered 200,000 miles, \\"explored more of the earth's surface than anyone in history,\\" and redrew the map of the world, Cook remains a relatively obscure historical figure, even in his native land, and is the subject of legend, much of it fanciful, in the places he charted.  In celebrating Cook's achievements, analyzing the man and his values, and evaluating his influence, Horwitz attempts to put Cook's discoveries into their rightful perspective.<br /><br />Accompanied by Roger Williamson, an Aussie free spirit dedicated to wine, women, and fun, author Horwitz travels to those places \\"discovered\\" by Captain Cook, describing Cook's reception by indigenous cultures, and observing the cultures as they exist today--in virtually all cases, despoiled by contact with the \\"civilized\\" world.  Tahiti, Bora Bora, New Zealand, Australia, Tonga, the Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii, before and after western contact, are presented in detail, using Capt. Cook's own journals, the journals of naturalist Joseph Banks (who accompanied him on his important first voyage), drawings by Cook's artists, and the research of Cook biographer John Beaglehole to establish the pre-contact cultures.  Horwitz's personal observations, interviews with local inhabitants, and on-site research assess the lasting effects.<br /><br />Cook becomes accessible as a personality because of his friendship with Banks, who often served as his sounding board, and, it appears, loosened him up a bit.  Naturally expansive and enthusiastic, and uninhibited by responsibilities and the sense of morality which seemed to dominate Cook, Banks serves as a foil to Cook.  While Cook conscientiously records the contours of islands, Banks is far more interested in getting to know the local residents.  Horwitz's friend Williamson, on the trip primarily for fun, not scholarship, serves the same purpose in Horwitz's book, creating humorous diversions both for Horwitz and the reader and spicing up Horwitz's serious research.<br /><br />Fascinating as a biography of the complex Capt. Cook, as a lively record of the age of exploration, as a modern adventure to \\"romantic\\" south Pacific islands, and as research on cultural anthropology, this is an exhilarating and fast-paced narrative, one which will reward careful reading and cause the reader to examine the dubious results of \\"civilization.\\"  Horwitz obviously enjoyed his research, and the reader will, too, however vicariously.

This powerful novel of identity, both personal and cultural, spans several generations and moves through Africa, New Orleans, and New York, deftly integrating the personal sufferings of the characters with the music which sets them free--jazz.  An African legend establishes at the beginning of the novel the complex interrelationships between music, love, sorrow, spells (be they from magic, dreams, drugs, or drink) and tragic fate.  As later characters face the same complex of forces and fates in their own generations, \\"the American Negro experience\\" is dramatically revealed, along with the emotional release which comes with the birth of blues and jazz.<br /><br />Telling the story of Lick Holden, \\"the greatest...horn man that was ever lost to history,\\" Neate recreates the early days of New Orleans jazz in Storyville, with characters like Buddy Bolden, Fate Marable, Louis \\"Dipper\\" Armstrong, Kid Ory, and King Oliver. Whenever one of these legends performed, he \\"felt his music transcend his present...[and] he knew that he was more than a disempowered, dislocated, disrespected third generation slave.\\"  For Lick Holden, \\"the horn was his prayer voice and there was...God in his music.\\"<br /><br />Crafting the novel in the pattern of the twelve bar blues, described in the opening pages, Neate presents each half of the novel in twelve chapters, which move back and forth and around in time and location, from the early 1900's to the present, from Africa to New Orleans, New York, and Chicago.  Lick's life story and his long love of Sylvie intertwines with the African legend at the beginning of the novel and with a present-day search by Sylvia DiNapoli, a black woman in her mid-forties, for her past.  An additional contemporary setting in Africa, involving later generations of the characters from the opening legend, offers a counterpoint to Sylvia's search, and like a jazz motif, becomes part of it. The dominant themes of fate and choice, love and sorrow, dreams and tragedy, guilt and redemption weave through all the personal stories, as each generation expresses its soul in music--\\"which set [their] blackness free.\\"<br /><br />Powerfully drawn episodes, full of vitality and color, pulsate with the kind of detail which makes characters and locations simultaneously unique and universal.  The \\"coincidences\\" at the conclusion are foreshadowed throughout, both by the twelve-bar pattern of the narrative development and by the repetitions in the lifestyles and choices of the characters.

In this absorbing and multi-layered can't-put-it-downer, Collins provides the reader with innumerable vantage points from which to view the lives of Frank Cassidy and his quirky and dysfunctional family, to see life as Frank sees it, and to watch in fascination as each family member grows and changes.  Stuck by circumstance and lack of opportunity at the bottom rung of the economic ladder, Frank, \\"a scavenger at the edge of existence,\\" Honey, and their children leave New Jersey in a series of stolen cars for the Upper Michigan Peninsula, as soon as they discover that Frank's uncle, who raised him, has died on his farm.  An inheritance, however small, could change their lives.<br />A mystery lies at the heart of the novel.  Frank's parents died in a fire when he was five, and, through hypnosis and, eventually, treatment for a breakdown, he's come to believe that he and his uncle were both involved in these deaths in some way.  Returning to \\"a town nobody returns to unless under tragic circumstances,\\" Frank starts digging into the past and disrupting lives.<br />On the level of plot alone, the novel is full of excitement, enhanced by vibrant characters with whom one feels great empathy as they wrestle against the circumstances that keep them down, bending the rules, if not breaking them, whenever they can. The vividly described, remote farm environment, the mores of the local community, and the treacherous winter weather generate much of the action and interaction.  Collins expands the scope of the novel well beyond plot and melodrama, however, by recreating the ambience of the 1970's and using Richard Nixon, Watergate, and Jim Jones as thematic motifs which recur throughout the novel and show parallels with his characters and story.<br /><br />As the title indicates, this is also a novel with religious parallels, so well integrated that many readers may not even notice them, at first.  The Prodigal Son, the Book of Job, and the story of Lot's wife are fairly obvious, while the Parable of the Loaves and Fishes (in this case a trick in which one hits a Coke machine at the right moment to get both the Coke and the money back) may be less so.  References to good and evil, hope and despair, death and rebirth, and salvation and resurrection occur throughout, as Frank and his family adapt to life in a small town, try to cope with their internal conflicts, and ultimately to come out ahead.<br />A beautifully developed novel of big ideas, The Resurrectionists is engaging and, to me, totally satisfying on every level.  Though I enjoyed Collins's Keepers of Truth, I liked this novel even better--it's one of my favorites of the year.

(3.5 stars) Imagine, for a moment, that western civilization not only did not evolve as we know it today, but that, in fact, it never existed at all.  This intriguing speculation is the underlying premise of a novel which forces the reader to rethink all the assumptions with which we habitually evaluate the past--the \\"givens\\" through which we interpret events.  Robinson presupposes that virtually all the inhabitants of Europe were wiped out by a plague in the fourteenth century and the continent left uninhabited.  But this was not the end of the world, nor was it the end of learning and \\"progress.\\"  Life continued, but all the intellectual developments arose out of the Muslim states, China, India, and eventually the North America of the Native Americans.<br /><br />Alternating workman-like prose with prose \\"poems\\" and, occasionally, stories and legends, Robinson crafts a fast-paced history of a different world, creating two characters who appear and reappear in different incarnations from 783 a. H. (after Hegira), roughly the late 14th century, to the present day.  Keeping basically the same personalities, regardless of their incarnations, Bold Bardash (Bihari, Bistami, Butterfly, Bahram, etc.) and Kyu (Kokila, Kya, Katima, Kheim, etc.) travel through time, experiencing life under the Mongols, Indians, early Chinese emperors, Muslim leaders, and Japanese sailors during their discovery of the New World.<br /><br />Some episodes are much more vivid, and ultimately more enlightening, than others, and as the cultures are brought to life, along with their different views of man's place in the universe, Robinson shows how the desire to impose one's own religion or beliefs on the outside world is the basis of some of the cruelest violence throughout history.  Ultimately, the Great War, lasting sixty-seven years and costing one billion lives, pits the rulers of Dar al-Islam against the Travancori League (India), China, and the Hodenosaunee League (Native America).<br /><br />While it is intriguing to contemplate alternative history, Robinson's goal--the alternative history of the entire world for the past six hundred years is an enormous subject, one which, because of its breadth and scope seems to lose focus and pace as the book progresses.  And while the reincarnations of Bold and Kyu help to bridge many gaps and avoid some problems of character development, the device becomes a bit tired by the end.  Still, in showing us how all aspects of our current knowledge might have developed in other societies if western civilization had not existed, Robinson goes a long way toward reducing intellectual arrogance and increasing empathy for other cultures.  Despite the book's limitations, Robinson succeeds in creating an alternative history which offers much food for thought and considerable narrative excitement.

Recreating the traumas that Third World citizens face every day, Djaout offers vivid pictures of their complex but fragile lives.  Here, in an unnamed country, presumably Algeria, government bureaucrats are concerned only with protecting themselves, their jobs, and their kickbacks, their fear of change so ingrained that any hope of modernization and real progress is squelched.  The average citizen tries to remain anonymous, making do in a society which does not reward excellence.

Whether she is \\"Walking with the Great Apes,\\" canoeing the Sundarbans for tigers, or, in this case, exploring Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos seeking the golden moon bear, Sy Montgomery single-mindedly seeks out rare animals, refusing to limit her searches to \\"safe\\" areas.  Facing land-mines in Cambodia, warring tribes of \\"drug-selling headhunters\\" on the Thai border with Myanmar (Burma), poachers in Laos, and a poverty-stricken Laotian society in which people eat virtually all insect and animal life (including bats, rats, and animal placentas), Montgomery attempts to track down a golden bear with Mickey-Mouse-type ears and a black mane, thought to be a variety of moon bear, and unlike any other bear known to science, possibly \\"the scientific finding of a lifetime.\\"<br /><br />Frustrated by a search in which all the animals she seeks are found in cages in the city or living, confined, in remote refuges and zoos, Montgomery tries to identify and find the bears' native habitats, describing the bears' importance in local culture and the myths and legends which have grown up around them.  Through interviews with native wildlife experts, local tribes, and even Hmong refugees in Skokie, Illinois, she tries to capture their fading memories of bear types to see if there is, in fact, an unknown bear species.<br /><br />A writer, rather than a hard scientist, Montgomery is often lyrical in her descriptions, romantic (some would say excessively so) in her observations and imagery: \\"Emerging from the deathly still of hibernation, out of gravelike dens, bears rise, Christlike from the dead.\\"  She tends to anthropomorphize her subjects--a bear \\"reminded me of a street waif,\\" a civet \\"stared at us defiantly,\\" and a pleated gibbon was \\"stunned and hopeless.\\"  Overcome by emotion at one point, she enters a cage of bears at feeding time because she \\"wanted to make them an offering, to be part of an exchange of food for blessing.\\"<br /><br />Less clearly focused and concentrated than her other books, Search for the Golden Moon Bear becomes less a search than a travelogue by the midpoint of Montgomery's book, as she and the scientists and aides who accompany her continue their explorations into remote and dangerous areas of southeast Asia.

A mystery which should keep even the most jaded reader intrigued and involved, Dark Matter begins like a typical Sherlock Holmes mystery, with Sir Isaac Newton interviewing Christopher Ellis to work as his assistant as Warden of the Royal Mint, and deducing all manner of personal information from clues he notices on Ellis's person.<br /><br />But here the similarities end.  The murders which Newton and Ellis soon investigate are part of a much broader picture of intrigue than anything in the Sherlock Holmes series, here involving the recoinage of England's silver and gold, battles against smugglers and counterfeiters, the enmity and warfare between England and France, the continuing hatred between Catholics and Protestants in both countries, the missing treasure of the Knights Templar, and alchemy, astronomy, scientific study, and even the ciphers developed a hundred years earlier by Rene Descartes.<br /><br />Newton remains throughout the novel as a somewhat mysterious character, formal, scholarly, honest, and industrious, but personally remote, even from his niece, with whom he lives.  Ellis, on the other hand, quickly engages the reader with his innate charm and physicality--he's an ebullient 20-year-old, \\"...\\"<br /><br />As this surprisingly compatible team investigates several grotesquely staged murders, while battling the political status quo at the Tower of London, where the Mint is located, the reader is taken on a wide-ranging and colorful tour of the city from its royal houses to its bawdy houses, its churches to its opium dens, and its bookshops to its prisons.  An informer with a steel nose, a man half eaten by a lion in the Tower, a goldsmith smuggling silver to France, and real characters, such as the vulgar Daniel Defoe and the likeable Samuel Pepys, keep the reader constantly engaged.<br /><br />The author cleverly and unobtrusively provides several recaps of the action and what it means within the context of the narrative, just at the point when the story may become a bit confusing, clearly remembering that the reader may be unfamiliar with this period and its history.

Life was cheap in New York City in 1863, the setting for this powerfully realized, naturalistic novel.  For $ a man who did not want to fight in the Civil War could hire another man to take his place, an option available only to the wealthy, the poor, of necessity, obeying the draft.  Living in the city's fetid back alleys, where pigs ran wild, children sailed paper boats in rivers of blood running out of butcheries, and horses and dogs rotted where they fell, the mainly Irish poor finally reached their limits and exploded in murderous rage.  During three of the hottest days in July, 1863, they rioted, bludgeoning any man, woman, or child who got in their way, saving their particular wrath for blacks, whom they blamed for the war--innocent neighbors who were stripped, set on fire, and hanged from lamp posts.<br /><br />The \\"Draft Riots,\\" the people who participated in them, the conditions which spawned them, and the politicians, churchmen, and police who either did not or could not stop them, are fully examined in this huge novel, filled with ugliness and offering little in the way of hope.<br /><br />These days of anarchy, with all their depredations, are recreated through the stories and points of view of seven characters--Ruth Dove, who survived the Irish potato famine (depicted in horrifying background detail) and her husband Billy, a former slave;  Dangerous Johnny Dolan, Ruth's abusive and jealous former lover;  Johnny's sister, Deirdre Dolan O'Kane, and her husband Tom, who participates in the battles of Fredericksburg and Gettysburg;  and newspaper hack, Herbert Willis Robinson, who follows the rioters around the city while worrying about his lover Maddy, a woman who became a prostitute when he refused to give her entree into his world.<br /><br />Baker is a master of odd, and apparently accurate, details from the period, devoting many pages to wide-ranging background material, and developing his characters just enough to make the plot seem plausible, despite its remarkable coincidences, its frequent telegraphing of the action, and an ending which leaves no loose ends.  The picture of humanity here is very dark, with details sometimes appearing to be inserted for their shock value. The mob's ghoulish delight in torture and mayhem is sustained for over 600 pages, an experience which makes the reader long for a moment or two of levity.

Both suspenseful and revelatory, Moore's story of the search for 70-year-old Maurice Brossard, a man who believes he acted righteously when he killed fourteen Jews chosen at random in Dombey, France, during World War II, reveals as much about the character of France and Frenchmen as it does about the man who killed in her name.  Maurice Brossard, as a young man, was a member of the milice, an active supporter of Marshall Petain and his Vichy government.  Believing that the Resistance was anti-France,  consisting primarily of Communists intent upon destroying the country's traditional values, specifically the old Catholic values of the conservative church, Brossard was, for many years, afforded protection from prosecution.  A resident guest in numerous abbeys and convents, he was financially supported by conservative groups representing both the church and political factions, eventually receiving a pardon by the French President.<br /><br />Now, accused of crimes against humanity, he is on the run, this time not knowing who it is who hunts him.  A multitude of brotherhoods, many of them secret, are revealed in all their nefarious dealings as they seek to restore the glorious heritage they believe to be at the very heart of French civilization.  Conservative priests, supporters of Pope Pius XII's position during the war, schismatic groups, political organizations opposed to the chauvinism of DeGaulle, police who have crimes of their own to hide, and politicians whose own pasts are far from innocent all have an interest in Brossard`s life--or death.  Additionally, Jewish groups, who feel that justice has not been done, seek retribution.<br /><br />The suspense here is palpable as various groups seek Brossard for their own ends, and the story is full of action, betrayal, and additional murders.  What gives this novel depth is that each group fully justifies their positions on ethical, moral, and philosophical grounds.  Moore presents a complex story of the complex French character in ways which are unique, and he does so within a framework of a fast-paced, intellectually challenging pursuit.

This old-fashioned saga of eighty years in a family's life, from the Partition of Ireland in 1921 to the present, differs from other such novels in that it is very short, a mere 228 pages, packed with intimate character portrayals and enough heartache to fill a book three times its size.  Like many other authors who excel at short story writing, Trevor compresses images and scenes, and his well honed ability to make a few words do the work of dozens allows him to create a book which is simultaneously intensely personal and broad in its time horizon.<br /><br />The Everard Gault family, Protestant estate owners in the south of Ireland, does not want to join the exodus of other Protestant families leaving Ireland for England in 1921.  When three young men sneak up to their house with gasoline one night, intent on burning them out, Capt. Gault, in an action reminiscent of the precipitating event of a Greek tragedy, fires a warning shot, accidentally wounding one of the young men and setting in motion a series of actions and reactions which ultimately affect the lives of nearly a dozen other people over the course of eighty years.  His nine-year-old daughter Lucy runs away into the hills. Gault and his wife, finding evidence which \\"proves\\" that she has drowned instead, leave for Europe in despair.  A seriously injured and almost starving Lucy is eventually found, but her parents are not, leaving her to be brought up in the abandoned house by two loving servants.  A child who blames herself entirely for her heartsick parents' departure, Lucy is unable to accept love or forgiveness until she can atone for her childish mistake of running away.<br /><br />In the hands of a lesser writer, the calamities, the \\"almost contacts\\" between Lucy and her parents, the coincidences, and the unremitting self-sacrifice of Lucy, even in the face of true love, might lead one to consider this just another melodrama.  In the hands of Trevor, however, the narrative is developed so carefully, the mood is sustained so effectively, and the details are so well selected that the reader is quickly caught up in the story and its suspense, and willingly follows along, even when the developing action seems to defy common sense.  Trevor makes the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" a real pleasure here.

The search for dinosaur fossils amid sandstorms and desert heat is anything but dry in this lively story of the excavation in January, 2000, of a site in the western Egyptian desert, partially excavated by Ernst Stromer in 1911, but untouched since then.  Nothdurft, a professional writer, working in concert with Josh Smith, the young paleontologist who was the team leader of the January, 2000, dig, tells the stories of both the 1911 and the 2000 excavations, along with the fossil discoveries made by each group.<br /><br />Stromer, a German aristocrat and meticulous paleontologist, found the fossils of four unique, 95-million-year-old dinosaurs in Bahariya in 1911, spent twenty years analyzing them, and then supervised the fossils' installation at the Bavarian State College of Paleontology and Historical Geology in Munich.  In April, 1944, everything was lost in the allied bombing of Munich.  The story of Stromer's efforts, now almost forgotten, alternates with that of Smith and his group of young Ph.D's from the University of Pennsylvania, who hope to find additional fossils in the same area in January, 2000.<br /><br />Financed by a Los Angeles film company making a documentary, the crew ultimately unearths a 80 - 100 ton new dinosaur species, discovering in the process that at least two other equally gigantic dinosaur species shared space with this titan.  How this desert area could support three such huge species becomes the question for the geologists on the trip, a mystery which Nothdurft imbues with immediacy and great excitement as they examine the confusing strata for clues.<br /><br />Nothdurft excels in characterizing the paleontologists and geologists so that the reader can easily imagine participating in the dig along with them.  His narrative is fast-paced and full of memorable detail--depictions of Bahariya, with its 130-degree heat and its scorpions, the excitement of the young researchers as they uncover new fossils, and their puzzlement at the paradoxes which unfold.  With likeable researchers, and photos and drawings which make their discoveries come alive, this is a wonderful introduction to the challenges of on-site research, the scientific methods of the crew, and the respect with which they regard the past.  Ultimately, even the almost-forgotten Ernst Stromer shares in their discoveries.

As Mistry makes clear in this novel, the \\"one important story [is] of youth, and loss, and yearning for redemption...Just the details are different.\\"  With these themes as the bedrock of his story, he depicts the world of a multigenerational Parsi family in Bombay, their world changed forever when Nariman Vakeel, a 79-year-old former professor and sufferer from Parkinson's disease, falls and breaks his leg, effectively ending any possibility of an independent life.  His stepchildren, Coomy  and Jal, quickly dump Nariman in the two-room apartment of their younger half-sister, Roxana Chenoy, her husband Yezad, and two sons, supposedly for only three weeks, while his leg heals.  Beset with financial problems, lack of space, and resentment of Coomy and Jal, who remain in their father's 7-room apartment, the family does its best, but tensions rise and slowly erode their relationships, precipitating intense personal crises for each family member.<br /><br />Concentrating more on the world writ small than on the broader, more expansive views of A Fine Balance, Mistry creates a number of vibrant and fully drawn characters.  Nariman Vakeel, recalling his dreams and disappointments, his 11-year love for Lucy Braganza, and his disastrous arranged marriage, is touching in his neediness and in his apologetic helplessness.  His grandchildren delight in his stories and seek ways to help out; Roxana makes do in every way possible, tending to Nariman's most personal needs; and Yezad, frustrated by the lack of financial support from Coomy and Jal and a job in which he is underpaid, feels jealous of the old man's claims on Roxana.  Mistry's dialogue, the subtle and not-so-subtle undercurrents it reflects, the often humorous interactions, the honest but naïve motivations of some of the characters, and the meticulously depicted and subtle decline of the family are the work of a master.<br /><br />The one jarring note for me was the use of Shiv Sena, a fanatic political/religious group, as a motif thoughout the novel, their threats, extortion, violence, and fundamentalist rhetoric intruding periodically (and often dramatically) on the lives of the characters. While this obviously broadens the scope of the novel and offers a context in which to evaluate Coomy's religiosity, the fears of small businessmen like Yezad and his boss, and Yezad's eventual conflicts with one of his sons, it felt contrived to me, too strong and too obvious in what is otherwise a novel of more subtle interactions.

For over 140 days in 1522, the aging Philippe Villiers de L'Isle Adam, Grand Master of the Knights of St. John Hospitaller, faced the 26-year-old Sulieman the Magnificent, new sultan of the Ottoman Turks in a life-or-death struggle for the heavily fortified island of Rhodes.  The Knights had considered it their home for 200 years and had used it, first, as a base from which to lead Crusades to the Holy Land, and later, to disrupt Ottoman shipping in the eastern Mediterranean.  Sulieman, armed with 100,000 soldiers, 300 warships, a crew of engineers prepared to tunnel under walls, and unlimited supplies from the nearby Turkish mainland, faced a mere 5000 knights, their supplies limited, with little hope of aid from Europe, which was engaged in its own wars.<br /><br />Goodman excels in recreating the ambience of Sulieman's court and army camp, contrasting it with the single-minded piety of the knights in their fortress.  His depiction of the tactical maneuvering by both sides during the 140-day siege are clear and easy to follow, and the characters are individualized enough that the reader will have no difficulty in keeping track of who is who.  Gruesome depictions of people being beheaded, slashed, drawn and quartered, covered with boiling oil, broken on the rack, and slip-sliding in each other's gore share space with two tender love stories, giving some sense of reality to characters who are otherwise dedicated to inflicting pain and mayhem.<br /><br />Though the battle scenes are well drawn, the author's style in other places is sometimes a bit awkward.  Using short, simple sentences, Goodman often gives definitions and explains vocabulary in a textbook-like manner.  Historical background, which is inserted into the story and sometimes even repeated, and a large amount of detail, some of it having questionable relevance, slow down the narrative at the beginning.  Dialogue is sometimes stilted and even preachy.

The Bondwoman's Narrative is an historical artifact, a significant contribution to the literature of the pre-Civil War United States and, most especially, to African-American history and culture.  Rating such a relic as if it were a modern publication denies it the accord it deserves as a newly discovered record of the misery endured by humans who were bought and sold in the last years of slavery.<br /><br />Telling the story of Hannah Crafts, a literate house slave, the author, convincingly identified by editor Gates as a black woman, pens a sentimental melodrama, a genre popular at the time, to describe in detail the life of a slave.  Leading a somewhat less miserable life than a field hand, Hannah reveals her never-ending duties, her treatment and mistreatment by wives of the owners, her observations on the sexual abuse of women by owners, and her firsthand knowledge of venal slave traders and unscrupulous lawyers.  These accounts are remarkable for their immediacy and human drama.<br /><br />The novel's narrative flow, as one traumatic episode after another builds to a climax, is clearly planned. Characters from one part of the novel appear and reappear in other parts, and sentimental motifs, common to the genre, repeat--the personification of a linden tree which affects several generations, curses visited on people and carried out over time, coincidences which strain credibility, and the hand of providence helping the pious Hannah.<br /><br />Although Gates's arguments for black authorship are convincing, he does not address some intriguing European references here.  Fresh linens look like \\"an alpine snowdrift,\\" Mr. Wheeler is noted by Hannah as having \\"the attitude of a Frenchman,\\" Mrs. Wheeler says she will not accept Hannah's \\"blarney,\\" Hannah refers to the poetry of Lord Byron, and she describes Mrs. Wheeler in one scene as having \\"the rage of Orestes.\\" These struck me as unusual metaphors and references, and I'd be intrigued to learn how common they were to the day and how and why Hannah came to employ them.

As he and several named and unnamed narrators relate episodes from Jozef's unfocused life throughout the 1990's, the story jumps from Chicago to Sarajevo to Kiev and Shanghai, following no sequential order, and always returning to the controlling idea that \\"There was a hole in the world, and I fit right into it; if I perished, the hole would just close, like a scar healing...\\"<br /><br />Hemon, a Sarajevo native who didn't begin writing in English until 1995, achieves immense power by keeping his sentence structure simple, acutely observing the minutiae of Jozef's life, meticulously selecting images which are both visually and emotionally memorable, then firing them at us in a staccato series of flashes. Just before a job interview, for example, Jozef recalls smashing cardboard boxes, a cat eating the head of a mouse, the Bosnian war as seen on TV, and a passing driver pointing a finger at him and pretending to shoot.  Boiling eggs are seen as \\"iris-less eyes,\\" and he has \\"butterflies in [his] stomach, ripping off one another's wings.\\"  With irony and dark humor, he recalls a woman calling out to her lost dog, \\"Lucky Boy,\\" while a young ESL teacher addresses her class as \\"you guys\\" and conducts lessons about Siamese twins.<br /><br />Jozef is a character with whom most readers will empathize, and as we view his life at home and abroad, we root for his success at the same time that we fear his failure. \\"The possibility that the world can never respond to [Jozef's] desires torture[s] him.\\"  Because separating Jozef from all his fantasies is not always easy, some readers may still be wondering at the end of the novel, \\"Who is Jozef Pronek, really?\\" however, and his world, in which an \\"omniscient, omnipotent, but not necessarily benevolent being\\" is in control, will not appeal to everyone.

In a theater in Sydney, Australia, at the turn of the century, Eliza McGinty, a young actress, steps into the shoes of an actor too drunk to play the role of Hamlet one night and gives the performance of her life.  Pregnant and unmarried, she goes into labor on stage and gives birth to a son, Miles.  Her apparently contagious exertions stimulate a banker's wife in the audience to go into labor and give birth to a daughter, Isabel, that same night.  Of different family backgrounds and social class, Miles and Isabel nevertheless reflect the remarkable coincidence of their births by growing up to be remarkably similar in personality-both are fiercely independent, adventurous, and determined to break free of the constraints on their lives.  Most importantly, both have always wanted to fly.<br /><br />A wry humor and light-hearted tone pervade the novel as Miles, tired of working as an assistant to Balthazar the Levitator and \\"flying\\" on stage each night, eventually sets off on his own adventures, learning everything he can from story tellers, inventors, and his own observations of nature in an effort to design a flying machine.  Isabel, too, eventually sets off on her own, fleeing from suitors, a perverted distant relative, and the specter of a stifling life like that of her mother.  It is, of course, no surprise that the fates which governed their births also bring them together so that they can continue their dreams of flight.<br /><br />Gilling writes simply here, creating an old-fashioned story for the sake of story, a story easy to read, with no deep or hidden meanings, no symbolism, and no pretension.  Filled with quirky characters and amusing anecdotes, the novel is straightforward and relatively mellow in tone.  The boisterous humor, irreverent satire, and ironic detachment which made Gillings's first novel, The Sooterkin, such a wacky pleasure are sacrificed here in favor of charm, as Gilling becomes more involved with individual characters and dreams than with the society at large.

A much admired financier/philanthropist, Paddy has been working on a plan for a debt-for-equity swap involving the Irish national debt and a Japanese investor, and someone finds this so threatening that s/he tinkers with Paddy's heart medication and kills him.<br /><br />Political intrigue at the highest levels, intraparty politics and resentments, and the northern branch of the IRA all play a part in the action here and add to the intricate financial maneuvering.  Unfortunately, however, they also lead to a somewhat \\"talky\\" novel, as Gill is forced to explain technicalities to his reader.  Most of the personal interactions and intrigue here involve the politicians and their wives, lovers, and families, rather than McGarr and his detectives from the Garda Siochana, and I missed the focus on those characters which made Death of a Joyce Scholar and Death of an Irish Sinner (the novel after this one) so satisfying.<br /><br />Sneem, a \\"Tidy Town\\" in Kerry, which is the site of Paddy's murder, is very lively here, with quirky characters, culchies, and locals with long memories, but the banter and teasing which so characterize the series as a whole are less prominent here.  The relationship between Ruthie Bresnahan and Hugh Ward, a highlight of the previous novel, Death of a a Joyce Scholar, is not a factor, with Ward acting undercover as a bartender and Ruthie, on her \\"home turf,\\" using her connections in the community to help McGarr solve the murder.  With numerous subplots and red herrings, along with complex financial and political dealings, Gill tackles big subjects with his usual gusto, and his conclusion explodes in fireworks, torture, mayhem, and an incredible body count.  Tighter plotting and fewer side issues might have made this novel more powerful, but even when Gill is not at his best, he's still better than most!

Through letters, diaries, journals, personal interviews, and family archives, they speak to the reader with unprecedented candor about their personal travails, but more importantly, about their early struggles for funding, their fossil discoveries in remote desert locations, their constant surprise by the historical record, and their uncertainty, to this day, about modern man's exact lineage.<br /><br />Some Leakey peccadilloes, never secret, are fully documented here: Louis's constant womanizing and his \\"adoption\\" of young female researchers, such as Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birute Galdikas; Mary's scotch-drinking, her cigar-smoking, and her intolerance of those on her Stinker List, some of them other researchers; and Richard's boyish brashness and arrogance, along with his health problems and dislike of Donald Johanson.  Less appreciated, however, is the fact that before Louis's work and significant discoveries, people still believed that early man was from China or Europe, not Africa.  Mary Leakey was the first person ever to excavate a Paleolithic site, and her meticulous care about documenting the tools and animals found in the same stratae as her hominid fossils, told here in detail, revolutionized the way fossils were recovered and catalogued.  Richard found as many hominid fossils in two years (1971 and 1972) as Mary and Louis found in 36 years, and his level of dedication to research since finding his first hominid fossil at age 6, his mentoring of young researchers, and his creation of museums and foundations in Nairobi have perhaps received less attention than they deserve.<br /><br />The Leakeys believe at least two and perhaps three or four different hominids may have lived in certain areas simultaneously, sharing space for a million or more years, and that the exact line of descent to modern man is still unknown.  Tens of thousands of extinct, fossilized species of hippos, elephants, saber-toothed cats, crocodiles, antelopes, and even insects, unearthed by the Leakeys, are overwhelming evidence that if species, including hominids, do not change and adapt, they die.  While some may argue about how certain hominids are labeled, no one can argue with their existence in the historical record, and nearly all of them have been unearthed by just one family.  These contributions continue beyond the purview of this book into a new generation:  Dr. Louise Leakey and her mother Maeve (Richard's wife) found yet another completely new hominid species in March, 2001.

The Body Artist is one of the strangest--and most seductive--books I've read in a long time, a \\"ghost story\\" with a character who is described as if he were real, and whom the main character believes to be real, and who may, in fact, be real--but who may also be a figment of imagination.  Events which are described as real may be fantasies, and even the relationships the main character has or has had with people who seem to be real may, in fact, be colored by wishful thinking.  Ultimately, even the linear progression of the narrative itself is called into question since, DeLillo tells us, \\"Past, present, and future are not amenities of language.\\"<br /><br />The story begins with the intimately described minutiae of breakfast, as a couple, married just a short time, gets ready for the day.  We learn that it takes two cycles on the toaster to get the bread the right color, that the cup is his and the paper is hers, that a blue jay comes to the bird feeder, that she puts soya on her cereal and that it smells like feet.  When Rey Robles, the husband, dies later that day (something we know from the beginning), the world of the wife, Lauren Hartke, changes from one of communication and an outward focus to a world of grief and an inward focus.  When she discovers a stranger living on the third floor of her rented house, we aren't sure whether he is real or whether he materializes to show Lauren's unresolved feelings about her loss and the depth of her trauma.  The stranger, dubbed Mr. Tuttle, is handicapped, unable to understand or communicate in language in any traditional way.<br /><br />Fascinating in its focus on internal action, the reader must ultimately just accept the story for what it is while enjoying the glories of the meticulous prose, the acutely felt portrait of a woman grieving, the suggested symbolism in birds and nature, and the author's depiction of the ambiguities and uncertainties of life and time.  This is a work which uses language in new ways, ultimately even calling into question the use of language itself to make sense of the world.  Like Lauren, DeLillo himself is a performance artist.

With an apocalyptic vision at its heart, Blood Music is escapist reading with high drama, though its excitement has been somewhat muted by time and the magnitude of the real events which have transpired since its publication in 1985.  Here a genetic experiment goes awry, and the whole world is endangered.  When Vergil Ulam, a cross between Dennis-the-Menace and a stereotyped nerd, is fired from his job, he takes his private research with him--by injecting himself with intellectual lymphocytes, cellular computers, which he has developed.  Not unexpectedly with Vergil, things go wrong, and these cells take over his body and eventually spread wildly, endangering the whole world.<br /><br />Though only seventeen years have passed since its publication, the book feels old-eerily so.  Gene therapy is now a reality. The Soviet Union, which here rattles its nuclear sabers  in an effort to dominate the world, seems like a very old enemy.  Strangely, a number of particularly vivid scenes here take place in a ravaged World Trade Center, images so similar to the present reality that I found them painful to stumble upon in a piece of light fiction.  Suzy McKenzie, a lonely survivor in New York, sets up home in the World Trade Center lobby, and Bear's descriptions of her explorations through the desolate upper floors and of the collapse of one of the towers conjured up nightmarish images for me which Bear could never have foretold and which some readers may wish to avoid.<br /><br />Bear's narrative is fast-paced and suspenseful.  With an acute sensibility and eye for detail, Bear creates stark images.  His characterizations of Vergil and Suzy are often touching, however, and the dialogue between Vergil and his mother will bring smiles to the faces of many parents.  Structurally, the novel is very loose, with characters who come and go, and ultimately the novel feels almost as chaotic as Bear's vision of devastation.  Bear's immense potential, obvious here, finds its true fulfillment in his later, more carefully controlled, novels.  Mary Whippler, more carefully controlled, novels.  Mary Whipple	2002-09-12

With her usual precision, Colegate here focuses on \\"deceits of time,\\" those deliberate little falsehoods that all of us, over time, create and eventually accept as truth because they allow us to smooth over unpleasant events in our lives and assuage any guilt we may have about them.  In creating personal deceits, we adjust our pasts--our personal histories--so that they are more palatable and easier to cope with.  Ultimately, most of us try to convince others to accept these little falsehoods as the truth.  Colegate, a writer of the utmost exactitude, wants the whole truth laid bare, and in this remarkable novel she requires each of her characters to face reality in order to come to new understandings.<br /><br />Catherine Hillery, a widow in her fifties, is hired by a solicitor for the Campion family to write the definitive biography of Neil Campion, a young Member of Parliament, a World War II pilot, and a man with an idealistic vision of what society could become.  Neil died in 1941 in a car crash on his way north toward Scotland, his reasons for that trip unknown, and Catherine is not sure why she, rather than someone more famous, has been chosen to write his biography.  Determined to find out the truth about her subject and not merely reflect what the family wants her to say, she intends to get all the facts.  As we come to understand Neil's family--his brother and sister, his wife, and his grandson--we also become acquainted with Catherine, her two sons, and their wives.  All, including Catherine, are hiding from some truth.<br /><br />As is characteristic of Colegate, this novel is a marvel of compression, with individual scenes casting light on Neil Campion, one or more of his relatives, and Catherine, all at the same time.  Colegate's sparkling dialogue conveys attitude, class, prejudices, and personality, while also revealing plot and the deceits each character insists on maintaining.  Parallels among characters and between the Campion family and Catherine expand the scope and give added power to the message, and the irony which occurs at the end is both darkly humorous and memorable.  Colegate is a powerful writer, sadly neglected, and this novel deserves a wide audience.  Fortunately, many copies of this book are available on Used venues, including Amazon.

One of the most seductive of all ghost stories, Turn of the Screw is not a tale for young people inured to Halloween I and II or Tales from the Crypt.  It is a sophisticated and subtle literary exercise in which the author creates a dense, suggestive, and highly ambiguous story, its suspense and horror generated primarily by what the author does NOT say and does not describe.  Compelled to fill in the blanks from his/her own store of personal fears, the reader ultimately conjures up a more horrifying set of images and circumstances than anything an author could impose from without.<br /><br />Written in 1898, this is superficially the tale of a governess who accepts the job of teaching two beautiful, young children whose uncle-guardian wants nothing to do with them.  On a symbolic level, however, it is a study of the mores and prejudices of the times and, ultimately, of the nature of Evil.  The governess fears that ghosts of the former governess Miss Jessel and her lover, valet Peter Quint, have corrupted the souls of little Flora and Miles and have won them to the side of Evil.  The children deny any knowledge of ghosts, and, in fact, only the governess actually sees them.  Were it not for the fact that the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, can identify them from the governess's descriptions, one might be tempted to think that the governess is hallucinating.<br /><br />Though the governess is certainly neurotic and repressed, this novel was published ten years before Freud, suggesting that the story should be taken at face value, as a suspenseful but enigmatic Victorian version of a Faustian struggle for the souls of these children.  The ending, which comes as a shock to the reader, is a sign that such struggles should never be underestimated.  As is always the case with James, the formal syntax, complex sentence structure, and elaborately constructed narrative are a pleasure to read for anyone who loves language, formality, and intricate psychological labyrinths.  As is obvious from the reviews here by high school students, however, these literary \\"charms\\" may be less alluring to those on whom they are imposed as required reading.

When Walter Benjamin, a German Jew, died in Spain during World War II, Europe was deprived of \\"the most subtle mind of [his] generation.\\"  Benjamin, a philosopher, historian, and literary critic, was a colleague of some of Europe's most influential thinkers during the period between the two world wars.  Deeply involved in the intellectual aspects of history, Benjamin, however, became a prisoner of the world of ideas, a man who neither understood nor recognized the immediate political realities of the Nazi threat, preferring to sit \\"in glory above the fray, on an alabaster cloud.\\"  Refusing to leave Paris until almost all avenues of escape were closed, Benjamin's indecisiveness about escape and his insistence on toting his 1000-page manuscript on the history of Parisian arcades may have cost him his life.<br /><br />Parini's imagery here is often stunning, and his prose so smooth it is almost melodic in its flow.  Using several points of view, he allows Benjamin's friends and acquaintances to recall episodes in Benjamin life, creating emotional power from their reminiscences after Benjamin's death in Spain.  First-person accounts by Lisa Fittko, a real person who helped Benjamin and others escape through the Pyrenees into Spain, are particularly powerful, giving immediacy and drama to Benjamin's attempted escape on foot.  Quotations from Benjamin's own philosophical writing give a sense of reality to a man who otherwise refused to become engaged in the realities of his time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Benjamin himself is phlegmatic, and Parini is often forced to \\"tell about\\" his life, rather than recreating it for the reader. Because he is distanced, both by his own personality and Parini's narrative style, Benjamin never really comes to life as do his friends, such as Fittko, Jewish mystic Gershom Scholem, and Russian Marxist Asja Lacis, who, in addressing us directly, create scenes which are full of vitality.  Still, this novel about Benjamin as \\"the European Mind writ large\\" is endlessly fascinating, a thoughtful eulogy for all that has been lost to posterity.

With Darwin's publication of the Origin of the Species in 1859, two thousand years of church doctrine--that God created the species on earth in divine acts of separate creation and that Genesis is a literal description of this creation--came into direct conflict with scientific research.  Darwin, himself a theologian, was reluctant to reveal his acceptance of evolution, saying that \\"denial of a literal interpretation of the biblical account of creation felt like 'confessing a murder.'\\"<br /><br />This erudite and literate novel purports to be a found manuscript from an unknown author writing in 1883 from an island in the Java Sea.  Telling of \\"Bobby\\" Darwin's early life and background, the speaker reveals his love for Bobby, his fascination with Bobby's explorations on the Beagle, and his influence on Bobby to accept the Theory of Evolution.  The speaker, who \\"cannot remember ever having a God,\\" also claims to have been the source of Alfred Russel Wallace's knowledge of The Theory.  His depiction of Wallace as a self-promoting and arrogant trader of beetles and butterflies provides a bit of humor and suggests a rationale for Wallace's rush to promote his view of evolution simultaneously with that of Darwin.<br /><br />Alternating fast-paced personal narrative and characterization with vibrant descriptions of fascinating, largely imaginary flora and fauna on the Java Sea island (now vanished after a volcanic eruption), the speaker focuses on the interdependence of plant and animal species on each other.  The gentle gadzocks eat the salty sargassum weed, misseltow feeds on the blood of noddy chicks, crabs fell trees in order to get to coconuts, and the mystical golden scarab depends on the guano of bats.  These descriptions of dependence give a thought-provoking slant to the treatment of evolution, provide numerous parallels with the human relationships in the story, and stimulate the reader's imagination about possible vanished species and the need for conservation.  This is a novel of huge reach, with a full-circle, religiously suggestive conclusion.  Some sections are a bit pedantic, and not all readers will enjoy the alternating focus of intimate personal revelations and descriptions of nature, but the book provides much food for thought, and, perhaps, a new view of Darwin and his achievements.

Describing Yale as \\"an institution that presents itself far less as an academic school than as a social game,\\" author Robbins delves into the history of the university itself in an effort to explain the evolution of its secret societies--Skull and Bones, in particular--and to rationalize their continuing existence.  Quoting documents from the archives, she cites religious zealotry, student rankings by social status and family background, a veneration of tradition, and the promotion of ultra-conservative values at Yale in the 19th century as factors in the development of these societies during that time.  Literary, debating, and drama societies, open to all students, evolved and disbanded during these years, but the secret societies survived, providing in the absence of a residential college system, a bonding experience which fulfilled unmet social needs.<br /><br />Skull and Bones is highly selective, tapping only fifteen seniors each year, but the networks members forge among themselves, with faculty who were members, and with powerful alumni endure for a lifetime.  Bushes, Buckleys, Bundys, Rockefellers, Tafts, and others have formed and exploited their secret society networks in government and foreign policy, the CIA, finance, and business.  Robbins firmly debunks, however, the rumors of an \\"international mafia,\\" a real estate cabal, neo-Nazi philosophy, and the notion that this is the \\"most powerful secret society the world has ever known.\\"<br /><br />Herself a member of a \\"kindred Yale secret society,\\" Robbins can hardly be expected to represent the point of view of the 90% of the campus which is not tapped for secret societies, which, now admitting women and minorities, seem to be trying to represent the college's demographics more fairly.  She never really deals with the inherent elitism (or tokenism) which the selection process represents, however, and I disagree with her contention that secret societies are necessary in our lives: \\"The secret society--like the power of the elitist, old-school colleges...--survives because people like to believe that seemingly random events are orchestrated by someone or something in control...they need causality in much the same way as they need a God.

Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1973, this moving study of memory and the progression of generations is still vibrant and relevant thirty years later.  Not only does it show us the ripple effect that one person's passing has on loved ones, it also shows us the changes to society which occur as older generations pass away and new generations take their place.<br /><br />Welty's concern here is with values--those traditional values learned by Laurel, the daughter of a Mississippi judge, from her parents; those learned by her parents from their parents; those imparted by the town she grew up in and the people who lived there; and those which Laurel has absorbed from her life as an artist in Chicago.  In her values she is in direct contrast with Fay, the judge's young second wife, a crass and selfish woman from Texas with a large, boisterous, and uneducated family--a woman whose only desire is to come out a winner.  When the judge dies, Laurel returns temporarily to her old room in the family home, which, Fay takes great pains to remind her, now belongs to Fay.  There, surrounded by family belongings, she is assailed by memories of her childhood, her mother, her mother's final illness, and her relationship with her father. Her pre-occupation with the past is in direct contrast with Fay's concern with the present and her future--these women clearly belong to different worlds, and only Laurel is capable of change or adaptation.<br /><br />Welty's ear for dialogue is unerring.  She reveals character, class, and education in her syntax and choice of vocabulary and creates conflicts from the smallest of details--a misunderstood word, an imagined slight, a presumption.  The conflict is leavened by humor in many places, some of it dark, especially when Fay's \\"no 'count\\" family arrives  at the funeral.  The characters themselves lack subtlety, however, and the symbolism is obvious--birds and flowers are constant motifs, and in the final scene, a handmade breadboard assumes meanings for Laurel well beyond what one would expect for such a simple item.  For those of us who have lived through the death of parents and the disposal of a family home, this novel has a resonance rare in modern fiction, one which transcends the period in which it was written and the southern location in which it is set.

Less a novel than a thesis, the book uses the characters as mouthpieces for historical research rather than as living humans:  they remain flat and lacking in those unique personal characteristics which make fictional characters come alive and communicate with the reader.<br /><br />In prose which is as archaic and poetic as the Bible, the Torah, and/or the Koran, the author uses Ka'b, a Jew who becomes a trusted advisor of the Muslim Caliph Umar, to tell the early religious stories and legends, sometimes common to all three religions, which infuse the Holy Land, its religious sites, and shrines. Because Ka'b is a teacher, he can preach to his subjects, including the reader, with impunity. While this is effective in conveying a great deal of information about the history of these sites, it perpetuates the distance between the reader and the subject matter and does not allow for the kind of identification with a character which can make this information come alive and remain with the reader.<br /><br />The formality of the style and the enormous amount of abstraction in the story-telling sometimes make the actual sequence of events difficult to follow. Events affecting these sites are described, but the reasons behind them are not always clear--unless, of course, you already have a great deal of knowledge of the people and places important to all three religions and understand their historical practices and traditions. This scholarly work succeeds in showing the common threads of the three major religions and their common interests in the holy sites as they existed in the seventh century. It is less successful in providing keys to the disputes which surround these sites in the present day.  Mary Whipple	2002-08-27

Do not be misled by the \\"moony\\" cover art, the title, or the fact that this is sometimes described as a coming-of-age novel--it is not romantic, whimsical, or lightweight.  Instead, it is a meticulously crafted, mature novel which illuminates the major themes and issues which thoughtful men and women confront throughout their lives.  Elegantly written and emotionally involving, it is one of the best--and most unsettling--novels I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Alex Massolini, aged 22, is a budding poet and student of classics in 1970, when he drops out of Columbia because he no longer \\"cared a feather about the fate of Rome or its [Gallic wars]...My only brother, Nicky, had been killed in Vietnam.\\"  Taking a job as a secretary to Rupert Grant, a well-known Scottish writer living on Capri, Alex faces his own, more subtle wars as he tries to discover who he is and what he believes, while living in Grant's turbulent household and observing his decadent lifestyle.  Grant is manipulative, vindictive, and ego-driven, often abusive to his wife and two young female assistants. As his resentment of Grant grows, Alex finds himself in a quandary, since he admires Grant's writing, loves meeting his friends--W.H.Auden, Graham Greene, and Gore Vidal, among others--and hopes Grant will become a mentor for him in his own writing.<br /><br />Themes of love and loss, good and evil, free will and obligation, and war and its aftermath pervade the novel as Alex tries to understand himself, the creative life, and the sacrifices artists make for it.  Issues of sexuality, religion, politics, philosophy, and even economics come into play for Alex, and Parini widens the perspective and gives universality to these themes and issues by juxtaposing, throughout, the letters which Alex's estranged brother Nicky has sent him from Vietnam.  This is a beautifully realized, patiently designed, and maturely confident novel, by an author who himself illustrates a quotation by Rilke in the book:  \\"Being an artist means, not reckoning and counting, but ripening like the tree that does not force its sap but stands confident in the storms of spring without fear that after them may come no summer.\\"  For this author, summer has arrived.

This Cartesian principle resonates throughout Gill's narrative about the violence in Northern Ireland, as he represents the many competing forces in the battle to control Northern Ireland.  Catholic Provo extremists are bent upon assassinating Ian Paisley, a self-annointed Protestant minister and firebrand Loyalist intent upon establishing his own absolute right to rule Ulster.  Paisley's security staff in Belfast, equally bloodthirsty and equally irrational, have their own plans for payback to the Catholic minority and their supporters in the south.<br /><br />The official governments of the two parts of Ireland have their own interests, not always consistent with those of the extremists on both sides, and the British further complicate the issue.  The police of both areas operate independently, and some high officials are actively in cahoots with leaders of various factions.  Into this vividly described maelstrom, comes Supt. Peter McGarr of the Garda Siochana, as he investigates the seemingly unrelated death of a rugby star.<br /><br />With the most powerful opening section Gill has ever written, this novel stands apart from the rest of the McGarr series and easily holds its own as an independent novel.  Though the characters usually associated with McGarr do make some minor appearances, the narrative's strength lies not with the Garda but with the vividly portrayed characters involved in the political unrest.  McGarr himself does not even appear in the novel until p. 65.<br /><br />Readers unfamiliar with the complexities of the troubles in Northern Ireland may find it a bit difficult to keep track of who's who and who's on which side, and even the participants don't always know, as people frequently cross borders and change alliances.  This is a stunning novel, however, with an ending as complex as the conflicts themselves.  With no humor to disguise the violence and sadness afflicting the Six Counties, Gill writes this one \\"straight.\\"  Mary Whipple	2002-08-22

Publishing this novel in 1978, Greene says in his autobiography (Ways of Escape, pp. 256  - 257) that he had actually started it ten years earlier, abandoning it when his friend and former colleague, Kim Philby, defected to Russia.  He did not want this book to be considered a roman a clef.  Like Philby, Maurice Castle, the main character in this novel, is a double agent, and Greene goes to great pains to bring him to life and try to make his inevitable defection to Russia believable. Having earlier lived in South Africa, Castle had fallen in love with Sarah, an African woman.  Another double agent had helped her escape from South Africa so she and Castle could be married.  Now living in England with Sarah and their son, Castle continues to provide information to the Russians as payback for the help he received years before.<br /><br />The cloak-and-dagger intrigue here is rooted in the Cold War, and Greene's own sympathies with the Communists, well known, are noticeable throughout the novel.  When a leak is suspected in Castle's section of British intelligence, a secret plan is devised to eliminate the culprit quietly to avoid another Philby-type embarrassment to the government.  It's of only minor consequence to the higher-ups that they kill Davis, an innocent man.  The Russians' rush to \\"save\\" Castle, whose work for them has really been of only minor importance, seems more like wishful thinking than reality.  Codes created from duplicate copies of old books, messages left in a hollow tree, and warning signals made with rings of the telephone now seem to belong to an age much earlier than the mere 24 years which have evolved since the book's publication.<br /><br />Castle is well drawn, for the most part, though he seems a rather clumsy agent-about-to-defect, someone who, though supposedly devoted to his wife and child, has not thought far enough ahead to guarantee their ultimate safety and happiness.  Sarah, unfortunately, is an undifferentiated, flat character, and Castle's devotion to her must be accepted, rather than felt, thereby limiting the impact of the ending.  Parts of the book are very moving, and Castle is often a sympathetic character, but I thought the book lacked the philosophical and structural tightness of his earlier, more famous novels.

In a simple, unpretentious, and totally accessible style, Murakami tells six tales, each with a message about life and death and love and loss.  Simple, straightforward stories, haunting and hypnotic in tone, belie a complexity of themes and thought-provoking observations about the importance of creating your own identity, building relationships, sharing, and avoiding the emptiness of the bogeyman's box, \\"ready for everybody...[and] waiting with the lid open.\\"<br /><br />All the main characters are single or separated, and all feel isolated and empty, naïve in matters of love and life.  In \\"UFO in Kashiro,\\" an abandoned  husband agrees to help a friend by delivering a box to Hokkaido, only to discover that  the box \\"contains the something that was inside you. You'll never get it back.\\"  In \\"Landscape in Flatiron,\\" a 40-ish artist and a young girl meet and build a bonfire. \\"The fire itself has to be free,\\" he remarks, while the young girl comments on the emptiness of her life, and they make plans for the rest of the evening.  In \\"All God's Children Can Dance,\\" a young man pursues the man he believes to be his father to an abandoned baseball field, \\"chasing the tail of the darkness inside [him].\\"  \\"Thailand\\" features a doctor in her 40's who is told that she must get rid of the stone inside her and that \\"living and dying are, in a sense, of equal value.\\"<br /><br />In the last two stories, \\"Superfrog Saves Tokyo,\\" and \\"Honey Pie,\\" Murakami begins to offer more hope and direction to his characters.  Superfrog, a 6' tall frog who needs a plodding banker to help him fight the Worm and save Tokyo from an earthquake, due to strike soon, teaches that \\"the ultimate value of our lives is decided not by how we win but by how we lose.\\"  And in \\"Honey Pie,\\" which brings all these themes together, a young man has an opportunity to find happiness with the only woman he's ever loved and her young daughter, and determines that he will \\"never let anyone...try to put them into that crazy box, not even if the sky should fall or the earth crack open with a roar.\\"<br /><br />Despite the fact that Murakami states his themes overtly, the stories themselves are enigmatic and the action unpredictable, and the reader will ponder his meanings and his images long after the stories are finished.  Wonderful descriptions, small details which reflect the characters' class and educational level, sympathetic and well drawn characters, and a sense that the world is absurd and illogical make this short collection unforgettable.

A sad cynicism lies at the root of Greene's dark humor in this very early (1932) novel, Greene's fourth novel and the first entertainment to be written and published for a wide audience.  A Jewish businessman, a lesbian journalist, her rebellious young companion, a dancer in need of a job, a Socialist physician wanted in Serbia for treason, and an Austrian thief meet and interact aboard the Orient Express on a trip from London to Istanbul (Stamboul).  Each person in this motley group hopes that some remarkable change will occur to him or her as a result of the trip, but though all eventually get their wish, fate has something devious up its sleeve for each one.  These twists and turns, sometimes humorous and sometimes immensely sad, constitute the heart of the novel.<br /><br />Unlike Greene's later novels, with their fully developed characters and religious themes, this novel's characters are often stereotypes, and the action is often designed simply to bring the characters down, showing that no matter what dreams or goals they may have, that ultimately they have no control over their destinies.  Greene's later, much more intensely realized themes--sin and atonement, innocence and guilt, love of life and fear of death, piety and corruption, sex and religion--are missing here, and as the action unfolds and the characters are manipulated, the reader easily recognizes the \\"bones\\" of the themes which will later come into full flower in Greene's mature philosophical novels.  As a series of tours de force, and as a glimpse into the creative process of a writer who, at this point, was just beginning to come into his own, this is an intriguing novel, loaded with insights, a fascinating and enjoyable read.

Daisy Bates, a controversial woman who has attained almost mythical status in Australia, was an inveterate liar, constitutionally incapable of seeing herself in the world as it really was.  Instead, she created a better world in her own mind and assumed that everyone else recognized her world as real.  As Julia Blackburn reconstructs what she believes to have been Daisy's life in Australia's western desert, and her seemingly futile efforts to protect and preserve the aborigines and their culture, she presents a plausible personality with whom the reader can, to a great extent, identify.<br /><br />Blackburn is successful in making Daisy's dream world seem like an understandable response to the privations and hardships she faced in her early life alone.  In Part I, Blackburn describes what Daisy has said about her life, and follows it with what Blackburn has discovered to be the truth as a result of her documented research.  In Part II, she allows Daisy, as she understands her, to speak to the reader herself, and we \\"live\\" with her in the desert for many years, watching as her original dedication becomes a mission and then a mania, and her insecurity grows into delusion and eventually paranoia.  A woman who seems to have accomplished nothing of lasting significance, Daisy might have achieved some of her goals if she had only bent a little.  Part III tells of Daisy's life after she leaves the desert.<br /><br />Blackburn brings Daisy's Australian desert camp to life--the blinding sun, the heat of day and cold of night, the ghostly arrivals and departures of the shy aborigines, the birds and animals who were often Daisy's only company, and the changes wrought by the railroads, settlement, missionaries, and unfeeling governmental bureaucrats.  Though she presents Daisy sympathetically, she is not Daisy's apologist, offering no defense, other than Daisy's own personality, for her extreme and solitary viewpoint.  Unlike other readers, I found this a very poignant story of a woman who, at the end of a life of the utmost privation and dedication to saving a culture, realizes with sadness that it has all been for naught.  Clearly, she never had a clue that most of her failure was her own fault.

A strange amalgam of fiction and non-fiction, this book is marketed as the fictional confession of a real, and, one would think, endlessly fascinating, character--writer, painter, swindler, companion of famous Romantic authors, probable murderer, and criminal transported to Tasmania. Publishers highlight the fact that Andrew Motion, the author, is both Poet Laureate of Great Britain and a professor of creative writing, and words such as \\"brilliant,\\" \\"memorable,\\" \\"engaging,\\" and \\"convincing\\" attach to the book and appear in reviews. With credentials like these, this book should be one of the most vivid and exciting reading experiences of the year, if not the decade.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book is so much like a doctoral dissertation that the reader never gets close to the subject. The voice of Wainewright, done extremely well in the formal language of the period, nevertheless keeps him at an unbridgeable distance. Wainewright himself never admits his crimes--in fact, does not even recognize them as crimes--and seems to be solely concerned with his own ends, not characteristics allowing for reader identification. Most unfortunately, footnotes so heavily burden the narrative they constitute almost as many pages as the novel itself, and they bring any flow the author does create to a juddering stop. Appearing at the end of every chapter, rather than at the end of the book, they act as deadweights throughout.<br /><br />Andrew Motion is a respected biographer who has chosen to write this \\"novel\\" because it's the only way he can fill in the gaps in the real Wainewright's shadowy history, but he is too much the conscientious scholar to be able to exploit the privileges which fiction allows him. We end up, ironically, with a slow, footnoted, scholarly account of Wainewright, a man who lived almost totally in the moment.  Mary Whipple	2002-08-14

Scheduled for reprinting in December, 2002, this novel will thrill readers who admire careful, precise writing.  Like a jeweler, Colegate has polished her prose till it sparkles, avoiding pretension, excess verbiage, and empty lyricism, choosing, instead, words full of inference and irony, feeling and attitude.  Broad themes, historical perspective, and a plot which contains a large cast of individualized characters from all levels of society come alive here in a mere two hundred pages.<br /><br />Setting the novel in the autumn of 1913, before the outbreak of World War I, Colegate establishes her themes in the first paragraph, asking the reader to imagine an Edwardian  drawing room of a country estate, with gas lamps, a log fire, and people from a long time ago, sitting and standing in groups.  In the room beyond, a \\"fierce electric light\\" shines forth, overpowering the quiet, lamplit room, making it seem shadowy and the people like \\"beings from a much remoter past.\\"  The gentry in this snapshot are not naïve.  Even they recognize that \\"an age, perhaps a civilization, is coming to an end,\\" as industrialization and urbanization are changing the centers of power, and a war looms.<br /><br />A lively cast of characters is invited to Sir Randolph Nettleby's 1000-acre park for a weekend shoot, and as they converse and interact, they quickly become individualized, the reader learning of their attitudes and prejudices, their understanding of the code of behavior, and the details of their very \\"civilized\\" lives. When the shoot begins and the beaters send the birds into the air, the symbolic parallels between the world as it has been, the world as it will be during the coming war, and the world as it may be after the war become obvious to the reader, and the death of one of the characters is not a surprise.<br /><br />Colegate is never polemical, however, imbuing her story with a great deal of personal interaction, warmth, and feeling, and as the action unfolds, the reader feels simultaneously wistful about the loss of cultural identity which is about to occur and gratified that the stultifying \\"predictable-ness\\" of that life will change.  This is a book to savor, written by a remarkable stylist whose prose clearly illustrates that less is more.

Like Graham Greene, Pears writes both serious, philosophical novels (The Dream of Scipio and An Instance of the Fingerpost) and entertainments--in this case, the fascinating art history mysteries which feature Flavia di Stefano and her boss, Gen. Taddeo Bottando of the Rome police.  These quirky detectives from the Art Theft Squad are back in action here, though with changed roles.  Bottando is now semi-retired and Flavia, newly married to former art dealer Jonathan Argyll, is acting head of the department.<br /><br />Life in Pears' Rome never pretends to be simple, and it's always loads of fun for the reader.  Here the theft of a priceless painting on loan from the Louvre leads to the Italian prime minister's order to Flavia to find it, but she must not allow the public or the press to know about the theft, she must get it back no matter the cost, she must pay whatever ransom is demanded without using public funds, and she must do this knowing in advance that she will be a scapegoat--that the prime minister will publicly deny everything he's told her.  As the search for the painting gets underway, further mysteries unfold, until even Bottando himself is implicated in an art theft.<br /><br />Influence peddling, payoffs, and old political rivalries are both accepted and taken for granted here as Flavia negotiates the minefields of art and politics.  The satire is gentle, and the action is non-stop.  The intricacies of the characters' relationships keep the reader constantly challenged and always thinking, and the art history angle, more about provenance than about painters, should appeal to readers with little art background.  The surprising conclusion and the major changes resulting to the lives of the main characters are stunning.  If Pears continues this series, it will undoubtedly be in new directions.

Queen Victoria, her family, and her genetic contribution to the scourge of hemophilia, which devastated ruling families throughout Europe, all figure in this fascinating medical mystery.  Dr. Henry Nanther, Physician In-Ordinary to Prince Leopold, Queen Victoria's beloved hemophiliac son, tells through letters, diary entries, and his personal \\"alternative history\\" the story of his research into hemophilia and how it is transmitted.  Martin Nanther, the 4th Lord Nanther, who inherited his peerage from his great-grandfather Henry, is the desk-bound modern detective in this tale, researching Henry's life for a biography he intends to write about his contributions to history and medicine.<br /><br />The agony of the hemophiliac during the Victorian era, when little help could be offered the sufferer, is finely drawn.  Martin and his wife Jude suffer their own medical agony, as Jude has been unable carry a pregnancy beyond the first three months, and they have suffered numerous miscarriages, the cause unknown.<br /><br />Though most of the action takes place \\"off stage,\\" Vine's characterizations are so fully drawn and Martin's quest so intriguing that the reader feels like part of the action, even the action of 100 years ago.  Students of genealogy will thrill as Martin follows a genealogical paper trail through many generations of Nanthers and the Hendersons, his forbears on his mother's side of the family.  The serious, intellectual tone and Vine's careful attention to detail, particularly as it reveals the psychology and motivation of her characters, elevate this a serious novel and give the reader much to contemplate. Ironically, Henry's personality is so carefully delineated that many readers may figure out, on the basis of Vine's information, Henry's secret history, well before the conclusion.<br /><br />For its insights into the Victorian period, the clear discussions of genetics, the contemporary insights into British reforms of the House of Lords, the personal and medical mysteries at the heart of the story, and the urgency of Henry's and Martin's quests, Vine's novel is outstanding and fully involving.

This book is filled with delights, not least of which is the light, deft touch the author employs as he deals charmingly with important and weighty issues of family relationships--fathers with sons, and brothers with each other. There's a freshness and gentleness of tone here that might even be cloying were it not for the acerbic, sometimes boisterous, humor which the author uses to leaven his narrative and keep his issues in perspective. Though there is a mystery at the heart of the novel, it's a quiet mystery, more important for the lessons it illuminates than for any thrills it may provide.<br /><br />Damien March, the main character, is an expatriate American living in London and working for the BBC. Although he's had no contact with his uncle Patrick for twenty years, he finds himself the sudden beneficiary of his uncle's estate on Ionia, a fictional island off Cape Cod, an island which resembles the Martha's Vineyard of the past. The only catch is that he must not change the interior of the house, which is packed with bric-a-brac. When he decides to spend six months living in the house, he discovers several unpublished stories by his uncle, all concerning Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes's mysterious brother, who has committed a terrible crime, but for worthy reasons. The parallels Damien sees between Mycroft Holmes's relationship with Sherlock and his uncle Patrick's relationship with Damien's father lead him to investigate the crime and, ultimately, to come to a new understanding of what family means and what its enduring values may be.<br /><br />It is possible that this fictional story reflects either directly or obliquely on the author's own relationship with his author-father, Paul Theroux, his author-uncle Alexander Theroux, his British TV-host-brother Louis, and the relationship of the elder Theroux brothers with each other. While these overlaps will provide tantalizing and fertile grounds for biographers, they are irrelevant to one's enjoyment of this narrative. Marcel Theroux, however, certainly seems to welcome such speculation by setting of this novel off Cape Cod, where Paul Theroux lives, and by his references to Medford, where the elder Theroux authors grew up. The accurate Cape Cod descriptions, the \\"Yankee spirit,\\" and the unpretentious lives so well illustrated by the peripheral characters here add immeasurably to the realism of this delightful study of family values.

A futuristic fantasy with as much swash-buckling derring-do as any medieval romance, Kiln People features an intriguing mix of real humans and their clay dittos (or golems), clone-like duplicates which have all the characteristics of the individual real people who create them, including their memories, but which live for only 24 hours.  Albert Morris and his dittos (ditectives) hope to find the killer of the real Professor Maharal, one of the founders of Universal Kilns, the maker of dittos, and prevent the world of the future from falling into the hands of an evil mastermind who could change the very essence of human nature.<br /><br />No one reads a book like this for its deep philosophical insights.  It is an entertainment, filled with intricate twists of plot and subplot, a confusion of real and dittoed identities, and non-stop, Superhero action, along with a great deal of humor.  Puns and word play, especially in the chapter headings, along with satire and social commentary, born of the similarities between this futuristic world and our present world, abound here, adding a layer of clever playfulness to the fast-paced and energetic narrative.<br /><br />With so much action involving clay dittos of both the good guys and the bad guys, however, the reader does not have much opportunity to become involved with individual characters' lives and thoughts, problems, and future destinies, and this leads to a rather flat, affectless novel.  The characters remain cartoon-like, sometimes mouthing cute observations about society or moralizing on behalf of the author.  The subject of cloning and the question of what elements of human nature and society, if any, are worth preserving into the future are fascinating ones, and Brin deals with these in unique and interesting ways, but the overall tone is light-hearted, and the overall impact, for me, was also light.

Darwin's Radio is a real eye-opener about molecular biology, evolution, and the condition of the human race, not just the human race of the present or the early humans who were the immediate descendants of the hominids, but the human race as it may soon become in the future.  Bear himself, after researching the book, \\"came away with an unshakable sense that evolutionary biology is about to undergo a major upheaval--not in the next few decades, but in the next few years\\"!<br /><br />In a powerful and exciting narrative, Bear explores just this sort of evolutionary upheaval, as SHEVA, a retrovirus, begins to attack women, causing them to miscarry at three months, while, at the same time, causing them to begin spontaneously a new, ostensibly fatherless, pregnancy within a month.  Kaye Lang, a highly respected molecular biologist, and Mitch Rafelson, a disgraced anthropologist, are involved in research to contain SHEVA, studying DNA and its coding, various immune responses to bacteria and viruses, genetic mutations, and the possibility that SHEVA is not a new phenomenon at all.  As the virus starts to spread and thousands of women find themselves infected, public safety is endangered, riots occur, shootings result in deaths, and the government starts to panic, requiring SHEVA-infected women to register their pregnancies, and their second stage babies, if delivered alive, to be turned over to the government.<br /><br />Bear does a masterful job of depicting both the personal traumas and the petty jealousies which surface when people in power recognize that a genuine emergency can also provide opportunities for personal advancement.  Conflicts on both the personal and professional level are astutely presented and heighten the tension and immediacy of the SHEVA crisis.  Remarkably, Bear never reduces issues or individual behavior to the level of black and white, carefully preserving the grays which are involved in all ethical and moral inquiry.  The science here is dense and challenging to someone (like me) who is not a scientist, but the human story and its implications for the future are so clearly presented and intriguing, that I became thoroughly engrossed in the possibilities of new directions in evolution.

Anyone who has ever enjoyed a novel by Thomas Keneally and wondered about his \\"inner man\\" will be richly rewarded by this perceptive, unpretentious, and often light-hearted memoir of life during his 17th year.  The year 1952, was, he says, a \\"reckless, sweet, divinely hectic and subtly hormonal year...the most succulent and the most dangerous [year],\\" one which \\"lightly embarked on, [has] not to this day ceased to tease, govern and turn on me.\\"<br /><br />Capturing the confusion of adolescence, along with the trying on of roles, the dreams of the future, and his own willing surrender to aesthetic and otherworldly influences, he introduces the reader to his family, his school, his neighborhood, his church, and his psyche, as he \\"hungers for grandeur\\" and makes decisions which will ultimately affect the course of his life.  Vividly depicting his friends, the Celestials, with whom he shares his last year at St. Pat's, a boys' day school about 15 miles outside of Sydney, he reveals himself, at seventeen, as an adequate athlete, an excellent writer, a devoted friend (especially to a blind student, the first ever to sit for the Leaving Certificate from a regular school), a dreamer of literary glory, a devout communicant, and a naïve worshipper-from-afar of the equally naïve Bernadette Curran.<br /><br />With his characteristically astute eye for imagery and an acute sensitivity (born, in this case, of hindsight) to the pressures pushing him to become a priest, Keneally reconstructs this tumultuous year and the decisions he and his friends ultimately make about their futures.  As the reader empathizes with the seventeen-year-old Keneally and appreciates both the atmosphere of Homebush in 1952 and the power of outside forces to affect his life, s/he also appreciates more fully the nature of the true creative urge and the urgency of its release.  Less then ten years later, when Keneally's voice finally (and brilliantly) bursts forth, literary history begins a glorious new chapter.

Exploring the inner lives and conflicts of three main characters, each of whom is a member of the band during the Titanic's maiden voyage, Fosnes Hansen recreates the unstable and dismal world each man inhabits at the dawn of World War I.  Jason Coward is bandmaster, Leo Lewenhaupt, known as Spot Hauptmann, is the pianist, and young David Bleierstein is a violinist.  Together with two lesser developed characters, Alex from St. Petersburg, and Petronius from Rome, they raise the big questions of how we become who we are, how much freedom we have to make choices in our lives, and to what extent we can control our destinies.<br /><br />Each of these characters is in some way a captain without a ship.  As Fosnes Hansen brings them alive through the poignant and often harrowing tales of their youth, including the death of their dreams and the sorrows which have led them to the Titanic, we see them as ordinary people whose lives might have been completely different if just one or two circumstances had changed.  Lonely and self-destructive, all have found love to be illusory and a stable and loving family life to be impossible.  In the consummate irony, the Titanic may offer hope, for \\"A ship is a star...a star of dreams.\\"<br /><br />A writer of great intensity, Fosnes Hansen's portrayals of his characters are simultaneously gripping and sympathetic, his stories and anecdotes realistic and moving.  Not given to flights of lyricism, the author creates his images through his selection of perfect details and by providing access to the vibrant inner lives of the characters.  Revealing the Titanic as a microcosm of life in 1914, the author also offers many symbolic scenes--rat fights, the execution of beloved pets, puppet shows, for example--which broaden the reader's perspective on the characters and their times.  Though the ending fizzles with the sinking of the ship, the novel is startling, not only in its own right, but because it so clearly foreshadows the author's later novel, Tales of Protection, a novel which is more fully developed thematically and which soars!

Massey's stories of Rei Shimura attract legions of devoted fans, and it's easy to see why. Shimura is a charming and spunky young woman of bicultural heritage, an expert in Asian antiques, a fearless investigator of irregularities in the business, and a sexually liberated seeker of the right guy with whom to share her life. Here she is hired to act as a courier taking eight priceless kimono from a museum in Tokyo to a museum in Washington, D.C., where one of them quickly disappears. Soon afterward, Rei's passport turns up on the body of a murder victim.<br /><br />Many cultural differences are highlighted here. Flying with a tour group of Japanese \\"shopping ladies,\\" who plan to mall-shop for four days, Rei comments on the role of women in Japan and the limitations of their lives and relationships. Her museum lecture on the history of the antique kimono illuminates aspects of the Tokugawa reign and the conflicting roles of wife and lover in that period. When Rei reconnects with her own former lover Hugh Glendinning, for whom she still has feelings, her almost-fiance from Japan appears in D.C. as a surprise--and a significant complication. The intricacies of museum power structures here and in Japan are explained, while her rude treatment by Americans on the plane, at the front desks of hotels, and, especially, by the D.C. police allows her to scrutinize American culture.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Rei's behavior sometimes defies common sense. With business class tickets both for herself and her hand-carried kimono, she agrees to move everything to coach because one rude American wants one seat. She \\"forgets\\" a priceless kimono in a restaurant and later leaves it and her passport unsecured in her hotel room. She signs documents she cannot read and gets no instructions from Tokyo when the D.C. museum refuses one kimono. If you are looking for something fun to read at the beach, this is different, and the action at the end is exciting, as long as you are willing to ignore clich&eacute;s and stereotyped characters and to accept an unusual number of coincidences.

Thomas Keneally is an amazingly versatile writer who seems to do everything well, whether it be intense dramatic fiction, such as Schindler's List, Confederates, and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith;  biography, such as An American Scoundrel, about Gen. Dan Sickles; or, in this case, an amusing roman a clef and gentle satire.<br /><br />Fictionalizing the life of a TV personality named Jacko, who suddenly confronts and often embarrasses ordinary citizens in their homes, Keneally brings his huge personality to life by acting both as an omniscient narrator and as a caring and sensitive confidante to Jacko, sometimes participating in the action himself.  As Jacko, an Australian who has found a niche in New York TV, conducts a search for a young woman who has been kidnapped and held prisoner for five years, Keneally shows Jacko to be a man of some conscience, but also an unregenerate womanizer, egotist, and sometimes insufferable boor.<br /><br />Jacko's father, Stammerin' Jack, and his irrepressible mother Chloe, who live on a remote cattle ranch in The Northern Territories;  his opera-loving brother Frank, who lives the effete life of an aesthete in Sydney; and various lovers and wives join with some of Australia's most notable (real) characters to enliven Keneally's narrative with tongue-in-cheek anecdotes and moments of sensitivity and great poignancy.  Though Keneally disguises these real characters with pseudonyms, he does not otherwise change the details of their lives, so the novel becomes a sort of semi-autobiography of Keneally, as he includes stories of these characters and his relationship with them.  Keneally is obviously the unnamed narrator, just as Patrick White, winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize for Literature, is clearly the model for Michael Bickham.<br /><br />Keneally obviously had great fun writing this book, and his ebullience shines through.  With self-deprecating humor and a light hand, he pokes fun at people's foibles, while respecting the people themselves.  Jacko's larger than life persona parallels the wide-openness of Australia itself, and Keneally's love for the country and its people, along with his need to escape sometimes, shine through.

Combining moments of danger with moments of profound introspection, mountaineer/explorer Ridgeway details his journey from the top of Mount Kilimanjaro through the Tsavo game reserves to Mombasa, a month-long journey on foot, which allows him to experience man's primal relationships with the environment.  Traveling with an experienced guide, two members of the Kenya Park and Wildlife Service, and two sharpshooters (in case of life-threatening danger), Ridgeway follows dry riverbeds across the savanna, seeking \\"tactile knowledge of Africa's wildlands and wild animals.\\"<br /><br />Far more than a search for thrills, the journey offers Ridgeway an opportunity to observe breath-taking vistas and the full panoply of wildlife, from the elephant to the tiniest of birds, paying equal attention to all.  Mourning the absence of once-plentiful animals from the bushlands near Kilimanjaro, and the decline of species elsewhere, Ridgeway contemplates the long-term effects of colonialism, big game hunting, poaching, traditional tribal values, climatic changes, and tourism, as well as man's seemingly innate tendency to kill certain species into extinction.<br /><br />Ridgeway, long a hunter himself, is an engaging author, both observant and thoughtful.  A great admirer of hunter-turned-game-park-adminstrator Bill Woodley, whose two sons from the Park and Wildlife Service are on the journey, he is aware that conservation is a crucial issue.  Extolling the work of elephant researchers Cynthia Moss and Joyce Poole, the latter of whom joins the group for part of the journey, he points out that they have acquired through study a kind of knowledge not available to hunters.  As he lauds the efforts of Richard Leakey and others to save both animals and their habitats, Ridgeway's sensitive and impartial treatment of conservation issues allow him to convey the \\"big picture\\" effectively and to conclude:  \\"The central hope for Africa's large mammals...is to fight fiercely not only to preserve, but even to expand, their wild habitats.  Whatever happens to the beasts, happens to man.\\"  Mary Whippleexpand, their wild habitats.  Whatever happens to the beasts, happens to man.\\"  Mary Whipple	2002-07-19

For anyone who has read Lanchester's other novels (the fiendishly clever Debt to Pleasure and the Walter Mittyish Mr. Phillips), this novel will come as a big surprise.  Far more serious, complex, and traditional a novel than either of these others, it might even be considered old-fashioned in its grand-scale story-telling.  Concerning itself with three generations of people who have succumbed to the siren's song of Hong Kong as a financial capital--and sometimes found her to be a fickle mistress--the novel is as much about the city and the personal connections one brings to business as it is about individuals.<br /><br /> \\"Longevity can be a form of spite,\\" Tom Stewart announces at the beginning of the novel.  Stewart, an old man at the end of the century, has spent almost sixty years working in the former colony.  On his way to Hong Kong in the early `30's, Stewart was taught Chinese on shipboard by Sister Maria, with whom he remained in contact as they both began their vocations--he as a hotel manager and she as a missionary to the remote countryside--and throughout their years in Hong Kong.  Enduring the upheavals of colonialism, the Chinese revolution, the Japanese occupation and subsequent World War II atrocities, and the postwar rise of drug trafficking, graft, corruption, and the triads, Sister Maria and Stewart separately experience the myriad influences affecting both everyday life and business life in China and Hong Kong.  Their different responses to these influences reflect both the tumult and vibrancy of the community, and give a broad scope to Lanchester's vision. Dawn Stone, an ambitious journalist whose career in Hong Kong is encapsulated for fifty pages at the beginning of the novel (a mystifying digression, it seems, at first), plays a role at the end of the novel as the complexities of business life during the turnover become threatening.<br /><br />Filled with local color and the kind of detail accessible only to someone who has grown up in a place, Lanchester's novel vitalizes Hong Kong's life in both its glories and its sleaziness.  The characters vividly illustrate the attitudes common to the periods in which they appear, and the novel, which never loses sight of its goal to tell a good story well, is both exciting and enlightening.  A big novel in scope and ambition, I found it entertaining and stimulating, a wonderful read.  Mary Whipples novel vitalizes Hong Kong's life in both its glories and its sleaziness.

Ode to a Nightingale, which reflects John Keats's mournful state of mind in the face of the beauty and liveliness of nature, inspires the title of this sad but suspenseful book and parallels its melancholy tone.  McCabe, like Keats, is in the thrall of nature in this novel, but McCabe's nature is not sentimentalized.  Whatever beauty exists is wild, sometimes harsh and even savage, like the reality of life for the farm folk who populate the novel. Nature's everyday challenges are intensified here by the social and political challenges of Ireland in the 1880's:  Catholic vs. Protestant rivalries, the upheavals of Charles Stewart Parnell and the Fenians, the assassinations of British aristocrats, the legacy of the famine, and the tenuousness of life itself.<br /><br />Primarily a domestic drama, the novel describes one day in the life of Beth Winters, a Catholic in a community which is equally divided between Catholics and Protestants.  Depicting her cleverness and resilience in the face of her difficult farm life, McCabe focuses on her 25th birthday and the events which have led to the crisis which is the novel's focus--the circumstances of her birth, her abuse by her putative father, and her attraction to Liam Ward, a Protestant firebrand.  Full of local color, lively dialogue, sometimes mystifying dialect, and powerful nature imagery, Beth's personal drama achieves wider significance as the characters, confronting issues of life and death, separately reveal the inherent (natural) violence lurking in everyone just below the surface.  Political and religious rivalries complicate the personal conflicts between Beth, her father, and her lover, and the suspense builds to a crescendo.<br /><br />In terse prose which is so restrained that the reader must bring his/her own intelligence to the interpretation of the action, McCabe creates a final scene of devastating power, addressing the violence within us all and making it understandable, plausible, and ultimately shocking.  The traumas here are the traumas of real life, the characters are practical and tied to the earth, the prose is unburdened by excessive verbiage, and McCabe's message rings true.

Some of the great Nobel Prize winners of the early 20th century--Erwin Schrodinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, Johannes Stark, and Nils Bohr--play roles in this fascinating novel about the effort to unmask Klingsor, codename for the prominent scientist believed to have overseen and approved Nazi Germany's research into an atomic weapon.  Gustav Links, a German physicist, is co-operating with Francis Bacon, a young  scientist and OSS officer, just after the Nuremberg Trials, as he tries to identify Klingsor.<br /><br />The novel, supposedly Links's journal about the search, is both intelligent and unusual.  Links applies scientific laws and their corollaries to the art of fiction, suggests scientific hypotheses which might be applicable to espionage, and reveals \\"autobiographical disquisitions: from set theory to totalitarianism,\\" along with discussions of parallel universes, game theory, and even the quest for the Holy Grail as described in Wagner's Parsifal.  The scientific discoveries of Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Planck, et. al., are presented clearly, so that even someone like me, who is neither a mathematician nor a scientist, can understand enough of the material to make the book and the search for Klingsor both tension-filled and exciting.  Two love stories--that of Links in the mid-1930's and of Bacon in 1946--provide breaks from the sometimes textbook-like disquisitions on physics.<br /><br />Volpi's language is rich in metaphor and often playful--an electron is described as a criminal who commits atrocities and slips away, and quantum mechanics as a police chief who wants to nab him during that \\"one brief instant, when someone is able to make out his silhouette.\\"  And this simile may be unique: \\"He had behaved like a subatomic particle, subjecting himself to the imperious forces of bodies far more powerful than he.\\"<br /><br />Despite its cleverness, however, the book has some clumsy plotting and some dead-giveaway moments, which marred the narrative for me.  Links often sets up meetings with German scientists and then meets with Bacon to talk about the scientist's \\"file,\\" an artificial device which gives information to the reader but acts as a brake on the narrative.  At one point, Volpi even introduces a new character, who, at just the right moment, and \\"by pure coincidence...is transcribing Nazi party archives that were used during the Nuremberg Trials,\\" a report which is then analyzed, another narrative-slowing episode.<br /><br />Cliches are sometimes a problem.  One of the female characters, who, incidentally, will meet her lover only at night, says, \\"If you really love me, you have to promise me...that you'll always trust me,\\" then asks about the search for Klingsor and the scientists her lover has interviewed.  Amazingly, the  \\"intelligent\\" lover never gets suspicious, even when warned about her \\"Slavic accent,\\" and tells her everything, even bringing her into his interviews with Schrodinger and Bohr.  The unmasking of a \\"new\\" Klingsor in the conclusion does not surprise, nor does the identity. This is a very unusual and intriguing novel, however, incorporating fact, fiction, science, and philosophy in new ways, and readers interested in science and math may be so intrigued they'll willingly excuse any narrative lapses.

Strikingly different in tone from all the other Peter McGarr mysteries, this novel may have been a Gill experiment in the blackest of black humor.  It's a curiosity in the McGarr series, a wicked piece of work with some truly disgusting scenes, perhaps an attempt to mock the pseudo-realism of other mysteries and/or film, or, more likely, an attempt to imitate the dark satire of Jonathan Swift, whose work is featured throughout this novel about the murder of a man who regarded himself as the Dean's reincarnation.<br /><br />In the opening scene McGarr arrives at the estate of B.H.P. Herrick, the keeper of Marsh's Library of antique manuscripts in Dublin, finding find him nude and six days dead.  With a sort of ghoulish glee, Gill describes the macabre scene in minute detail, omitting none of the putrescent details.  Herrick was in the midst of a Frollick, \\"inspired by Swift,\\" a lurid carnal escapade in which Herrick quoted lines from Swift and which he videotaped, unwittingly recording his own agonizing death from poison.<br /><br />I concede that the book is clever, in that it incorporates some serious literary criticism about Swift's work, some of it obscure, in addition to discussions of Gulliver, the Brobdingnagians, the Yahoos, and the Houyhnhnms, and it does illustrate how the main character surrounded himself with the modern incarnations of these Swiftian creatures.  However, Gill's additional remarks about \\"excremental verse\\" and the Freudians, along with additional scenes of degradation, keep this grim and grisly little novel firmly mired in depths most readers do not expect of this series and will not want to explore.  1 star for subject matter, 2 stars for cleverness.

This deceptively complex and tension-filled Australian novel begins as the straightforward story of Mary Hare, a strange, half-mad spinster who lives in Xanadu, a crumbling \\"pleasure dome,\\" with the busybody Mrs. Jolley, a servant she fears.  At various times in her meanderings, Mary meets a kind laundress named Mrs. Godbold, who lives in a shed with her nine children; Alf Dubbo, an often-drunk aborigine artist; and Mordecai Himmelfarb, a Jewish concentration camp survivor who has emigrated to Australia and now works in a machine shop.<br /><br />In succeeding sections, in which these characters overlap, their intricate interior lives are developed in colorful, memorable detail, and the reader quickly sees that each is a lonely survivor of some traumatic experience which has made him/her question the nature of good and evil.  Each hopes to unravel some of the mysteries at the center of the universe.  Remarkably, all of them have experienced the same apocalyptic vision of a chariot being drawn by four horses galloping into a shimmering future.<br /><br />In the hands of a lesser writer, the characters, their daily lives, and their vision of the chariot might have been presented in a sentimental or romantic way, or even been used to illustrate the author's religious views.  But White's view of the chariot and its importance is far subtler--and more enigmatic--than that, and its role in the lives of these characters is both unsentimental and haunting.  Tantalizing parallels between the vision of the chariot and the mysteries of Revelations, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the Seven Seals, along with Biblical warnings about blood, fire, and destruction will keep a symbol-hunter totally engaged.  At the same time, more literal readers will find the stories and characters so firmly grounded in the reality of 1960's Australia, that they are captivating in their own right and may be taken, and thoroughly enjoyed, at face value.<br /><br />This is a huge novel, an old-fashioned saga of fascinating characters living their lives the best way they can, while wrestling with issues of epic significance.  The author's primary concern with telling a good story never falters, despite the overlay of mysticism, and the leisurely pace and fully realized dramatic action make this a totally fulfilling reading experience.

Israel Levis, a man of 58, returns to Habana in 1947, after ten years in Europe, still weak from his internment at Buchenwald.  A devout Catholic who was branded a Jew on the basis of his Catalan name, Levis escaped the worst of that work camp's horrors because the commandant knew he was a noted composer and pianist and assigned him to perform at Nazi gatherings.  Now old before his time and living with a servant and maid in the old family home in Habana, Levis tries to distill some sort of meaning about art, love, and God from his experiences in Europe and from his long career as a musician/composer.<br /><br />This is a difficult task. He has spent a lifetime avoiding personal decisions, letting life happen to him, and remaining passive when faced with those moments which make life meaningful for most of us.  As he and the reader review those pivotal moments in which he failed to act, we have an opportunity to see how these events, when taken cumulatively, have led to his ultimate loneliness and despair.<br /><br />Unlike most novels, in which the reader is drawn into the action and participates in events with the main character, this novel, though assured and beautifully written, keeps the reader at a distance, feeling more like a biography written by a detached observer than a novel.  This is completely consistent with Levis's uninvolved personality, but it leads to a novel which, though full of melancholy and moving in its depiction of a man who just can't make important commitments, lacks the action, interactive conflict, confrontation, and narrative movement which make novels memorable for many of us. Despite Levis's connections with Al Jolson, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Charlie Chaplin, Pablo Picasso, and a host of other luminaries of the mid 20th century, which add color and give context to Levis's expatriate life in Paris, this novel remained for me more like a black and white film than the lively and colorful evocation of Cuban music and its importance to music history that I had expected from its reviews.

If you are already a fan and need a Moore \\"fix,\\" this novel will keep you thoroughly occupied with its wacky charm, its light-hearted approach to cosmic issues, and its skewed, but respectful, treatment of Native American life and traditions.  Coming after Practical Demonkeeping, his debut novel, it has many of the elements for which Moore has become so (justly) popular with his later novels, though its plot and characters are not as fully developed, and the book is not as outrageous or crazily funny as those.<br /><br />Sam Hunter, the main character, is a 35-year-old California insurance salesman, a Crow Indian whose real name is Sam Hunts Alone.  Having attacked a policeman as a teen, Sam became a fugitive from the Crow Agency, and now, twenty years later, leads a totally predictable, boring life--that is, until Old Man Coyote (the trickster), Sam's spiritual helper, arrives, bringing \\"chaos--the new order in his life.\\"<br /><br />A beautiful woman, her biker-druggie-ex-lover, and an assortment of wackos, stir up the action, as Sam tries to figure out who he really is and, with Coyote's \\"help,\\" learn what he is capable of.  Lots of wild action and some potentially hilarious scenes are reined in, a bit, by Moore's focus on Sam's Indian traditions and why they are, or should be, important to him, a subject serious enough to curtail the uninhibited flights of craziness that we now expect from Moore.  This is fun, but it's a somewhat more thoughtful novel, overall, than the outrageous, campy stories for which Moore is now famous.  Mary Whipple	2002-07-05

Setting this murder mystery in the early days of the Civil War, Parry effectively uses real people and events from this tumultuous period to add drama and strength to his mystery.  Including elderly Gen. Winfield Scott, arrogant Gen. George McClellan, and larcenous Sec. of War Simon Cameron in the novel, he allows his fictional characters to interact with them, drawing on the reader's existing knowledge and feelings about these real characters to lend credence to the invented story. And when he sends Capt. Abel Jones, the main character, on a carriage ride to Ford's Theater with troubled President Abraham Lincoln, he draws on our image of a national hero and his death to double the impact of the scene.<br /><br />The murder mystery itself is fairly traditional, but Parry's hero is unusual. Abel Jones, a Welsh immigrant, is a priggish and somewhat prejudiced man who participated in the horrors of war in India but who hates \\"the muchness of death.\\"  Fearful that a divided country will affect the dreams of immigrants, like him, to be \\"part of something great and vast, something mighty and yet undefined,\\" he reluctantly enlists in a Pennsylvania artillery company.  After nearly losing a leg in the Battle of Bull Run, he is assigned to the Ordinance Office in Washington, where, at the request of Gen. McClellan, he investigates the death of an abolitionist war hero from Philadelphia and uncovers all manner of corruption and profiteering connected to the highest levels of government.<br /><br />Though the story depends, to some extent, on our acceptance of stereotypes (the Irish drinker, the German housewife, snobbish Philadelphia society, corrupt politicians, the nouveau riche), Parry's effective incorporation of mountains of period detail elevates the novel, giving it a wider scope and capturing the reader's interest at levels beyond the mystery.  This is the first of a series of four Abel Jones mysteries--one a year since 1999--and with this winning main character and Civil War setting, Parry is not likely to run out of material anytime soon!

As the book opens, the rising sun illuminates membranes of dew, nebulae of fragrance, and clouds of pollen.  A pair of swifts, with a nest outside a chapel, converse about the dead man inside, while the not-yet-departed spirit of the man listens to the \\"music within the music.\\"  Details like these, in lesser hands, might presage the beginning of a heavy-duty Gothic romance, but here they introduce a lively and thought-provoking novel which investigates the serious themes of time, love, art, and science-and the role chance, fate, or coincidence plays in our lives.<br /><br />The dead man is Wilhelm Bolt, a reclusive scientist who has been living at Ekelund, an old estate, with his aged servant Andersen, many hives of bees, a talking ape,  a valuable art collection, piles of research documents, and a recently arrived grand-niece. Bolt has taken her in, hoping she will continue his research on the law of seriality, the strange conjunction of random events which we call coincidence, the opposite of causality.<br /><br />The book's structure itself illustrates seriality, four seemingly random and unconnected stories from different time periods, all of which have at least one character, object, and/or specific kind of music, art, or science in common.  As the novel moves from the present at Ekelund, to an 1898 shipwreck off a small Norwegian island, to 15th century Rome and Padova (a section which could have used some pruning), to a World War II research camp, the narratives feel completely different in focus, yet the reader's discovery of coincidences in them is startling, encouraging further examination and a search for more seriality.<br /><br />Time itself feels random here, descriptions sometimes repeat, and narrators and point of view suddenly change.  Ghosts, spirits, and voices appear and reappear.  Despite the romantic stories, Hansen's style is remarkably business-like, however--factual  and scientific in detail, rather than lyrical or flowery.  Because the overlaps in the stories are not emphasized--and are sometimes actually hidden in the middle of a sentence or paragraph-readers will want to stay alert and read carefully. The novel is loaded with wonderful observations, the individual stories are exciting, the scientific detail is fascinating, and the novel's focus is unique, making this a stimulating read, one of my favorites for the year.

Resembling both McEwan's Atonement and Frayn's Spies in its plot, this 1953 novel, recently reprinted, tells of a pre-adolescent's naive meddling in the love lives of elders, with disastrous results.  Set in the summer of 1900, when the hopes and dreams for the century were as yet untarnished by two world wars and subsequent horrors, this novel is quietly elegant in style, its emotional upheavals restrained, and its 12-year-old main character, Leo Colston, so earnest, hopeful, and curious about life that the reader cannot help but be moved by his innocence.<br /><br />Leo's summer visit to a friend at Brandham Hall introduces him to the landed gentry, the privileges they have assumed, and the strict social behaviors which guide their everyday lives.  Bored and wanting to be helpful when his friend falls ill, Leo agrees to be a messenger carrying letters between Marian, his host's sister, and Ted Burgess, her secret love, a farmer living nearby.  Catastrophe is inevitable--and devastating to Leo.  In descriptive and nuanced prose, Hartley evokes the heat of summer and the emotional conflicts it heightens, the intensity rising along with the temperature.  Magic spells, creatures of the zodiac, and mythology create an overlay of (chaste) paganism for Leo's perceptions, while widening the scope of Hartley's focus and providing innumerable parallels and symbols for the reader.<br /><br />The emotional impact of the climax is tremendous, heightened by the author's use of three perspectives--Leo Colston as a man in his 60's, permanently damaged by events when he was 12;  Leo as a 12-year-old, wrestling with new issues of class, social obligation, friendship, morality, and love, while inadvertently causing a  disaster; and the reader himself, for whom hindsight and knowledge of history create powerful ironies as he views these events and the way of life they represent.  Some readers have commented on Leo's unrealistic innocence in matters of sex, even as a 12-year-old, but this may be a function of age.  For those of us who can remember life without TV and the computer, it is not so far-fetched to imagine a life in which \\"mass communication\\" meant the telegraph and in which \\"spooning\\" was an adults-only secret!

Almost 40 years old, this novel has no scenes of violence or sex--or humor!  The language and style are very formal, and the characters, virtually all male, are generic, not individualized--not surprising in a culture in which \\"The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.\\"  Nearly all the characteristics one associates with the best modern mystery thrillers are absent here, yet Takagi's novel is fascinating and its plot intriguing, both for the inherent complexities and for the light shed on Japanese business and culture in 1965.<br /><br />When Shigeo Segawa, a failed stocktrader, is offered a job at an outrageous salary, he finds himself working, not surprisingly, as an industrial spy, ferreting secrets from Shichiyo Chemical, a company in which a college friend is a high official.  Segawa shows no qualms of conscience, despite the fact that Eiko, the love of his life, is now married to the friend.  Manipulating the women in his life, all of whom are regarded throughout the novel as brainless ornaments or conveniences, he also fails, eventually, at his spy tasks, becoming the prime suspect when his friend turns up murdered.  When two more deaths further implicate Segawa, Takagi shows his enormous skill at creating red herrings, using the intricacies of corporate Japan and the traditional restraint of police and prosecutors to keep the reader occupied and diverted.<br /><br />Differences in legal procedures are stunning here.  The police abandon the crime scene because \\"people were showing up to pay respects [to the widow]...and the atmosphere was no longer suitable.\\"  Police and prosecutors make appointments to speak to clients' lawyers and wait patiently till they can be seen.  The police give details of confessions to people they are interviewing and seem to share information with whoever wants it. Industrial espionage by itself is not a crime. Careful readers may figure out early who is responsible for the murders, but this novel provides unusual glimpses of Japanese culture, enough to keep a curious reader fascinated and involved till the end.

1497803:US	49273674	R35DL4PBDRBZCB	038071129X	90212641	The Death of a Joyce Scholar: A Peter McGarr Mystery	Books	4	19	19	N	N	One of the best of the Peter McGarr series.	If you don't know Irish detective Peter McGarr, this terrific novel from 1989 is a great introduction!  Where else but Dublin might you find a James Joyce scholar dead, and McGarr and the Murder Squad of the Garda Siochana reading Ulysses, and occasionally Samuel Beckett, in an effort to understand what led to his death?  Including brief quotations from Ulysses in this novel, Gill locates the action in places which are significant in Ulysses, talks about Finnegan's Wake, and even discusses \\"the novel of competence,\\" represented by Joyce, as opposed to \\"the novel of incompetence,\\" represented by Samuel Beckett, making these esoteric subjects comprehensible and intriguing.<br /><br />Dublin throbs with life here, in the pubs, on the streets, in the university, and at galleries, the Shelbourne Hotel, and St. Michan's church.  The action is robust, with many fights, fractures, and a few hospitalizations, as McGarr and his detectives concentrate more on justice than on the niceties of procedure.  The characters we know from earlier novels are further developed here (and continue into later novels).<br /><br />As always, Gill includes lively and wonderfully droll conversations--the teasing and byplay one expects of close and caring relationships--both at home and at the Garda station.  And when Det. Hugh Ward and Det. Ruthie Bresnahan finally discover each other, one of the highlights of this novel, their scenes become both hilarious and steamy.  Gill's excellent satire (the Beautiful People at a book-launching), his wonderful sense of the absurd (the murder victim's wife bringing the victim home, laying him in bed, and contacting McGarr only after he starts to \\"go off\\"), and his uncanny ability to create quirky and likable characters make this one of the best novels in this remarkable series.

Dan Sickles was a brilliant manipulator who managed to get his own way whenever it counted, pulling strings, bending the truth, ignoring the facts, and turning on his charm, full-force.  Not content just to win, Sickles wanted also to convince those who opposed him that they were wrong, and to destroy whatever and whoever got in his way.  Manipulating public opinion and the opinion of his superiors, including Presidents, he kept himself constantly in the limelight, and even when he went on trial for a cold-blooded murder, he managed to come out a popular winner, the first defendant ever to use temporary insanity as a defense.<br /><br />Described as charming, bright, gregarious, eloquent, profligate with money (sometimes other people's), and sexually voracious, he also had a streak of cold-blooded cruelty, as his poor young wife discovered, when, after his countless infidelities, she sought solace with Barton Key, only to have Key waylaid by a Sickles friend and shot multiple times, point-blank, by Sickles.  A Tammany Hall insider and New York politician, Sickles thrived on the excitement and debate in Washington in the years immediately before the outbreak of the Civil War. Here Keneally does a remarkable job of presenting complex issues clearly, and of personalizing the trauma of war and its emotional devastation.<br /><br />Though some Civil War buffs have questioned a few details in Keneally's descriptions of battles in which Gen. Sickles participated, these scenes are not the major part of this book.  His maltreatment of his wife, from her marriage at 16 until her death from tuberculosis at age 31, is also a focus, as are the murder of Key, Sickles's trial, and, after the war, his continuing involvement with Presidents and his missions to Panama, Colombia, and Spain.  Sickles is an unlikable character, presented with all his flaws, and Keneally vividly illustrates this man's successes and their costs to others.  Mary Whipple	2002-06-25

Writing one of the must unusual and imaginative books I've read in a long time, Flanagan presents a multi-leveled novel which is full of wry, sometimes hilarious, observations about people and history, at the same time that it is a scathing indictment of colonialism's cruelties and its prison system, in particular.  Almost schizophrenic in its approach, the novel jerks the reader back and forth from delighted amusement to horrified revulsion in a series of episodes that clearly parallel the unstable inner life of main character William Buelow Gould, who lives in  \\"a world that demanded reality imitate fiction.\\"<br /><br />Sentenced to life imprisonment on an island off the coast of Tasmania, Gould cleverly plays the survival game, ingratiating himself with the authorities through his willingness to paint whatever they want-species of fish for the surgeon, fake Constable landscapes for the turnkey Pobjoy, murals for the Commandant's great Mah-jong Hall, and backdrops for his railroad to nowhere.  It is through the fish paintings that Gould paints for himself, however, that he tries to hang onto his sanity against overwhelming cruelty, continuing to believe that life has meaning, though \\"[it] is a mystery...and love the mystery within the mystery.\\"<br /><br />This is not an easy book.  The action, such as it is, is all filtered through Gould's mind, and that is shaky, at best.  In a few passages, Gould (and Hammett, the speaker who opens the novel) describe dream-like reactions to events, reflecting their mental states (not magic realism).  When the last hundred pages become surreal, the reader is well-prepared to accept the strange events which unfold.  Flanagan's novel is very clever, and his use of specific fish as parallels to the people and events within chapters (especially the serpent eel) is particularly amusing.  His characteristically 19th century list of topics at the beginning of each chapter, his duplication of the writing style of the period, his satire, his literary jokes (purple sea urchin ink for \\"purple prose,\\" jokes about George Keats's brother, a failed poet), and his broad vision of what makes life meaningful are signs of a mature novelist who doesn't hesitate to take chances--5 stars for originality!

Long fascinated with the subject of man-eating lions, Philip Caputo does not pretend to be an expert on them, the environment, or African affairs.  In fact, his lack of expertise and his desire to learn give this book some of its appeal and make it totally accessible, even to the most scientifically challenged reader.  Consulting experts from Chicago's Field Museum and from the University of Minnesota, before, during, and after two trips he makes to Kenya's Tsavo National Park, Caputo immerses himself in their research, familiarizing the reader, in the process, with the lions, their behavior, and their controversies.<br /><br />Far more apt to attack and eat humans than are the Serengeti plains lions, the man-eaters of Tsavo are giants, much longer from nose to tail, much taller at the shoulder, and 100 - 150 pounds heavier than the plains lions, and the males are often maneless.  Caputo's experts strongly disagree on whether these giant lions differ simply because they have adapted to the hotter climate of Tsavo and their need to kill Cape buffalo for food, or whether, in fact, they represent a missing link between modern lions and the maneless cave lions of the Pleistocene era, which roamed throughout the Near East and Africa.<br /><br />Stories of famous man-eaters of the past hundred years, including two which killed 135 people in 1898, and one 550-pounder from 1991, add drama and excitement to the narrative. But Caputo also ranges widely into peripheral, more personal subjects--why he believes hunters are closer to nature than are photographers, why tracking a lion on foot for four days is a more divine experience than using a vehicle, evolution vs. creationism, cloning, science vs. faith, and even his nightmares.  Ultimately, the book is as much about Caputo as about the lions, who remain a mystery. \\"The truth is,\\" he concludes, \\"I don't want to learn anything more about lions, but am content...to keep some blank spots blank; after all, those are what excite the imagination.\\"  Mary WhippleMary Whipple	2002-06-20

Often described as a light-hearted \\"riff,\\" rather than a satire, this novel of government and politics casts an eye on the Secret Service and its all-too-human agents.  Working to protect an unnamed Vice-Presidential candidate on a pre-primary visit to New Hampshire, the assigned agents are also dealing simultaneously with their own insecurities, quirks, and numerous dysfunctions.  As this wry novel evolves, the reader discovers that the differences between those we employ to protect us and those we want to be protected from may be very slim, indeed.<br /><br />Half a dozen Secret Service members, their spouses, parents, children, and lovers;  an equal number of computer programmers for Big If, a multiplayer war game on the Web;  and the Vice-President, his staff, and campaign workers constitute a huge cast of characters, but each is so idiosyncratic, and the minutiae of his/her daily life so completely articulated, that the characters are memorable, if not fully developed.  As Costello expands his scope beyond that of the campaign, he  pokes fun at child-rearing practices, prison work-release programs, the real estate market, the expectations of newly-moneyed trophy wives, the addiction to violent computer games, and even the get-out-the-vote efforts of campaign volunteers.<br /><br />The reader must be patient with this novel. Plot is not a major concern, as the book meanders through the lives and backgrounds of multiple characters.  Vi Asplund, the main character, receives only slightly more emphasis than other characters, and conflict and dramatic action are minimal, dependent more upon the characters' past histories than upon new events. Delightful metaphors (\\"a tall, soft sofa of a boy,\\" \\"a snippy poodle kind of sneeze\\") are sprinkled throughout, but they are sometimes buried in long lists of detail.  The humor often feels self-conscious.  This is a most unusual novel, one which defies the conventions and pushes the boundaries, and I suspect that few readers will remain neutral about it.

I can't recall a recent book in which so many professional reviewers find so many different messages at the heart of the story... It's not that Redhill is vague or obscure;  in fact, multiple messages are probably what he was hoping for.<br /><br />Integrating all these themes into a deceptively simple story, Redhill emphasizes that for each of us, our past always shapes our understanding of the present.  Martin Sloane, a fifty-ish artist who creates enigmatic boxes, and Jolene Iolas, a college student who falls in love with him and his artwork, speak to the reader unpretentiously about the past and present, and one quickly identifies with them, falling into the rhythm of their alternating voices.  Martin's inexplicable disappearance from Jolene's apartment and Jolene's renewed search for him many years later provide a framework for the story, along with unlimited opportunities for the author to explore themes of love and loss, home and family, death and dying, childhood and memory, and, most of all, our personal identities as a result of our separate pasts. As the reader filters the separate and combined stories of Martin and Jolene through his/her own past experiences, s/he also distills from the author's themes whatever personal messages are relevant, pertinent, or even unique for him.<br /><br />Redhill's background as a poet is obvious here.  His ability to compress allows him to pack short scenes with big meanings, to ensure that every detail advances his story and themes, and to create fresh images which allow the reader to see common experiences in new ways.  Wonderful, pithy observations keep the reader energized and involved on many levels, while an intriguing mystery maintains the suspense.  Though a transition might help to avoid some minor confusion (eventually resolved) in a couple of scenes, and a few questions of character remain unresolved, this is an amazing debut novel, one of the year's most enjoyable for me.

Though Durham's anti-slavery message provides the framework for this affecting and beautifully written narrative, it is his message of hope and his recognition of the abiding kinship among men, even within the shadows of slavery's cruelty, which are his ultimate lessons.  Setting his story just prior to the Civil War, in and around cities in the mid-Atlantic states, where the ownership of humans was more a convenience than an economic necessity, Durham conveys his story in strong, clean prose, using carefully selected details, rather than emotional language, to power the narrative.  His resilient characters give the story the dignity it deserves.<br /><br />William, owned by the cruel St. John Humboldt, becomes a slave Everyman when he escapes and tries to reach Pennsylvania, a free state where he hopes to find his beloved Dover, who is expecting his child.  His travails are those of all slaves, and Durham uses them to show the myriad ways men exert power over others--as well as the ways good men can show their shared humanity.  Betrayal, imprisonment, torture, sexual assault, and many other forms of degradation enter the story as William tries to deny his fate.  In a parallel narrative, Andrew Morrison, an immigrant whose early experiences in Scotland and America are similar to William's, describes his dogged search for William until they meet in a concluding showdown.<br /><br />Nature symbolism, most notably that of snakes and crows, combines with some wonderful images (\\"his eyes were small things, two tadpoles slipped between his eyelids\\") to give depth and color to Durham's style.  Despite his subject matter, he largely avoids sensationalism because he is more concerned with the characters' realistic reactions to horrific events than with descriptions of the horrors themselves--until the end.  There the story finally succumbs to melodrama and excessive coincidence in a conclusion that may be a bit too easy to satisfy some of his new fans.  Mary Whipple	2002-06-14

Gill's novels are always fun because they revolve around aspects of Irish life not usually incorporated into mystery stories--eel-fishing, secret Catholic societies, literary history, and in this case, the serious business of salmon-fishing and fly-tying.  Well drawn, repeating characters, lyrical descriptions of Ireland's rural charms, pitch-perfect vernacular and syntax, big dollops of humor, and a graceful incorporation of the mythology and history which infuses Irish culture intrigue the reader on levels other than plot.<br /><br />This novel reflects all of these characteristics to some degree, but the mystery at the heart of this novel is thinner and less complex than in some of Gill's other novels.  Focusing on the death of famed salmon-fisherman Nellie Millar in Donegal's Owenea River, Gill employs a limited cast of characters, each of whom has a reason to resent and or even kill Nellie, who is a former lover of Supt. Peter McGarr of the Garda Siochana.  McGarr (now suspended) and his wife Noreen, along with acting Supt. Hugh Ward and his former lover, Det. Ruthie Bresnahan, find themselves helping unofficially in the investigation of Nellie's death and lending moral support to Nellie's bereft father.<br /><br />The usually intense and idiosyncratic behavior of McGarr and his staff, which so often animates Gill's novels and keeps the reader involved and intrigued, is absent here.  The wild nights and fights, the circumventions of the law to achieve a greater good, and the threats to the safety of McGarr, his staff, and their families, which usually keep the reader on edge, are missing.  Though written in beautiful prose, this plot is more formulaic--and the characters' more predictable--than is customary for Gill.  It's fun to read, but not Gill's best.  Mary Whipple	2002-06-12

So powerful that it will take your breath away, this finely crafted novel deserves to be resurrected from the oblivion in which it now resides.  Carefully choosing a form which perfectly suits his message, Edric presents a shocking and graphic account of the genocide of the aborigines in Tasmania by British imperialists in the 1860's.<br /><br />The novel consists of a series of voices and vignettes--local Tasmanian newspaper reporters claiming William Lanne, the last full-blooded aborigine male, to be a fraud;  rough, illiterate soldiers \\"interviewing\\" the better educated Lanne;  acculturated mixed-blood aborigines rejecting their own culture and bowing low to the British, while advising their peers to cooperate;  others still living in the bush and practicing their old ways (and an occasional murder);  British administrators mockingly calling Lanne \\"King Billy\\" and subjecting him to scientific experiments and bodily \\"mapping.\\"  One of Edric's strengths here is the ironic detachment with which he presents these voices, not always telling the reader who they are, requiring the reader to figure it out from the treatment which is accorded to each speaker over the course of the novel.<br /><br />Gradually, a story emerges, and the reader comes to sympathize with Lanne, who walks the fine line between his love of his own people and culture and his desire to prevent additional bloodshed.  He is being interviewed, photographed, and measured by James Fairfax, a pretentious scientist who treats him as an exhibit, the last of his people--all others forced to live, subjugated and degraded, as mixed breeds under the rule of the colonial administrator or dead from government-sanctioned operations, such as the Black Line, which twice swept up and killed every native in the way of a line of marching soldiers.  Vacillating between the city, the hut where he lives with three old aborigine women, and the bush, where some of his friends are hiding in caves and rescuing bones from the graveyard, Lanne is truly a man between cultures.<br /><br />Though the contrasts between the ways of the aborigines and the ways of the British are very dramatic, Edric is not a sentimentalist.  Aborigines who, in frustration, resort to murder are presented with the same detachment as are brutal soldiers, who sadistically torment the innocent.  And it is this detachment which is the novel's strength--it is the reader who draws the conclusions and fills in the blanks, the reader who recognizes symbols and is struck by their power, and the reader who eventually draws all the conclusions.

In this remarkable and hugely conceived novel of ideas, Pears gives us three intense, emotionally gripping stories set in Provence during the fifth, fourteenth, and 20th centuries.  In each of these, a sensitive and thoughtful man of letters faces not only a crisis of belief, but also of action, as outside forces threaten to destroy civilization as he knows it.  As each man fights to save the values he finds important, Pears explores the ethical underpinnings of western thought and history, those ideas first proffered by Plato which continue to influence men and governments two thousand years later.<br /><br />A mysterious 5th century manuscript by Manlius Hippomanes connects the parallel plots and eras:  the waning days of the Roman Empire, as the barbarian hordes attack Gaul's borders and Manlius Hippomanes writes The Dream of Scipio;  the 14th century in Avignon, when poet Olivier de Noyen discovers some of Manlius's writing and deals with papal intrigue, the Hundred Years War, and the Black Death;  and the Vichy government in France during World War II, when Julien Barneuve, a scholar who has traced the Manlius manuscript, joins the Vichy government in an effort to \\"civilize\\" the German occupiers and prevent deportation of the Jews.<br /><br />This is not a beach book--its excitement is far more thoughtful than sensational.  Pears' characters are real, flawed people living and loving in times of crisis and experiencing conflicts with parents, teachers, friends, and mentors.  These conflicts clearly parallel those in the wider world of their political alliances and governments, and ultimately affect their attitudes toward humankind in general.  Beautiful love stories, which bring warmth to the narrative, are portrayed with the delicacy such fragile relationships deserve and the strength which allows them to endure.  As we, too, face uncertain times and threats to our own civilization, Pears offers a reflective and thought-provoking framework for contemplating our own future.  Mary Whipple.

This imaginative first novel takes us into the mind of the anonymous (and now famous) Chinese student who stood his ground against an oncoming tank in Tiananmen Square during the massacre of students in June, 1989.  Creating a persona he calls Xiao-Di, author Cheng depicts him as a former Cornell student, unable to find work upon his return home to Beijing.  The obvious contrasts illustrated by Xiao-Di's experiences in Ithaca vs. Beijing are given broader scope when Cheng also takes us into the minds of two more characters:  Xiao-Di's brother Lu, a short-tempered, brawling member of the Red Army, who is eventually sent to find and arrest his brother;  and Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, whom we see conversing with the ghost of Mao while he determines to end the embarrassing student demonstrations by force, if necessary.<br /><br />Cheng has chosen to depict his characters in ways that make them feel familiar.  Lu is a hothead just like the hotheads we all know, though certainly more violent, while Xiao-Di is a frustrated, out-of-work graduate with little idea of where his future will take him, not unlike other recent graduates.  Deng Xiao-ping is seen as a fond and caring father to his son, and his decision about the students is seen as a difficult one. By taking us into the minds of these characters, Cheng creates a sense of immediacy and urgency, and as the forces leading up to the demonstrations develop and then take on a life of their own, he successfully evokes a \\"You Are There\\" atmosphere.<br /><br />Though some readers may find this approach to be praiseworthy, others may find it limiting.

Almost claustrophobic in its intensity, Tsypkin's recreation of the frustration, and even paranoia, of Dostoevsky during one summer in Baden-Baden, in which he attempts to gamble his way out of debt, is a masterpiece, newly published twenty years after its author's death.  With sensitivity and a feeling for suffering which may have come from similar frustration, Tsypkin reveals Dostoevsky's inner life, showing us a sensitive but driven man who is also insecure, rude, and arrogant, a man who dominates his wife, a man who suffers from the aftereffects of his imprisonment and his epilepsy, a man virulently anti-Jewish and anti-German and in the grip of compulsive gambling--and a man with whom every reader will ultimately feel empathy, if not complete sympathy.<br /><br />The story line is deceptively simple. An unidentified narrator, a great admirer of Dostoevsky, is traveling by train to various sites associated with Dostoevsky.  As he travels, he reads a Dostoevsky novel, musing about characters in Dostoevsky's novels and events in his life, his honeymoon and marriage, his remarkably supportive second wife, and his associations or wished-for associations with other Russian authors, such as Turgenev.  The narrator's additional musings on the forces which eventually impel some later  authors, like Solzhenitsyn, to seek exile, while other authors remain behind, bring Russian literary history up to date, expanding the novel's scope beyond that of Dostoevsky and his contemporaries and giving some historical context to Tsypkin's own writing.<br /><br />Contributing to the dark and intense moodiness of the novel is its style.  Single sentences, full of unique images but sometimes two pages long, drive the narrative and the reader along, with the insistence of the train ride which opens the novel.  Because each of these sentences is often a single, extended paragraph, there are almost no visual breaks to provide respite from solid type, which completely fills each page and compels the reader to read every word.  The writing is so strong, so energetic, and so fresh, however, that most readers will find themselves speeding to keep up with the narrative, the grayness of the text disappearing as Tsypkin's lively images emerge and his characters come to life.  This is a challenging and utterly fascinating novel, a startling new work which has earned a place in Russian literary history.  Mary Whippleder to read every word.

The goal of the Weber-Vedder research team goes way beyond the single-minded documentation of one species:  they study not only the life of the mountain gorilla, but also their changing habitat and the needy humans who share it.  Amy Vedder is a biologist, her husband Bill Weber a social scientist, and their multidisciplinary approach to conservation offers a fresh look at opportunities to create win-win situations for both the animals and the humans who live near them.<br /><br />In a lively and fast-paced narrative, Weber and Vedder document threats to the gorillas from 1978  1992, presenting graphic accounts of animals injured by snares, beheaded by poachers, exposed to diseases borne by humans, allowed to die for lack of medical care, and forced to live in ever decreasing habitats, with more and more limited food supplies. Working first with Dian Fossey, whose battles with the bottle and mental illness are well documented, they eventually found the Mountain Gorilla Project, working with local governments and international foundations to develop educational programs, slow down the devastation of forests to create farmland, and make Rwandans proud of the unique environment they share with the animal world.<br /><br />The outbreak of the Rwandan civil war in 1993, and the ensuing genocide of over a million people, which no western nation or the U.N. intervened to prevent, are depicted dramatically, emotionally, and thoroughly, as the research team returns to Rwanda to find their workers dead, missing, or in jail.  Ironically, the gorillas are thriving.  As the country tries to heal its wounds and rebuild, the authors comment about values:  \\"There are more than a few Rwandans who wonder if the Western world would have intervened more quickly and forcefully if mountain gorillas, rather than Africans, were being slaughtered in 1994.\\"  In Rwanda, it may be the humans who are the more fragile species in this dangerous land.

If you think of Tibet as a place of mystery and mysticism, an ethereal and other-worldly place which rejects the physical world in favor of the spiritual, you are in for some huge surprises when you read this book.  Set during the early to mid-20th century, this novel by a Tibetan author feels medieval, revealing a feudal society of tribal chieftains and their internecine rivalries, complete with intrigue, murder, vengeance, double-crosses, and a callous disregard of life and limb.<br /><br />In short, simple sentences, easy vocabulary, and straightforward style befitting the subject matter, Alai tells the history of the Maichi family, depicting a family of rulers who believe only in power--\\"You can ride [your slaves] like horses or beat them like dogs, but you must never treat them like humans.\\"  Hands are cut off, tongues are cut out, enemies are beheaded, hungry people are used as pawns and allowed to starve, children are beaten for playing.  Though the Living Buddha and several lamas play roles in the novel, they are not a dominant, or even a moderating, force, appearing to be more like soothsayers than real religious leaders.  One lama even remarks, \\"Instead of teaching us to love, why must religion teach us to hate?\\"<br /><br />Almost cartoon-like with its shallow, black-and-white characters, its good guys vs. bad guys action scenes, and its high quotient of blood and guts, the novel is stunning in its total disregard for the value of life.  When, at the end, the revolutionary Red Chinese emerge victorious in the nearby Chinese provinces and begin to exert power over the Tibetan chieftains, the reader is stunned by the irony--we know the Red Chinese historical record, but here they seem more idealistic and far more concerned with the lives of the common man than the chieftains do. I found this a disturbing book, one which offers few references to a \\"soft,\\" cultural side of Tibet, such as its music, art, religion, and literature.  Mary Whipple	2002-05-26

A mother's agonized attempt to help to her 19-year-old daughter Norah, a drop-out who now begs on a street corner while wearing a sign saying \\"Goodness\\" around her neck, provides the framework for Shields's thoughtful and sensitive look at women's roles and the juggling acts they sometimes require.  Reta Winters, a successful writer, believes at first that by writing a bright, perky novel about \\"lost children and goodness and going home,\\" she will be \\"remaking the untenable world through the nib of a pen.\\"  But real life--and Shields's real novel--are, of course, much more complex than that.<br /><br />Despite the support of her two younger and very caring daughters, her empathetic husband, her friends, and Danielle Westerman, the French feminist whose books she has translated, Kate nevertheless discovers that trying to help a child who will not be helped is a terrible loneliness to bear: \\"I need to know I'm not alone in what I apprehend, this awful incompleteness that has been alive inside me all this time.\\"  Evaluating her life as a wife, writer, friend, mother, and, increasingly, feminist, Kate allows us to share her inner life, both as it is revealed in her writing and as she wrestles with Norah's \\"hibernation\\" on the street corner.<br /><br />Filled with dazzling images (an idea that has \\"popped out of the ground like the rounded snout of a crocus on a cold lawn\\" ; women who have been \\"sent over to the side pocket of the snooker table and made to disappear\\"), this Shields novel is more meditative than many of her other novels.  \\"I've been trying to focus my thoughts on the immensity, rather than the particular,\\" Kate/Shields says.  As she inspires the reader to share this immensity, she provides insights into the essence of who we are and who be might become.  Mary Whipple	2002-05-20

Evoking a dark world of violence and doom from the outset, Hooper sets her debut novel in Tasmania, a remote former penal colony where the aborigine population was eliminated by genocide and prisoners were subjected to unspeakable cruelty.  Mystery, deception, and betrayal are at the heart of three stories told simultaneously.  A children's tale written by 4th grade teacher Kate Byrne uses animals to tell about a 1983 murder (hence, the title);  a popular novel written by Veronica Marne,  the wife of Kate's lover, Thomas Marne, describes the same murder;  and the on-going triangle of Kate, Veronica, and Thomas provides the day-to-day action.<br /><br />This is a lot to cover in 230 pages.  In order to tell Kate's story and provide the background of her affair with Thomas Marne, Hooper must give many flashbacks while simultaneously revealing Kate's life in the classroom, her trysts with Thomas, and the perceived threats to her life.  The suspense depends on the reader's seeing parallels between Kate's affair and that of the 1983 victim, Ellie Siddells, so Kate, as narrator, must also provide information about Ellie's background and her murder.  The animal story is yet another level of abstraction which the reader must correlate with Kate's life.<br /><br />Though the novel is filled with dazzling descriptions and some insightful observations about childhood, the novel ultimately ends up being talky, its three stories overwhelming its characters and obscuring its focus.  The narrator, Kate, dictates and talks about the action, instead of bringing it to life, and the reader never really gets to know her.  Plot and suspense are the novel's focus at the beginning, while Kate's (undeveloped) character and her coming of age are the focus at the end, a problem which makes the author's overall purpose unclear.  The quality of the writing and some gorgeous descriptive paragraphs will take your breath away, however, and perhaps leave you as anxious as I am to see what Hooper does in her next novel.

Though this intriguing picaresque novel is full of esoteric pursuits in late 18th century France, the novel is remarkably accessible and great fun to read.  Claude Page, a 12-year-old farm boy of huge imagination and intelligence, is \\"adopted\\" by the Count of Tournay, a defrocked priest who studies \\"everything from the grandeur of the heavens to the minutiae of the terrestrial world.\\" In reality, he is training Claude to be an enameler of pornographic watches.  As Claude pursues his interest as a \\"mechanician,\\" the reader is introduced to many facets of society and the forces which animate them.<br /><br />Kurzweil obviously delights in playing games with the reader, breaking down defenses and challenging expectations.  In an early scene, for example, a surgeon's removal of \\"the devil's handiwork\\" from a child stimulates our sensibilities and anticipates our revulsion.  Then Kurzweil jerks the chain and shows us who is in control.  In serious or scholarly scenes, he lightens the mood with puns, word play, and jokes, some clever, some groaners--a nobleman's motto, \\"Born to Serve,\\" refers to his tennis abilities; an expert in insanity is named Battie.  Unique images provide constant surprises and vitalize his descriptions--\\"[The sound of] feet walking through snow was indistinguishable from the noise when the baker squeezed a sack of cornstarch\\"; \\"her costume was a taxidermist's dream.\\"<br /><br />Kurzweil's ability to bring this period to life in a context accessible to the reader is daunting.  Gracefully incorporating such diverse subjects as the enameling process, watchmaking, contemporary 18th century science and philosophy, and love of pornography, Kurzweil makes these esoteric subjects come alive, not because they are so alluring to the reader, but because they are important to the characters, whose lives are intriguing and whose problems, despite the 18th century context, are nevertheless universal.

Though some of his settings feel a bit reminiscent of Agatha Christie, Gill writes for a totally different audience--readers who do not shy away from realistically depicted (and sometimes gratuitous) violence, who do not expect the police to be models of probity, and who want their mysteries to be more than simple whodunits.  In this 1996 combination of modern mystery and World War II thriller, set off the coast of County Mayo, Gill tells the tale of Clement Ford, a mystery man with a hoard of hidden treasure.  Ford has just been tracked down by his old enemy, Angus Rehm, and the result is three deaths, three disappearances, two missing boats, and the arrival of Chief Inspector Peter McGarr from the Garda Siochana and his detectives, each of whom is also dealing with personal problems--alcohol, illicit affairs, and the demands of family--while trying to solve the mystery.<br /><br />Local beliefs and superstitions, ancient history and pagan monuments, the geological record, and family history are interwoven with the more modern attitudes toward religion, the British, and authority in general, as Gill creates a lively \\"personality\\" for Clare Island.  The mystery develops a global scope as Clement Ford's true identity and his World War II connections to Angus Rehm emerge in the final pages.<br /><br />One of a long series of engaging Peter McGarr mysteries with a cast of well-developed repeating characters, Gill focuses on some intriguing aspect of Irish history and culture in each (e.g. eel-fishing, secret religious societies, literary history).  The novels written prior to the recent Death of an Irish Sinner can be read in any order, but events in the latter are so explosive that it is difficult to go back if you read Irish Sinner too soon.  The series is a fascinating look at Ireland and its characters--great fun and great escape reading.  Mary Whipple	2002-05-07

A gentleness and warmth infuse this paean to small town Irish life and the usually loving connections among the residents.  Almost plotless in the traditional sense, the book achieves surprising power through its sensitive and sometimes humorous portrayals of \\"everyday\\" characters as they work their land, respond to the needs of their neighbors, celebrate milestones, and observe the lyrically described changes in flora and fauna around the lake during one year.  It's a magnificent novel, a testament (and, unfortunately, perhaps also a memorial) to a vanishing way of life and the enduring connections, both among men and with the land, which have shaped the Irish character and spawned its traditions.<br /><br />The Ruttledges have returned to Ireland after advertising careers in London, renewing connections with their kin and settling \\"by the lake,\\" where they are greeted first by Jamesie Murphy and his wife Mary, who bring food, and then by the unforgettable roue of the village, John Quinn, who wants them to find him a wife from out of town, as he's already too well known to be successful in his own village.  Other characters, each unique, give color and a sense of reality to life by the lake:  Jimmy Joe McKiernan, the local Provo leader who led the breakout from Long Kesh;  the pathetic Bill Evans, an orphan brought up by the nuns, then farmed out to an unfeeling family to work when he was 14;  Cecil Pierce, the local Protestant;  Johnny Murphy, Jamesie's brother, who visits each summer from London, where he lives in relative exile after being dumped by the woman he loved;  the Shah, a Ruttledge relative who became hugely successful in the junk business;  Patrick Ryan, who never seems to finish the building projects he's doing for his neighbors;  and many others who illustrate the charms and frustrations of small town life and the forces which have shaped it.  Significantly, all the main characters are middle-aged or older, the young having been lured already to big cities.  As one character says, \\"After us there'll be nothing but the water hen and swan.\\"<br /><br />As the reader shares the passage of the year with the residents, observing the celebrations of birth, the rites of death, and the homely activities which give meaning to life by the lake, it's impossible not to feel a sense of profound melancholy and to mourn the loss of this rapidly disappearing life.  As McGahern himself says, \\"[The days] did not feel particularly quiet or happy, but through them ran the sense...that there would come a time when these days would be looked back on as happiness, all that life could give of contentment and peace.\\" With its profound openness to the sensations of the moment, its constant awareness of even the subtlest changes in nature, and its joy in human connections, it's a life which few harried city dwellers ever know.

In this novel of enormous reach, Coe attempts to give epic significance to the 1970's in Birmingham, England.  Abandoning the extremely tight, limited focus he employed in The House of Sleep, Coe here employs a huge cast of characters, eight or ten of them teenagers (somewhat difficult to keep track of because they are not yet fully formed or unique), along with their parents and  their parents' lovers, their brothers and sisters and the brothers' and sisters' lovers, and their teachers and some of their lovers.<br /><br />Starting with a meeting in 2003 between the adult children of some of the characters from the 1970's, the novel switches back and forth in time through several different points of view, offering insights about what has happened in the interim.  The teenagers' lives are depicted in minute detail as they work on school magazines, collect new rock albums, create their own bands, score with girlfriends, and do all the superficial things teenagers do the world over, told from the well-developed, if not particularly compelling, perspective of the `70's.<br /><br />Coe can be very funny, and his view of teenage life is often amusing, but the teenagers also reveal their intolerance of differences, their casual cruelty, doubts about religion, ignorance of the political system, and general insulation from the forces which are shaping their world.  Their parents' lives are completely separate from their children's, dealing with union vs. management issues, Labour vs. Tory political goals, a stagnant economy, resentment over immigration, IRA activity, some anti-semitism, and a belief that their dreams probably will not come true.  These huge and important themes seem a bit jarring when juxtaposed against the superficial, day-to-day activities of the teenagers who are the main characters.<br /><br />Coe has enormous, very obvious talents, but this book feels fragmented, with too many characters pursuing too many different ends, the ultimate goal seeming to be the recreation of the entire sociopolitical history of 1970's Birmingham.  At the end of 400+ pages of this book, Coe himself states that a second volume will continue this story, perhaps the author's acknowledgment that his reach has exceeded his grasp with this one.

Harking back to the days when children spent most of their after-school hours outdoors, making \\"forts\\" and hideyholes on vacant land still thick with scrub, Frayn recreates the atmosphere of the early 1940's in a small town outside London.  Stephen Wheatley, now in his mid-60's and living abroad, is drawn back to his childhood home by the \\"sweet and luring reek\\" of privet, a scent which evokes memories of his twelfth year, when he naively \\"spied\\" on his neighborhood from inside privet bushes with his friend Keith Hayward.  Announcing one day that his mother is a German spy, Keith \\"crosses the frontier into another country altogether,\\" and the boys begin dangerous meddling in real lives, manipulating events which they do not fully understand.  Huge, personal costs to others result from their meddling and still puzzle Stephen fifty years later.  As he tries to retrieve memories, make necessary connections between events, and put his personal demons to rest, he is a sympathetic figure, and the reader both understands his curiosity as a child-spy and observes with ironic detachment and adult judgment the unfolding disasters he provokes.<br /><br />Frayn is in full control of his material here, recreating the rather matter-of-fact atmosphere of a suburban London neighborhood during the war--the errant bombing of a neighborhood house and killing of an old woman, the blackouts and alarms, the separated families, the rigid social distinctions, and the indifference toward those of lower class.  His depiction of the child's motivation is flawless, the adult Stephen's confusion is plausible, and the dramatic ironies for the reader continue to the end.<br /><br />Much has been said about the ending.  I confess that I, too, was startled, at first, by the last twenty pages, and initially, I agreed with those who felt it was too pat.  As I started thinking about why Frayn would choose this ending, however, I began to think that perhaps, with all the secrets and spying that take place in the novel, he wanted one final irony--to show that the reader, too, is a kind of spy, a voyeur observing what takes place in the novel and jumping to false conclusions based on partial knowledge, no better than the characters.  If that's the case, he certainly gets the last laugh.

I cannot imagine why this thoughtful and beautifully constructed  novel by an author of immense talent is so little known and so little praised.  It's a very strong book, filled with sensual images, subtle feelings, vibrant scenes, carefully plotted intrigue, and clear messages.  Its scenes of family life and strife in Zanzibar, contrasted with the \\"civilized,\\" bureaucratic, and officious behavior of the British at home and abroad, establish strong contrasts and illuminate the themes.<br /><br />The book begins as a leisurely portrait of two lonely immigrants to England from Zanzibar, one of them a distinguished young professor and the other a 65-year-old asylum seeker who has just arrived, pretending he understands no English.  As the points of view shift back and forth between the two men in succeeding sections of the novel, we come to know each man well--his life, his aspirations in Zanzibar, his extended family, the family's business connections there, and ultimately, the how and why of each man's emigration to England.  Coming from two different generations, each man has a different view of his former country, the older man having spent most of his life there, escaping to England when all other hope is gone, and the younger having left as a young student, but still longing for the connections he left behind.<br /><br />Powerful ironies drive the action.  Each man knows who the other is, or was, in Zanzibar, and each believes that the other's family has brought about his own family's downfall there.  As the two men tentatively explore the past and the old man reveals information the young man could never have known, the pace quickens until the past and the present merge and each of the men discovers hidden truths and new strengths.  This is passionate book of clear vision, a book which recognizes harsh truths and still remains compassionate.  Mary Whipple	2002-04-23

Suddenly, the woman reacts to this quiet, pastoral scene: \\"An owl screamed in the wood and I wanted to ride behind its eyes when it plunged its talons into living flesh, wanted to tear something warm and soft to pieces while it squealed.\\"  With this remarkable sentence, I was totally hooked--by the strong visual images, by the frightening responses of this damaged woman to the sights and sounds around her, and by the emotional desolation of her life.<br /><br />Aud Torvingen, a former police officer who has killed more than once in the line of duty, has withdrawn from the world to her isolated cabin, grieving and guilt-ridden about the loss of her lover in a shooting she believes to be her fault.  When an old friend asks her to find his missing fiancee, Aud journeys to Greenwich Village and a scene of such brutality the reader will not soon forget it.  Devastated by the events, Aud understands that she must rebuild her shattered self from the ground up if she ever hopes to recover her life.<br /><br />Griffith's imagery and psychological acuity are overwhelming.  She sets up vivid, sensual contrasts between the pastoral life of Appalachia and the urban life of New York, provides total access to Aud's ravaged psyche, makes the reader truly care for this woman who has killed more than once, and encourages us to hope for her emotional rebirth.

Fforde combines \\"real\\" people from the \\"historically challenged\\" world of his plot with characters from classic novels, adding dollops of word play, irony, literary humor, satire--and even a dodo bird--just for spice.<br /><br />With \\"real\\" characters who can stop time or travel back and forth in it, hear their own names (the names here are really terrific!) from 1000 yards away, appear in duplicate before themselves to give advice, travel inside books, and change the outcome of history, the reader  journeys through Fforde's looking glass into a different and far more literary universe than the one we know.  Thursday Next, a SpecOp-27 in the Literary Detective Division of Special Operations, is looking for Acheron Hades, who has stolen the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit and killed one of the characters in it, thereby changing the story forever.  Thursday and the Literatecs are trying to prevent him from getting inside Jane Eyre and committing further murders.<br /><br />If you have not read Jane Eyre recently, your pleasure in this book will be greatly enhanced if you look up a brief plot summary on-line before proceeding too far--the ending of Jane Eyre as we know it is different from the ending of  Jane Eyre as Thursday Next knows it, and the differences themselves become a delightful part of this plot.  Though some readers seem to feel that the book would benefit from a bit of pruning in order to strengthen its conclusion, that suggestion seems to me to be too much like Acheron Hades changing Martin Chuzzlewit or Jane Eyre--if you do that, something is irreparably lost--and this book is so much fun that I'd hate to lose even a single word!

The world of Carrie Bell, a 23-year-old Wisconsin native, changes forever when she witnesses Mike Mayer's dive from Clausen's Pier, a dive which results in his broken neck, quadriplegia, and long rehab.  Mike has been her love for eight years, and though the intensity of her early relationship has palled, she has been unable to decide how, or even whether, to call off her engagement. Lovingly remaining at Mike's side during the crucial early months of his recuperation, Carrie wonders, \\"How much do we owe the people we love?\\" as she tries to distinguish between love and friendship and the limitations and obligations of each.<br /><br />Packer's naturalistic style puts the minutiae of the daily lives of Carrie, Mike, their friends, and families under a microscope.  We learn, for example, even the smallest details of Carrie's compulsive sewing (how to make a spaghetti strap, why she uses a Bernina sewing machine and Butterick pattern), the exacting therapy a spinal cord injury patient undergoes, some of the cherished traditions of Madison (Paddle and Portage Day at the lakes), and even some of Carrie's memories of friend Jamie from third grade.  Packer is equally precise about what the characters are thinking, feeling, wondering, and concluding so that the reader need never search beneath the surface for hidden meanings or subtleties. (\\"We were alone together, and also alone within ourselves.\\" \\"[Carrie went] from guilt to remorse to relief to exhilaration [as she drove to New York].\\" \\"You do what you do.  Not without consequences for other people.\\")<br /><br />The subject of spinal cord injuries arouses powerful feelings in the reader and makes us confront our personal moralities as we consider how we ourselves might behave in similar circumstances, and Packer is remarkable in her ability to illuminate these issues.  Some readers may feel shortchanged by the conclusion of this book and question how much control Carrie ultimately exercises over her life--does she decide her future or merely let it happen?  But Packer's presentation of her character reinforces the belief that little is to be gained by second-guessing someone else's choices.  Ultimately, we can never know for sure what we ourselves would do.  Mary Whippleerely let it happen?

The eccentric and attention-seeking graphics of the bookjacket convey the idea that this book is fresh, daring, kooky, and inventive-and the book is all these things! But it is also serious and thoughtful, touching on universal themes and the essence of what makes us human.  With young \\"heroes\\" who are sometimes both earnest and sweetly vulnerable, the book contains moments of profound melancholy, as well as deep sadness, behind its bravado and its finger-snapping brio.<br /><br />Jonathan Safran Foer, a character bearing the same name as the author, is looking for the woman he believes saved his grandfather Safran from the Nazis.  Traveling to the Ukraine, he meets Alex Perchov, a young man representing a Ukrainian travel agency which specializes in taking tourists to the sites of vanished shetls.  Alex, a not-quite-fluent translator, and his \\"blind\\" grandfather, who serves as the driver, travel with Jonathan to the site of  Trachimbrod, his family's village, collecting stories and legends which will help Jonathan learn about his family and his Ukrainian Jewish heritage.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers that parts of the book are a bit sophomoric.  (How many farting dog jokes does one need?  And do we really need to know the details of Grandfather Safran's 132 mistresses?)  The fictional Jonathan's letters and comments as he writes a novel about his trip are an artificial device for dealing, perhaps, with the author's uncertainties and/or heading off criticism, while the chapters he includes for Alex's review, are, of course, the actual chapters of this book.  And Alex's misuse of language, while often very funny, begins to pall after numerous repetitions.<br /><br />But these are minor criticisms in view of the author's immense achievement in dynamically presenting two young men as they explore who they are, where they come from, and how they fit in the world.  As the sought-after story of each boy's grandfather emerges, the depth and breadth of family relationships and cultural history become clearer to character and reader alike.

Confronting the usual thorny, coming-of-age issues of sex, religion, and morality, Belfast teenager Martin Brennan and his friends, with their hormones in high gear, are stunningly naïve, their primary concern, sex, remaining a mysterious, dark realm into which they must feel their own way.  Unable to gain much needed knowledge of basic biology from home or school, they try to sublimate their urges, exploring the mysteries of faith, the example of Christ, the meaning of sin, and the importance of family and friends, while privately garnering as much information as they can about the Big Secret.<br /><br />Brilliantly creating the jokey banter, braggadocio, and innuendoes of teenage conversations, MacLaverty introduces a main character who, while a bit more serious and naive than some of his friends, is still a typical teenager facing typical teenage problems.  And that, to me, is both the attraction and limitation of this novel.  Many readers will chuckle out loud as they relive their own pasts through Martin, but at the conclusion, some may also ask,  \\"Is that all there is?\\"  The superficial resolution of normal teenage predicaments, no matter how well presented here, may not be satisfying for readers who expect a broader treatment of themes and a deeper exploration of inner conflicts.  The author's introduction of the Catholic/Protestant violence at the end of the novel seems gratuitous, an overly strong element used to make a generalized point about morality and religion--Martin is almost untouched by The Troubles.<br /><br />The book pulses with the drama of teenage life, kooky characters, a wonderful feel for the tenuous relationships between teens and adults, and often hilarious repartee--especially with the \\"dotery coterie\\" of Martin's mother, the local priest, and her two friends.  These individual delights are not fully integrated into a thematic whole, however, and the reader may be left feeling a bit short-changed at the end--thoroughly entertained, but no wiser.

Wall constantly intrigues and intellectually challenges the reader with two parallel stories, set 450 years apart.  Sean Tallow is a 42-year-old Oxford graduate and the son of a thief, a man who says in the opening sentence that he has just stolen the Hariot notebooks from the university library.  He is consumed with his mission to find out all he can about the School of Night, a mysterious group which involved Sir Walter Ralegh, Christopher Marlowe, Hariot, and others, and to which there is only one reference in literature, in Shakespeare's Love's Labour Lost.  Sean thinks that the encoded messages in Hariot's notebooks will help him discover the answer to whether Shakespeare really wrote all the plays attributed to him.<br /><br />At the same time, he is deeply involved in trying to help the family of the recently deceased Dan Pagett, his oldest friend, a man who became immensely wealthy through his mercantile interests.  Dan was always very much centered in the here and now, a person dealing with earthly concerns and day to day existence.  Sean, by contrast, has always been centered on the long ago, a person dealing with mysteries and intellectual concerns, a night person working the overnight desk at the BBC.<br /><br />Even the most dedicated symbol-hunter will be kept fully occupied poring over this fascinating novel, as dozens of references to the night, both obvious and subtle, appear throughout both stories.  Water, one of the metaphysical elements most closely associated with night, is also a major focus.  Sean and Dan become friends while fishing along the river;  Sean says at the beginning of the novel, \\"I never tried to push against the river\\";  Ralegh was imprisoned in the Tower of London, along the river; and Dan's house is on the river.  The satisfying conclusion brings all these references together.<br /><br />Crisp, concise imagery combines with diverse intellectual discussions of alchemy, the \\"truth\\" of history vs. the \\"tissue\\" of probability, Freudian vs. Jungian analysis, linear interpretations of Elizabethan literature, and even the introduction of the zero during Elizabethan history. Yet the novel wears this intellectualism lightly.  Wall never forgets that this is, first and foremost, a novel, not a dissertation.

The most wonderful aspect of this book is the reader's slowly growing awareness that this is not \\"just\\" another plot-driven novel with exotic locations and an unusual protagonist facing life-changing decisions, however fascinating they may be.  It is also a deeply engrossing and carefully constructed tour de force which uses an exciting plot and a good deal of humor to make statements about the essence of selfhood, the importance of national and cultural identity, and, ultimately, our definitions of civilization and civilized behavior.<br /><br />In a daring move, Kunzru throws the conventions of characterization to the winds.  Instead of bringing his main character alive by showcasing his uniqueness and highlighting his different personal perspective on the world and its history, Kunzru does the opposite.  In Pran/Rukhsana/Chandra/Pretty Bobby/Jonathan Bridgeman, he gives us a character who becomes, during the novel, less unique, more stereotypical--a man who sees life \\"in general\\" and from the perspective of whatever society he inhabits, a man who accepts the judgments and morality imposed upon him, acting, ultimately, \\"For God and England and the Empire and Civilization and Progress and Uplift and Morality and Honor.\\"<br /><br />Set primarily in the latter years of World War I and in the turbulent 1920's of the British Raj in India, the novel introduces Pran Nath Razdan, the beautiful, spoiled, and arrogant son of a wealthy court pleader in Agra.  Banished from his home when his true status as a half Anglo is discovered, he must adapt to changed circumstances to stay alive.  As the chief hijra of Fatehpur tells him when he assumes the role of Rukhsana and enters the harem of the Sultan, \\"We are all as mutable as the air!  Just release...your body and you can be a myriad!  An army!\\"<br /><br />In successive roles in other locations, he learns to create impressions, to become stereotypical of the cultures in which he finds himself, to be whatever someone wants him to be, from a male prostitute and procurer in India to a student at Oxford and an assistant to an anthropologist in Africa.  Along the way, he learns that it pays to be British--while the reader sees the extent to which British colonialism and arrogance have indelibly changed the world for the worse.<br /><br />Satirical touches (not the least of which are some of the characters' names), broad humor, and irony make reading this story a continual delight, despite the author's occasional lapses into irrelevant background material for some of the characters.

Setting her mystery story in 1895, two years after the overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani, Ball deftly juggles the history of the Hawaiian monarchy and those rapacious outside forces which changed Hawaiian life forever. Creating a broad and fascinating context for what would otherwise be a simple mystery, Ball depicts a time in which Royalist gun-runners, supporting the Queen, try to establish a base in Oahu from which they can fight the Provisional Government of Sanford Dole and the sugar barons, a time in which this powerful and wealthy foreign \\"government\\" is able to exert so much pressure on a weak U.S. Senate that the Senate bows to their every wish rather than go to war against influential U.S. citizens in the Republic of Hawaii.<br /><br />Ball successfully captures the frenzied lives of ordinary people in Honolulu during this time, those who collaborate with the new \\"authorities,\\" those who actively oppose them, and those whose lives are forever changed by their actions.  Eva Hansen, a Norwegian fortune-teller and sometime pickpocket who has assumed the identity of a woman who died at sea, and her friend Lehua, a part-Hawaiian \\"orphan,\\" find a body while fishing.  When Eva reports it to the police, she finds herself the unwitting target of forces who find her a danger to their plans.  Moving through all levels of society from Queen Lili'uokalani herself to opium addicts, from the Asian community to immigrants like herself who are hoping some of the new \\"prosperity\\" will wash off on them, and from Hawaiians who work the land to those who must now figure out how to survive in the city, Eva tries to protect herself from the police, the politicians and their thugs, and the marines sent in to keep peace.<br /><br />Without resorting to polemics, Ball includes brief, chronological, historical pieces between the chapters of the mystery, allowing the sordid facts to speak for themselves.  With strong visual imagery, she brings alive and incorporates into her story  the resulting impoverishment of the Hawaiians; the suffering from leprosy, smallpox, and other diseases; the attempts to preserve  the banned Hawaiian language, hula dancing, and music; and the long-term damage to the Hawaiian way of life.  Though the book is too short to provide for deep characterization, complicated plot twists, or a satisfying love story, Ball keeps the reader's interest high, telling a good story in simple language, while shining a spotlight on a particularly dark facet of American history.

The first seventy pages of this huge, eloquent, and multi-layered novel require the reader's patience--it is not always clear, at first, who the characters are or exactly what they are doing.  But patience is gloriously rewarded as the cadences of the characters' speech, with its street slang, odd syntax, natural poetry, and homespun aphorisms, combine with vibrant details of their everyday lives and eventually bring these \\"ordinary\\" folks to life in Dublin in 1915.<br /><br />On the eve of the Easter Rebellion, we meet Jim Mack and Doyler Doyle, two teenage boys who are trying to sort out who they are, emotionally, politically, and sexually.  They get no help from home, where their fathers relive their memories of fighting for the British during the Boer War and where sex and the facts of life are never even hinted at.  They get no help from their priests, who severely punish confessions of  \\"the solitary sin,\\" while sometimes fondling their students.  Secret revolutionary societies troll for members, and priests sometimes help them.  Neither boy has close friends his own age.  As naïve Jim gravitates toward the more street-wise Doyler, their friendship blossoms, they rejoice in each other's company, and they begin to try on roles for the future--Doyler finding an outlet with Irish rebels, and Jim considering a priestly vocation.<br /><br />It quickly becomes clear to the reader that this will be a gay coming-of-age story within the broader context of the Irish rebellion, and these two stories mesh seamlessly, with many obvious parallels.  Quietly, without beating any drums or making any polemical statements, O'Neill allows his characters to discover their feelings for each other and their inborn nature, even as the political rebellion takes shape.  O'Neill's  characters are who they are, and he respects them and the reader too much to use them simply to prove a point.  The parallels he draws between them and some of the famous leaders of the Irish rebellion, such as Roger Casement, and between them and the Sacred Band of Thebes are incidental to the story, though they do give a broader context to the gay relationship.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this engrossing novel was with the character of MacMurrough, an older \\"mentor\\" to both boys.  MacMurrough is a sexual predator, in my opinion, at least at the beginning, a man guilty of violent rape in a graphic early scene which made me cringe.  The fact that he is later depicted sympathetically, and to some extent heroically, remains a problem for me, an anomaly in what is otherwise a beautifully wrought novel.

With one of the all-time great opening chapters, a traditional Hindu marriage of a five-year-old girl, Mukherjee establishes her themes, conflicts, and contrasts.  Amidst the lyrical, atmospheric details of flickering oil lamps, the impenetrable jungle, banks of fog, and smoke from cooking fires, she inserts the singular detail of retching coughs from tuberculosis, suddenly shocking the reader and abruptly signaling that this is not a novel which will sugarcoat reality.  And when the bride's and groom's families differ in interpreting the events which occur on the way to the ceremony and the bride ends up married to a tree, \\"It seems all the sorrow of history, all that is unjust  in society and cruel in religion has settled on her.\\"<br /><br />Tara Chatterjee, the main character and a descendant of the tree bride, is an orthodox Bengali Brahmin from a well-known Hindu family, someone who accepted without question the groom her father chose for her and who settled in the U.S. when he established a business in California.  Now a woman in her mid-thirties residing in Atherton, California, she is divorced, raising her son alone, living with a red-haired biker, and teaching kindergarten.  When a stranger, Christopher Dey, arrives at her house claiming to be the illegitimate son of one of her older sisters, she is shocked and forced to contend with the issues he raises, while facing possible dangers, as she tries to check out his story.<br /><br />The contrasts between life in Calcutta and Atherton, between her ex-husband and her lover, and between her traditional, protected life in India and her free and independent life in the U.S. are very obvious throughout, but as Tara deals with the complexities of Christopher Dey's appearance, we also see how tradition and family stories also guide her inner world, shape her responses, and affect both her views of the external world and her behavior within it--even after she has \\"changed worlds.\\"<br /><br />At times the contrasts in Tara's life seem exaggerated and perhaps less realistic than they could be, with the dramatic plot and its violence somewhat at odds with the more subtle (and, to me, more interesting) internal conflicts she faces.

Though this book is only of average length, it has the feel of a big family saga, so completely does McEwan delve into the consciousness of his main characters as they attempt to cope with the long-term repercussions of a \\"crime\\" committed by a Briony Tallis, a naïve 13-year-old with a \\"controlling demon.\\" Briony's \\"wish for a harmonious, organised world denie[s] her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing,\\" so it is doubly ironic that her attempt to \\"fix\\" what she sees as wrongdoing involving her sister and Robbie Turner, a childhood friend, becomes, in itself, a wrongdoing, one she feels compelled to deny and for which she will eventually attempt to atone.<br /><br />Opening the novel in 1935, McEwan creates an intense, edgy, and almost claustrophobic mood. England is on the brink of war; Briony, a budding writer, is on the edge of adolescence; her newly graduated sister Cecilia is thinking of her future life; and Robbie is about to start medical school.  The summer is unusually hot.  Troubled young cousins have arrived because their parents are on the verge of divorce; Briony's mother is suffering from migraines; her father is \\"away,\\" working for the government; her adored brother Leon and a friend have arrived from Cambridge; and Briony, an \\"almost only child,\\" with a hypersensitive imagination, finds her world threatened.<br /><br />Step by step, McEwan leads his characters to disaster, each individual action and misstep simple, explainable, and logical.  The engaged reader sees numerous dramatic ironies and waits for everything to snap. When Briony finally commits her long-foreshadowed \\"crime,\\" the results are cataclysmic, and the world, as they know it, ends for several characters.<br /><br />Giving depth to his themes of truth, justice, honesty, guilt and innocence, and punishment and atonement, McEwan uses shifting points of view and an extended time frame.  Part I is Briony's.  In Part II, five years after the crime, Robbie, now a footsoldier retreating from the French countryside to Dunkirk, continues the same themes, seeing the crimes of war, not only between the combatants but against civilians and, at Dunkirk, by the Brits against each other.  In Part III, Briony, atoning for her earlier crime by working as a student nurse, rather than studying to be a writer, brings the past and present together, tending the casualties of war.

From a writer whose publicity bills him as \\"Canada's greatest living writer,\\" this book is both a surprise and a disappointment.  Telling the story of a group of participants in Ontario's Stratford Festival, the book includes many subplots, all dealing with some issue of love--love from the past, young love, new love, love of children, homosexual love, thwarted love, love of self, love of career--and the extent to which the characters are willing to sacrifice for it.<br /><br />While some of the dialogue, such as that in an early birthday party scene, pops and crackles, as one would expect in the writing of a playwright, other aspects of the book creak and groan, weighed down by irrelevant details and a shocking number of cliches. Ten pages into the book, Jane comments that she is the luckiest girl in the world.  \\"I've got everything I wanted,\\" she says.  One is not surprised, then, when fate decides to teach her a lesson in the ensuing 400 pages.<br /><br />The personal conflicts which evolve are too shallow to allow for the illumination of great themes, and the characters are one-dimensional, prone to observations one has read many times in many other novels.

There was something...indefinable.\\"  Her psychiatrist has a print of Paul Klee's \\"Scholar 1933\\" on the wall, \\"his inner eye, his daily reminder...that life was full of endless mystery and that nothing was known.\\"  An outdoor love scene takes place against a background with \\"not a single cloud.

When an imaginative and gifted author can use a giant roach as his main character, include a romance between the roach and a human, and still make you love him, he's accomplished a colossal feat.  Yet these are only a few of Estrin's marvelous achievements in this thoughtful, but very playful, and often very funny chronicle of western history and thought from World War I through the dropping of the atomic bomb in World War II.  Gregor Samsa, the famous salesman turned roach in Kafka's Metamorphosis, ends up not in Kafka's dustbin, but as part of a Viennese freak show run by Amadeus Hoffnung, in the opening chapter, \\"Tails of Hoffnung.\\"<br /><br />Reciting Rilke and discoursing on Spengler's Decline of the West, Gregor attracts the attention of writer Robert Musil, who tells him that although western humanity is finished, that \\"Society...is in a larval state.  What it needs is a larval model to lead it onward, upward, and out of the corral,\\" and Gregor is that larval model, his ironic task being to teach us what it means to be human.<br /><br />In lighthearted, fast-paced prose, Estrin describes Gregor's emigration to New York, his search for identity, and his eventual connection to seminal events in western history and the people responsible for them.  The music of Charles Ives, the Scopes trial (at which Gregor, ironically, testifies), the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti, the election and administration of FDR, and the development of the atomic bomb are just a few of Estrin's sensitively presented turning points of American history.  At Eleanor Roosevelt's urging, Gregor accepts the offer to move into the White House, where he lives, literally, as part of the \\"kitchen cabinet\\" and works at the Department of Agriculture as an exterminator.<br /><br />Extermination and the death of \\"others\\" are, in fact, strong themes throughout this novel, despite its playfulness, and an increasing gravity and darkness develop as the plot progresses.  As Gregor, the king of otherness,  shows us, the U.S., historically, has not been immune to prejudice, and he is remarkably critical of FDR for failing to take an early stand against the Holocaust when clear evidence was available to him.  Still, this powerful book ends on a positive note, one which readers of this extraordinary tale will long remember--and, I suspect, share with their friends.

In this consummately romantic double narrative, the reader discovers in the first hundred words (!) that the speaker is Olivia Wyvern, a 38-year-old woman falsely accused of murder and in prison in Arue, \\"on the far side of the world,\\" that she has been contacted by the child she gave up for adoption when she was sixteen, and that she is writing a letter to this child.<br /><br />Within the first ten pages, Wright efficiently involves the reader in further details of Olivia's life, as she muses over the death of her mother \\"over a parrot\\" and reminisces about the old house in which the family has lived for 200 years, a house loaded with documents, letters, and artifacts, including a strange, 14' long  ebony spear, supposedly an assegai from Africa.  We find out that Olivia's mother was disowned, that she never revealed information about her family background, and that Olivia's father was declared missing in Korea.  In a locked box Olivia has found five notebooks written by Frank Henderson, a former owner of the house, an adventurer who traveled around the world for three years in the late 1800's with Crown Prince Eddy and Prince George.<br /><br />As Olivia Wyvern, through her letter to her daughter, and Frank Henderson, through his newly discovered journals, tell their stories in alternate chapters, the reader learns how Olivia, a film maker, came to be imprisoned in Tahiti and of her search for her father and her family history.  We learn about Henderson's travels with the teenage princes through Africa in the 1880's, their search for identity, their sexual curiosity, and their mysterious three-week stop in Tahiti.<br /><br />Wright pulls out all the stops in this novel, using every romantic element imaginable to pique the reader's curiosity and involve his/her emotions.  He also includes, however, historical background which gives this novel more depth than some other romances.  In Olivia's story, the aftereffects of French colonialism in the Pacific, along with France's A-bomb tests in Polynesia, are included, and Lars Lindquist, an adventurer who sailed on the Kon Tiki with Thor Heyerdahl, is a character.  Melville's novel Typee, set in Tahiti, is discussed at some length.  In the Henderson story, discussions of Darwin, native opposition to French colonialism, the \\"secret\\" story of Prince Eddy, and traditional customs of the local Polynesians are included.

Setting this novel during the glory days of Big Studio Hollywood, in which he himself was an earnest young screenwriter, Ray Bradbury sets out to create a murder mystery in which a twenty years-dead body is found on a ladder leaning against a wall between a graveyard and the movie studio next door.  Over-the-top Hollywood characters and wannabes,  \\"beasts\\" and monsters, and faux settings, such as Notre Dame, Calvary, and even the speaker's grandparents' house in Green Town, Illinois, fill this book with the illusions in which the film industry excels, while the machinations of ego-driven moguls provide motivations for murder.<br /><br />No one should read this novel expecting a hard-boiled mystery, however.  Bradbury's obvious love of people and of life itself is so heartfelt and overwhelming that it makes any sense of toughness unbelievable--and there are many other reasons to enjoy this book.  Grounded by Midwestern values, fundamentally decent, and lacking the ego which seems to drive the rest of the industry, Bradbury shines in describing a mad Hollywood, \\"where great elephant ideas go to die.  A graveyard for lunatics,\\" where men so dedicate their lives to the creation of illusions that they often lose sight of reality.  His wacky imagination flourishes, and it is clear that despite his sometimes flippant, tongue-in-cheek observations, his irony, and his criticism of Hollywood excess, that he loves the place and the exotic characters he meets there.<br /><br />With imagery and descriptions that bring to life every aspect of studio activity, trenchant philosophical observations inserted casually (almost as throwaways), self-deprecating humor, and visions of plain folks challenging the studio bigwigs, Bradbury's mystery ambles toward an almost amiable conclusion.  For the lover of Bradbury, this is another chance to share his visions and his enthusiasm for a life lived honestly.  Most readers will undoubtedly share the feelings of Constance, who tells speaker/Bradbury, \\"How lucky to be inside your skin...Don't ever change.  We stupid doomsayers, cynics, monsters laugh, but we need you.  Otherwise, Merlin dies, or a carpenter fixing the Round Table saws it crooked, or the guy who oils the armor substitutes cat pee.

Palace intrigue of the highest order, conducted by courtiers and officials who will do anything to achieve their goals, makes this one of the most stimulating and thoroughly engrossing novels of the year.  The Danish court from 1768 - 1772 pulses with life as powerful personalities collide in their rush to fill the power vacuum resulting from the weakness of King Christian VII, a sensitive, half-mad 17-year-old boy, married to Caroline Mathilde, the 14-year-old sister of Britain's King George III.  This is a time of great intellectual ferment as the new ideas of the Enlightenment, with their value on the individual and freedom, begin to threaten the feudal basis of the old, autocratic monarchies of Europe, and more frightening to the courtiers, their own power within their countries.<br /><br />Enquist brilliantly recreates the psychology of the king, a puppet who desperately wants to please the courtiers and officials and is tormented when he does not, a  bright but \\"ravaged child,\\" who from his earliest years was regularly flogged, ridiculed, beaten for casual conversations, forcibly separated from everyone with whom he developed attachments, shamed, and driven mad by his own courtiers.  When he becomes interested in the enlightened ideas of Voltaire and Diderot and is celebrated by these philosophers on a trip around the continent, his nervous and threatened court decides he needs a physician.  What they never expect is that the physician they engage, Johann Friedrich Struensee from Germany, will establish a relationship with Christian, share his enlightened ideas, and eventually become the de facto king.<br /><br />Bursting with dramatic scenes of Machiavellian court intrigue and fear of the Enlightenment, and with powerfully moving scenes of psychological abuse, tenderness, passion,  love, and genuine sadness, this novel is stunning!  Though the reader knows from the opening pages what the outcome of the court struggle will be, Enquist manages to endow it with an immediacy and tension which totally engage the reader.  By focusing on the court, rather than on the populace, he makes the Enlightenment and the revolutions it inspires throughout Europe come alive from a new perspective, and in creating this novel based on history, he brings to life both the sad and abused child-king Christian and Struensee, the enlightened but politically naïve mentor who paid the ultimate price.

The Prologue of this novel, a birthing scene, is masterful--a classic example of the canon of fiction in which the writer creates a scene so vibrant and specific that the reader experiences it vicariously and draws conclusions about its characters on his own.  Unfortunately, the immediacy of the Prologue is not sustained. In this sequel to Sister of My Heart, the author follows the three main characters after they leave India for the United States, giving the reader some background about them, and also including their large \\"support system\\" back home.  But characters who were important in the first book (virtually all of them except the triangle of Anju, Sunil, and Sudha) have no direct role in this story at all, and their inclusion here, via  letters, diaries, flashbacks, and references, serves as filler, a distraction, rather than as an integral part of the action.<br /><br />Anju's invitation to her cousin and dearest friend, Sudha, and her baby, to stay with Anju and her husband in their tiny apartment, sets the stage for what might have been an intense study of characters interacting.  Instead, the author backs off, \\"telling about\\" what's happening, rather than creating scenes.  She also \\"tells about\\" the characters, rather than allowing us to draw conclusions from the action on our own.  Sentences, such as the following, are common: \\"He should have known by now that Anju wasn't one to hide her meanings,\\" \\"These are what the people closest to me are afraid of...,\\" followed by a list, or \\"What fibers of steel are woven into Sudha's will...\\"  Instead of creating intense scenes that directly involve the reader's heart, Divakaruni often becomes cute, involving the reader by addressing him/her directly, \\"Can you sense inside him the desire for speed?\\" or, when Sudha gets a letter, \\"We want Sudha to open her letter, but she goes about her daily chores with exasperating meticulousness,\\" and \\"Have we underestimated Sudha?\\"<br /><br />Though the book is just published in 2002, the author has chosen to set the action in 1994 in order to draw deliberate parallels between what is happening in this triangle and the O.J. Simpson case, with which Sunil is obsessed. This artifice continues when Sunil  returns home temporarily to help his mother settle his father's estate:  \\"It is the year of exiles returning home: Arafat to Gaza, Solzhenitsyn to Russia, and Sunil to a childhood he thinks of as an unhealed wound,\\" not exactly comparable events.  This is a simple, episodic tale written by an author whose work here lacks the subtlety and clear point of view one has come to expect from her previous writing.

Wilson's unusual ability to create fascinating and fully drawn characters within the confines of a plot-driven espionage novel make this novel particularly enjoyable.  Andrea/Anne is a character who grows from a protected and naive twenty-year-old to a pragmatic spy and, later in life, to a committed political activist.  Karl Voss and his family are \\"good Germans,\\" disillusioned by Hitler's callous disregard for his soldiers and by his monomaniacal plans, and they believe they can serve their country best by betraying its Nazi leadership.  As Karl makes contact with British intelligence and with Anne and other agents based in Lisbon, the reader watches their characters unfold as they respond to the intricacies of spy/counterspy maneuvering.<br /><br />More than half the novel consists of this Anne/Karl story during the waning days of World War II, a tightly drawn, tension-filled, and often genuinely moving interplay of characters and the forces which motivate them.  Part II further develops the story of Anne in 1968 in London, with the short Part III taking place in 1989. These latter two sections, while intriguing and consistent with the author's themes, seemed to me to lack the immediacy and excitement of the earlier Lisbon section.  The broad scope and intensity of  World War II are sacrificed in favor of subtler, more abstract maneuvering during the Cold War in Part II.  The motivations of the characters are fuzzier, the consequences of their behavior seem less cataclysmic, and what action there is feels a bit arthritic.  The concluding Part III narrows the scope even more to a handful of characters in a country cottage setting, and while it is dramatic and probably realistic, I found it disappointing--as if the author himself were performing some double agent trickery on me, the reader.<br /><br />Like the best of the espionage novels, this one has plenty of action and excitement to keep the reader occupied, especially in Part I, but the book also seems to straddle a line.  Because the author is also intent on developing character over an extended period of time, an unusual objective in a thriller, he also needs to include the less exciting Parts II and III which show the characters in their maturity and bring the story and themes full circle, an unusual structure and a fascinating attempt by the author to \\"have it all.\\"  Mary Whippleecause the author is also intent on developing character over an extended period of time, an unusual objective in a thriller, he also needs to include the less exciting Parts II and III which show the characters in their maturity and bring the story and themes full circle, an unusual structure and a fascinating attempt by the author to \\"have it all.\\"  Mary Whipple	2002-02-07

Yair Einhorn, a 33-year-old, married man sees Miriam, a somewhat older woman, for five minutes at a party, never meets or talks to her, but instantly decides that she would be the perfect person to whom to bare his soul in letters. \\"We could be like two people who inject themselves with truth serum...I want to be able to say to myself, 'I bled truth with her. Be a knife for me,'\\" he says in his introductory letter to her. The first 2/3 of the book consists of Yair's long, self-analytical letters to Miriam, the rest of the novel consisting of Miriam's diary and a separate collage of their comments after the end of the correspondence.<br /><br />Many readers will have a difficult time suspending disbelief as much as is necessary here to accept the basic premise of this novel--that a complete stranger can write a long, neurotic, and frighteningly personal letter to a woman who does not run away in terror and who, in fact, agrees to be his \\"knife.\\" In this novel of words rather than actions, Yair says, early in his correspondence, \\"I never imagined that meeting a stranger's language could be as exciting as the first touch of her body,\\" and he admits to feeling jealous when he finds, in newspapers and advertising, some of the same words Miriam has used in her letters. He also confesses that \\"something is building up...begging to burst out, something that will suffocate if it doesn't crack...\\" He admits that his emotional stability is \\"the size of a peanut.\\" Still Miriam allows the correspondence to continue, even though his letters arrive without postmarks, hand delivered to her mailbox at work.<br /><br />Self-conscious and, some would say, self-indulgent in the extreme, Yair's letters eventually begin to reveal factual information about his marriage and his child, in addition to his important inner child, which he hopes to rediscover through Miriam, and I found myself grabbing onto these morsels as a way to give some reality and perspective to his lengthy and sometimes repetitious self-analysis. Miriam's diary, on the other hand, is truly touching. Appearing 2/3 of the way through the book, it is a very moving story of a woman who, in addition to working, must also deal with a seriously ill 10-year-old child, a child who was once normal but who is now speechless, living in his own world, and subject to fits. The conclusion, a section called Rain, which comes after the end of the correspondence, is intense and very dramatic.<br /><br />Though the book is thoughtful and well written, I found it difficult to care much about Yair, whose inner world and needs seem to be his only concern. Miriam, on the other hand, has very real and difficult problems in the outside world, all of them, it seems to me, more urgent than Yair's, yet, until her diary appears late in the book, we know little about her except a few nuggets we glean second-hand from Yair's letters. This is a very introspective novel requiring immense patience, a book which will undoubtedly reward some readers, while perhaps driving others to distraction.

In prose which is dense, dramatic, and saturated with images of violence of all kinds, Vargas Llosa reconstructs the final, tumultuous years of Rafael Trujillos despotism in the Dominican Republic.  Using three points of view to give breadth to the portrait of the country in 1961, the author cycles the chapters through three distinct viewpoints: that of Urania Cabral, a contemporary 49-year-old woman who has returned to the Dominican Republic for the first time in 35 years, and who shares her reminscences of her life there in 1961, when her father was President of the Senate;  that of Trujillo himself as he reflects on his declining health, his 31 years in power, and his relationships with subordinates, the church, and the U.S.; and that of four conspirators waiting to ambush and assassinate \\"The Goat,\\" as they individually recall the events which have driven them to take this final step.<br /><br />The heavily masculine atmosphere, redolent of whiskey and sex, and full of dramatic scenes of intrigue, sudden violence, graphically depicted torture, and casual murder, reflects the realities of life under Trujillo--nothing is gratuitous or irrelevant.  In fact, the books only \\"soft\\" feelings are elicited by Uranias story and her long-term rejection of her father after his betrayal of her, thirty-five years ago, when she was fourteen.  While this is the least \\"important,\\" and perhaps least effective, of the story lines, it gives a necessary feminine perspective on the violence and on Trujillos government, and it keeps the reader from becoming overwhelmed by the sheer weight of the violence in the other stories.<br /><br />The scope of this novel is large, and it is well worth the readers effort to concentrate, during the first hundred pages, on the large cast of characters and their interrelationships.  All these characters are integral to the final outcome, and as they rotate among the three story lines, the reader benefits from increasingly broader and more subtle portraits which emerge from the new points of view, making the conclusion and the political aftermath of the assassination especially intriguing.  This is a beautifully developed novel of power and its excesses, presented lucidly and unambiguously.

It's the best, most interesting, and inspiring cookbook I've seen in years!

Although she emphasizes that advance preparation takes the stress out of entertaining, her idea of preparation is far more casual than the start-the-meal-five-days-in-advance program many of us adopted twenty years ago when we first \\"discovered\\" Julia Child and became dedicated \\"French chefs.\\"  She is not afraid to suggest that you put together a beautiful and creative assortment of dessert pastries purchased from a local vendor, instead of trying to make something spectacular with homemade puff pastry dough;  she provides loads of helpful hints to head off potential disasters (put the red cabbage you shred in advance for the Vegetable Cole Slaw into a separate plastic bag so that it doesn't turn the other vegetables pink);  she indicates when you can save time by using commercial frozen products; and she gives wonderful tips about how to arrange the guests around the dining table so that you don't end up with separate groups at each end having separate conversations.<br /><br />Garten uses the freshest ingredients, and she is often inspired by what's available in her local market.  She shows how to adapt some old favorites, such as Eggplant Caviar, to more health-conscious diets by roasting, rather than frying the ingredients.  And the results are delectable.  Her updated version of Beef Bourguignon, Indonesian Chicken, Kitchen Clambake, and Tuna Nicoise Platter are fabulous.

This beautifully constructed novel quickly seduces the reader with strong imagery, pitch perfect dialogue, vibrant characters, and beautifully realized interrelationships which extend well beyond the bounds of the apartment house they share in Bombay.  All the characters are attending a wedding reception hosted by successful lawyer Jimmy Kanga for his son Mehernosh, the wedding reception serving as the loose framework on which the author hangs the characters and their stories.<br /><br />While this is not a plot in the traditional sense, Umrigar uses this device very effectively.  As the festivities begin, each character privately recalls how s/he has been affected by some early love and/or loss, and the reader comes to know the characters and their stories intimately.  We see how the characters relate to each other and interact, we care for them, we silently scold them for their blindness, and ultimately, we hope for their eventual happiness.<br /><br />Unique aspects of Parsi heritage and history, the pressures of life in Bombay, the attraction of educated Indian youth to England and America, the unbridgeable chasm between middle-class Indians and the masses of homeless poor, the marriage customs, and the changing role of women in India are just a few of the fascinating subjects which Umrigar manages to weave into the stories of her characters.  These personal stories take on broader significance in the light they shed on contemporary Indian society, and they achieve universality in their focus on love and loss.<br /><br />As the novel comes to a close and the sweetness of young love and the wedding reception linger in the reader's mind, Umrigar injects an unexpected and powerful dose of Bombay reality, forcing the reader to see these lives in the even greater context of the human condition.  This is a beautifully realized portrait of the lives of one group of friends in one building in one Indian city and how it relates to the world at large.  Mary Whipple	2002-01-24

British expatriates, her parents seem to have gravitated to Africa because it is a place which enables them to live, work, and drink on their own terms, freed from the limitations imposed by conventional society.<br /><br />Opposing majority rule in the countries where he lives, the father serves as part of an active, armed, white militia in Rhodesia.  He teaches his two daughters how to handle guns and to shoot to kill, and tells them what to do if their parents are killed.  As Mum and Dad eke out lives as farmers and ranchers during Rhodesia's civil war, they treat as mere inconveniences the landmines planted in their dirt roads, the razor wire fencing around their property, the armed escorts when they go to town, the necessary bribery of officials, and even the abuse of their daughters.  Not even vicious assaults on their help and their animals can shake them from their self-involved world or make them fully connect with their children.<br /><br />Despite all this and her mother's several frightening breakdowns, Alexandra (Bobo) clearly loves  her parents, the independence of her childhood, and her African life, which fills her senses with unique and beautifully described sights, sounds, and smells.  She accepts as normal the scorpions in the algae- and mosquito-laden swimming pool, the cobra she shoots inside the house, the cat-sized rats, and the leopards, which farm managers illegally kill and skin.  Without self-consciousness, she reveals her own naïve acceptance of her \\"superior\\" role, developing, as she matures, a growing sensitivity to the Africans whose world she shares.  As she relates her tale, complete with the teasing, the local slang, and a point of view which feels absolutely right for her age, the reader marvels at the normalcy she reflects and the resilience of her spirit.

The goals of the young have changed, and many people in the cities are experimenting with capitalism. The firebrands of the past are now elderly people living simple, often deprived, lives, and  the destruction which occurred during the Cultural Revolution is now recognized and acknowledged as unfortunate.  People are coping with the closure of factories, general unemployment, unsatisfying work on farms, and the pollution of rivers and waterways.<br /><br />Hill endows what might have been a bleak setting with much humor.  When Da Shan returns to the town after being away for seven years, for example, his reunion with his mother reflects the relationships of mothers and sons across all cultures and time, sounding as much like a Borscht Belt Jewish Mother skit as a domestic interchange in rural China.  The petty quarrels, jealousies, resentments, longings, and hopes for the future, which are only hinted at in Chinese-written books such as Wild Swans, Waiting, and Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, are explicit here, further adding to the sense of common humanity which makes Hill's characters so understandable.  While this may make the novel \\"less Chinese,\\" it allows for greater reader identification.<br /><br />Much of Hill's effectiveness stems from his selection of powerful visual details, rather than his use of pretty words.  The polluted river, for example, shines with \\"pale gray smudges where plastic bags have drowned,\\" while an ancient temple is inhabited by nuns who can no longer read some of the Chinese characters in their books.  I did find several fairly explicit sex scenes to be jarring, out of character with the warmth, light humor, and restraint throughout much of the book, and inconsistent with its formal, almost operatic structure.  In addition, a harshness creeps into the end of the book and may be a warning to the reader that nothing may be taken for granted in this country, despite our desire to think the people are \\"just like us.\\"  Hill's ambitious novel contains many delights and augurs a promising future.

Filled with loads of fascinating facts about rubies, pearls, and diamonds, and bursting with historical information about Elizabethan and Victorian England, 19th century Baghdad, and the traders, dealers, and smugglers of the gemstone trade, this is a captivating novel of one woman's obsession with The Three Brethren.  A \\"jewel\\" created for Queen Elizabeth and consisting of four pearls, three balas rubies, and a pyramid-shaped diamond, The Three Brethren mysteriously vanishes during her reign, and a very tough, modern woman, Katharine Sterne, is tracing and hoping to find it.<br /><br />Author Hill keeps the reader's interest high by telling two intriguing, parallel stories--that of contemporary Katharine as she travels from London to Turkey and Japan in her search, and that of the two Levy brothers, Jews in 19th century \\"Mesopotamia,\\" who find some jewels which they expect will allow them to begin a new life in Victorian England's jewel trade.  Largely avoiding the excessive romanticism which this subject might have engendered, Hill matches his prose style to Katharine's obsessive, business-like approach to her jewel-hunt.  Nothing else really matters to her, not even family, and Hill's prose echoes the urgency of her search, tending toward efficient, straightforward sentences of fact, with limited description and none of the lyrical flights so common to historical novels.<br /><br />I found this to be both a virtue and a limitation.  It does prevent this big novel from becoming soupy with sentiment. It also keeps the reader moving rapidly through several countries, time frames, and sometimes complex plot details.  On the other hand, it is difficult to care much about Katharine's search when we cannot identify with her--we do not know, really, what  she looks like or even how old she is.  Perhaps this lack of an emotional hook is the reason that Hill, near the end of the book, inserts a number of melodramatic subplots, leading to an ending which is both sentimental and, I thought, unconvincing with its moralizing--too pat as it pertains to Katharine and her search.  Still, this is loads of fun for lovers of jewels and history, terrific escape reading.  Mary Whipplet, unconvincing with its moralizing--too pat as it pertains to Katharine and her search.

Stephenson's memoir about the Hadzabe in Tanzania, one of the last tribes of hunter-gatherers, is fascinating, though not always in ways the author probably intended.  As much about the 27-year-old author and the casual romanticism with which he plunges into life in another culture as it is about the death throes of a Stone Age tribe being overtaken by \\"progress,\\" the author announces at the outset that this is \\"a journey greater than [him]self, a journey that has chosen [him].\\"<br /><br />Propelled initially by visions and fever dreams, New Yorker Stephenson, called \\"Jemsi\\" by the Hadzabe, participates in all phases of their lives--the hunting and gathering, the long, thirsty treks in the bush, the seemingly endless drinking of intoxicating pombe, the meals of everything from monkey brains to baboon marrow, and dangerous, unprotected sex with camp followers, who believe that baboon oil will protect them from AIDS.<br /><br />The reader cannot help but admire the gusto with which the author approaches this life, his genuine fear that this culture will soon die completely, and his reverence for their beliefs, their connection to the land, and their ancestors.  But it's impossible also not to wonder about the authenticity of his observations when he is so often paying to accompany the Hadzabe in the bush, when it is his flashlight the Hadzabe sometimes use to blind the small antelope they kill and eat, and when so much of his knowledge seems to come from visions or in dreams.<br /><br />And he can always escape.  During an uncomfortable time of heavy rains, he takes a vacation, flying to Zanzibar, where, he says, the \\"energy of the stars, the earth, the trees, the animals...all seemed to channel through me...I was creatively on fire and sexually out of control...The ancient man inside me had awakened and was struggling violently with the modern man,\\" which sounds like a creative way of saying, \\"The devil made me do it.\\"<br /><br />Stating in his preface that he \\"came to understand the importance of exaggeration...to create a more universal truth for the listening party,\\" the author conveys his excitement in a skillful narrative, which often includes striking imagery: of elderly people entering the camp \\"like slow wakes in still water,\\" and of walking \\"through the oracles of singing red birds.\\"  His visions, dreams, and psychic premonitions, however, may cause the reader to pause, wondering if they are part of the exaggeration he finds so important here.  And there is unintended irony, with Nubea, an old Hadzabe, mournfully asking, \\"Why are the forests eaten by the corn and bean?\\" [p. 176] , while the author, just a few pages later [p. 185], admires the life of a friend in Zanzibar, stating, \\"One could definitely envy the family's way of life.

With his grim humor, ironic detachment, and mordant examination of profoundly disturbed psyches, McCabe always provides thrills and chills for the reader, forcing us to share the unique lives and grotesquely skewed viewpoints of his characters.  Here the reader is drawn into the mind of transvestite prostitute Pussy Braden, the son of a priest and the teenage Mitzi Gaynor lookalike he raped, as he asks \\"How can I ever belong on this earth?\\" and tries, often pathetically, to find the answer.<br /><br />Set in the 1960's and 1970's, a time in which IRA bombings occur as frequently as Beatles hits, McCabe's tale juxtaposes sectarian violence against Pussy's search for love and a very personal peace, the enormity of the bloodshed contrasting with Pussy's campy search for the perfect costume, fabric, or skin cream, and the grand goal of \\"political justice\\" contrasting with Pussy's search for a home.  Pussy is writing his story for Dr. Terence Harkin, his absent psychiatrist, and the reader quickly discovers that he is a very unreliable narrator, inventing scenarios in which he claims to play significant roles and acting out his fantasies.  McCabe's prose style here reflects Pussy's preoccupation with popular music, among other  things, often sounding like a cross between the song lyrics of the period and the songs of Shakespeare, with inverted syntax, complex sentence patterns, and the kind of distortions one sometimes finds when a poet strains too hard for a rhyme or a character like Pussy strains too hard for an effect.<br /><br />While I love McCabe's facility with the language and his ability to make even an unlikely character like Pussy come alive and inspire compassion, this novel felt a bit strained to me.  The IRA violence, while certainly a sad part of the life and times, feels more like a parallel track in this novel than an integrated part of Pussy's psyche, and I found myself wondering if McCabe were using it to ratchet up the drama rather than for any light it might shed on Pussy's problems and their complications.  Still, McCabe is so good a writer that it's hard to imagine any lover of words and word play not responding enthusiastically to this novel.  It may not be as intense as The Butcher Boy or as wickedly thoughtful as The Dead School, but it's vivid and memorable, and in Pussy Braden it features a character not soon forgotten.

It is profoundly affecting to read a book which is not in its final form because its author was assassinated.  Doubly moving for the reader is this book's warning cry against mindless practitioners of fundamentalist oppression, the very people responsible for the author's death in Algeria.  Djaout clearly knew he was in danger, knew why he was in danger, and knew why he, along with other writers and artists, represented a threat to single-minded fanatics in his country, yet he continued to create, leaving behind this final book, a legacy not just to compatriots who might feel like lonely soldiers against intolerance but to lovers of books throughout the world who sometimes take for granted the power and glory of a free press.<br /><br />Almost plotless, the book reveals the thoughts and feelings of Boualem Yekker, a lonely man who finds himself living \\"a blank life\\" in a society which has been subsumed by the Regulators of Faith, zealots who worship a god of vengeance and punishment and do not recognize love, forgiveness, or compassion.  Several far more compelling, but unwritten, stories parallel this plot, however.  First is the powerful story which the reader cannot help but conjure of the author's own travails as a writer trying to find an outlet for his creativity within a similar society, and his eventual assassination.  Equally compelling is the interior story the reader cannot help but create, and which I believe the author expected his reader to create, of what his own life would be like under similar circumstances.<br /><br />Poetic and thoughtful, Djaout makes the world of a fanatical theocracy come alive, a world which many readers, like myself, could read about but not even begin to understand in the days after September 11.  By allowing us to share the thoughts of a man whose \\"opinion of life was too high for him to make do with its shadow, its wrapping, and its peelings,\\" we are granted entr&eacute;e into such a world.  Perhaps this is Djaout's greatest and most heartfelt gift to a public which did not listen in time to save his life.  This is a stunning book from which only the most jaded reader will emerge unmoved and unchanged.  Mary Whippleift to a public which did not listen in time to save his life.

Thepageturner's review (below) inspired me to get this book, and Marius's hypnotic writing kept me reading it, almost non-stop.  This is a huge, panoramic novel of 1950's Tennessee, set in Bourbonville, also the setting for After the War, and involving later generations of some of the same families.  Hope Kirby's killing of his wife and her lover start the spiralling action in this thoughtful, but exciting, novel and provide the forum for the author's extended study of the different ways we define justice and seek retribution.<br /><br />Charles Alexander, a college student and newspaper reporter who accidentally witnesses the double murder, escapes being executed by Kirby only because he promises not to tell what he's seen.  Charles, however, eventually becomes overwhelmed with guilt and confesses to the sheriff that he was a witness.  While this action might seem on the surface to be clearly a correct action, it is not so simple in Bourbonville, where many believe the \\"code of the hills\\" is inviolate and Charles's breaking of his word of honor to be a serious betrayal.  Even the clergy get in on the action, some advocating that he retract his statement, and Charles finds himself with few friends and even fewer supporters.<br /><br />Plenty of drama, and even melodrama, keep the reader going, and the pages fly by, as we become totally caught up in the plot and in the lives of the characters, all of whom face demons of some sort.  Marius is a master of keeping mysteries alive and making us understand and care for these characters, even those we dislike or consider misguided, because he makes us share their experiences, often through flashbacks.  The complexities of religious faith, which we see as Charles and many other characters battle their doubts, are brought into sharp focus as we also share the traumas many characters have experienced during World War II, traumas still affecting both their earthly and spiritual lives.  Marius takes on the big questions and provides a fascinating novel in which love and justice sometimes seem ineffable goals in a society which often honors tradition and shared community values far more than humanity and individual worth.

Filtering the whole story through the eyes of Philip Carver, a collector of antique books in his late 40's, the author startles the reader by making no effort whatsoever to involve him vicariously in the action, something we now take for granted in modern fiction.  Instead, he requires the reader to get to know Philip through his first-person narrative, draw conclusions about his background, and observe how unfolding events change his perceptions, not only about present actions, but of the past, as well.<br /><br />Philip is, at heart, very much a southern gentleman, despite the fact that he thinks he has escaped his Nashville and Memphis heritage for New York, where he has lived for almost fifteen years, unmarried, with Holly Kaplan.  Despite the painful relationship he has had with his autocratic but reserved father, now in his eighties, he responds to a series of phone calls from his unmarried sisters and returns to Memphis, where his father is planning to remarry, an eventuality which the sisters find anathema and which they are determined to countervail.<br /><br />Both the immediate situation in Memphis and the history leading up to it are told in the past tense, with flashbacks to still earlier times, a rare and difficult narrative approach which keeps the reader at arm's length, but Taylor manages to give emotional power to unfolding events, in part, because Philip's narrative restraint contrasts so sharply with the meanness and manipulation of his \\"well-meaning\\" father and, now, his sisters.  The irony grows as the reader sees parallels between the present circumstances of the father, his fianc&eacute;e, and the sisters, and events which happened many years ago.  The tables have been turned, but Philip exhibits no sense of victory, no gloating, only growing self-awareness and understanding.

If what you are looking for is a delicious, show-stopping dessert, with no thought at all to calories, cholesterol, or fat content, you'll find loads of them here, starting with the scrumptious-looking cover photo of a Coconut Cream Cheese Poundcake. Those on diets of any kind may have a harder time finding appropriate recipes.<br /><br />Southern Living has collected their best recipes from the past thirty years, including, apparently, quite a few from those blissful years in the 70's when the future seemed to stretch on forever and we felt no guilt about indulging our taste for lots of butter, eggs, and heavy cream. The recipes are all fantastic and relatively easy to prepare, and some, such as the Baked Spicy Beef Chimichangas have been updated to suggest spraying them with cooking spray and baking them, rather than deep frying, to lower the fat content, though the frying instructions are still included. None of the recipes, however, include any nutritional analysis.<br /><br />What I find most surprising is the extent to which the baking recipes, especially, have not changed with the times. I had hoped the book would help me update some of my S.L. favorites by suggesting some options for reducing the fat and cholesterol while still remaining delicious.  Alas, of the 25 recipes for cakes (excluding jelly rolls), nine still call for at least one full cup (one-half pound) of butter. Some also call for six eggs.  No options are suggested, though there must be some which would not compromise the recipes too much!  When one adds to this the fact that the microwave is seldom, if ever, mentioned and that none of the recipes seem to indicate whether something can be frozen or for how long, the cookbook feels a bit dated, not completely in tune with today's greater health-consciousness and S.L.'s older readership trying to be more conscientious about food preparation.

Designed for those of us who love the taste of \\"balsamic vinegar\\" but don't know much about it (I didn't even know it came from grapes!), this beautifully illustrated niche book is full of fascinating historical tidbits and some tantalizing recipes.  Once limited to wealthy families of Modena and Reggio in Italy, the syrupy, sweet-sour treasure known as aceto balsamico was regarded as an heirloom, included in a daughter's dowry, and given out in small vials to particularly honored guests.  Even now, the real thing, dating from 1650, can sell for as much as $535 for 3 oz., enough to fill only six tablespoons.<br /><br />In explaining how the Reggiano consortium has certified balsamico tradizionale since 1987, the author describes the various grades in heady terms usually reserved only for fine wines, making them sound so tempting that one longs for the chance to sample them, despite their prohibitive prices.  The recipes are zesty (even if one must make them with the imitation balsamico they sell in supermarkets) and, for the most part, simple enough to inspire the reader to think of adjusting some family favorites by adding a splash of balsamic vinegar.  The Italian Gazpacho, Spicy Blueberry Chutney for curries, the Mediterranean Vegetable Stew with Parmesan Polenta, and the Tomato and Mozzarella Pizza with Balsamic Pesto are some of the savory delights here, though I'll take a pass on the desserts.  An excellent book for the adventurous cook, though one might wish for more than just 44 recipes.  Mary Whipple	2001-12-18

When you are ready to break out and try something really fun, however, this is the book you'll want!  The Bread Machine Primer at the beginning answers every question you could possibly have about machines and ingredients, explains the chemical interrelationships between salt, sugar, yeast, and flour, and, best of all, even tells you how to adapt your grandmother's non-bread-machine recipes and other family favorites for use with the bread machine.<br /><br />Even the \\"Plain\\" Breads in this book are much more imaginative and interesting than average--Beer Bread, Potato Bread, and Cheese Bread are not exactly \\"white bread.\\"  The Whole Grain Breads are fantastic, with the Wild Rice Bread and Yogurt Corn Bread among our special favorites.  Savory Breads feature Welsh Rarebit Bread, Prosciutto Loaf, and a really toothsome Olive Bread.  Holiday Eggnog Bread, Rum Raisin Loaf, Peaches and Cream Loaf, and Welsh Currant Bread are just a few of the Sweet Breads to keep you constantly tempted.

In this dazzling tour de force, Maurensig plays a clever intellectual game, setting traps for the reader, his prey.  Fiendish in his deceptions, he actively engages our emotions from the outset, evoking curiosity about his mysterious characters and their circumstances, inspiring sympathy for teenage musicians surviving psychological torment in music school, and creating enormous empathy for an orphaned boy, homeless, unloved, and passionate about his music.  We feel rather than think, we get caught, and we love it.<br /><br />What makes the book even more remarkable to me is that while the author is playing tricks with the reader's emotions and views of reality, he is also creating a passionate tribute to the power of music and artfully structuring his book in the pattern of a musical canon--a  round, in which a \\"melody\\" is introduced and then chased indefinitely by its imitation, until, as in this novel, it rises \\"to its supreme fulfillment in an original burst of mutual genius...and [then begins] its descent, its countdown,...its canone inverso.\\"<br /><br />The symbolic melody of a valuable 16th century Stainer violin sets the voices of the canon's narrative aswirl.  The first voice, an unnamed old man, buys the violin at auction.  The second voice, a writer and passionate lover of music, comes to his hotel the next day to see, and attempt to buy, the violin from its new owner. He tells the old man the story of Jeno Varga, a Hungarian itinerant musician who once owned the violin and who stupefied a tavern audience, playing rapturously the previous year.  \\"One of music's fighters\\" whose career had, for some reason, been interrupted, Jeno becomes the third and dominant voice as he tells his story to the writer.<br /><br />Many readers have talked about reading the book a second time to answer questions about Jeno and his life and to understand the ending.  While I rarely reread a book, I did with this one, marveling at the author's cleverness, amazed at how clearly the characters and events fall into place and the questions are answered, once one has the benefit of hindsight.

This is a Very Serious Work, one that cannot be read (or summarized) quickly without doing it an injustice.  A newly created,  \\"classical\\" epic for the first hundred pages, it has larger than life heroes from Greek mythology fighting great, ancient battles in which the survival of a culture is at stake.  King Meleager of Kalydon, the lone huntress Atalanta, her dog Aura, and her cousin Meilanion are, with sixty other hunters, trying to conquer a ferocious boar unleashed upon the country by the angry goddess Artemis.  As the other hunters fall prey to jealousies, duplicities, and betrayals, these three alone face the final battle, the outcome of which is never clear.<br /><br />The rest of the book tells parallel stories from three 20th century time frames, involving modern characters whose lives involve similar battles with \\"the boar\\" and what it represents. Solomon Memel, Ruth Lackner, and Jakob Feuerstein are teenage friends in Romania in 1938, when the Russians and, soon afterward, the Nazis, occupy the country, create ghettos, and bring the Holocaust.  In 1952, Solomon publishes a poem, \\"Die Keilerjagd,\\" in which he describes his World War II experiences with partisans in Greece, paralleling the boar hunt of the ancient heroes, as they chase a Nazi field commander through the same mountains in the war's waning days.  Some years later, when Sol is 49 and a heroic icon to schoolchildren, Ruth, a successful theater figure, decides to make a film of his poem and experiences, and the accuracy of his poem and memory are challenged publicly.  Sol's battles to fill the gaps in his memory and to recall uncertain events represent yet another battle with the boar.<br /><br />Time is flexible here, filtered through the consciousness of Sol, as memories from all three time periods crowd his life in no particular order, and he recollects one event after another, perhaps imperfectly.  Norfolk does not always dot all the I's and cross all the T's as Sol tells his story, requiring the reader to bring his/her own consciousness to the interpretation of events, and, like Sol, to keep an open mind to alternative interpretations.  His concern with myths, both ancient and modern, how they are created, what they reveal about human needs, how they reflect reality, and why they are perpetuated give tremendous impact and broad scope to his several stories.  The hypnotic, musical cadences and the elaborate, minutely detailed descriptions lend a weightiness appropriate to an epic.  The action is intense, the themes are universal, and the scope of the author's vision seems almost limitless.

Hidden within this fantastical tale of spirits, ghosts, and surreal happenings, is a message that speaks directly to the soul--a message so timely, so heartfelt, and so broad in its applications that it feels like the culmination of everything Bradbury has learned and wanted to say during his lifetime.  With a lyricism and warmth which never become precious, he issues a manifesto for keeping life's mysteries alive, for celebrating the world of the spirit, for reaching and stretching and never taking anything for granted, and most of all for understanding and staying connected, lovingly, with the past and its wisdom--not just the recent past, but a past going back beyond the ancient Egyptians to the beginning of time. \\"Would you not admit,\\"  he asks, \\"that forty billion deaths [represent] a great wisdom, and those forty billion who shelve under the earth are a great gift to the living so that they might live?\\"<br /><br />Centering the action around the House, a huge dwelling created from \\"tumults of weather and excursions of Time\\" in Green Town, Illinois, Bradbury creates a fanciful population from the spirit world, and one young, human boy, who loves them and whose job it is to record this Family's history.  With Cecy, a goddess of wisdom who is \\"all the senses of all the creatures in the world,\\" acting as his mentor, Tim, the young boy, shares the spirit world and their history, and searches for insights into the future.

Whenever a novel wins multiple French prizes, it usually exhibits two notable traits:  first, its celebration of France's glorious past (in this case, its 19th century romantic authors, especially Balzac) and second, its condescension to the female characters (in this case, an unnamed \\"little Chinese seamstress\\").  This is not to say it is not a good book--it is!  But the main characters' expressed desire to  \\"civilize\\" and ultimately \\"transform\\" the little seamstress may be a difficult cultural pill for independent American women to swallow, much less empathize with.<br /><br />Set during China's Cultural Revolution, the two main characters, city-dwelling young men of 17 and 18, have been sent to the countryside for re-education, which in this case means hauling excrement down from a mountain ironically named \\"The Phoenix of the Sky.\\"  Luo, the friend of the narrator, is a good storyteller, and the village headman eventually sends the two young men repeatedly to the nearest small city, a four-day round trip on foot, to view a movie and then return and \\"tell it\\" to the village.  In a neighboring village, they meet the beautiful young seamstress, \\"the princess of Phoenix mountain,\\" whom Luo wishes to improve and with whom he fancies himself in love. When the men obtain access to a hidden cache of forbidden romantic novels, mostly French, they devour them, using them to \\"educate\\"  the seamstress and entertain the villagers.<br /><br />Fascinating for its views of Chinese rural life and intriguing for its lovely descriptions of the natural world, its simple style, and its ability to show the universality of emotions-- jealousy, fear, sympathy, self-protection, quirky humor, and passion--this is a very well-written and entertaining novella, too short to allow for significant development of character and theme.  Its symbolism will be familiar to most readers--a snake, keys, a narrow walkway between deep gorges, fearless plunges into the water, etc.--and its ending is inevitable. A simple story, simply told.

Though Chip Kidd is best known as a \\"graphic designer\\" for book covers (as opposed to \\"commercial artist,\\" a distinction he makes in the book), his talent as a writer could propel him into a whole new field--and this book into cult icon status.  With a clarity of vision perhaps brought on by hindsight, he lays bare the emotional and intellectual confusion of a naïve, first year art student at a state university, a character who must find himself in an atmosphere which requires him to evaluate all the ideas and values he's uncritically absorbed to date.  The character, who feels autobiographical, is lively, funny, and, I thought, totally believable, and I suspect that any reader who has ever taken an art course will empathize, if not identify, with him in some way.<br /><br />As the speaker lives through this \\"novel in two semesters,\\" he is profoundly affected by an off-the-wall female upperclassman, Himillsy Dodd, a free-spirited, hard-drinking woman of strong opinions, willing to challenge everyone and everything.  Opposing hypocrisy wherever she finds it (virtually everywhere), Himillsy serves as a quirky mentor during the speaker's first two art classes, the second of which is with Winter Sorbeck, a never-to-be-forgotten instructor who turns his students' thinking inside-out, viciously critiquing not only of their work but also their personalities.  As \\"Happy\\" deals with Sorbeck, Himillsy, the usual freshman tensions, fraternity parties, exams, critiques, and all-nighters, the reader shares his anxieties and feels his growth.<br /><br />The amusing cover of the book resembles a doodled-on freshman text, with a magic marker message written on the binding and side of the closed book, bleeding into the pages themselves.  The title, taken from one of Himillsy's sculptures, is as goofy as she is, though its meaning becomes clearer as the book progresses.  The ending is a letdown, however, and it feels as if the book got away from the author, who then had to take extreme action to resolve his subplots and themes.

As John Wesley Powell and his crew of nine follow the Green and Colorado Rivers through uncharted territory into the Grand Canyon in 1869, Vernon imbues them with so much energy and strength that this fictional account of their journey feels like the real thing--more like a well-written memoir than a flight of imagination.  His depictions of the canyons, mesas, geological strata, and the always changing river are so precise and vivid that they feel more like great photographs than prose.  His descriptions of the heat and privation have the intensity of old sermons of hellfire and damnation.<br /><br />With a lyricism as masculine and vigorous as the characters of his story, Vernon tells of two parallel, and eventually intersecting, journeys--the famous journey of John Wesley Powell and his crew on the river, and the fictional journey of a family of Paiute (Shivwits) Indians across the high mesas, as they try to reclaim a daughter which the father sold to Mormons in exchange for two guns.  Vernon alternates these narratives in successive sections, bringing the ironies of the two journeys into sharp focus.  The Powell expedition fights the forces of nature and is often at the mercy of the elements, struggling with equipment and scientific instruments, and in danger of running out of food.  The Shivwits, on the other hand, are in communion with nature, comfortable in their belief that nature will provide, as it always has--their struggle, of course, being to preserve their lands and culture.<br /><br />Vernon is a remarkable writer, equally adept at all aspects of writing--action sequences on the river, dialogues ranging from humorous to rancorous, insights into the characters' thinking, and a faithful adherence to the writing style of the period.  His ability to present very different descriptions of the same geographical features, as seen separately by the Paiutes and explorers, is nothing short of amazing.  This is a beautifully written, very masculine story of exploration and cultural conflict, one that should not be missed by anyone fascinated by tales of outdoor adventure and exploration.

Anyone who has ever been to Kenya's extraordinary game parks to see the elephants, or dreamed of doing so, will be fascinated by this story of how these parks came to be the refuges they are and not the corrals for government-sanctioned poaching that they were.  When paleontologist Richard Leakey took over the Department of Wildlife and Conservation in 1989, rampant corruption, theft, absenteeism, and a don't-care attitude were hallmarks within the department.<br /><br />The Kenyan government lacked a real commitment to conservation, and the burgeoning population exerted pressure on national park borders, clearing land for farming and threatening wildlife, unimpeded.  Poaching, patronage, a general ripoff mentality, and collusion between park rangers, politicians, blackmarketeers, and smugglers, were so interconnected and seemingly so ineradicable that the department resembled a many-headed hydra.  Tribal rivalries within Kenya, a porous border through which Somalian thieves made forays, and a lack of agreement between Kenya and neighboring African countries about the best way to conserve animals made this one of the most daunting management challenges imaginable.<br /><br />In prose that is as direct and to the point (and sometimes as self-congratulatory) as he is, Leakey tells how he managed a multimilliondollar corporation in a country in which everyone wants a piece of the pie, usually under the table.  As Leakey tells of cleaning up the department and conserving the elephants, the reader also learns about the economics of the ivory trade, the tug-of-war between immediate political realities and long-term goals, the role of the World Bank in African development, and  the politicking involved in deciding what is an endangered species under the U.N.'s Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).  It's a fascinating tale, equally intriguing to the lover of wildlife, the student of management, and the East African history buff.  Mary Whipple	2001-11-25

In this highly structured novel of life within the Chinese People's Liberation Army and in the very rural countryside, Ha Jin offers the reader a way to understand the culture and character of people living under repressive conditions.  To Lin Kong, his wife Shuyu, and his chaste lover Manna Wu, life is a process of acceptance, not choice, a life in which there are no personal goals, other than working for the greater good of the country and its leaders.  Because the concept of freedom simply does not exist here, it never enters anyone's mind.  No one feels its loss or yearns for it, and an individual seeks neither happiness nor pleasure, instead finding satisfaction within the system.<br /><br />Lin Kong, a physician working eleven months of the year in Muji City while his wife works the farm in Goose Village, experiences the sensations of love for the first time when he is attracted to Manna Wu, a nurse at his army station.  Having previously accepted an arranged marriage, he is the legal husband of an older woman whose only attraction has been the care she lavished on his sick and elderly parents.  For eighteen years he endures the limbo of trying to obtain a divorce from his wife while obeying the army's requirements that he and Manna Wu remain physically chaste.<br /><br />Ha Jin's prose is efficient and straightforward, much like the life of his characters, and one neither expects nor misses the flights of poesy so often found in novels of China written by westerners.  The chief attraction of this novel is the care with which Ha Jin recreates the atmosphere of life in Communist China, showing us how ordinary people conduct their lives under conditions which we would find intolerable.  His careful choice of details to illuminate the ironies of his characters' lives give power to a narrative about people who have no individual power.  He succeeds admirably in bringing to life characters whose whole concept of what it means to be a person is diametrically opposed to our own, making humans out of people who live lives of structure, not of choice.

As much fun to read as any book by Redmond O'Hanlon or Gerald Durrell, A Primate's Memoir is funny, irreverent, and full of adventure, while also being a serious scientific study of the savanna baboons of Kenya.  Sapolsky's goal is to determine the relationship of baboon stress levels to their overall health over a period of years.  A neuroscientist, he observes the social hierarchy and interactions of his baboon group, guesses which individuals appear to be most stressed or most relaxed and then checks their hormones and blood chemistry, not an easy procedure, given his clever and not always co-operative population.  Sapolsky, who works alone, must first outwit the baboon, use a blowgun to dart him, follow and wait for him to become unconscious, and then carry him half a mile or more to his portable lab facilities, where he then draws blood and does measurements.  The baboons, of course, react to stress the way humans do.<br /><br />The title of A Primate's Memoir is deliberately ambiguous--it is both Sapolsky's memoir and that of his baboon population, and his experiences and interactions with the outside world are remarkably similar to theirs.  Leaving the relative safety of the game reserves and hitchhiking into dangerous territories during his \\"down time,\\" Sapolsky describes his travels with enthusiasm, impeccable timing, and great, self-deprecating humor, subtly selecting details which show how similarly he and his baboon population deal with their worlds' uncertainties.  Kenya is experiencing civil unrest and corruption; Uganda has just deposed Idi Amin; the Sudan is in the midst of a long civil war; the border of Zaire is under siege; and the Somalis refuse to accept any borders at all, stealing lands and property wherever they go--all dangerous and stressful atmospheres for their populations and for visitors like the author.<br /><br />Sapolsky is a great story teller, however, equally entertaining in presenting both his adventures and his research, his world and that of his baboons.  While life may be \\"nasty, brutish, and short,\\" Sapolsky shows us it's a lot more fun if one keeps a sense of humor--and a lot less stressful.  Mary Whipplehis baboons.

A popular Hawaiian bumper sticker asserts, \\"Poi happens,\\" while a contemporary Hawaiian song repeats the refrain, \\"No huhu (stay cool).\\"  Kathleen Tyau develops these quintessentially Hawaiian themes as she traces the aspirations and disappointments of two women and their friendships, loves, and families over the course of forty years.  Alice Lum, the Chinese/Hawaiian narrator, sensitively observes people and events from her perspective as a 50-ish mother of adult children, at the same time that she reminisces about her life as a young girl in Honolulu in the time of the Pearl Harbor attack and later as a young wife living in the remote Maui town of Hana.  Most of these memories involve Annabel Lee, her hapa-haole (part Causasian) best friend from St. Andrew's Priory, with whom she still feels close--\\"The sisters taught me religion, but Annabel taught me how to dream.\\"<br /><br />With her chatty tone, short sentences, and occasional lapses into pidgin, Alice recreates her domestic life without embellishment or exaggeration, her story achieving power through her acceptance of events and circumstances which might have crushed a weaker woman.  Unlike Annabel, whose goal was always to escape the islands into a more glamorous life on the mainland, Alice \\"makes do,\\" achieving a dignity and nobility through her acceptance of what is--\\"We have our own battlefields.  We survive in our own way.\\"  As she reveals her life and talks about those she loves, we gain insights not only into personalities, especially that of Annabel, but also into the culture which Alice has embraced.  Alice is a vibrant force to which readers will be drawn and a person with whom many will identify.  No huhu, Alice.  Mary Whipple	2001-11-12

Hodgson certainly doesn't beat around the bush, establishing the eerie mood of this unique novel with her opening sentence:  \\"Helen woke up in the middle of the night wearing someone else's breasts.\\"  If that doesn't catch your attention, Helen's encounters on the train from Munich to Vienna should.  A grotesque female doctor gives Helen an antique wooden box filled with medical memorabilia for her \\"search\\";  an old woman, accompanied by a young man wearing eye makeup, demands in vain that Helen change her seat, then leaves her a diamond ring;  and a talking dog offers her a new pair of shoes, while his mistress plops herself down and begins to shave her legs.<br /><br />A combination of a fever dream and a nightmare, this strikingly illustrated novel explores the five senses and the anatomy associated with them, as Helen, a specialist in anatomical illustration, searches for her missing husband and expands her vision of life's possibilities.  Martin, her husband, is a journalist who has been investigating art fraud in Europe, specifically fraud involving the woodblocks used to reproduce the anatomical studies of Vesalius in 1543.  Helen's mysterious wooden box includes a Vesalius woodcut, which may provide a key to unraveling Martin's disappearance, but the contents of the box are always changing, as virtually everyone Helen meets either adds or subtracts objects.  A series of new mysteries emerge, involving horrible murders and suicides among the people Helen has met.<br /><br />While the book is certainly intriguing in many ways, Hodgson pushes the envelope so far that I wondered if she were deliberately trying to out-weird all other contemporary authors with her plot.  The \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" ended early for me.  Unlike some other readers, I did not find the book \\"light,\\" or  \\"whimsical.\\"  Rather, I found it dark and gloomy, filled with depressing visions of raw humanity.

You can almost smell the literary mothballs as this very old-fashioned mystery, set in Gay Nineties San Francisco, unfolds and develops.  Adhering faithfully to the tone and atmosphere of the time, and using much of the vocabulary and style of the period,  Oakley Hall fills his pages with historical detail as he fleshes out a story of the death of King Kalakaua of Hawaii, including the rivalry for his throne, the influence of the sugar barons, and the pressure of the U.S. government for a lease on Pearl Harbor as a Pacific port. Despite the complex subject matter, Hall's style is surprisingly economical and restrained, and he advances the action quickly, presenting Ambrose Bierce, a real 19th century journalist and writer, as his clever, Holmes-like detective, with the narrator, Tom Redmond, as his much more sympathetic, Watsonian sidekick.<br /><br />Old Hawaiian customs, sensitive issues of race and color, and America's imperialism all directly affect this plot, and Hall takes great care to depict these issues accurately.  Unfortunately, the book gets bogged down in its own minutiae.  Well over two dozen characters play roles here, some with similar names, and the reader, not knowing who may eventually become important in all the plots and subplots, must keep track of them all in order to understand the action.  Additionally, the main plots regarding succession to the Hawaiian throne involve complex genealogies and political motivation, and there are innumerable subplots and digressions.  These include the disappearance of a princess, mysterious and unavenged deaths from the past, blackmail and extortion, Haunani Brown's various love affairs, her search for information on her parentage, the women's suffrage movement, spiritualism and voodoo, white slavery, the introduction of leprosy and other diseases to the islands, and even a gay love connection in San Francisco, certainly enough to keep any reader fully occupied.<br /><br />Still, if you are fascinated by Gay Nineties San Francisco and by Hawaiian history, this unusual mystery with its careful rendering of the atmosphere of the period should provide you with hours of pleasure.

Like an elaborate concert piece sung by a soloist to display his full range of talents, this early tour de force by Malouf showcases his remarkable versatility with literary styles, a talent which comes to full fruition in his later award-winning novels.  Taking us into the mind of a terrorist/assassin as he waits to commit a murder, this novella may have been shocking when it was written in 1982, but its impact has been lessened to the point of insignificance by contemporary events.  The story's impact is further lessened because Malouf keeps us at a distance from the killer, severely restricting the killer's consciousness to his sense impressions about the world around him, his remembrances and warm feelings toward his childhood and family, his everyday life, and his philosophical musings about his predestined relationship with his chosen victim.  The reader is given no clue about what has made this man a terrorist or what his ultimate purpose might be--he is like a child playing a very deadly game.<br /><br />Malouf's dense images of the sights, sounds, and smells of rural Italy, of the city where a terrorist murder is planned, and of the distant piazza where the murder will take place are vibrantly alive.  The main character's affection for his father, some lovely vignettes about his life in the country, and his kindness to an elderly woman in his apartment building make the killer seem not only human, but even personally admirable.  His ability to transport himself into the mind of his victim, and his beliefs about death and destiny show his sensitivity and his intelligence, certainly fine traits.  Ultimately, however, I didn't find the limited exploration of the killer's mind to be enough of goal in its own right--I wanted the author to provide a sense of significance and context for what otherwise appears to be a motiveless killing by an intelligent and sensitive man.

The small, personal, domestic dramas in the lives of women, which Miller portrays in this soul-baring, confessional narrative, will make this book appealing for many readers--chiefly women, I suspect--who will see themselves or events from their own lives in the emotional challenges faced by Catherine Hubbard and her grandmother, Georgia Rice.  But those who are hoping for a book which rises above the here and now and into the realm of universal themes and truths may be less enchanted.<br /><br />Catherine is a twice divorced mother of three from California who inherits and moves temporarily into the Vermont cottage in which she lived with her grandparents during her teen years.  Long interested in her grandparents' seemingly successful marriage, which contrasts sharply with her own marriages, Catherine embarks on some serious soul-searching as she tries to decide whether to stay permanently in Vermont and begin a new life.  While she is there, she discovers her grandmother's diaries and learns that her grandmother, too, faced personal crises and challenges.<br /><br />The let-it-all-hang-out confessions of the minutiae of Catherine's and Georgia's emotional lives seem, somehow, intrusive to me, too personal--not because they are so revelatory or shocking but because they are so mundane, so self-conscious.  The reader is hard pressed to find many universal truths which can illuminate aspects of our own lives in these revelations, and I ended up learning more about the daily emotional lives of these women than I really wanted to know.  Additionally, Georgia's diaries did not ring true to me.  Dignity, restraint, and, most of all, privacy, are so integral to the character of lifelong residents of Down East Maine and Vermont, especially elderly ones, that  while I could accept Georgia's behavior as real, I couldn't imagine anyone of her era putting it all in writing, and her supposed intention of having Catherine read the account some day seems too pat.

Anyone who reads this book in the mistaken belief that it will be a pleasant and nostalgic escape into vaudeville, the golden age of film, and the early days of television, may be disappointed.  This is not Carter Beats the Devil, delightful as that book is--it's far more ambitious.  McCracken uses a narrow focus on one Abbott/Costello type comedy team over a span of sixty years to delve into the broad spectrum of human emotions which makes life meaningful for each of us, insightfully developing themes about family, friendship, love, and the essence of communion and connection.<br /><br />Mose Sharp (Sharensky), a Jewish boy from Valley Junction, Iowa, is an only son among six sisters, destined to inherit his father's men's clothing store, until his sister Hattie inspires him to take his chances with vaudeville.  He runs away, meets up with Rocky Carter, for whom he acts as straight man,  and becomes half of a successful team, which goes from vaudeville, to popular B-movies, radio, and TV in the age of Eddie Cantor and Milton Berle.  Giving proof to the idea that you can take the boy out of Iowa but you can't take Iowa out of the boy, Mose remains true to the values he learned at home, escaping their narrow limitations while preserving their essence and, in contrast to Rocky, forming lasting and loving relationships.<br /><br />As McCracken explores the off-again, on-again relationship of Mose and Rocky over the span of sixty years, she draws parallels and contrasts between their relationship and that of a marriage, between friendship and family, between sharing an act and sharing one's life, between the little deaths inherent in a tumultuous partnership and the very real deaths one must cope with in real life.  It's a thoughtful, sensitive exploration of ideas within an intriguing framework, loaded with original imagery and observations (\\"he was a parsnippy-looking guy, scraped and pale...\\";  \\"eyebrows so plucked they looked like columns of marching ants\\").

One of Perez-Reverte's most outstanding characteristics has always been his ability to incorporate academic research and arcane and thought-provoking historical data into an exciting and stimulating historical mystery.  In the past, this research has always been an integral part of the novel's structure, and woe be unto the reader who, half-asleep when reading, misses a key detail or fails to note some crucial connection necessary to understanding the conclusion.  This novel is different.  Though it contains an intellectual mystery, it is also part treasure hunt, love story, character study, and treatise on sexual politics.<br /><br />Not totally successful on any of these levels, I found the novel entertaining, but lacking those special characteristics which have always made Perez-Reverte's books so mentally engaging.  The story is relatively simple. Coy, a seaman who has been suspended for two years because of an accident, begins working for Tanger Soto, a pretty, blonde librarian for the Museo Naval, who has purchased a maritime atlas which will help her to locate a sunken ship.  The ship, owned by the Jesuits, sank in 1767, and Tanger believes it carries a treasure, which she intends to find.  Predictable complications ensue.<br /><br />The plot divides into two parts--the first part is exciting and full of action as Coy and Tanger launch their search, while the second part is almost dead, as their rivals for the treasure disappear for almost 200 pages.  Perez-Reverte tries to keep the excitement going by having a particularly nasty rival reappear, menacingly,  from time to time on shore, but eventually the author has to resort to the cute trick of introducing a completely new character, the narrator, to juice up the narrative and the search for the sunken ship.  Even the foreshadowing is often heavy-handed: \\"He suspected that later...he would need to remember something about this place.\\"  Tanger, the \\"love interest,\\" is distant and duplicitous, and Coy is warned by virtually everyone in the book that she can't be trusted, something that prevents the reader from being caught up in the love story.

Ostensibly the illustrated story of Hippolyte Webb's search for an island which has disappeared from the maps, it is also a tribute to the spirit of adventure, the power of imagination, and the stick-to-it-iveness which sometimes makes dreams come true.  Webb, the former owner of a travel magazine and voyager to remote and unlikely places, is also a collector of antique maps and atlases.  Seeing the Aurora Islands halfway between the Falklands and South Georgia Island on old maps from the 18th century, but missing from later maps, he decides to try to find them, using equipment from the period.<br /><br />Hodgson's writing is lighthearted and often very funny, making what must have been a tremendous amount of research seem perfectly natural to an iconoclast like Hippolyte, with his eclectic interests and resistance to convention.  Her collages of drawings, maps, charts, and letters from Hippolyte, written on an old typewriter, are so much fun that I pored over them, looking at every detail, and I had to work hard to restrain myself from rushing ahead to see what new delights were waiting just a few pages ahead.  And Hippolyte himself is an irresistible character--truly romantic and a little flaky, to be sure, but conscientious and concerned enough with the details of his journey that even the most pedantic among us will empathize.<br /><br />Sailors, naturalists, archaeologists, geographers, engineers, historians accustomed to research using primary sources, and others grounded in the reality of the here and now should find the book a delightful escape. Those whose spirit of adventure sometimes propels them out of this world and into that of dreams, imagination, and new possibilities will find it positively magical.  And those who dabble in writing and drawing and wish we had more talent will be positively green-eyed at Hodgson's ability to do both so well.  Mary Whipple	2001-10-24

Winner of Canada's Giller Prize as the best novel of the year, this is a beautifully written, but excruciatingly painful, story of the Job-like suffering inflicted on a destitute family by mindless thugs, and the economic, political, and social climate of a community which allowed it to continue for twenty years.  During an unparalleled series of disasters visited upon this independent and hard-working family, the author tackles the big questions of whether justice can be achieved through a turn-the-other-cheek, New Testament morality or whether it is more appropriately served by the fierce retribution seen in the Old Testament, and where love fits into the picture.<br /><br />Lyle, the benighted young adolescent of the family, tries to live by his father's gentle code, while also trying to develop a sense of personal worth, establish relationships outside his family, protect his albino sister, and respect his parents, challenges he thinks are insurmountable when they ignore their persecution. Using vigorous, unadorned prose, Lyle conveys the harshness of his life unemotionally and honestly, judging himself as severely as he judges others.  Aged twenty-five when he tells his story, he is a man who has been tested in the fiery furnaces, a man who has \\"left the Valley of the Saints\\" and seeks to wrest control of his life.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the events which have scarred Lyle and his family are so ugly, so melodramatic, and so frequent that I became frustrated and angry at the family's passivity, so much so that I almost abandoned the book, despite the excellence of the writing.  It does not give away the plot to say that members of the family are mocked and laughed at, beaten, sexually abused, robbed, poisoned by toxic waste, separated from each other, forced to pay unjust taxes, excommunicated, denied food at the local market (even though they can pay for it),  and even drugged with LSD.  They are charged with theft (more than once), sexual misconduct, being unfit parents, the sabotage of a bridge, and even manslaughter.  Throughout all this, the parents console themselves with aphorisms about a man's heart and the belief that the evils done to them will rebound and destroy their enemies.  The religious parallels are obvious and plentiful, as is the sense of redemption.  I'm not so sure I agree about the justice of it all.  Mary Whipplethe sabotage of a bridge, and even manslaughter.

Unlike so many other thrillers, this is a subtle and thought-provoking novel, a search for moral truth within a mystery and a love story.  Creating fully developed main characters, filled with the good intentions and personal failings that make us all human, Kanon portrays the ethical dilemmas of the occupying forces in a devastated Berlin, just as the Potsdam Conference begins.  The Good German, an ironic title, explores the practice of American policymakers of \\"sanitizing\\" the Nazi connections of German scientists so that they may be spirited into the U.S. for work on the atomic bomb.  By transforming them into \\"good Germans,\\" as opposed to the \\"bad Germans\\" who will face war crimes trials, the American \\"good guys\\" reveal themselves to be as morally compromised, perhaps, as the German scientists, willing to stop at nothing, including murder, in order to keep these men from falling into the hands of the Soviets.<br /><br />Kanon's eye for the telling detail is unerring.  To fix the scope of the devastation, he remarks: \\"Buildings, like soldiers, were expected casualties of war.  But the trees were gone too, all of them...The dense forest of the Tiergarten, all the winding paths...burned down to a vast open field littered with dark charcoal stumps.\\"  He refers to those Jews who tried to delay their fates in the only way open to them as \\"U-boats,\\" hungry people who walked anonymously around the city all day, every day, so that they could not be identified by \\"friends,\\"  sometimes captured and deported when they took their worn out shoes to be repaired.  Nazi big shots are \\"golden pheasants.\\"  The Russians are said to \\"pack up the power plants and anything shiny and hope for the best,\\" while the Americans searching for scientists were doing \\"patriotic looting.\\"<br /><br />The several subplots--the search for Emil Brandt, the love story of Jake and Lena, the conflict between war crimes investigators and the State Department, in conjunction with U.S. industry, and the difficulties of sharing power with the brutal Russians--are smoothly integrated into a thoroughly engrossing narrative, which, in combination with the unique characters, allow the reader to keep track of what's going on and stay involved till the end.  I cannot attest to the accuracy of the history, but I came away from the novel with vivid images of the level of devastation in Berlin and a new appreciation of the difficulties faced by occupying forces.

Naipaul's Nobel Prize for Literature celebrates the long and illustrious career of a writer of extraordinary narrative gifts, amply demonstrated in this novel.  The reader can choose any page of the book at random and be stunned by a graceful turn of phrase, a unique observation, the pleasing alternation of starkly simple and elegantly complex sentences, or a perceptive comment presented with grace.  Though it is relatively short, it is dense in its thematic development, tracing the peripatetic life of Willie Somerset Chandran across three continents, and from his teen years to his early 40's, as he attempts to fit in, to be part of some mainstream.<br /><br />The offspring of a Brahmin functionary in a maharajah's court and an Untouchable woman, someone to whom his father was drawn temporarily in an effort to emulate the sacrifice of Gandhi, Willie belongs to neither group, an outsider even to the lowest caste.  He escapes to England, where he remains an outsider, for his schooling and an early career as a writer, eventually fleeing again with Ana, a Portuguese-African woman, to her farm in Mozambique, where he lives for eighteen years.  These are eighteen years in which he remains alienated, however, living half a life in a half-developed country to which he, apparently, is only half-committed.<br /><br />The political and racial tensions of the novel--the bloody independence movement in India, the Notting Hill race riots in London, and the guerrilla movement for independence in Mozambique--are vivid and dramatic, paralleling Willie's personal conflicts. His early sexual encounters, which might have brought him some sense of belonging, are unfulfilling, however, laden with racial overtones and additional tensions, and described by Naipaul in startingly passionless and unerotic prose. And while the novel has a good deal of irony and some satire, it has no sense of lighthearted fun.  Willie's need to belong is so intense it overpowers everything else.  Though the reader may feel sympathy for him, his self-centeredness and lack of feeling for other alienated people, especially Ana, ultimately keep him at a distance him from everyone, including this reader.<br /><br />Because Naipaul has mined the theme of displacement repeatedly in his novels and non-fiction, one cannot avoid wondering how much of this book is autobiographical.  Though that probably shouldn't matter, it is a distraction here. The book feels more like the nonfictional summing-up of a life, in which the reader is an objective observer, than a liberating fictional journey into a new world which the reader shares equally with the author.

As full of dramatic tension as anything written by Poe, this masterpiece of character development idealizes the personal values of a lost world, and celebrates the rewards and obligations of friendship.  Henrik, a former Austro-Hungarian general and member of the aristocracy, is approaching the end of his life, having lived 75 years according to the \\"male virtues: silence, solitude, and the inviolability of one's word.\\"  He is awaiting a visit from Konrad, his former best friend, a man he has not seen or heard from in 41 years and 43 days, a man he believes betrayed him and upon whom he has yearned for revenge for more than half his life.<br /><br />The simple narrative framework allows Henrik to tell the story through his own meditations and his one-sided conversation with Konrad after his arrival.  Touching first on the lives and marriages of Henrik's parents, his wife's parents, and then Konrad's parents, Henrik slides obliquely and seductively into the story of his friendship with Konrad, his courtship of Krisztina, and the first four years of his own marriage.  As tiny details emerge and build upon one another, the dramatic irony grows.  Henrik's vision of himself, his motivations, and his actions appear in sharp relief against the conclusions being drawn by the reader.  Henrik is, above all, an aristocrat, imprisoned by a value system he also embraces.<br /><br />As the parallel dilemmas he imposes on his wife and Konrad emerge ironically from Henrik's narrative, the reader is simultaneously fascinated and frustrated by Henrik's view of his own dilemma and his desire for Truth.  A heart-stopping climax and Konrad's dramatic reply to his interrogation, along with numerous breath-taking descriptions of nature, leave the reader awed by Marai's talent and grateful that this very clever and sensitive study of character and values has been reclaimed for posterity.

Sensitively portraying the aftereffects of World War I on the people of Bourbonville, Tennessee, this robust, dramatic novel is a triumphant celebration of the power of writing to create whole worlds and then lead the reader in exploring them.  Spanning the years from 1890 - 1930, the novel moves  back and forth in time, leisurely building detail upon detail until an entire community, several generations of its important families, its important businesses, and its religious and social organizations spring to life, tied together, as small communities often are, by custom, gossip, and a shared past, not all of it pretty.  As the war wreaks its changes on the fabric of society, the author explores life's big themes--what makes life meaningful, how we connect with each other, how we deal with death of loved ones, and how we face the future--adding an extra dimension through the symbolism of Greek legends, especially that of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun.<br /><br />Main character Paul Alexander (formerly Kephalopoulos), a Greek by birth and Belgian by education and social preference, arrives in Bourbonville, not fully recovered from a head wound received during the early days of the war.  Through Paul, an outsider who speaks to the ghosts of his two best friends, the reader comes to know a variety of local characters--a grassroots industrialist who runs the car works foundry for the local railroad, a leading family whose members realize that their agrarian way of life is ending, a  delightful moonshiner, the last of the family doctors who were truly part of the family, a brilliant black man whose technical achievements as a member of the French armed forces gave him a taste of life denied him in postwar Tennessee, and various members of Paul's own family back in Greece.<br /><br />Weaving together such diverse topics as the Spanish American War and the battle for Cuba, the early anti-war movement, the growth of railroads and industry, the early women's movement, the Ku Klux Klan (easily the most dramatic part of the book), strikes and the labor movement, Bolshevism, evangelical frenzy, and the interest in foreign travel, the novel is an expansive treatment of some of the early influences on 20th century thinking, and, as such, is fascinating.  Its comprehensive thematic development is equally striking.  It is somewhat less successful in its characterizations, which are not always consistent, and in its melodrama, which while emotionally seductive, tend to divide the book into separate and somewhat disconnected units.  Still, for those who enjoy big books which offer a treatment of equally big ideas, this is a captivating novel, great fun to read.

The earliest days of Sydney, Australia, and the prison colony which was its first population center provide a dynamic setting for this ambitious, old-fashioned novel.  With a broad scope, grand design, and sensitive treatment of universal themes, it has the weightiness of an epic, but is far more vigorous and more involving than that, with vivid, sympathetic characters who come fully to life.<br /><br />Transported halfway around the world to a forbidding and alien landscape, men and women prisoners share their personal struggles, providing a vitality and emotional punch one does not often find in fiction.  The reader soon discovers that the prisoners are not all that different, of course, from the civil servants and Marines who administer the colony--everyone in Port Jackson (Sydney) is a prisoner in some way or another, be it physical, spiritual, or emotional.<br /><br />Lt. Ralph Clark's decision to produce George Farquhar's early 18th century comedy, The Recruiting Officer, with an all-prisoner cast leads to many emotional conflicts.  Though the play provides the participants with a way to achieve a measure of dignity, they must still bow to the strictures of the colony off stage. Many prisoners wield cruel powers over other prisoners, while Marines and administrators exert power over both the prisoners and the aborigine inhabitants of the area.  The restrictions imposed by the church, in the person of Rev. Dick Johnson, aggravate tensions by concentrating on rules of behavior rather than on the human soul.<br /><br />Against this backdrop of the restrictions on their lives,  Keneally's characters are set in high relief, their humanity contrasting sharply with the impersonal forms of government which are imposed upon them.  Meticulously depicting 18th century England, its government, its penal system, and its social structure, along with early Australia, its first western inhabitants, the decimation of the aborigine population, and the social conflicts faced by its characters, this is one of Keneally's greatest novels, a timeless story based on real journals, stunning in its effect.

Let's face it--no one reads a Charles Knief mystery for the excellence of the writing or the tautness of the plot.  It's the Hawaiian setting, with its local Polynesian/Hawaiian characters, which is so alluring, and even the violence instigated by its underworld cannot dim that allure.  From a marina in Pearl Harbor, to a chase at sea on the way to Kauai, to the top of the Waimea Canyon, with its 500 inches of rain a year, Hawaii sings its siren song, and the reader follows along, not really caring how plausible or tightly controlled the plot may be.<br /><br />In this novel John Caine, private eye and friend alike to Honolulu racketeer Chawlie Choy and Police Lieutenant Kimo Kahanamoku, a relative of the famed surfer, Duke Kahanamoku, saves a naked woman from her enraged husband, who later turns up dead.  Fleeing from the Colombian emerald smugglers from whom she has stolen $20M of emeralds, she wants Caine to save her.  Between the boat chases and the flights through Kauai's Waimea Canyon rain forest and the Na Pali coast, horrendous mayhem takes place, ranging from grenade attacks to firefights and stabbings along wild pig trails, with perennial hero Caine emerging, of course, very bloody but unbowed.  Not the best of the John Caine series, Emerald Flash is still lots of fun, whether you read it to escape into an imaginary Hawaii or to revisit your favorite parts of Paradise.

The main character, Hardo, and two soldier friends had aided the Japanese in ousting the Dutch colonials who had ruled the country for years, their ultimate goal being the independence of the country.  After becoming disillusioned by the Japanese, they had attempted a coup, only to have it fail because of betrayal by one of the men.  The novel focuses on Hardo, running for his life ever since, in three encounters he has while disguised as a beggar, each encounter showcasing the conflicting loyalties within the country, and developing the suspense.<br /><br />Though the novel is intriguing and its powerful descriptions of nature are absolutely stunning, it is strangely inconsistent in tone and feels stylistically fragmented.  Hardo's first encounter, with his future father-in-law, is positively operatic, resembling a duet between wooden characters, their dueling voices swirling around almost like a canon.  \\"Come to the house,\\" the traitorous father-in-law says, echoing the invitation more than fifteen times, offering Hardo, disguised as a beggar, a variety of enticements, each of which he refuses.  In the second encounter, with his own father, the operatic style dies, more communication takes place, and a narrative emerges.  The third section, a meeting with co-conspirator Dipo, several others involved in the rebellion, Japanese officers, and the father-in-law is a fully developed theatrical scene, tying together the narrative and themes through dialogue.<br /><br />With the novel's structure echoing a variety of genres and its characters subordinated to theme, I found it difficult to become emotionally involved with the characters themselves, however much I might have been sympathetic to their plight and fascinated by the subject matter.  The novel clearly presages the greatness which comes to fruition in Pramoedya's later tetralogy, This Earth of Mankind, however, and I highly recommend it as an introduction to his more mature work.

Written in 1929, Some Prefer Nettles is as relevant and fresh today as it was more than seventy years ago.  Illuminating the conflict between the old, traditional ways of Japan and western, \\"modern\\" influences, obvious in Tokyo even in the 1920's, this story of an unsuccessful marriage could be contemporary, except in the details.  The social unacceptability of divorce in Japanese culture and the resulting tensions felt by three generations of a Japanese family allow the western reader to enter an emotional world, a world of conflict rarely shared with outsiders and almost never understood.<br /><br />Kaname and his wife Misako \\"do not excite each other,\\"  but they are stuck, perhaps permanently, in their loveless marriage.  If Misako leaves Kaname, she will have to return to her father's home, a social outcast, without her son, who will stay with his father.  Kaname will also suffer--he has failed as a husband.  Considering himself \\"modern,\\"  Kaname has allowed Misako to take a lover, while he finds satisfaction in geisha houses and with prostitutes.  As we follow this unhappy couple, we watch Kaname come increasingly under the influence of his conservative, traditional father-in-law, becoming more and more fascinated with old traditions--wearing the kimono, visiting the Bunraku puppet theatre, and appreciating the behavior of O-hisa, his father-in-law's doll-like mistress--while Misako relentlessly pursues materialistic and selfish goals, presumably western.<br /><br />Tanazaki creates beautifully realized domestic scenes, and his subtle dialogue reveals character by what is not said as much by what is said.  Kaname is a sympathetic character torn by his culture and loyalties, a man at the mercy of a cultural tradition which he also embraces.  The culture itself is presented lucidly, allowing the reader to admire both the depth of its traditions and the forms, artistic and otherwise, through which it is expressed.  This fascinating novel offers a westerner much to contemplate as we see how our emphasis on the individual engenders inevitable conflicts with societies valuing tradition and cultural uniformity.

With the liveliness of a stepdance and the simplicity of a Dingle Peninsula landscape, Keane introduces us to the harsh life of the close-knit community of Dirrabeg, a community facing extinction in the mid-1950's.  Many of the young have left for England or America, where there are opportunities and chances for secure lives.  Those remaining behind love their land and their independence but fear for the future as the bogs get thin, the yields are poor, and the children have little hope of success.<br /><br />For Donal Hallapy, devoted father of a large family, times are very tough.  But Donal is a bodhran player, an expert in the ancient drums of his Celtic forebears, a musician in great demand whenever the once-a-year wrendances take place, all-night singing and dancing hooleys which can be traced back to pagan times.  This paganism, the secret nature of the celebrations, the drinking that takes place, and the fact that the church has no control over them has made them anathema to \\"the clan of the round collar,\\" in the person of Canon Tett, an ultraconservative and downright sadistic priest determined to bring the free spirits of Dirrabeg to bay by ending the fun of the wrendances.<br /><br />The prose is straightforward and earthy, the dialogue salty and realistic, and the interactions of the characters so natural that one can share the joys and sorrows, the humor and anger, and the frustrations and all-too-brief personal satisfactions.  The natural world, which is exquisitely described, even in its harshness, takes on almost human dimensions, influencing the action directly, while providing a vivid canvas upon which the contest between church and village is played out.  The humor is broad, almost slapstick, but tempered by an overarching feeling of melancholy and impending doom.  Though some may find the clergy to be caricatures and the message a bit too didactic, Keane provides us a rare glimpse of the last days of a now-vanished world.  Mary Whipple	2001-09-30

Dunant is a real pro, subtly using every trick in the book to create a psychological novel of intense suspense, a novel that succeeds beautifully in keeping the reader involved, on edge, and dying to find out, first, what is happening to Anna, and second, what is real.  The main character, Anna, resembles many other single women about to turn forty.  She is a woman with whom most readers will empathize, even if they find her domestic history to be a bit unusual.  As she yearns for love and excitement, reveals her vulnerabilities, and shares her fears, all of which play their part in the mystery that develops during her one week vacation in Italy, Dunant ratchets up the suspense--we can imagine and share Anna's plight because she reflects our own insecurities.  The fact that she does not return to her loved ones on time, and is considered missing, coincides with our own worst fears, while the fact that neither we nor Anna are sure about what is real and what is fantasy parallels the neurotic daydreams and nightmares everyone shares.<br /><br />Dunant tantalizes the reader by presenting two parallel explanations for what happens on Anna's vacation.  As Anna tells us about her past relationships and the birth of her daughter Lily, now six years old, along with two other, very different relationships which may or may not be occurring in Italy while she is \\"missing,\\" Dunant provides just enough information to allow the reader to jump to conclusions, often incorrect, about what's going on.  At the same time, she increases the suspense by having Anna's friend Estella describe the chilling effects of Anna's absence on Lily and the rest of the household back in England.<br /><br />As the novel races to its conclusion, most readers will probably race along, too, unwilling to take a break till it's finished and the outcome known.  It is only after the fact, when we \\"recollect in tranquility,\\" that the true sense of Dunant's achievement can be appreciated--she has manipulated us like marionettes, and we have loved every minute of it.

Barney Panofsky and his cohorts are all artists of sorts--writers, sculptors, painters--Jewish intellectuals at odds with mainstream Montreal life, firmly convinced that they are right, the world is wrong.  Boisterous, loud, and resolute in pursuing the pleasures of drugs, alcohol, and women, they live life creatively and on their own terms, taking what they want, where and when they want it.  Their cynicism, self-righteousness, and self-absorption epitomize the lives of many young adults during the fifties and sixties, when much of the action of this novel takes place, via flackbacks.<br /><br />With great panache, Richler loads his complex narrative with pungent satire and wry humor as he shows Barney near the end of his life, reflecting on his three marriages and divorces, his affairs, his career as a producer of second rate films and ads, his drinking, and his trial for the murder of his best friend, some thirty years before.  Throughout the novel, Richler teases the reader with tiny pieces of information about the murder, creating suspense at the same time that he tamps it down with humor or neutralizes it by burying it in the mundane details of Barney's life over the span of forty years.<br /><br />Certainly not a traditional murder mystery, the reader never receives the clues necessary to solve the murder until the last pages of the book.  But solving the murder is hardly the point.  This is Barney's story--the story of an exasperating and sometimes annoying man almost totally lacking in charm, a man who has spent a good part of his life avoiding responsibility. Now in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, Barney is an unreliable narrator, trying valiantly to set down his version of what happened to Boogie Moscovich.  Only the most hard-hearted reader will fail to develop sympathy for Barney by the end of the novel, but I found it difficult to like him and his friends very much. As a result, I found this a hard read, despite my admiration for the author and delight in much of his humor.  Mary Whippleh of his humor.  Mary Whipple	2001-09-25

You can almost hear a vaudeville audience ooh-ing and aah-ing in the background, the tinny, honkytonk piano of a black and white movie, or the buzz of the Green Hornet, as you get caught up in this seductive piece of nostalgic writing, probably the best escape reading I've come across in years! Like the old-fashioned melodramas which entertained audiences from the turn of the century to the 1940's, this novel about magic creates its own world of superheroes and dastardly villains, one which quickly absorbs and enchants the reader.  As magician Carter says, \\"[Magic] is a way of turning back the darkness....[It] makes [the world] less awful for a moment or two....There's joy and wonderment to be had.\\"<br /><br />This is a novel of pure entertainment, an uncomplicated, imaginative, and highly visual narrative of almost comic-bookish simplicity.  Telling the story of Charlie Carter, from young child to traveling magician to the world-renowned Carter the Great, Gold recreates the mood the early part of the 20th century, skillfully incorporating into Charlie's life such diverse subjects as the death of President Harding, the cutthroat competition among magicians and vaudeville performers, the founding of the Secret Service, the country's fascination with psychic phenomena, the speculation and competition among those who finance the country's inventions, the development of early television, and even Yale's supersecret Skull and Bones Society.  A love story and a mystery, it also has a truly spectacular grand finale of an ending with a rapidfire series of illusions, deceptions, and escapes.<br /><br />The fabulous cover art, the period posters which precede the \\"Overture\\" and the three \\"Acts\\" of the novel, and the unrestrained glee with which Gold tells his tale make this novel both a visual and and emotional treat, an unpretentious, old-fashioned story which offers no apologies for its light-hearted tone.

Few readers will be able to resist the charm of Triton, who, eleven years old at the midpoint of the 20th century, becomes a member of Ranjan Salgado's Sri Lankan household as a houseboy. His life under the demanding and belligerent older servant Joseph is a challenge, and Gunesekera delightfully conveys Triton's point of view, skillfully revealing an 11-year-old's sensibilities and imagination as Triton envisions Joseph being brought low or stricken by disaster, while his own heroic acts save his master.  As Triton gets older and acquires more and more responsibilities, Gunesekera reveals a character of unwavering conscientiousness whose personal devotion to Salgado and admiration for his intellectual accomplishments are absolute.<br /><br />Reef is not just a story, however, as fascinating as that may be.  It is a delicate allegory of the small changes which can bring cataclysmic results to a society, just as the coral reef which Ranjan Salgado studies is \\"very delicate.  It has survived aeons, but even a small change in the immediate environment...could kill it.\\"  With the gap between the educated and the \\"underclass\\" in Sri Lanka very wide, and portentous changes occurring to the country politically, the reader is constantly reminded that, like the reef, \\"if the structure is destroyed...then the whole thing will go.\\"  As Salgado's love for Nili makes him more and more self-centered and less altruistic, and as political movements inspired by other countries become more aggressive, the \\"small changes in the immediate environment\\" begin for Triton.<br /><br />In prose that shimmers with the light of the tropics and the scent of flowers, the reader is absorbed into the Sri Lankan jungle and sea, watching as the outside world propels along the small changes which may devour everything--the jungle, the sea, and the cultural fabric of which they have all been part for eons.  As as one reads this remarkable novel, one joins with Triton and Salgado in yearning for peace,  the \\"twilight when the forces of darkness and the forces of light are evenly matched and in balance [and] there is nothing to fear.  No demons, no troubles, no carrion.

While some writers of police procedurals feature a detective who reappears throughout a long series of novels,  Bill James repeats not only his detectives, but also his \\"bad guys,\\" creating an entire world of fascinating characters to which devoted readers (including me) return again and again.  James's world is mad, complex, and even violent, but it is always full of irony and wry humor, and it is always thoroughly entertaining.  This novel, one of the early Harpur and Iles mysteries,  takes a bit longer than some others to get its legs, but once it does, it's off to the races.<br /><br />Like virtually all the male characters here, Chief Superintendent Colin Harpur does not find that having a wife and child in any way limits his social life.  This time, the middle-aged detective's extracurricular love is a 19-year-old college student whose best friend is the lover of Harpur's chief \\"grass,\\" or snitch.  When, as a result of information received from the informer, Harpur interrupts a robbery and kills the son of a vicious but somewhat inept criminal, he sets in motion a series of threats on the life of his lover Denise, thought to be a conduit of information between the informer and Harpur.  As Harpur tries to protect her, the informer, his reputation on the force, and his marriage and family, we come to know him as basically a good-hearted man who enjoys living way out on the edge, a man willing to bend every rule, if necessary.<br /><br />James manages to keep the excitement high and the threat of real violence foremost in the reader's mind at the same time that he presents some wonderfully funny scenes--the funeral of the thief Harpur killed, the disposal of a body which inconveniently appears on the grounds of a house where a lawn party is to be held, and the resulting garden party, almost certain to end the upward mobility of its host.  His peripheral characters are quirky and memorable, his dialogue is superb, the plot and motivations feel realistic, and the novel, overall, offers a terrific escape into a well-developed and exciting fictional world.

This haunting and ironic novel takes us into the heart, mind, and family history of a dedicated priest living in Rome, giving the reader a rare look at his insecurities,  the internal battles he faces, and the constant choices he must make.  Father Leo Newman is an expert in ancient scrolls from the Dead Sea.  Called to investigate a new, intact scroll in Jerusalem, he makes the startling discovery that this scroll is a record of what happened immediately after the crucifixion, as witnessed by Judas and Paul.  Its transcription and publication will call into question the accuracy of the more familiar gospels, all of which were written later than this scroll, and which have, until now, been the underpinnings of Christianity and its traditions.<br /><br />Mawer takes us into the mind of Father Leo as he battles the demons of doubt unleashed by his discovery, and other, entirely mundane demons represented by his love for Madeleine Brewer, the wife of a diplomat.  As the novel spirals from the present to the very near past and into the more distant past of Father Leo's childhood during World War II and back again, we see fascinating parallels between the betrayals Father Leo commits, and those of his mother, and of Judas.  The roles of Mary Magdalen, Madeleine, and Magda, all of whom even share a name, continue these intriguing parallels and expand the novel's themes.<br /><br />As Mawer investigates the many kinds of love--love of mankind, love of God, and romantic love--he also  shows us the multiplicity of threats to these kinds of love, and the difficulty of facing personal challenges armed only with black and white arguments.  Father Leo, an honest man doing the best he can to be true to his church, is, strictly speaking, guilty of betraying both individuals and the church, while Judas, usually thought of as the most villainous of betrayers, possesses a core of honesty here which calls into question the traditional view of him in later gospels.  This tour de force of a novel is a stimulating and thought-provoking study of love and truth, connecting a modern man with a much vilified disciple and raising the big question of whether a long-range good can come from a short-term betrayal and whether the price is worth it.

Bruce Olds has talent coming out his pores, and we see it on glorious display here in his intense imagery, poetic prose, and earnest attempt to recreate the psychology of Doc Holliday, who knew for fifteen years that he would die of tuberculosis.  Unfortunately, all this talent does not add up to a great novel, or even a good one.  With a main character about whom little primary information is available, the author resorts to mountains of repetition of the small details that are known in order to flesh out a novel-length story.<br /><br />Over fifty pages, for example, iterate and then reiterate, in only slightly different words, Holliday's realization that he will die from the tuberculosis which killed his mother, along with the symptoms of the disease, various names for it, and other famous people who died from it.  None of these advance Holliday's biography, nor do similarly long sections which list, among other things, various names for whiskey, alternative words for prostitutes, types of gambling games, and ways to cheat.  Newspaper excerpts describing Holliday, and quotations from people who knew Wyatt Earp, his friend, while interesting in an academic sense, are more like research than story, and they are merely presented, not integrated into a whole.  The inclusion of pages of Olds's poetry, along with his e. e. cummings-like manipulation of typefaces and spacing, feels artificial, more an attempt to elevate a flat story than part of a sensitive and carefully thought out novel.<br /><br />While some readers praise the author's attempt to bring Doc Holliday to life through the presentation of this collage, a technique which Michael Ondaatje does brilliantly and successfully in his The Collected Works of Billy the Kid, this reader found it an attempt to wrap a hollow box in a pretty package.

In the war's aftermath, he is beset by personal demons that are at least as terrifying as the war itself. An amateur geologist and rock collector after the war, Manase marries unhappily, has two sons, and runs his business as a bookseller.  He tries to escape the humanizing emotions which made his life as a soldier such hell, and which allow his post-war nightmares to flourish, by retreating to his rock collection and his workshop.  He can never escape the final days he spent in a cave in Leyte, however, a time in which following orders meant closing his eyes and killing the dying, even his friends, as they stared at him with the enlarged eyes of the starving.<br /><br />With taut prose and stunning imagery, Okuizumi generates sympathy for this damaged veteran whose internal war continues long after the peace treaty, and affects, especially, his relationships with his sons.  The climax, when it comes, is breath-taking, its power enhanced by Okuizumi's restraint and his belief that the careful reader will figure out the details for himself.  As the reader's comprehension of the events grows, so, too, does his understanding of the stones, the river, and the universe which Okuizumi creates here.  This is a novella of tremendous power which transcends national boundaries and touches on what makes us all human.  Mary Whipple	2001-09-05

If you read only one novel all year, let it be this one--so powerfully moving, yet carefully constructed, that it will surely win every literary award of the year.  Such a statement would be hyperbolic in any other context, but it is realistic here, and necessary to describe the magnitude of Franzen's ambition and achievement.  Spanning the last forty years of the 20th century, this is a magnificent family drama focusing on the elderly parents and three grown children in a midwestern family.  Labeling the characters as dysfunctional does not do justice to their uniquenesses or to the reader's ability to identify with them.  Their difficulties as a family arise because the family dynamics require them to hurt each other if they are to be true to themselves.<br /><br />Enid, the mother, while not assertive in a traditional sense, is nevertheless controlling, cleverly wielding the age-old guilt ploy to get her own way.  Albert, suffering from Parkinson's-induced dementia, is trying to hang on to the last shreds of his independence and dignity, while causing enormous strains on Enid and the rest of the family.  Gary, the eldest son, often manipulated by his wife and children and often depressed, believes in toughing it out, an attitude he imposes on his mother and siblings.  Chip, something of a flake, is the insecure author of a never-finished play, a wandering spirit who goes to Lithuania, where he is hired to create a web site to siphon money from gullible American donors.  Denise, a very successful and much-sought-after chef, is bisexual, constantly enduring her mother's urging that she find the right man and start a family.  When Enid decides that the whole family must come home to St. Jude's for \\"one last family Christmas,\\" the stage is set for an emotional family reunion which results in many \\"corrections.\\"<br /><br />Seven years in the making, this novel elevates intimate, domestic drama to whole new heights, smoothly incorporating themes which question who we are, what we owe our parents, how we become who we are, and where we are going.  Franzen's pointed observations about contemporary life--as revealed by upscale restaurants, the green movement, cruise ship behavior, use of the internet for fund-raising, dispensation of \\"happy pills,\\" nursing homes, and even the crassness of Christmas--enliven the plot as it spirals around and through time and the lives of the five characters.  Albert's decline, told in part from his point of view, is particularly heart-breaking. This book is a wonder, offering a stunning and intimate view of a middle-class American family, its values, and its dreams, all presented with wit, sensitivity, and enormous power.

The ill-fated romance of Priscilla Hart, a young American  working at a birth control clinic in India, and Lakshman, an older, married, Indian civil servant, is an engrossing story in its own right, but it serves a much wider purpose in this ambitious and utterly fascinating novel.  It provides the limited, manageable context through which the author asks questions about cultural identity and presents an impassioned plea for understanding and tolerance among cultures.  Priscilla, we discover on the first page, was stabbed to death by an unknown assailant during a riot in Zalilgarh, a riot instigated by militant Hindus wanting to build a temple on the site of an ancient Muslim mosque.  Many other, competing social and political forces contributed to the unrest which resulted in the riot, however, and the author clearly believes that the religious and ethnic extremism which has arisen in India in recent years has destroyed the traditional fabric of Indian society and may eventually be the undoing of the nation.<br /><br />There is no narrator here to interpret the events of Priscilla's death and of the riot. Tharoor leaves all interpretation up to the reader.  Through newspaper stories, entries in Priscilla's scrapbook, letters to her best friend at home and to Lakshman, transcripts of meetings with goverment officials, and a reporter's interviews with extremist religious leaders, the police, and professors (who provide the reader with crucial historical background), the passionate affair of Priscilla and Lakshman comes to life, and the complex and tumultuous forces which contribute to her death emerge.<br /><br />Tharoor is a smooth and disciplined writer who respects his characters and his readers. He presents historical background clearly and allows for multiple interpretations of events, assigning no blame and making no declarations of truth.  His American characters are realistic, and the contrasts of their values with those of traditional Indians are presented insightfully.  Amazingly, he manages to bring to life the world of traditional India, its cultures, its ironies, its recent history, and its possible future, in fewer than 300 pages, and he does so within the context of a love story which epitomizes the incredible difficulty of separating our selves from our cultures.  This is a novel which enlightens while it entertains, presenting a rational view of irrational behaviors.

Bartholomew Gill is an Irish writer of intriguing police procedurals which blend hard realism with romantic story-telling, set always in very confined settings, full of local color and local characters. The intricacies of eel-fishing on the River Shannon, and eel-poaching by IRA sympathizers, who sell the eels at high prices to finance IRA activity, are the offbeat sources of the realism and romance here.<br /><br /> When two members of the \\"eel-police\\" are found shot to death in bed, in what appears to be a slaying by a jealous husband, Detective Superintendent Peter McGarr and his motley assistants from Dublin are called in. As they investigate the killings in the seemingly idyllic town of Leixleap, the reader is exposed to the slippery underbelly of small town Irish life--the petty jealousies, the abusive liaisons, the manipulations of those clever enough to play \\"the system,\\" the limited expectations of the young women, and the ties that bind everyone to a beautiful village which has few legitimate opportunities.<br /><br /> Ultimately, it's the characters which make the novel come truly alive. McGarr, his family, and his assistants are colorfully drawn, all with unique characteristics which make them memorable. His psychological acuity makes their behavior plausible, and the limited setting provides for much interaction among them and the townspeople. These interactions, not outside sources, lead to the complications which enliven the plot. Gill alternates pathos and humor to moderate the most violent scenes, and his depiction of a child caught unwittingly in the turmoil is especially affecting. This is an absorbing mystery and a welcome change of pace from urban thrillers--no less violent, but perhaps more affecting because its world is so small and its characters, so chummy.

Written with passion and fury, this novel is as unrelenting as a nightmare--you can't break out of it once you are in it, and you are compelled to see it through to the end. On the surface, it is a murder mystery and investigation, but at its heart, it's a bleak case study of a community which has died since its manufacturing industries shut down and the supports for its local economy collapsed. Everything which gave dignity, meaning, and focus to the hardscrabble lives of the inhabitants is gone. In the middle of a hot, dry summer in this community in the Dust Bowl, Ronny Lawton's no 'count father disappears, and Ronny, no Boy Scout himself, is generally assumed to be his killer.<br /><br /> Collins sets up the framework for his themes from the outset. The main character, Bill, is the grandson of a man who made his fortune selling ice, and later manufacturing refrigerators. Bill is working haphazardly for the local newspaper and living in the basement of the family mansion because it's the coolest area of the house during these brutally hot days. He is recovering from a breakdown and hospitalization following his father's suicide. Ronny Lawton, to whom he is drawn, at first, as a newsman, is in many ways his opposite, though they share the bond of having lost their mothers and having had cruel fathers. Ronny lives in a shack and works at Denny's, where he takes pride in his designation as Employee of the Month. Except for Bill, who believes Ronny may be innocent, everyone--the local police, the FBI, the newpaper owner, and the claque of women at the local hairdressing salon--needs to find Ronny guilty to regain control of their lives. As the spirit of frontier justice grows and the need for a scapegoat becomes more pressing, Bill and Ronny both become caught up in the out-of-control spiral which soon engulfs them both.<br /><br /> The pace of the novel is unrelenting. The small-town dialogue is realistic, filled with petty resentments and jealousies. The prose is vivid, full of heavy, occasionally \\"purple,\\" descriptions. The pathetic setting of a community which has lost every reason for being, and the hopelessness of the lives of its inhabitants, made obsolescent by the decline of manufacturing, make this a bleak reading experience. Collins's humor, however, saves it from bathos, and the psychological credibility of the characters and the excitement of the plot make this a book that I found impossible to put down. It's easy to see why it was a Booker nominee.  Mary Whippleavy, occasionally \\"purple,\\" descriptions.

Alexander Short is a young librarian--precise and studious, with a need to catalogue and record, and on his way to becoming stuffy.  But he was not always this way.  His courtship and marriage to his French wife Nic, who designs pop-up books, was romantic--and spontaneous enough to have earned him a reprimand from the head of the library for his enthusiastic acceptance of her proposal on the library's electronic bulletin board.  Now the marriage is in trouble, his career seems to have hit a snag, and he's holding himself and his life together by recording and alphabetizing his life experiences in a notebook he has attached to his waist.  Into his life comes Henry James Jesson III, an elderly man in search of an object missing from a hidden compartment in an 18th century furniture case he owns.  Short is enlisted to help in the search, and his life is suddenly turned upside down.<br /><br />The book, and the research behind it, took the author ten years, and one of the greatest compliments I can pay is to say that it doesn't show.  So smoothly does Kurzweil integrate all the esoteric details of compartmented antique furniture, 18th century watchmaking, library cataloguing and conservation procedures, the intricacies of fine art theft, and even Japanese irezumi tattooing, that it all feels right and appropriate, and not at all pretentious.  His themes of order vs. spontaneity, life vs. stasis, permanence vs. change mesh perfectly with the search for a missing timepiece, which is what belongs in Jesson's case--a watch called The Grand Complication, which was originally commissioned by Marie Antoinette.  The book's structure mirrors the intricacies of this mysterious watch, which was stolen..<br /><br />As Short and Jesson conduct their search, the reader is, by turns, entertained, enlightened, and thoroughly engaged.  Alexander Short is a character who comes to life, as, to a lesser extent, does Jesson, who is a sad case, not unlike his furniture piece, missing something necessary for personal completion.  The library itself comes to life so fully that it almost becomes a character itself.  The book is full of puns and literary allusions, which add yet another level of fun. With a terrific, bang-up conclusion which ties up all the loose ends of the plot, the characters' lives, and the themes, Kurzweil leaves his reader fully satisfied--and hoping not to have to wait ten more years for his next novel.

If you were ever a teenager involved in backpacking and trekking;  a flower child in search of peace, love, and spiritual fulfillment;  a traveler to India adventurous enough to go off the regular tourist trails;  or the parent of any of these, you will love this wickedly satirical tale of two callow 19-year-olds who decide to spend a few months of their gap year backpacking around India in search of experience and enlightenment.  With so many summaries already on the site, I'll forgo writing another one, but this book, unlike so many others that critics tout as \\"hilarious,\\" but which regular readers find only mildly amusing at best, really IS hilarious!<br /><br />As Dave and Liz smugly \\"experience India,\\" we see how shallow their involvement is, how much they are acting and trying on roles to see if they fit, how much this trip is a way to avoid boredom, and how, lemming-like, they do what everyone else does, staying in the same hostels, following the same itinerary, and searching for \\"meaning\\" in outrageously off-the-wall activities, the chief attraction of which is that they take place in a foreign country.<br /><br />Sutcliffe does not hold back in his satire, but he is not mean-spirited.  The reader can easily imagine that this novel evolves from some of Sutcliffe's own amusing experiences or those of some of his friends.  He is laughing with, rather than laughing at.

This short novel is a potpourri of genres--it's a mystery, a social commentary on life in Paris (with the requisite French digs at other countries, including the U.S.), a travel/adventure story, a meditation about love and lust, and a study of midlife crisis.  Its main character, Felix Ferrer, a marginally successful gallery owner whose main preoccupation is his own ego, is interested in locating and then selling paleoarctic artifacts from a ship lost near the Arctic Circle long ago, when it became icebound.  When the artifacts, his former partner, his wife, a succession of girlfriends, and his financial security all disappear within a short period of time, Felix rouses himself and sets out to regain the artifacts, and, perhaps, some control over his life.<br /><br />Echenoz is an immensely skillful writer.  He creates a fast-paced narrative in which Ferrer ranges from his Parisian art gallery, to the Arctic, where he lives with a seal-hunting family (nice contrasts here), and back to Paris and Spain, and Echenoz makes these transitions seamlessly.  His imagery is often striking, and there's a good deal of sardonic humor and light satire about Parisian life. His ability to make the reader see the world through the eyes of Ferrer, and his observations about people, are sometimes startling and original.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the \\"hero,\\" Ferrer, is so blas&eacute; and so obnoxiously self-satisfied that it's difficult to care much about his world or what happens to him, and the whole novel feels smug. The unnamed narrator's snide and self-important asides degenerate rapidly from cute to annoying (\\"Personally, I've had it up to here with [a certain character].  His daily life is too boring.\\").  The characters' casual cruelty toward everyone in a subordinate position, their universal lack of \\"engagement,\\" and their treatment of women as objects further distance the reader and reflect the feeling that becoming involved or caring intensely about anything at all is somehow unsophisticated or bourgeois.

Whitehead is a writer who obviously finds enormous joy in writing, and it's such fun to participate in that joy with him!  Ebullient and absolutely irrepressible, he recreates the ambience of a West Virginia county fair being held in 1996 to celebrate the issuance of a new stamp honoring John Henry, the legendary black miner who beat the steam drill, then collapsed and died.  Talcott and Hinton, twin towns in rural West Virginia, are hoping the publicity and their enthusiastic efforts to promote John Henry will generate tourism to help their depressed economy.<br /><br />But this is not a traditional novel, and we find out in the first twenty pages that a catastrophic killing spree occurs during the festivities, probably ending those hopes.  In just a few more pages, we also know who the shooter is, and there are still more than 300 pages to go!  Filling these pages are a cast of characters ranging from John Henry himself to his modern alterego, J. Sutter, a \\"junketeer\\"/freelance writer covering John Henry Days, along with postal employees, representatives of publicity firms, collectors of memorabilia, researchers into John Henry's life, songwriters, stamp collectors, and local \\"experts\\" and politicians.  These provide Whitehead with innumerable venues for gentle satire, moments of warmth and sensitivity, and a serious exploration of themes.<br /><br />More a meditation on race, the growth of legends, the role of the press, and the lure of dreams than a narrative, the novel is almost plotless, yet I found it an absolute delight to read, a book hard to put down, filled with moving and eloquent scenes that echo long after the book is finished.  This is largely due to Whitehead's humor and his obvious goal of entertaining his readers, despite his weighty themes.  His remarkably gentle treatment of racial issues, in particular, allows him to explore this terrible legacy from the days of John Henry to the present without losing his equanimity (and, perhaps, some of his readers), and leads the reader to draw conclusions of his own, an ultimately more powerful and longer lasting experience.

In the tiniest of vignettes, most only a page or two long, Olafsson creates a pointillist portrait of Disa, a middle-aged Icelandic woman, and the people and events from her past over which she still feels guilt and distress.  She is on her way back to Iceland from England, where she and her friend Anthony have run a country hotel for many years, and where she has acquired a reputation as a fine chef.  Her trip \\"home\\" is an attempt to find peace and to achieve the satisfaction of knowing her life has had meaning.  This is an urgent quest--Disa has only twelve to eighteen months to live, and her life is full of unresolved traumas.<br /><br />Olafsson uses the diary Disa keeps on her journey to intersperse sensitive, often powerful, memories from the past with her recollections from her more recent life in England.  She is an intense and independent woman who sometimes reacts more sensitively toward the natural world around her than to the people with whom she has had relationships.  We relive her estrangement from her mother and sister, her heartache in love, her love for her father and her secret life in Iceland, her protectiveness for her partner Anthony, her relationships with her employers and later with her employees, and her desperate romantic fling during a particularly vulnerable time.  As in our own daydreams, we relive Disa's memories and the feelings they evoke in random order, not always knowing why they are important until later memories provide the keys to understanding.  As her memories and nightmares intensify, the suspense grows.  As Disa says, \\"The soul can take delight in small things if one's dreams only leave it in peace long enough.\\"<br /><br />Although Disa probably has enough traumas in her life for three novels, Olafsson avoids some of the usual pitfalls of romances by spacing out the details and requiring the reader to draw the conclusions.  He tempers sensational revelations by including repeated images or symbols within them--apples, thrushes, storms, views from windows, music, the color red, the cold--to make us think.  By the time the real reason for the trip to Iceland is revealed, most readers will have guessed it, but we sympathize with the unfortunate Disa and her journey, nevertheless.  This is an emotion-packed rollercoaster of a novel, with a multitude of period details, sure to keep readers on edge.  Mary Whipplews from windows, music, the color red, the cold--to make us think.

This no-holds-barred police procedural features unusually well-developed characters, so firmly rooted in their Irish heritage that this exciting mystery also provides insights into modern Ireland and the forces which shape it.  Peter McGarr, the police superintendent, is a good man who has rejected the traditional church in favor of enforcing justice on earth;  his wife Noreen, though not devout, is a true believer in the church.  Peter is investigating the murder of Mary-Jo Stanton, an extremely religious writer who has intended to leave her estate to Opus Dei, a zealous order of ultra-conservative Catholics who believe it is their mission to do anything necessary, including murder, to protect the \\"true\\" Church.  Peter's close investigation of Opus Dei brings him into contact with manipulative priests, and with their various contacts in the outside world, including an extremely successful, muckraking journalist, who panders to the public's love of good gossip, an influence-peddling politician said to \\"control the country through his contacts with the movers and shakers in commerce and industry,\\" a host of pub patrons, and a gardener on the lam after ratting out his co-conspirators in crime in exchange for lesser jail time.<br /><br />As the investigation widens, the reader sees that although many in the church live completely in a world of their own, so, too, do many on the police force, a group of fiercely independent and passionate people.  \\"Procedure\\" is, at times, a very flexible concept--whatever works, as long as you don't get caught, seems to be the motto.  Planting evidence, beating up suspects, closing one's eyes to one crime if the suspect can be \\"turned\\" to help solve another crime, and shooting to kill and asking questions later are all methods employed here to solve Mary-Jo's murder.<br /><br />With dialogue that perfectly captures both the lilt and the gruffness of the dialect, a setting which is totally integrated into the action (no long, lyrical descriptions here), believable characters, an exciting and intricate plot, insights into social psychology, and scenes of touching sentiment and pathos, this is a mystery which has everything!

Ferdinand Mount is an elegant, controlled, and immensely intelligent writer, and his Jem (and Sam) is brilliant. When I saw this new book at the local bookstore, I read the blurbs on the jacket and and bought it on impulse.  But while it was pleasant enough reading and offered some interesting morsels to chew on, I found it ultimately disappointing.  The third novel in Mount's Chronicle of Modern Twilight, Fairness features the same characters.  Unless you have read the other novels, however, you may be as nonplussed as I was by the huge gaps between the characters as described in summaries and on the book jacket, and the same characters as you find them in this novel.  This is not Mount's fault, but the potential reader should be cautious.<br /><br />Gus Cotton, the narrator, is a young man who, at the outset of this book, becomes friends with golden-haired Helen, like him working as a nanny/tutor one summer in Normandy.  Gus and Helen, their employers, the children and friends of the employers, and even the bookies and racetrack touts from the earlier novels in the series appear and reappear, sometimes in extraordinary coincidences, over the twenty year time span of this novel. Unfortunately, Gus himself is a cipher, too phlegmatic to inspire much sympathy, and not strong enough to hold the myriad characters and long plot line together.  Helen is described as aspiring to a morally satisfying life, yet throughout the book she constantly makes self-interested and surprising compromises, and falls into bed with just about everyone.  There are few occasions in which we see Helen wrestling with moral decisions--she simply acts, impulsively.  Though the blurb-writer calls her a modern female counterpart to Candide, she is actually a mystifying and depressing character, without the obvious naivete one associates with Candide and which allows for lively satire.<br /><br />A government-sanctioned stripping of mineral resources from a Central African country, a miners' strike, and a child abuse investigation feature in the plot and involve both Gus and Helen.  While these may be the scandals that have defined--and sometimes shattered--the latter decades of the 20th century for British readers, they are not so familiar to American readers, and their significance pales.<br /><br />Fairness may be an important part of Mount's large scale Chronicle of Modern Twilight.  It may develop themes and social commentary significant to the overall success of the Chronicle.  As a separate novel, however, it was not an exhilarating or comic experience, at least for this American reader. This rating is three stars for enjoyment, five stars for the writing.

In a novel that truly defies categorization, McPhee tells of Marie Brown, a 39-year-old New Yorker whose conscientious, part-time work on a never-quite-finished graduate school science paper brings her into contact with Marco Trentadue, a fellow habitu&eacute; of the library and \\"freelance intellectual,\\" in many ways her opposite.  Professionally, Marie works, underappreciated, at a tabloid newspaper.  When she volunteers to write the newspaper's not-yet-needed obituary for actress Nora Mars, Marie uncovers a secret so explosive that it could totally change  her standing at the tabloid.  The intrigue, Marie's emotional responses, her relationships with Marco and others, and the tabloid atmosphere all contribute to an involving plot which can stand completely on its own.<br /><br />But McPhee is ambitious and fiendishly clever here, and the plot is only the tip of a huge and wonderful thematic iceberg.  Every chapter bears the title of a major preoccupation of our lives--Time, Truth, Beauty, Love, Reality, Death, etc.--and in each we learn something about both Marie's life and the life of Nora Mars, relative to this thematic idea.  At the same time, however, McPhee also introduces a principle of quantum physics into each chapter, explaining it in a way which suggests obvious parallels with the chapter's theme of Time, Truth, Beauty, Love, etc.  She forces the reader to look at things from completely new and infinitely wider perspectives, playing with the reader's preconceived ideas about reality, drawing parallels between the behavior of subatomic particles and the behavior of people;  and raising questions about the space/time \\"continuum,\\"  random behavior, multiple universes, and even consciousness itself as an evolutionary response.  And she does all this while simultaneously including ironic and humorous quotations from Nora's films.<br /><br />In its originality, scope, and unique perspectives, this is surely a novel which will arouse passionate feelings (one way or the other) among its readers!  My one criticism is that the complex scientific concepts do not have the same narrative \\"flow\\" as the story line and can be daunting to the \\"scientifically challenged\\" (like me).  A sentence such as \\"She had always loved Schrodinger's theory that life was negative entropy--that it began as a meaningless mess but was in the continuous process of becoming more and more ordered\\" slows down the narrative and feels clunky and textbook-like in what is otherwise a delightful, sensitive novel about people and relationships.

If you, like me, find yourself needing to gear up emotionally before reading an Indian novel, due to the stupendous scale of the misery you are likely to find, you are in for a huge--and very wonderful--surprise here.  Despite the off-putting title, this is a very funny novel.  It is also very thoughtful, thought-provoking, and beautifully constructed.  A Mumbai apartment building serves as the setting, a true microcosm of life in Mumbai at large, but a limited enough context for the reader to be able to see the problems as soluble and to appreciate the day-to-day lives of its inhabitants.<br /><br />Vishnu, an alcoholic who inhabits the stairwell on the ground floor, dreams of his mother, his love for Padmini, a prostitute, and the Hindi myths which have given color and meaning to his life, as he lies dying.  But he is a colossal problem for his petty and contentious neighbors--Mrs. Pathak tries to figure out how he can be cleaned up and hidden before her gossipy friends come for a card party, Mrs. Asrani hates waste and wonders whether she really needs to leave tea for him after all, Mr. Asrani and Mr. Pathak  argue about who will pay for the ambulance to take Vishnu away.<br /><br />While life among these residents of the first floor is centered on the most basic aspects of life, the residents of the upper floors have the financial resources to be able to worry about \\"higher\\" concerns.  The Jalal family, on the second floor, are Muslims at odds with the Hindi society in which they live, Mrs. Jalal devout, while Mr. Jalal is still searching for answers. On the top floor is Mr. Taneja, whose ascetic life takes on new meaning when he does good works, finds a swami, and discovers the peace of meditation. The symbolism of the floors takes on additional meaning through Vishnu's visions.<br /><br />In many ways this resembles a grand chorus from a huge and wonderful comic opera, with all the inhabitants of the building singing at once.  And underneath all the voices wailing about their personal concerns is the insistent bass of Vishnu as he prepares to die.  Dealing with the most basic aspects of religion, love, and human kindness in a city setting which challenges its inhabitants to the limit, Suri creates a warm, funny, and very human drama of a every man's search for meaning in life.

A woman of celebrated beauty, talent, and social position, Alma Schindler, while still a teenager, catapulted herself into the dazzling high life of artists, writers, and musicians in fin-de-siecle Vienna.  A consummate opportunist, totally dedicated to the pursuit of her own pleasure, Alma saw her future in the achievements of the men she slept with.  Her life was one of voluptuous hedonism, unrestrained by religious scruples,  marriage contracts, and even, in some cases, common decency, yet no man seemed able to resist her.  Her marriages to composer Gustav Mahler, Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius, and writer Franz Werfel were all accompanied by numerous affairs;  she dumped everyone with whom she became bored;  and she was not always sure who the fathers of her children were.<br /><br />With a narrative style as seductive as the woman he chronicles, Phillips recreates the social, intellectual, and political ferment of the waning days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Through Alma's eyes, the reader meets, on a personal level, many of the artistic geniuses whose influences in music, painting, and writing are felt even to the present.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the strongest and most memorable influences in early 20th century Vienna was a casual, socially accepted anti-Semitism, which permeated all levels of society for a generation or more before Adolph Hitler began his rise.  Alma, too,  reveals this bigotry in her attitudes and remarks, despite the fact that two of her husbands were Jewish, and this, along with the sheer weight of her self-absorption,  seriously limits the reader's ability to empathize with her in the latter part of the book.<br /><br />Still, this is a fascinating study of the way one woman managed to liberate herself from some of the social restrictions of her day.  The intellectual and artistic worlds Phillips recreates pulse with life;  the political changes from empire to post-war socialism and the rise of Hitler are smoothly integrated into the story;  and the book, overall, is a remarkable portrait of a place and time rarely chronicled in American fiction.

In a novel which is as powerfully sensuous as Suskind's Perfume and as imaginatively tasty as Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate, Averill finds his own voice, creating a unique and thoughtful coming-of-age story which, while rich in imagery, is remarkably simple and direct in its message.  Food is life here, and the preparation of food and the ingredients one uses reflect the attitudes and spirit with which one approaches life and relationships.<br /><br />Weston Hingler is the son of two cooks with totally different viewpoints.  His father, Robert Hingler, owns the Tsil Caf&eacute;, where he uses robust, New World ingredients and spicy chiles and seasonings to bring the heat of southwestern cuisine to Kansas City.  His mother, Maria Tito Hingler, part Italian, is a caterer who uses cultivated, Old World ingredients in a more subtle and traditional way.  Stubbornly independent and wildly passionate, Robert and Maria communicate best when talking about food, marching to different drummers in the conduct of their personal lives, thereby creating innumerable challenges for their growing son.  As Weston grows up, exposed to both cuisines and working, at various times, for both his parents, he must decide who he is, where he fits, who his parents really are, where each of them really comes from, and, ultimately, who he will become.<br /><br />Filled with recipes which go way beyond anything most of us have ever imagined (and which, according to the acknowledgments, have actually been tested!), the book is hugely fun to read, even for someone who might not have a great deal of interest in cooking.  I'll take a pass on the Dog Tamal, Roasted Maguey Worms, and Guinea Pig Stuffed with Marigolds, but I do understand why they were so important to Robert, and the Crab Cakes with Pineapple-Mango Salsa and the Jicama Salad sound absolutely delicious.  This is a delightful novel, intriguing on all its many levels, and full of new insights into how and why we are what we eat.  Mary Whipple	2001-07-25

If this is your first foray into the bitingly humorous world of Harpur and Iles, as it was mine, be prepared.  Author Bill James is obviously having the time of his life here, tweaking all aspects of traditional police procedural novels and the characters who populate them.  James's characters are unique:  idealistic Commissioner Lane, who \\"[does] not presume to see himself as Christ, but at least as the one who rolled away the stone\\";  ACC Iles, an unrepentant sycophant who praises Lane's \\"gifted decisiveness,\\" and thinks of him as a \\"towering sweetheart, someone I look up to as to a small god\\";  a dogged investigator, such as Harpur, who has no problem playing fast and loose with the law and everyone he meets to get what he wants;  quirky crooks, such as Ralph Ember, with his \\"rich flair for panic\\" and \\"that greasy speed he could get into his sprinting, even over tricky ground\\" in his flight from trouble;  and young Keith Vine, an up and coming criminal who insists on referring to himself as the third person \\"Keith Vine.\\"<br /><br />As Harpur deals with these characters and investigates the growth of drug syndicates after the death of Oliphant Kenward Knapp, eventually becoming involved in one of them himself, the reader is treated to one amusing scene after another.<br /><br />Unlike some humorous mystery writers like Christopher Moore and Carl Hiaasen, James does not depend on outrageous, off-the-wall scenes and smart-mouthed fast-talk for most of his humor.  He is a lover of ironic, often subtle, word-play.  He gives poker-faced, lyrical descriptions of decidedly un-lyrical scenes, and he writes with intelligence and care about dangerous criminals, mocking them, while never making light of their cruelty and dangerousness to society.  This novel is well plotted and exciting, and its absurdities echo with truth.  Mary Whipple	2001-07-23

Setting her story in the Saskatchewan Dust Bowl in the 1930's, where \\"children grew up never tasting an apple and thinking Ontario was heaven,\\" Hay tells of Norma Joyce and her sister Lucinda, opposite in appearance and personality, who have little to keep their minds and hearts occupied on the flat prairie and on their farm, where they have only their stern and uncommunicative father for company.  The sisters fixate on the homely details of their lives, beautifully and vividly described by Hay--strange, little Norma Joyce collecting (or stealing) bones, buttons, and small objects, which she displays in the unused room which once belonged to her mother, while shy, beautiful Lucinda cleans every corner of the house and concentrates on being the perfect housekeeper. Into this emotional void steps Maurice Dove, a handsome student of weather and fascinating story teller, who quickly becomes the focus of both sisters' attentions while he stays with them and studies the native grasses which have apparently protected their farm from the ravages of the wind and weather.<br /><br />In the hands of a lesser writer, the story could have become a romantic pot-boiler, at this point, but Hay's insights into the differing thoughts and motivations of all the characters, all of them with faults, combined with her beautifully realized setting, her lovely, often quiet, descriptions of weather and nature in all seasons, and her use of common sights and objects as symbols make this an absorbing story of a woman's search for fulfillment.<br /><br />As Norma Joyce grows from a spunky 9-year-old, suffering from early puberty, to a woman in her mid-40's, moving from the farm to Ontario and New York and back, Hay shows how external social forces, combined with Norma Joyce's powerful memories of the farm and Maurice Dove, continually affect the choices she makes as an adult, even when she urgently attempts to free herself from these influences and take full control of her life.  Sometimes selfish to the point of cruelty in her desire to manipulate outcomes, Norma Joyce is not a typical \\"heroine,\\"  but Hay creates such believable contexts for her behavior that the reader will have no difficulty empathizing, if not, identifying, with her.  This is an absorbing story of a woman's attempt to come to grips with her past--both the good and the bad--and to use it in forging a fulfilling life in the present.

If you are already a member of the Anastas cult, you will love this book!  And if you don't know Anastas but enjoy novels which are stylistically unique, you will find yourself intrigued.  Anastas, with no pretense of scholarly reticence (some might even say he shows off), creates syntactical fireworks within fireworks here, sentences which take on lives of their own, and mountains of very specific images in his descriptions.  He applies a verbal machete to the misguided aspirations and the pretentions of suburbia, from SUV's and designer homes to the patronizing attitudes and unchristian behavior among churchgoers.  Few readers will be able to resist his narrative pull.<br /><br />Anastas's astounding abilities, however, are sometimes given such free rein that they seem to gallop off under their own power.  Structurally, the book is loosey-goosey, lacking a  sense of purpose clear enough to control both the plot and Anastos's quixotic tendency to pursue new directions.  The opening chapter seems to be a paean to his own talent more than a serious introduction to his characters and setting, the chapter consisting of three pages of text divided into just two spectacular, long sentences.  The reader becomes more intrigued with whether the sentences will end than with their content.  (See the Amazon excerpt.)  Initially a broad satire directed at some easy and obvious targets, the book employs flat characters who serve as examples of suburban types, rather than as individuals.<br /><br />The satire is not sustained throughout, however. Bethany Caruso, the main character, develops into a much more a sympathetic character than is consistent with satire, though she never becomes a fully round character, either.  Even the mystery of the pastor's disappearance, which serves throughout as the unifying thread and provides a stage for the satire, ultimately turns out not to be the primary story at all.  This is really the tale of Bethany, her marriage, and her life in suburbia, and much of the church satire and many of the characters associated with the pastor's disappearance turn out to be irrelevant to her central story.<br /><br />This is a book of many delights, but students of writing who enjoy observing how an author limits his subject and develops his themes through careful plot construction and use of detail may find themselves a bit nonplussed by Anastas's insistent march to his own drummer.urch satire and many of the characters associated with the pastor's disappearance turn out to be irrelevant to her central story.

It is, however, an equally apt description of the novel itself.  The \\"captured spirits,\\" in both cases, represent several generations of Indian expatriate merchants living in the shadows of Mt. Kilimanjaro, straddling the border of Kenya and Tanzania.<br /><br />As Pius Fernandes investigates mysterious events only partially explained by the British Assistant District Commissioner, Alfred Corbin, in his 1913 diary, the reader is treated to a century of East African history, from the days of British and German colonial rule in Kenya and Tanzania, respectively, through its World War II battles, its independence movements, and up to the present.<br /><br />Since the narrator and all the main characters from three generations are either Indian or British, and not African, the reader gains a unique perspective on the unfolding events in these African countries.<br /><br />The author's ambitious scope and broad perspective, his overlapping characters from several generations, the thread of mystery which connects the 1913 diary with characters well into the present, and his seductive story-telling, all contribute to an exciting narrative which will actively involve even the most jaded reader.  The insights we gain into the character of the narrator and one or two other main characters engage the heart, making the conclusion understandable, if not, satisfying.

Anyone who has ever questioned whether less is more in terms of writing excellence will find the question answered completely in this impeccable, precise novel. With a care for the exact word which one usually finds only in short stories, Colegate's Winter Journey tells of a brother and sister in the winter of their lives, rejoining each other at the family farm in rural England, and finding that the memories which surface lead each on a personal journey toward new understandings.<br /><br />Every word counts here, and as the lives of Edith and Alfred unfold and their relationships with past lovers, acquaintances, and each other become clear, a picture of their completely different lifestyles and attitudes emerges.<br /><br />This is not an action novel, in terms of plot.  Most of the excitement here is generated by the unfolding of events from the past, the revelations of which Colegate delays through carefully dropped \\"hints\\" and prolongs, tantalizingly, throughout the novel.  A couple of subplots involving present efforts to change the farm and affect its future, provide a context for these revelations and an impetus for the interior journeys of Edith and Alfred.<br /><br />Those who think that great writing needs long, lush, descriptive passages, complicated syntax, and convoluted dialogue will find Colegate a refreshing change.  Her scenes and images are of such startling clarity and simplicity that she creates whole worlds in just two hundred pages here.  With her jewel-like precision, she speaks directly to the heart and makes Edith and Alfred live.  Mary Whipple	2001-07-14

Its offbeat humor and breezy voice, the tour de force of its plot (trouble arises because a main character turns good, not bad), its trenchant satire of the tired conventions of social behavior, and its earnest but sometimes misguided characters all contribute to the urgent pace of a great beach book. But that label does not do justice to Hornby or his novel, for underneath the genuine humor and wacky plot turns, Hornby is also dealing with some of the biggest themes in literature, raising ethical questions many other authors shy away from, while considering, in an obviously religious sense, the implications of what constitutes a good life.<br />Katie Carr, a conscientious and clear-thinking doctor, has enough on her hands trying to deal with her marital problems, and she never dreams that every aspect of her life will soon be turned upside down by husband David's sudden conversion from snide cynicism to pure altruism. He gives away his children's favorite electronic amusements, invites D.J. GoodNews, a faith healer and unschooled preacher, to move in with the family, embarks on a crusade to have all his neighbors donate their extra bedrooms to homeless street children, donates the family's meals to homeless shelters, and generally tries to lead a totally good, unselfish life. But pure goodness leads to total havoc as the gap between good intentions and practical reality widens. With wit and sensitivity, along with an unfortunate bit of moralizing, Hornby considers issues of marriage, family, social responsibility, freedom, and obligation, creating a novel which is thoughtful, in addition to entertaining.	2001-07-09

This fascinating novel may seem at first to be a well-written romance or frothy bit of historical fiction.  Alison's style from the outset is sensuously heavy, filled with lush impressions from an exotic area &quot;on the farthest coast of the Black Sea, in the corner of the maps where sea monsters coiled....&quot; The Roman poet Ovid is in self-exile here, having offended the moralistic Emperor Augustus with his erotic book, The Art of Love, and we come to empathize with him through his interior monologues.  The dense imagery so familiar in Ovid's poetry shines here, not only in his description of Pontus, but also of the beguiling Xenia, a priestess and practitioner of magic, who, if she resembles the cover photo in any way, is a most bewitching creature of seemingly supernatural power.  She is much like the mythical witch Medea, the area's most renowned character and &quot;heroine&quot; of Euripedes' terrifying tragedy of the same name.<br />When Xenia returns to Rome with Ovid, however, the exoticism and romanticism become less an end in themselves and more a part of the psychological atmosphere, and the author begins actively to solicit the reader's curiosity.  Ovid, with Augustus's granddaughter Julia as his patroness and Xenia as his inspiration,  begins work on his play Medea, from which only two lines have survived to the present day.  Here the novel is less straightforward and less overtly romantic, acquiring a sense of great mystery, consistent with the mystery both of Ovid's tragic play and of the Medea legend itself.<br />Love, jealousy, revenge, rage, the fear of rejection, and the desire for immortality, so vividly exemplified in the tragedy of  the legendary Medea, find their parallels in life here, as Xenia, Ovid, and Julia play out the triangle of misunderstandings which leads to the inevitable conclusion--Ovid's banishment.  Omitting all the usual authorial signals that clue the reader about what s/he is supposed to think and feel, Alison reveals instead what Xenia, Ovid, and Julia, are thinking and feeling, leaving it up to the reader to figure out what has happened to these characters that makes them  feel and act the way they do. The drama of this remarkable novel comes fully to life, and the reader begins to feel that s/he is participating in the inexorable falling action of a real, classical tragedy.  This startlingly original and intense novel is a pleasure to read slowly--it ultimately enthralls because even its conclusion is elusive.<br />Note:  Lovers of this novel may also be intrigued with David Malouf's equally unusual novel, An Imaginary Life, which begins where this novel ends, with Ovid's banishment.ls instead what Xenia, Ovid, and Julia, are thinking and feeling, leaving it up to the reader to figure out what has happened to these characters that makes them  feel and act the way they do.

Anyone standing at the Fishermen's Memorial along Gloucester Harbor in Massachusetts will be struck by two things.  First, visitors always gravitate to the names at the very end--the familiar names of Capt. Billy Tyne and his five crewmates from the Andrea Gail, lost in The Perfect Storm in 1991. But those who linger are always astonished by the fact that there are more than five thousand other names here--sometimes hundreds of them lost during a single year in the 1800's, often from the same families.  This book brings those 19th century years to life, providing a lively glimpse of the Gloucester fishing industry during its height, and a fitting memorial to all those \\"who go down to the sea in ships.\\"<br /><br />Joseph Garland reveals this history through the tale of one man--Giant Jim Pattillo, probably the most colorful and independent captain ever to command a Gloucester fishing vessel.  A Novie who became a \\"whitewashed Yankee\\" when he became a U.S. citizen, Pattillo sailed between Georges Bank, Nova Scotia, and Cape Ann, Massachusetts, during the glory years of 1820 - 1870. Huge in size, immensely strong,  and willing to take on anyone when he'd had enough to drink, Pattillo was a brawler who feared nothing and no one, a man who was willing to break the rules and even smuggle when it suited his purpose.  Defying storms and all manner of danger, he also defied  the restrictions the Crown placed on fishing around Nova Scotia--along with all the Crown's officers and enforcers.<br /><br />Owner and master of his first fishing vessel in 1820, when he was just fourteen, Pattillo later fished for halibut, mackerel, herring, and cod in pinkeys, smacks, barks, sharpshooters, and schooners, all sailing vessels operating without any supplementary power.  Navigation was challenging, to say the least, especially during ferocious storms at night, and the long list of names on the Gloucester memorial attests to the difficulty of keeping these vessels intact during the terrible Atlantic winters.  Communication was almost non-existent, and on one occasion, when Pattillo and his crew returned to Gloucester in May, the town was stunned--it had already mourned their deaths, thinking they, like dozens of others, had perished in February.<br /><br />Garland's impeccably researched tale is a can't-put-it-downer which deserves much more publicity!  It's not an exaggeration to say that the insights you gain here about fishing and fishermen will forever change your perceptions of this heroic profession.  Through Jim Pattillo, whose career spanned fifty tumultuous years, Garland provides a comprehensive historical account of the Gloucester - Nova Scotia fishing fleet, giving a context to more modern stories, such as The Perfect Storm, often thought to be unique.  As a result, these modern accounts may now rightly assume their place as part of Gloucester's centuries-old, seafaring history, their crews members of the more than 5300-man fraternity of those \\"who go down to the sea in ships.\\"inters.

Packing a knife, a gun, and a reputation for having killed eight people &quot;in self defense,&quot; John Caine is certainly not a cerebral, Columbo-style private investigator.  With a lust for action and sometimes a lust for lust, he is macho in the extreme, fiercely loyal to his friends, no matter which side of the police desk they may occupy and no matter how dangerous their friendship may be to his health.  Though he is shot, stabbed, hit with martial arts sticks, sucker-punched, kicked, knocked unconscious,  hospitalized for surgery, and thrown in jail for murder, just for starters, he's like an Energizer ape who just keeps going.<br />Escape reading at its best, this is an old-fashioned murder mystery which makes no apologies for its machismo as Caine constantly comes to the rescue of damsels and others in distress, getting beaten and nearly killed on a regular basis.  The Hawaiian setting is a welcome change from the usual urban wasteland of P. I. stories, the action never falters, and the plot, while intriguing, is not so complicated that you have trouble keeping all the characters straight.<br />Local color is heightened by a police chief who is a descendant of famed surfer Duke Kahanamoku, by an archaeologist who has found the tomb of King Kamehameha I, on the Big Island's Kona coast, and by the goddess Pele, who brings the dormant shield volcano of Hualalai, long overdue for eruption, suddenly to life, threatening Kailua-Kona.  Lovers of Hawaii will find this fun to read, as long as they don't get hung up on some proofreading problems--a few typos, misspellings, and several annoying references to Moana Kea and Moana Loa, instead of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa.	2001-07-02

There's a weird schizophrenia about this book, which sometimes feels like an eerie Gothic romance and at other times feels like the Diary of Anne Frank.  The title suggests that the book will tell the horrifying story of the children of Pithiviers, those French Jewish children wrested from their families and warehoused in Pithiviers before being turned over to the Germans for extermination.  The primary focus of the book, and the vehicle through which the Pithiviers story is revealed, however, is the character of Deidre, a pliable, uncritical, 17-year-old Sorbonne student from the Transvaal, sent to Pithiviers in the French countryside for the summer of 1959, following her &quot;disgrace&quot; in Paris and her subsequent abortion.<br />Deidre quickly discovers that life at the dilapidated mill with Madame and the Baron is more a form of bizarre sexual education than the elevating cultural experience she had expected.  Madame massages, bathes, and caresses her, has her walk around nude, and even dresses her, at one point.  The sixtyish Baron fondles her under the table at her 18th birthday party, excites her, and later has an affair with her.  Deidre retreats, at times, to the attic, where she has discovered a series of notes written in the margins of some old magazines by two young girls.  They are obviously children who have hidden there during the war, bright girls of twelve and fifteen who miss their Maman desperately, but who continue to believe that &quot;Nothing seriously wrong can happen in France: is it not the country of the Rights of Man?&quot;<br />Although one of the critics felt that intertwining these stories increased their emotional impact, I strongly disagree.  The story of the children of Pithiviers is so horrific and their betrayal by French collaborators so vile that no other story could possibly make the reality more powerful.  The author, however, creates obvious parallels between Deidre's &quot;imprisonment&quot; by Madame and the Baron, and the earlier, similar imprisonment of Lea and Anna, the two Jewish girls.  Since the scale of their problems is so dissimilar, however,  the comparisons between them made me cringe--the parallels diminished the story of the children of Pithiviers by making that story part of a less monstrous context. No matter how remote and isolated Deirdre may have felt from her family, or how helpless she may have been to resist the corruption to which she was exposed by her hosts, she nevertheless had choices absolutely unavailable to Lea and Anna in Pithiviers during World War II.<br />Because the narrative here speeds along and has many surprises and psychological insights, other readers may become caught up in the problems of Deidre with their considerable suspense.  I found her unrealistic and much too pliable, however, even for 1959, and I was offended by the obvious attempts to make me view the Pithiviers horrors in connection with her lesser problems.the earlier, similar imprisonment of Lea and Anna, the two Jewish girls.

Focusing on just two climactic years, 1913 - 1914, Frederic Morton recreates Vienna in all its splendor during the last days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The vibrant social, intellectual, and cultural life of Vienna is examined within the context of the seething nationalism of the Balkans, the Machiavellian intrigue among the political rulers of the European nations and Russia, and the human frailties of the seemingly larger-than-life national leaders, which assure that the twilight of the empire will eventually be overtaken by darkness.<br /><br />Rigorously selective in his choice of detail, Morton brings to life the varied activities of a broad cross-section of Viennese society, and reproduces the intellectual milieu which eventually leads to the rise of some of the most influential leaders of the twentieth century--Trotsky, Stalin, Adler, Freud, Jung, Lenin, Hitler, Tito, and a host of others, all of whom are part of Vienna life.<br /><br />Morton's seriousness of purpose and his scholarship are undeniable, yet his primary contribution here, it seems to me, is his ability to make historical personages come to life, to make the reader feel that they were real, breathing humans with both virtues and frailties, and not the cardboard characters one finds so often in history books. Vienna, as we see it here, has a real heart, albeit one that beats in 3/4 time.<br /><br />From the masquerades and balls held by all classes of society, to the revolutionary movements, innumerable newspapers and pamphlets, lively coffee houses, and seemingly endless games of political maneuvering, one feels the ferment and activity which must lead, eventually, to change. The liveliness of the city, as depicted here, is a visual and intellectual contrast to the formality and frailty of Emperor Franz Josef, making the twilight of his empire understandable and its demise inevitable. Even the empire's demise is stylish, however. According to Morton: As \\"The World War [came] to the city by the Danube, [it came] dressed as a ball. Tra-la...Hurrah!\\"  Mary Whippledressed as a ball. Tra-la...Hurrah!\\"  Mary Whipple	2001-06-26

August Kleinman, an elderly man who has earned a fortune, is diligent, focused, and uncompromising in his beliefs.  While he regards these attributes as virtues, other people see him as a man unwilling to bend and reluctant to concede a point, an unlikely &quot;hero&quot; for a book.  He has been ejected from a taxi for calling the driver a cheat, has challenged airplane crew by refusing to raise his seatback, has told a President to his face that he is a coward,  has a stormy relationship with his stong-willed son Jimmy, and may even have killed two men, one in war and one in business.  He has taken to heart the ironic advice his mother gave him when he was a child, &quot;Take the advice of no one,&quot; to which she also added, &quot;And know your enemy.&quot;<br />It is August's overpowering love for his wife Ginger, whom he lost to Alzheimer's disease, which humanizes him for the reader and makes his introspection and his behavior at the end of his life both realistic and emotionally moving. Canin switches back and forth, seemingly randomly, between August's terrifying World War II service as a G.I., his business life, his brief trip to Japan at the end of his life to meet the family of the man he killed, and his visits with his son and his family, gradually depicting a man who recognizes on some level that he has missed out on some of life's most meaningful experiences--experiences magnificently depicted in the delicate letters of the Japanese man he killed, letters August has kept as souvenirs and framed as curiosities.<br />This is a remarkably sensitive portrait of an often insensitive man who finds that &quot;understanding is not what this life has given [him].&quot;  He has never considered &quot;Where did the human soul flower?&quot; As he searches for answers at the end of his life, the reader shares his journey, admiring the simplicity of Canin's message, the clarity of his images, and the strength and dexterity of a prose style that is simultaneously disciplined and lyrical.y disciplined and lyrical.	2001-06-17

With her ex-husband in Chile making films, Bonnie Saks, stressed out and 40-ish, finds herself the sole support of her two sons in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a doctoral candidate who has lost interest in her thesis, and a victim of insomnia. Like many other academic women, she is trying unsuccessfully to make ends meet as a college lecturer.<br />It's hard to work up a lot of sympathy for Bonnie, however.  She seems to revel in her stress, using it as an excuse. Unlike thousands of other busy lecturers, she is irresponsible, never getting around to grading the papers for the writing course she is paid to teach (and for which her students pay tuition).  She can't get motivated to try to find a new approach to her thesis  so she can finish it, get her doctorate, and support her children more effectively.  She often leaves her two sons, one of whom is disturbed and the other of whom cries out for more attention, in the care of a semiliterate teenage babysitter who is also irresponsible and often on drugs.  She sleeps around and doesn't take precautions, leading to an unplanned pregnancy.  And despite the pregnancy, she continues to drink and smoke--and sleep around.  When, desperate for sleep, she decides to participate in a pill-induced sleep study, she blithely accepts the word of the researcher that the pills or drugs she takes will not hurt her unborn baby.<br />The supporting characters are similarly unable to recognize the true nature of their problems, looking for Timothy Leary-ish answers in pharmaceuticals, alcohol, sex, frantic academic research, and pointless activity, something which made this whole plot, for me, less than the &quot;sweet,&quot; &quot;lovely,&quot; and &quot;charming&quot; experience that some other readers experienced, though parts of it are undeniably amusing in their irony.<br />Still, the book is beautifully written, and the prose is glorious!  One gorgeous description after another describes Bonnie's entry into sleep.  Upon entering a dream state, she finds &quot;the very air a kind of pale, trembling jelly that offered resistance and envelopment both....It was like entering a Rothko...borne up by an ineffable heat mist, immersed in sunbursts of yellow and red, the primary colors of being....And then a silent trumpet blew, and the mortar of opposition in her head began to crumble...&quot;  Such description makes me anxious to read Cohen's next novel, when his characters may be more thoughtful, their lives more inspiring, and their travails more worthy of the wonderful talents on display here.dream state, she finds &quot;the very air a kind of pale, trembling jelly that offered resistance and envelopment both....It was like entering a Rothko...borne up by an ineffable heat mist, immersed in sunbursts of yellow and red, the primary colors of being....And then a silent trumpet blew, and the mortar of opposition in her head began to crumble...&quot;  Such description makes me anxious to read Cohen's next novel, when his characters may be more thoughtful, their lives more inspiring, and their travails more worthy of the wonderful talents on display here.	2001-06-12

A town full of people whose anti-psychotic drugs have been replaced by placebos, a druggist who is in love with a dolphin, a sheriff who is running a drug processing plant, a constable hooked on pot, a schlock artist in search of new subject matter, and a cult of salvation seekers all contribute to the hyperactive insanity of this plot.

This terrifying, bone-chilling novel does not depend on mere events, no matter how horrific, for its stunning effects.  Dorrestein is much too clever a writer for that.  Instead, she recreates with great psychological astuteness the inner workings of main character Ellen Van Bemmel's mind, revealing her memories from the age of twelve to adulthood in a seemingly random sequence, as Ellen allows herself first to remember, and later accept, the unimaginable trauma she has experienced as a child.  This trauma is made even more dramatic for the reader because it contrasts so starkly with lovely vignettes of the large, happy family we admire and feel part of in the beginning of the book.  Ellen's siblings--sister Billie, brother Kester, and Michael, nicknamed Carlos-- are in every way delightful, normal children, experiencing the same joys and humorous adventures that most readers will have experienced, with parents who are so in love they can hardly keep their hands off each other.  It is easy to admire, and even envy, such a family.<br />And then the idyll abruptly ends, and we don't know exactly how or why.  Slowly, inexorably, details are revealed which put Ellen's current life into perspective.  A 37-year-old single woman, recently divorced and pregnant as a result of a brief encounter, Ellen has purchased the house where disaster long ago struck her family, and there she awaits the birth of her baby and thinks about the past.  This past takes on added poignancy since it was the birth of her youngest sibling that triggered the events that destroyed Ellen's world.<br />Dorrestein is the consummate literary juggler here as she throws Ellen's innumerable memories, partial memories, and suspicions into the air of her story and manages to keep them all suspended until the heart-stopping, breath-taking conclusion.  I'm sure many readers will feel compelled to keep reading this book well into the night--the agony of finding out the details so slowly is more than some of us are willing to bear.

This captivating comedy of academic manners has a satisfying weightiness lacking in most other books of its genre because it is also intellectually challenging.  Here Lodge indulges his interest in the esoteric subject of cognitive science--the study of consciousness and the processes of thought--by giving us two intriguing characters at opposite extremes of the cognitive spectrum and then letting the sparks fly, at first intellectually, then \\"socially.\\"<br /><br />Ralph Messenger is the clever and manipulative Director of the Holt Belling Center for Cognitive Science at the imaginary University of Gloucester, a nuts-and-bolts scientist investigating the physical, quantifiable aspects of thought and consciousness.  Helen Reed, a visiting lecturer and grieving widow, on the other hand, is an artist, a novelist who celebrates feeling, imagination, and creation.  When Ralph, an unapologetic woman-chaser, finds Helen irresistibly attractive, their totally different worlds collide, exposing the reader to various theories of cognitive science but also illuminating the limitations in explaining the soul, love, relationships, imagination, and the creative life.<br /><br />Clandestine rendezvous, academic gamesmanship, office politics, secret lives kept hidden from spouses, and even involvement in pornography all contribute to the ensuing complications and suspense.  The sometimes farce-like action is kept in check, however, by the very real presence of death, which hovers over the action and grounds the comedy, adding to the realism and providing a setting for arguments about whether the soul and Heaven can exist in a strictly scientific world.<br /><br />The many delights of this novel are highlighted by Lodge's choice of appropriate points of view for his characters.  Ralph's self-involved maunderings are in stream of consciousness, constantly flitting from his serious research to daydreams about sex.  Helen's reminiscences appear in introspective journal entries.  Third person narratives, which advance the story line, are interspersed with a variety of clever diversions-including parodies of Martin Amis, Irvine Welsh, Samuel Beckett, Fay Weldon, Henry James, and Gertrude Stein by Helen's students.

This quotation from the introduction by Michael Hofmann, poet and translator of four Roth novels, highlights both the delights and limitations of this book. Like the Radetzky March, it has all the ingredients for a greatly exciting read and touches on all aspects of society in the Austro-Hungarian empire--worlds of the court, the army, journalism, night life, the law, popular entertainment, and even prostitution.<br /><br />Unlike the Radetzky March, however, it is sketchy, and doesn't draw you into the action or involve you with the characters. There's a curious disconnect between the characters and the reader, akin in many ways to the disconnect between most of the characters and each other, perhaps because there are many of them in this short novel, and perhaps because Roth himself felt disconnected, living in exile and dying of alcoholism at the time he wrote it.<br /><br />The visit of the Shah of Persia and his one-night-stand with a young Viennese woman provide fertile ground for wonderful dialogue and lyrical descriptions, but the characters are like exhibits in the wax museum which plays a part in the conclusion of the novel. In short, this novel is intriguing primarily for its detailed and exacting recreation of an historical context, but its large scope and small size act as barriers to reader involvement.

With this incredible debut novel,  Wray leaps onto the literary stage fully mature, with a book so polished and assured that lovers of great writing will be celebrating this book for a long time.  Wray shows no uncertainty. He has total control of his dramatic raw material--the rise of the Nazis in Austria, the Dollfuss Affair, and the Anschluss--and he never once stoops to sensationalism, never pushes any of those easy anti-Hitler buttons, never loses his characters in the intensity of the action, and never lets us forget that Hitler's rise was possible because ordinary people allowed it to happen.<br /><br />As the book opens, Oskar Voxlauer, is returning to Austria after twenty years in the Ukraine, where he has lived following his desertion from the horrors of Isonzo in World War I.  His Socialist ideals have crumbled in the face of the communist reality, his lover has died, and he hasn't seen his family or his former home since he was seventeen.  Unable to adjust to the changes which have taken place in Niessen, he finds work in the mountains as a gamekeeper for a Jewish friend, occasionally visiting the town and his somewhat dotty mother. Although Oskar finds love in the mountains with Else Bauer,  he sometimes worries about his stability, suffering from occasional hallucinations and panic attacks and sometimes reacting violently to the injustices he sees and feels.  He finds comfort in nature, even when the Nazi menace begins to threaten him, his relationship with Else, and his Jewish friend, Pauli Ryslavy.<br /><br />The lively third person narrative alternates wth Oskar's poignant and lengthy memories from his past--in the Ukraine and in the Austria of twenty years ago.  When Else's cousin, Kurt Bauer, a high-ranking SS official, arrives, a new point of view opens, as Bauer, too, contributes reminiscences--about the growth of his Nazi commitment, the killing of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, and his plans for a Nazi Austria.  These interior monologues are incredibly powerful, highlighting the similarities and  contrasts in the lives of Oskar and Bauer, both ordinary people who have been caught up in different political movements, committed to them for different reasons.<br /><br />Putting all the politics into perspective are some of the most lyrical and gorgeous extended descriptions of nature you'll ever read-including butterflies with their \\"parchment-like wingbeats,\\" two fox cubs, one of which \\"held the spine of a trout in its teeth like a diadem,\\" and even inkpot toads, with their \\"bright yellow undersides [that] bled a dark, poisonous-looking ink from tiny vents along their ribs.\\"  This is a successful novel on every level, and it is not far-fetched to read of comparisons between it and Joseph Roth's earlier Austrian masterpiece, The Radetzky March.

Despite the reverence with which Bradbury is regarded and the fact that this was his last book, it will probably never receive a literary award.  Parts of it are insightfully descriptive, thoughtful, humorous, and fun to read, but it lacks the unity (and editing!) which would make it a coherent whole, feeling more like a draft than a finished product.<br /><br />Two story lines unfold on parallel tracks.  Denis Diderot is at the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, visiting the court of Catherine the Great and discussing philosophy with her every afternoon in the hope that she will become an enlightened leader, rather than an autocratic despot.  The second, less effective story  involves seven contemporary characters--a writer, a diplomat, a carpenter, an opera singer, a trade unionist, a dramatist, and a \\"funky professor\\"  with \\"I Love Deconstruction\\" on his hat.  This motley group, representing some of the areas in which Diderot was interested, is participating in the Diderot Project, the object of which is to find all the books and papers which once belonged to Diderot and which he sold to Catherine for his \\"pension and posterity.\\" All participants regard this as a junket--a free trip.<br /><br />The atmosphere of 18th century Russia and of the Age of Enlightenment is vivid, and it is easy for the reader to feel the philosophical give and take of the discussions between Diderot and Catherine. The lengthy discussions, with references to Voltaire, Rousseau, Lawrence Sterne, David Garrick, and Dr. Johnson, among others, are intriguing for the connections they make, and they are often humorous, but they are too long and heavy here, and they weigh down and eventually bury the slim plot.<br /><br />As for the Diderot Project participants, they are sketchy characters, and one never really gets to understand them.  And why someone would fund this supposed project when its goals seem so amorphous and the objectives in Russia so nebulous remains a permanent (and unrealistic) mystery.  The fact that the group arrives just as Yeltsin dismisses the Duma and a possible coup or revolution is taking place could have been used to show some nice parallels and contrasts with the rule of Catherine and the ideas of Diderot, but the author's selection of details which would make this clear to the reader just didn't happen.<br /><br />The character of Galina, a discussion of postmortemism (the idea that writers all borrow directly from previous generations, thereby living forever), and the meeting of Diderot and Thomas Jefferson (and suggestion that Diderot thereby contributed to the U.S. Constitution)  are among the many wonderful features of this book, but they are hidden away in this 500-page attic of a book.

Full of the colors, scents, and sounds of exotic Burma in the 1860's, this novel comes to life within the Glass Palace of the royal family and in the streets of Mandalay, sometimes the \\"home\\" of its ordinary citizens, in the final days before Britain's voracious, imperialist juggernaut shoots its way up the Irrawaddy River.<br /><br />Giving life to the Burmese point of view, Rajkumar and Dolly, orphaned children working as servants when the novel begins, eventually become the founders of a family whose members, in succeeding generations, reflect the economic and the political realities in Burma, Malaya, and India over the 150 years from the British raj to the present day.  Working as suppliers of teak, petroleum, and rubber, members of this family and of two other families with whom they have close ties, also work as soldiers supporting Britain during World Wars I and II, with the independence movement in Burma and India, and eventually as anti-communist intellectuals in the present state of Myanmar.<br /><br />By having these families participate in the important historical events which occurred in this part of the world, Ghosh does a remarkable job of personalizing these events and making them memorable for readers (especially if they, like me, have little knowledge about these countries). The action, especially during the World War II invasion of Malaya by the Japanese, is vivid and very exciting, as people try to flee the shooting in Malaya but find roads closed to Burma and Siam.<br /><br />The extent to which Indian and Burmese troops, fighting for Britain, accelerated the collapse of the British Empire following World War II--and led to the (sometimes temporary) independence of India, Malaysia and Burma, now Myanmar--is presented clearly and unambiguously, and the reader is jolted by the extent to which whole cultures were lost through British zeal to colonize.  While this is not War and Peace, The Glass Palace is a fascinating look into the history and cultures of a region which has had little exposure in western novels.

This is a quintessentially British mystery, old-fashioned, and reminiscent in plot to Agatha Christie, with a murder and all the action taking place inside a closed community.  One of the priests or ordinands within a small, remote, High Church seminary must have committed a murder, or two, or three.<br /><br />Commander Adam Dalgliesh, who spent several summers at St. Anselm's as a boy, returns to investigate the death of the young son of an extremely wealthy man, and in short order, additional deaths occur.  A Rogier van der Weyden altarpiece, a treasure trove of ecclesiastical silver, Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and other priceless art objects owned by the about-to-be-closed seminary, provide a possible financial motive for murder, while an incestuous relationship, a secret marriage, a paralyzing fear of the future, and even pedophilia by a much-loved priest are among the psychological motives.<br /><br />Politeness and \\"civilized\\" behavior play a greater role here than they do in many, more \\"modern\\" mysteries.  There is no graphic sex, no profanity, and no scenes of violence--just the effects of the violence.  We see the priests and ordinands only within their circumscribed lives, and there are no scenes that suggest that any of them have any sense of humor or any real need for fun.<br /><br />Although James conveys enough psychological astuteness that her characters do not feel flat, there are at least eight or ten who could have committed the murder and for whom very substantial background information is given.  The reader must follow all of them, along with an equally large number of red herrings, for four hundred pages before the plot is resolved, somewhat anticlimactically.  That, combined with maddeningly detailed, physical descriptions of the rooms of the seminary, made this a four-star experience for me, rather than five-star.  Mary Whipple	2001-05-06

Kathleen de Burca, a single, middle-aged travel writer living alone for twenty years in the same basement flat in London, finds her whole life changing when her closest friend and confidante dies very suddenly.  Her loneliness is overpowering, her desire to leave her job and try a new kind of writing is growing, and as she faces the age of fifty without a family or any lover, she remarks soulfully, \\"I have to get old...I have to watch the [irresistible passion] in me dying....This is the hardest thing; and no one warned me.\\"<br /><br />Possessing the court transcript for an adultery trial from the 1850's, Kathleen decides to return to Ireland for the first time since she left home, thirty years before, to look for more information about the case and perhaps to write about it.  She is puzzled by the irony that the apparently unrestrained passion of the \\"affair\\"  took place during the depths of the Potato Famine, when hundreds of people on her husband's estate perished of hunger, their deaths made even more miserable by their forced evictions from their homes.  She is also open to a passion of her own.<br /><br />Kathleen de Burca is an unusual protagonist for a love story by virtue of her age alone, and few women will be able to resist her attempts to find direction for her life, with or without a lover. Skillfully alternating Kathleen de Burca's  search for meaning in her own life with her discoveries about Marianne Talbot, the famine, and emigration, O'Faolain creates a flawed and realistic main character trying to find connections within the mess of her life--the Irish roots she has abandoned, friends and lovers she has thoughtlessly hurt, and ill-considered choices she has made.<br /><br />Lush (sometimes too lush) descriptions of the Irish countryside alternate with dry court documents and testimonies, time alternates back and forth across the 150-year time frame, and hunger and passion are seen through the dual points of view of Kathleen de Burca and Marianne Talbot.  This is a big, enjoyable story of love and passion as seen by both a young wife and a woman in her 50's, leading to new perspectives and new considerations of their roles in our lives.

Paul Theroux writing on autopilot is still better than many other authors at the top of their form.  His well-known ability to describe a place or person in just a few perfect words, his creation of believable characters with clear motivations, his ironic detachment as these same characters mess up their lives, and his depiction of a writer's battle with the demons of his craft are among his many brilliant qualities, all on vibrant display here.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, this novel was a disappointment to me. Set in a 3rd-rate hotel in Honolulu, it has the characters and setting of a novel (and is called a novel on the cover), but it is so lacking in any sort of unifying plot, that it's not even possible to write a plot summary. The huge cast of characters has only one thing in common--they all live and/or work at the Hotel Honolulu.  While some characters are complete enough that they could have been worked into a wonderful collection of short stories, others are seen only in tiny, three- or four-page vignettes and add nothing significant.  Very much like the author, the narrator is a writer who has had a failed marriage and difficult divorce in England and who has come to Hawaii hoping to escape his bad memories and the pressures of the writing life.  He likes Hawaii \\"because it [is] a void\\"--almost no one recognizes his name, and those who do have not read his books.  He works as the manager of the Hotel Honolulu.<br /><br />Distressingly, this fragmented book is shockingly mean-spirited in tone, going way beyond good-humored satire, and demeaning almost every aspect of Hawaii, its people, and its culture, while also taking pokes at some American icons. Virtually every woman in the book either is or has been a prostitute.  All are dimwits.  Even the narrator's wife is the product of a one-night stand between a Honolulu prostitute and John F. Kennedy, a man she supposedly never recognized in this most Democratic state.<br /><br />Hawaiian/Filipino girls are depicted as fair game, sexually, for their fathers, uncles, brothers, and other relatives.  Hawaiians who speak pidgin among themselves are mocked and their language derided.  When he uses Hawaiian words, Theroux sometimes deliberately misspells them.  Fellow-author Stephen King (ironically, one of the truly great creators of plot) also takes a hit here, Theroux saying, \\"it takes only a modest talent to write about misery.\\"  In a particularly low blow, he even comments on King's near-fatal accident by saying, \\"Gross reality [the accident] overwhelms his puerile and implausible fantasies.\\" This novel has its virtues, but it seems that modesty, tolerance, and good taste are not among them.

Set in the Bronx and Brooklyn, this is a grisly and graphic story of mob murder, dismemberment, and torture, along with the businesses of protection, loansharking, and money laundering.  Tommy Pagano, the sous-chef at a small restaurant, who was cared for as a child by his mob-connected uncle Sal Pitera, finds himself up to his prime rib in dangerous mob business when Sally wants payback.  Sandwiched between bloodthirsty racketeers on one side and equally threatening and sinister investigators who want him to give up Sally and his \\"friends\\" on the other side, Tommy has more than ample reason to fear for his life.<br /><br />Suspense and horror are leavened throughout by humor, which comes mainly from absurdities--a hitman standing naked while he dismembers a body in order to protect his clothes, a chef upset because someone used his kitchen knife instead of a boning knife, a mobster telling a hitman that his actions were \\"bush.\\" This is primarily is a fast-paced story of murder and mayhem, with humor on the side and lots of insights into the restaurant business.

Every once in a while, a book comes along that is so stirring in its message and so elegant in its composition that you cannot wait to tell everyone you know about it.  This is one of those books.  Like the real gardens of Kyoto, it is quiet, subtle, and cerebral.  At the same time, it is immensely powerful in effect, full of dramatic contrasts which illuminate the bedrock of life itself. The mood is contemplative and introspective, and the reader ultimately gains new insights into the nature of human relationships.<br /><br />The main character, Ellen, is a young girl during the early 1940's, fascinated by her cousin Randall, a slight, sensitive boy, a few years older, that she sees only once or twice a year.  Randall expands Ellen's view of the world, showing her secret rooms in his house and inviting her to share some of his intellectual curiosity about the Underground Railroad which once stopped there.  The voices of these young people, each alone in many ways, speak directly to the reader and involve him/her in both the action and the values of the times.  Ellen shares Randall's fear as he leaves for the World War II, where, we have discovered in the opening sentence, he is killed on Iwo Jima.  He leaves Ellen a box of \\"treasures,\\" including his diary and his copy of The Gardens of Kyoto, a book given to him by his mother.  As the diary and book reveal Randall's family history, we also learn about Ellen's family, the relationships of the parents, their relationships with each other, Ellen's relationships with each of them, and her relationship with the father of the child to whom she is leaving the written record which constitutes this novel.<br /><br />The plot is full and rich with many overlaps of time and detail as the narrative shifts from pre-World War II to Korea.  The main characters are fully developed, understandable people trying to adapt to their changing world the best way they can, some more successfully than others.  However fascinating the story is (and it is totally captivating), Walbert's underlying themes and their development are even more fascinating (or were to me).  She illustrates, among other things, that as in Kyoto's gardens,  our views of \\"truth\\" are limited by our vantage points, that we sometimes confuse shadow with reality, and that there is a universal desire among all men to find peace and serenity.

Set in rural England sometime around the seventeenth century, this tightly controlled first novel is told by a young woman who works as a maid in the Great House and returns often to visit her mother, who is a mid-wife in the village.  When Dora, a huge woman from the village, with apparently equally huge appetites, is found dead, the village is not long in deciding that this may be murder, rather than the accident it appears to be.<br />Skillfully incorporating a vast amount of period detail when establishing the setting and atmosphere, Tobin also incorporates medical treatments, dreams thought to be inspired by the devil, and graphic accounts of childbirth, burials, and bewitchment.  Itinerant elixir-salesmen, domestic workers in the Great House, local pub patrons, and magistrates provide color and supplement the main characters--the cruel master of the Great House and his sadly deformed son,  the sickly and deluded mistress of the house, the narrator's stern and private mother, Dora's simple 11-year-old son with the body of a man and a hidden cache of gold, and Dora herself, who arrived in the village suddenly from afar and whose past is mysterious.  The narrative is very smooth and conversational in tone, flowing quickly and apparently effortlessly.  The story is uncomplicated, with a grand finale of an ending.

Setting his novel in the English Department of prestigious Midwest University, Hynes uses his rapier wit and prodigious scholarship to skewer the pretension, pettiness, and smarmy oneupsmanship of academia's career professionals.  Caste-conscious in the extreme, with adjuncts and writing lab teachers working in the basement of the building while department chairs and distinguished professors inhabit the top floors, these full-time professionals form alliances and/or sabotage each other, carefully toe-ing the line of political correctness while engaging in scholarly research on effete subjects, all in an effort to achieve the ultimate goal: Tenure.<br /><br />The plot of this novel is well outlined elsewhere on these pages, so I won't repeat it.  Suffice it to say, that when Nelson Humboldt, a phlegmatic scholar, never even close to being on tenure track, finds himself with supernatural powers, he delights in using them, both to advance his career and to correct what he considers the philosophical misdirection of his department.  The satire is pointed and realistic, as \\"colleagues\\" engage in competitive wordplay in which they spew Shakespearean quotations, try to trap each other in fallacies of argument, and generally reflect medieval values by jousting for position and trying to humiliate their opponents.  Hynes's own grounding in the canons of English literature (and his familiarity with academic politics) are obvious here, as he employs quotations ranging from Chaucer to T.S. Eliot, twisting and sometimes changing them to serve his purpose.<br /><br />Although one of the critics on this page refers to the book as a \\"pitchperfect blend of satire and horror,\\" I felt that the book split apart when the focus shifted from satire to horror.  Suddenly, the action ceased being cerebral, subtle, and tongue-in-cheek and became instead truly nasty, vicious, and life-threatening, with real, rather than intellectual danger facing the characters.  This is an enjoyable farce which makes some important points about academic politics.  It is also an enjoyable horror story.  I think it loses some coherence when it shifts between the two genres.

One would hope a book written about race relations thirty years ago would be irrelevant and possibly dated today.  Unfortunately, Keneally's stunning indictment of turn-of-the-century racism, in this case that of Anglo settlers towards Australia's native aborigines, remains vibrant and powerful, even after these many years.  Literally timeless in its message and articulate and graceful in its execution, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith could have been written about many minorities subjugated during many periods in many different countries.<br /><br />The basic story is not unique.  Half aborigine and half Anglo, Jimmie Blacksmith grows up in aborigine culture.  Because he is light-skinned, however, he is able to obtain jobs on white landholdings more readily than other aborigines, and there he is exposed to Anglo culture--with all its stated, good intentions, but its sometimes patronizing attitudes and selfish goals.  After being worked hard and cheated from his earnings repeatedly, Jimmie snaps, visiting on his former employers the kind of fatal \\"justice\\" which has so often been dealt to the aborigines.  As vigilantes and police join forces to apprehend Jimmie, we see all the conflicting attitudes toward life and justice which undermine the creation of a unified, fair society.<br /><br />The throbbing drumbeat of Jimmie's chants and Keneally's insistent narrative pace combine with our revulsion toward Jimmie's actions, to catch us up in the emotions of both the pursuers and the pursued.  Our understanding of  Jimmie and our empathy with him make us long for his redemption at the same time that we are anxious for justice to take place.  Keneally's resolution is brilliant, fittingly combining the best elements of both of Jimmie's worlds.  This is a wonderful novel which deals with a complex and sensitive subject without polemics or convenient, easy solutions, and it's as relevant today as it was when it was written.

Moore is a true American original--with an imagination so wild, irreverent, hyper, sexy, and just plain wacky that it's a wonder he can discipline himself enough to sit down and actually write a book.<br /><br />Anne Rice is probably rolling on the floor with laughter at this outrageous, \\"vampire book\\" send-up, which alludes to her Vampire Lestat and follows the conventions of the genre to the extent that Moore's vampires have the some of the same abilities and needs.  Beyond these characteristics, however,  Moore's vampires inhabit their own crazy world, a world in which there is even a good, innocent, fledgling vampire, like Jody Stroud, forced by events beyond her control to be a vampire, and an evil vampire who  performs gruesome crimes and tries to frame her.  Jody, the unwilling vampire, even has a lover who wants to help her and who continues to live with her, more or less taking her vampirism for granted, or at most considering it just another way in which she \\"does her own thing.\\"<br /><br />As would-be writer Tommy Flood tries to save Jody from blame for several murders in the seamier parts of San Francisco, described with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humor, he enlists his buddies on the midnight to eight a.m. shift of a supermarket, who put aside their turkey-bowling (a 12-lb frozen Butterball knocks down more Ivory liquid bottles than a 14-pounder) to help out.

Having already read McCabe's chilling book, The Butcher Boy, I was looking forward to a repeat of the damaged but sympathetic characters and the delicious horror one finds there.  This novel, however, boasts a broader scope and more subtle characterization than The Butcher Boy.  More ambitious, but just as seductive, it boasts two main characters of different generations and personalities, colliding with nightmarish results.  Because the characters are so normal, even happy, at the beginning, and their deterioration seems so accidental and avoidable, the sense of sadness and loss one feels at the end is even more intense.<br /><br />Malachy Dudgeon is a young man whose childhood, though not ideal, is not bizarre, either.  As a boy, he experiences love and security within his family, which more than outweighs any damage from bullying he faces by older kids, even when his family situation changes.  Eventually, he goes to college, falls in love, becomes a teacher almost by accident, and is hired to work in a private boys' school in Dublin.  Raphael Bell is his Headmaster.  We learn of Raphael's almost idyllic childhood, his great success as a student, his firm friendships, his early career, and his shy love and eventual marriage.  Passages of great, lyrical beauty pervade these descriptions.  Inexorably, however, Bell's conservative, moralistic, and formal approaches to life and education come into conflict with the casual attitudes toward discipline, structure, scholarship, and traditional values which Malachy represents, and the fabric of their lives unravels, then shreds.<br /><br />McCabe creates wonderful, understandable characters facing conflicts not unlike those many of us face, and voices so real we can recognize even their inflections.  By deliberately evoking the feeling that if only we were there we might be able to help, he cleverly involves the reader in the action.  For a teacher, however, he may dredge up real nightmares--of rude or surly students, impatient and demanding parents, classes for which more preparation was essential, compromises made because there was simply Not Enough Time, along with pedagogical conflicts between strict standards and flexible, creative learning.

Bruce Mason, a diplomat and ambassador in his sixties, returns to Salt Lake City for the funeral of his aunt, who is the last remaining connection to a family history Mason has spent forty years avoiding.  During the day and night he is there, he travels throughout Salt Lake, trying to locate landmarks from his troubled early life while reminiscing about the events which permanently influenced choices he made and directions he took as an adult.  Gentle and reflective in tone, despite its scenes of sadness and disillusionment, this is a novel quite different from Stegner's epics, such as Angle of Repose and Big Rock Candy Mountain, with their enormous scope.  Here, he creates what amounts to a memoir--a record of the life-changing experiences which one man, Mason, associates with his family, friends, and upbringing during the brief 24 hours he is in Salt Lake City.<br /><br />Although this is supposed to be a sequel to Big Rock Candy Mountain, with the same main character, one need not have any familiarity with that book to enjoy this one, a book so introspective that one cannot help but wonder about the degree to which it is autobiographical.  Like many of us who have outlived and, in some cases, out-achieved our parents, Mason finds his memories bittersweet.  He is filled with resentment for the unintentional injuries and deliberate cruelties which made his youth and adolescence a misery.  At the same time that he recognizes that he would never have been so motivated to achieve and escape had he not been so needy and so \\"hungry.\\"<br /><br />Though many authors have dealt with the \\"you can't go home again\\" theme, Stegner suggests here that one must go home again, not to relive early, unpleasant events again and again, stuck in the past, but to relive those events and reevaluate them from the perspective and experience one has gained over time.

Beautifully plotted and extremely sensitive to the differing viewpoints of those who seek to reunify the Six Counties with the rest of the Ireland, the novel offers a fresh look at the continued violence, those who plan it, those who support it indirectly through their inaction, those whose financial contributions allow it to affect successive generations, and those who oppose it.  Hynes is particularly adept at reducing the complexities of IRA internal politics to manageable levels so that the plot speeds along, sweeping up the reader in the excitement of the moment, just as the main characters are swept up in the emotional rollercoaster of their struggles.<br /><br />Brian Donovan is a twenty-year-old American delegated by his grandfather, an Irishman who fled the country after he assassinated a British policemen many years ago, to take $10,000 to Irish relatives engaged in IRA activities.  A callow young man with no sense of purpose or commitment, he is easy prey for those who would use his ability to cross borders at will to further their own goals.  His cousin Maire supports the IRA's new, more moderate position by being elected Sinn Fein city councillor from West Belfast, speaking out and collecting funds, such as those from her relatives in the U.S.  Her extremist husband, Jimmy Coogan, however, feels that the moderate position is a sellout.  He's stolen 10 pounds of plastique explosives and intends to \\"make a statement\\" when the moderate Provos have their national conference.  He intends to use Brian to help him.<br /><br />Hynes's depiction of Brian and Clare, the equally young American girlfriend Brian acquires in his travels, is spot-on.  Having never had to deal with the hard truths, Brian and Clare are naïve, looking at the deadly predicament in which they find themselves as if it were part of  a virtual reality game. As the conflicts within the IRA become more and more violent, the reader waits for Brian, a Guinness-drinking fun seeker, to grow up and take a stand.  A thrilling and exciting can't-put-it-downer, this novel goes beyond the all-or-nothing conflicts we've come to associate with The Troubles in Northern Ireland and IRA violence in England.  Here we also come to know some of the real, flawed humans from all sides who've become involved, however unwittingly--often by making emotional, rather than rational, choices about life-and-death issues.  As the struggle reaches its violent culmination here, freedom and responsibility take on new meaning.  Mary Whipplehemselves as if it were part of  a virtual reality game.

Aljaz Cosini, a Tasmanian river guide, is trapped under water, his body wedged between rocks in the Franklin River, into which he has dived in an effort to save a reckless rafter.  \\"I have entered the realm of the fabulous, of hallucinations, for there is no way anybody stuck drowning could experience such things,\\" he thinks, as many generations of his family history pass through his mind.  As this remarkable narrative unfolds, it alternates between Aljaz's dying, first person memories of his family's past and his objective, third person observations about life in contemporary Tasmania.  Through Aljaz's memories, the reader learns the sad history of the island, a former penal colony for the most hardened criminals, the site of total genocide for the aboriginal natives, a remote colony with little hope and no tolerance for differences.  A bright boy, Aljaz  himself has intentionally failed everything in school, because \\"by failing, Aljaz begins to fit in with people...there is a camaraderie amongst the ranks of the fallen....They expect to be failed, to be unemployed, to be pushed around, to know only despair.\\"<br /><br />This is a story of abject hopelessness, the misery of Aljaz's family continuing through the four or five generations we meet during Aljaz's final moments and culminating in Aljaz's own predicament. The author does not even hold out the hope that Aljaz himself will be rescued, choosing to confirm the death in the book's title, before the reader even opens the book.  What unites the generations (and keeps the reader going) is the clear and abiding respect for nature we see throughout the book--for the power of the river, for the unique animals of the island, for the stories and myths of the old people--and the belief that there is a unity of man and nature.  And Aljaz experiences the ultimate unity with nature in his death in the river, as he becomes one with the sea eagle who \\"carries the spirits of the ancestors.\\"<br /><br />The characters one meets in this book are memorable, as they survive the best way they can. The tales of nature and the mystical moments that Aljaz experiences are vivid and uplifting, a fitting contrast to the reality of life.  The action on the river is realistic and exciting, and there is a thematic unity which connects the generations of the past with the action in the present.  It may be self-defeating, however, to create a novel in which the reader is asked to become personally involved with a main character whose death is foretold from the outset.  Though that confirms and reinforces the point the author is making about the hopelessness of Aljaz's life, it certainly makes this novel a depressing ride for the reader.

If you've read everything you can find on Sir Ernest Shackleton's trips to Antarctica, seen the traveling exhibit with Frank Hurley's extraordinary photographs and memorabilia from the Endurance, and still crave more about Antarctic expeditions, this book will keep you interested and dreaming of such exploration for a few more hours.<br /><br />Written in 1978, this is a murder mystery set near the South Pole in 1909, the same year as Shackleton's first expedition and five years before the Endurance epic.  A similar crew of explorer-scientists and sailors, with the same attitudes and prejudices that one finds in the literary record of the Endurance, perform similar tasks under similar conditions, with one big exception.  Captain Eugene Stewart (sharing initials with Ernest Shackleton) must also investigate his own crew as he attempts to unmask the murderer of Victor Henneker, the expedition's representative of the press, who intends to record the voyage for posterity.<br /><br />With the same care for historic details and period attitudes which one sees in some of Keneally's later, prize-winning books, such as Confederates and Schindler's List, Keneally reveals Henneker to be a blackmailer who holds damaging information about almost everyone in the crew, their reputations vulnerable because they have violated the inflexible moral strictures of Edwardian England.  A cuckolded husband,  the secret lover of a married aristocrat, a mountain guide who may be responsible for a fatal excursion, a man tried for theft, and others \\"guilty\\" of homosexuality, Zionism, illegitimacy, and heresy reflect the pettiness and rigidity of \\"civilized\\" life in England and offer motivation both for the murder of Victor and for participating in the expedition.  The book's conclusion is also consistent with the mores of the day.  While this may not be the greatest mystery of all time, it is certainly one in which the author has done all his homework, well worth reading for the context it provides for other (real) expeditions of the day.

This thoughtful and loving tribute to the human spirit begins with the lines: \\"It is the industry of the soul, to love and to hate; to seek after the beautiful and to recognise the ugly; to honour friends and wreak vengeance upon enemies...\\"  Here and elsewhere throughout the book, Booth uses Biblical parallels to advance his message about the human condition:  \\"[There is] a time to love and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace [Ecclesiastes]...\\"  In quiet, thoughtful tones, the main character, 80-year-old Alexander Bayliss, called Shurik, reflects on his life, a life which we would consider intolerable but in which he has found satisfaction and, remarkably, much joy.  At eighty, he is a man completely at peace with his world, celebrating the love, endurance, and forgiveness which have made his life not only bearable, but ultimately, happy.<br /><br />Shurik was a 40-year-old Englishman doing business in the Soviet Union when he was summarily arrested for espionage and sentenced to hard labor in the gulag, spending the next twenty years in a coal mine.  In the hellish darkness and depths of the mine, however, Shurik finds enlightenment.  One of seven men in his labor group, he and his companions become a family, fiercely loyal to each other, accepting life moment by moment, with no thoughts wasted on a future they cannot afford to contemplate.  Eventually released, Shurik lives a quiet life in a small Russian village, where he becomes much beloved.  When Communism fails and the Soviet Union dissolves, Bayliss, at eighty, finds himself faced with his most difficult decision.<br /><br />This ambitious novel entertains at the same time that it conveys a strong message about man's enduring spirit and the need to forgive. The symbolism is clear and easily understood--the miners digging up a completely preserved wooly mammoth, then roasting and eating part of it, Shurik acting as teacher to the children of the village and sometimes speaking in aphorisms or proverbs, the story of the fox in the cage, the making of bread in the village, Shurik arguing for the historic preservation of the local church, etc.  The language is simple, the images are unforgettable, the prose style is both musical and urgent, and the characters are admirable and sympathetic.  A memorable and  thoughtfully constructed novel, every detail of which advances Bayliss's message.

There is something uncomfortable, squirmy, and even a bit repulsive about Mimi's Ghost, despite the fact that it's a lot of fun to read.  Morris Duckworth, the main character, you see, is a serial killer.  Though Parks  presents him in broad strokes and with some sense of absurdity, he also comes across, unfortunately, as someone the author finds quite amusing, a \\"delightful killer\\" of sorts.<br /><br />At the outset of the novel, Morris has already killed at least three people--Mimi, the only woman he has ever loved and two characters named Giacomo and Sandra, and there are hints that he has also killed his mother.  A good-looking, blonde Englishman living in Italy, Morris has quickly married Mimi's sister Paola and hopes to be in charge of the family winery soon.  What he has not expected is that he will begin communicating with Mimi on his cell phone, that he will hear her voice talking to him at unexpected moments, that he will see her wink at him in photographs, and that he'll recognize her face as the Virgin in Renaissance paintings.  As Morris tries to ensure his position in the family business, he resorts to homicide again, but he also becomes a born-again Christian, decides to establish a residence for homeless immigrants who have been living in the local cemetery, and tries to embark on an introspective life of good works.<br /><br />Morris may well be a schizophrenic and/or psychopath.  I was never sure, however, exactly what point of view the author wanted to convey about him.  Though Morris's actions are repulsive and show absolutely no remorse, many parts of the book are almost slapstick funny, and there is a great deal of satire-of the British character, of Italian police procedures, of business practices, and of bribery and graft. Mimi's Ghost, however, is not clearly a satire, nor is it clearly a horror story.  It lacks the control and  tongue-in-cheek tone which allows satire to flourish at the same time that the reader shares the author's seeming horror at the action.  As a result, there is no conclusion here about which the reader can say with relief, \\"Whew!  That was close!\\" as the main character gets his comeuppance.  Instead, one wonders here  if Parks is planning yet another installment in the murderous saga of Morris Duckworth.  Mary Whippleaction.

The fact that you have come this page at all to read about this obscure book suggests that you will probably like it.  It's not a book for everybody--I'm not sure how much it was a book for me, though I did like it.  The book jacket's advertising and the published plot summaries suggest that this an unusual coming-of-age story, combined with a mystery.  It is these things, but describing the book in terms of plot emphasizes its least important aspects and, to some extent, misleads the reader into thinking that this is primarily an entertainment.  It is, instead, a very serious study of theology, historical analysis, world literature, literary criticism, philosophy, aesthetics, ethics, and morality, using the story as a vehicle for communicating weighty ideas.<br /><br />On its most basic level, the book concerns Tom Lynch, born after his father's death in the Hindenburg disaster and rejected by his mother when he was a child.  Sent to boarding school on the moors of England at an extremely young age, he becomes a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the very religious and kind, but stuffy, headmaster.  It is here that he first sees a book illustrated by the artist Delaquay, a man so concerned with the aesthetic implications of reproducing artwork, that he has always refused to have his own work published or displayed in public.  Each of his books consists of just one original edition. Tom goes off to Oxford to study at the Lenau Institute of Art, supported by the secret Delaquay Society, and he eventually becomes its secretary.  Alas, Tom is unable to adhere to the strict requirements of Delaquay Society membership, begins drinking heavily, and falls into physical and moral decline.<br /><br />The book is full of lectures on abstract ideas and contains moral lessons galore as Tom tries to get his life back on track.  The first fifty pages are particularly challenging as the author sets up the thematic framework which makes Tom's descent so meaningful and the conclusion of the novel so dramatic.  Despite the lecturing, which seemed dry to me when I read it, the book is surprisingly moving by its conclusion, and I've found myself coming back to it, picking at it again and again, finding new insights each time I do.  It's a most unusual book and will appeal primarily to those readers with a strong background in philosophy and aesthetics.

This book is filled with delights, not least of which is the light, deft touch the author employs as he deals  charmingly with important and weighty issues of family relationships--fathers with sons, and brothers with each other.  There's a freshness and gentleness of tone here that might even be cloying were it not for the acerbic, sometimes boisterous, humor which the author uses to leaven his narrative and keep his issues in perspective. Though there is a mystery at the heart of the novel, it's a quiet mystery, more important for the lessons it illuminates than for any thrills it may provide.<br /><br />Damien March, the main character, is an expatriate American living in London and working for the BBC.  Although he's had no contact with his uncle Patrick for twenty years, he finds himself the sudden beneficiary of his uncle's estate on Ionia, a fictional island off Cape Cod, an island which resembles Martha's Vineyard of the past.  The only catch is that he must not change the interior of the house, which is packed with bric-a-brac.  When he decides to spend six months living in the house, he discovers several unpublished stories by his uncle, all concerning Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes's mysterious brother, who has committed a terrible crime, but for worthy reasons.  The parallels Damien sees between Mycroft Holmes's relationship with Sherlock and his uncle Patrick's relationship with Damien's father lead him to investigate the crime and, ultimately, to come to a new understanding of what family means and what its enduring values may be.<br /><br />It is possible that this fictional story reflects either directly or obliquely on the author's own relationship with his author-father, Paul Theroux,  his author-uncle Alexander Theroux, his British TV-host-brother Louis, and the relationship of the elder Theroux brothers with each other.  While these overlaps will provide tantalizing and fertile grounds for biographers, they are irrelevant to one's enjoyment of this narrative.  Marcel Theroux, however, certainly seems to welcome such speculation by setting of this novel off Cape Cod, where Paul Theroux lives, and by his references to Medford, where the elder Theroux authors grew up. The accurate Cape Cod descriptions, the \\"Yankee spirit,\\" and the unpretentious lives so well illustrated by the peripheral characters here add immeasurably to the realism of this delightful study of family values.

Two different settings and time frames--Germany and Portugal in the waning days of the Third Reich, and contemporary Portugal, with some of the same characters--allow the author to overlap both a complex historical thriller with a  traditional murder mystery in unique and fascinating ways.  Klaus Felsen, forced to work for the Nazi SS near the end of World War II,  is sent to Portugal to buy as much wolfram (tungsten) as he can get, to be used in the manufacture of armor-piercing weapons.  He is also responsible for privately smuggling out a great deal of German gold and some stolen art when it appears that Germany will lose the war, a job made more palatable when he realizes that he and his partners can profit greatly in the years after the war if they are careful to avoid discovery.<br /><br />All these details come into play when a young Portuguese girl, seemingly unconnected with any of this, is found murdered fifty years later in contemporary Lisbon.  Inspector Ze Coelho is assigned to solve the mystery of her death, a death which eventually reverberates throughout Lisbon society, the &eacute;migr&eacute; population, the police department, the federal Justice department, political parties past and present, and even the foundations of the present government.<br /><br />If all this seems like a lot to take on, it is.  Although the book is beautifully written with fully developed, imperfect, and quirky characters one grows to like and understand, fine and vivid description, and a fast-paced plot with something happening all the time, ultimately it is difficult to make all the connections required by the fifty year chronology of the plot.<br /><br />Although I worked hard at this, and (mistakenly) thought I had succeeded as I worked my way to the conclusion, the last twenty pages had me scratching my head trying to figure out the final details and the secret motivations of the main characters, all of which are necessary for a successful resolution of this very complex plot.

Concentrating on just ten months of Viennese history between July, 1888, and May, 1889, Morton dissects the life of Vienna vertically, revealing its brilliance and its contrasts--its magnificence but ineffable sadness, its political gamesmanship but resistance to social change, its \\"correctness\\" of behavior but its anti-Semitism, and its patronage of the arts and sciences but its refusal to acknowledge true originality.  He carefully selects details with which the modern reader can identify to create a full picture, both of the historical characters and the constricted settings in which they try to live and breathe.<br /><br />Focusing on Crown Prince Rudolf as romantic hero, liberal thinker, and sensitive social reformer, Morton selects details which show Rudolf's resentment of his figurehead position, his lack of power to effect change, and his fears for the future of the monarchy.  He is presented as a modern man trying to live within a fusty and stultifying  environment.  Also chafing against limitations on their creativity are artist Gustave Klimt, writers Arthur Schnitzler and Theodor Herzl, musicians Arnold Schonberg, Gustav Mahler, and Anton Bruckner, and psychiatrist Dr. Sigmund Freud, whose detailed stories of frustration run parallel with that of the Crown Prince and enhance it.  Only Baroness Mary Vetsera, age 17 and full of life, is able to escape the bonds of Viennese \\"correctness,\\" attracting Rudolf, having a brief affair with him, and eventually succumbing with him in a suicide pact at Mayerling.<br /><br />Morton's scholarship and care for detail are obvious throughout, but he goes far beyond most other historians in his ability to involve the reader and make him empathize with the long-dead people in his book.  In his hands the events at Mayerling become understandable--though no less sad.  One can only wonder how history might have changed if Rudolf had been a partner with his father, Emperor Franz Joseph, rather than a powerless figurehead.  Mary Whipple	2001-03-30

The  Radetzky March, which precedes this book, is a big, fully conceived novel of the last days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with memorable and unique characters from the von Trotta family, vivid description, and narrative and thematic unity.  The Emperor's Tomb, by contrast, is an incomplete outline, lifeless, cold, and mournful.  Continuing the story of the Trotta family, this time concentrating on a branch of the family which did not receive a title or its privileges, Roth limply attempts to bring Austrian history from World War I up to 1938, the year of the book's publication.<br /><br />In 1914 Franz Ferdinand Trotta is a young man with no real goals, other than pleasure.  When the Emperor declares war, he becomes a soldier on the Eastern front and, very quickly, a prisoner of war sent to Siberia.  Upon his eventual release and return to Vienna after the war, he finds the monarchy gone, the financial system in disarray, and his personal life in tatters.  What remains--and never changes--is Trotta's lack of direction, his lack of purpose, and, most distressingly, his lack of motivation regarding his future.<br /><br />Trotta's refusal to recognize that he can and must now assume  power over his own life leaves the reader with a character for whom there can be no epiphany and no real climax.  Trotta is a throw-back, insisting even twenty years after the war, \\"I still belong to a palpably vanished world, a world in which it seem[s] plain that a people exists to be ruled and that, therefore, if it wishes to continue being a people it cannot rule itself.\\"  Though the political situation in post-war Vienna, leading to the rise of Hitler, could have led to a chilling, dramatic story, Roth steers clear of this, choosing instead to memorialize the vanished past by giving us a character whose failure to adapt to change reflects some of the very characteristics which destroyed the empire he mourns.

When the monsoon rains wash a whole village of massacred babies, men, and women down the swollen river and past a small, peaceful community on India's border with the newly created Pakistani state, the residents of the village are aghast.  When whole trains of newly slaughtered Sikhs and Hindus, not a passenger still alive, start arriving in their village from Muslim Pakistan, they hastily cremate and bury the remains, then retire to the temple in shock.  When their own Muslim friends from the village are forcibly evacuated to Pakistan on ten minutes notice, the villagers know that the fabric of their lives is changed forever.<br /><br />With the immediacy of an on-the-spot observer to these events of 1947 and the passion of a sensitive writer impelled to tell a story, Singh mourns the seemingly permanent loss of compassion and tolerance which accompanied the separation of the Indian subcontinent into Hindu/Sikh India and Muslim Pakistan.  His novel, written less than ten years after some of the events which are chronicled here, is filled with vibrant and realistic characters sometimes forced to make impossible decisions, characters who reflect the horrors of religious intolerance, which flourished when artificial boundaries were set up to divide India by religions.  The book cries out against the losses of civility, tolerance, and life itself.<br /><br />With his love story of a Sikh dacoit and a Muslim weaver's daughter, told within an elegaic portrait of peaceful village life suddenly altered by religious strife,  Singh draws the reader into the world of Mano Majra and its contrasts.  He peppers the narrative with manipulative and grasping government officials and police, and outside agitators preying on residents' insecurities.  The small world he creates so vividly becomes a microcosm through which the reader gains knowledge of the wider issues.  Most remarkably, Singh holds himself above the ethnic and religious fray, reflecting his equal abhorrence of the Muslim atrocities and the Sikh response, \\"For each Hindu or Sikh they kill, kill two Mussulmans.\\"  Singh, writing this book in 1956, dramatically foreshadows the violence which has continued in this area to the present  day.  He makes us feel the sadness and the permanent loss to all the participants on all sides of  this tragic conflict.

It is a measure of Brink's genius that this compulsively readable novel seems so straightforward, at least at first, when one is deeply engrossed in the twists and turns of the main characters' changing relationship.  Primarily a love story, it chronicles the complex, sometimes masochistic, interaction between Ruben Olivier, a lonely former librarian in his sixties, and Tessa Butler, an attractive free spirit, almost thirty, whom he has taken into his home and who claims to have deep feelings for him.  But while Tessa enlivens his days with her attentions and conversations, she also toys with him, flaunting her numerous relationships with other men at night.  As Tessa settles in, Ruben finds his once-orderly and peaceful world shattered, the memories with which he has consoled himself after his wife's death destroyed, and his view of himself and the world permanently changed.<br /><br />The book is deceptively many-layered, for while Brink is exploring rights and desires in the relationship of Ruben and Tessa, he is also simultaneously exploring rights and desires in a political sense.  In the newly independent South Africa, the formerly oppressed black majority is now in power and asserting itself.  In the confusion of the power transfer, many young men, apparently feeling that \\"might makes right,\\"  have formed marauding gangs, attacking, raping, killing, and essentially doing whatever they desire, their only motivation being revenge for past injustices.  No one is safe, and Ruben and Tessa, who had hitherto ignored the danger even when it struck close to home, find that they are not immune as they face a defining moment of terror.<br /><br />The atmosphere of the novel is dark, the mood of violence is palpable, and a sense of  foreboding lies heavily over all.  The relationship of Ruben and Tessa is unsettling, strange, perhaps even clinically sick, but it is powerfully seductive in a Nabokovian way.  The ghost of a slave,  Antje of Bengal, 300-years-old, walks the house, haunts the inhabitants, and keeps them and the reader constantly on edge.  Throughout the action, Brink's language is so fluid, his first-person narrative so smooth, and his sense of timing so keen that his style achieves an elegance few others could achieve, given the sometimes bizarre subject matter.

Everyone is always trying to find The Book that will help them identify some mystery fish barely glimpsed from a distance and often never seen again.  If I could have only one book to help me find that mystery fish, this would be the one.  Filled with helpful information describing both the families and specific varieties of fish seen in Hawaiian waters, this book has the best collection of photographs of all the books I've found.  Often taken in dramatic close-up, and very artistic in composition, the photographs are all of live fish taken in their natural environments.<br />This can be both a blessing and a (minor) curse for the snorkeler and scuba diver.  Photos which were taken at 30', for example, tend to have a bluish cast, which can distort the color of the fish when they are seen in shallow water of four feet.  In addition, a close-up of the head of a particular eel, for example, does not help the snorkeler enough when s/he sees that eel from above, and it's moving at high speed among the rocks twenty feet below.  The book is terrific, my favorite reference book, in fact, but for the devoted snorkeler determined to identify every fish s/he sees, I'd recommend that the Guide to Hawaiian Reef Fishes by John E. Randall be consulted as backup.	2001-03-19

Hoover's Hawaii's Fishes: A Guide for Sorkelers, Divers, and Aquarists, you will be able to identify virtually any fish you see while snorkeling or diving along Hawaii's reefs and shores.  A scholarly (but user-friendly) collection of photographs and data, this book provides very close side views of virtually all the fishes one is likely to see and detailed descriptions of each.  In order to provide these views, the author uses photos of preserved specimens, all laid on their sides against black or light green backgrounds.  This shows the anatomical details of each fish extremely well and will enable the reader to see real differences between many seemingly similar fishes.  The disadvantage to this approach, however, one which the Hoover book corrects, is that frequently the preserved specimens have lost some of their color and are not nearly as bright as they are in life.  This is an extremely helpful resource book when it is combined with a book which shows these fishes in their natural habitat.  Mary Whipple	2001-03-19

Set in rural Ireland, this uncompromising family drama revolves around Michael Moran, the father of five. A member of the IRA during the time of The Troubles, years ago, Michael has apparently repressed violent traumas which, we are led to believe, are responsible for his withdrawal from society and his current violence against his family--it is not the result of drink or the frustrations of poverty. Now the father of teenage children, he is disillusioned by what he sees as the fruits of this war, remarking, \\"Look at the country now.  Run by a crowd of small-minded gangsters out for their own good.\\"<br /><br />Within his own household, Michael upholds all the values he fought for years ago.  He's a hard, independent man, beholden to no one, and his word is law.  To his family, however, he is often a tyrant--obstinate, cruel, full of hatred, quick to anger, and reluctant to apologize-and his second wife Rose his three daughters, and his two sons are \\"inordinately grateful for the slightest good will.\\"  Outwardly religious, Michael daily recites the Rosary, looking for religious help for his inner turmoil and the complications of his daily life.  As he says, \\"the war was the best part of our lives.  Things were never so simple and clear again.\\"<br /><br />With a main character who is never endearing, McGahern challenges the reader to empathize with Michael and understand why the women in his family remain tied to him emotionally, even after they have successfully escaped his domination and established independent lives away from the farm.  Gradually, the reader begins to understand the overpowering need to form connections with the past, even when it is not pleasant--to forgive one's parents for their limitations while remaining strong and faithful to oneself.  In clear, straightforward prose of immense power, McGahern piles mundane detail upon detail, creating a sensitive family story of great universality, one which will give the reader much to ponder.

In naming his novel Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth, Nobel Prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz signals his belief that Akhenaten's views of religion, the same views that led Akhenaten to be called  the \\"heretic pharoah,\\" show him to be more a man of our times than a man of his own times.  Akhenaten, formerly Amenhotep IV, changed his name to reflect his belief that Aten, the sun god, was more powerful than Amen (Amun), the traditional god of the Egyptians, the god served by a huge and powerful class of priests and recognized as the Most High by the large Egyptian population.  Following a mystical revelation, however, he also came to believe that there was a god even higher than Aten--One God, the Sole Creator, who was a god of love, forgiveness, and peace.  In this respect, Akhenaten became a pharoah whose beliefs made him seem almost \\"like one of us.\\"<br /><br />When Akhenaten eventually prohibited the worship of any god other than the One God, he showed himself to be a zealot more interested in promoting his religious views than in ruling his large and diverse country, more a priest than a pharoah.  Whether he was right or not became less important historically than the chaos his views created--the people became fragmented, the priests became infuriated at their sudden loss of political and social power, the enemies of the country saw their opportunity to attack, and the foundation of law and order crumbled in the ensuing cataclysm.<br /><br />Mahfouz examines Akhenaten's life from the points of view of more than a dozen of his contemporaries, including the High Priest of the new religion, the High Priest of the old religion, Akhenaten's wife Nefertiti, his teacher and counselor, his chief of security, and his doctor, among others.  Each gives a fresh view of who Akhenaten was, what he believed, and what his legacy might have been.  Mahfouz offers a fascinating, cautionary story of what happens when the ruler of a large and diverse country uses his position of power to impose new religious thought on a highly developed and traditional culture.

Colm Toibin cuts straight to the heart in this sensitive novel of an independent daughter, long estranged from her overly controlling mother, and their attempt to reach some sort of understanding and level of communication.  Daughter Helen and mother Lily are drawn to the neutral ground of Helen's grandmother's house in rural Ireland when Helen's brother Declan is gravely ill with AIDS and wants to return to the strand for a last look at the sea.  Toibin is both straightforward and graphic in describing Declan's declining health and completely open in describing the romantic relationships of Paul and Larry, Declan's two gay friends who are also attending him at the cottage in Cush.  But the focus of the story remains squarely on Helen and Lily and their long estrangement, so intense that Lily was never invited to attend Helen's wedding and, after seven years, still has not seen her grandchildren.  In the crucible of Declan's sick room, those attending him are painfully aware of  the tenuousness of life, and as they reach out to him with love, they share many of their innermost feelings and the stories that have shaped their lives.<br /><br />In prose that is so simple and so controlled one wonders how it can possibly carry the weight of these emotion packed scenes, Toibin empathizes with Helen, a daughter whose mother failed to meet her emotional needs when she was a child, and then tried to overpower and control her when she became strong enough to stand on her own.  At the same time, he explores Lily's competing needs and the limitations imposed on her by her husband's early death and her need to support her family both financially and physically.<br /><br />The obvious symbolism of the lightship, the wave-washed strand, and the eroding headland on which the grandmother's cottage perches adds weight and universality to the crises facing the participants in this intense and poignant domestic drama.  The involved reader will come away with new understandings of the need for connection, the essence of compassion, and the full meaning of love as the characters in this thematically complete novel find their resolutions.

In this simply written tale of the golf woes of J.B., Charlie King gives us a largely self-taught golfer whose handicap has remained the same for more than ten years.  Although his frustration has recently increased, he has been reluctant to take lessons from a pro, having previously had a bad experience with one who tried to change too many things too fast and \\"ruined his game.\\"  Now, ready to give up the game completely, he finally finds the perfect teacher--and the reader is able to go along and share his lessons and, presumably, apply some of the same helpful principles to his or her own game.<br /><br />If you have ever had someone tell you that \\"you lifted your head\\" when you've stubbed the ball and/or left all your weight on your back foot and failed to follow through, this is the book for you. Harry Wilkinson, the pro in this book, says he has videotaped hundreds of golfers, and not one of them has actually lifted his head at the time the club face contacts the ball. It is other parts of the swing (sometimes a \\"reverse pivot,\\" for example) that need to be corrected--and when they are, you'll never have to think about your head again.<br /><br />With relatively simple explanations and a few (unfortunately, too few!) drawings to illustrate the basic principles of driving, pitching, chipping, and putting, King aims to correct the many misconceptions about how the golf swing works, reducing it to its most basic elements and explaining why mistakes occur and how to correct them.  He addresses the everyday concerns of the weekend golfer and provides the important learning tools which can make a good golf swing more accessible and help lessons to \\"take.\\"  Whether you are a 35-handicap beginner reading about the golf swing for the first time or a 3-handicap expert who just needs a tune-up, you'll find much to enjoy--and apply--in this short book.

Eight people and one strange, disembodied spirit give dramatic, first person stories here, in nine different locales, ranging from Okinawa to Mongolia and New York.  Each chapter is as compressed and carefully drawn as a short story, and the author gives a virtuoso performance in finding an appropriate, and different, narrative voice for each individual character--from the tough art thief in Petersburg, to the romantic lover in Tokyo, the savagely abused young woman in China, the disillusioned scientist in Ireland, and the manic night-time talk show host in New York.<br /><br />As good as these individual chapters are, and as good as the writing is within each chapter, however, the feeling persists that the author is almost auditioning--showing all the wonderful talents he has (and they are many) and all the diverse writing styles he can employ.  Ultimately, the book remained for me a collection of interrelated short stories.  They did not come together into a coherent novel.<br /><br />Some obvious overlaps of people and events occur among the chapters, along with many subtle overlaps of theme, reflecting the author's concern with free will vs. control, love and connection vs. alienation and isolation, and the planned vs. the random.  But these overlaps serve to whet the reader's appetite for a big conclusion that will tie together all the many characters and the world-wide events in some significant way, and they understandably lead the reader to expect some comprehensive resolution, thematically.  With the entire world as his scope and some of literature's biggest themes as a focus, this book ended, not with a bang but a whimper.  Mary Whipple	2001-03-14

This is a strange and fractured narrative of the strange and fractured lives of identical twins separated at birth.  When their mother dies of a brain tumor at the time of the girls' birth, their father, Berts, decides he can take care of only one of them.  Naming her Maria, he quickly donates the other one, Marie (renamed Rose), for adoption.  Maria stays with Berts in Dublin, while Rose  moves around the world as the adopted daughter of a British doctor and his wife.<br /><br />Both girls have big problems. Maria, from her earliest years, is always asking, \\"What are you like?\\" and looking into mirrors.  Sometimes violent in arguments, she sleeps around, gets stoned, attempts suicide, and suffers a nervous breakdown.  She believes she \\"does not have a talent for life.\\"  Rose is a sadist who taunts the foster children her parents take in, goading one boy into throwing a kitten through a window and later trying to drown him.  She believes there is \\"a hole in her head, a hole in her life.\\"  Perhaps it is that hole she is trying to fill when she goes on her shoplifting expeditions.  Neither girl seems to have profited in any way from \\"nurture\\"--only nature counts here, and finding your  twin, even when you don't know you are a twin, is so compelling an urge that it overwhelms any attempt to live a normal life.<br /><br />With her very staccato style of short sentences, most having the subject at the beginning, Enright machine-guns her story at the reader.  Her in-the-face style is emphatic and unrelenting as her narrative jumps from 1965 to 1985 to 1971, etc., from Dublin to New York to London, and from Maria to Rose and, eventually, to Anna, their mother.  The story is sometimes difficult to follow, as the connections which explain some of the episodes do not occur until later in the book.  Tellingly, Enright has to rely on several extreme coincidences to bring the strands of her story together and achieve some sort of resolution.  The plot, such as it is, strains credulity, and if you don't agree with her thesis regarding the inborn compulsion of twins to find each other, even when they don't know they are twins, you will find this book difficult to accept.

In this beautifully realized and complex book, Banville blurs the edges between a man's interior and exterior worlds.  He draws the reader in at the same time that he holds him at arm's length and creates a book both realistic and surrealistic.  In many ways this resembles a memoir more than a novel, and it's a haunting story of a man's search for himself.<br /><br />Virtually all the \\"action\\" in this novel takes place inside the head of Alexander Cleave, and the \\"story,\\" such as it is, emerges at a snail's pace.  An actor who has \\"dried\\" onstage, Cleave has escaped to his childhood home to come to terms with his inner self and try to deal with his worry about his disturbed daughter Cass, with whom he has had no communication for months.  In the midst of a breakdown, he cannot tell the difference between fantasy and reality, acting and action.  He sees ghosts, spend a great deal of time sleeping and dreaming, and shadows townspeople at random, living their lives vicariously.<br /><br />His alterego is Quirke, the sloppy caretaker, and his equally untidy daughter Lily.  Creatures of the moment, the Quirkes are not at all introspective, indulging their basic desires without thinking about them and living entirely in the commonplace, the ordinary--they buy groceries, do superficial cleaning, go to the pub, read magazines.  Only Lily's melancholy, which Cleave also associates with his daughter, suggests that she may have a nascent inner life.<br /><br />If this sounds dull and abstract, it is, in a way.  There is very little plot in the traditional sense, and the events that do occur are filtered through the mind of Cleave, who, though very self-conscious, is not self-aware.  We do eventually find out what's happened to his daughter, we understand why the Quirkes are important, and we eventually see Cleave achieving an epiphany of sorts.  But it is a measure of Cleave's remoteness that the turning point of the book is not an event over which he exerts any control, but a solar eclipse--the convergence of dark and light, shadow and substance, distance and connection.  Still, this is a book  full of unique insights and transcendent observations, with a main character who, in his earnest attempts to come to terms with the world, bears much in common with us all.

If you've never seen Out of Africa or read any book about Kenya, this novel will give you a cursory overview of Kenyan history from 1919 to the present. It is easy to follow, its characters are uncomplicated, and it certainly never lacks for plot.<br /><br />Using simple words and very short sentences, Wood presents the interconnected stories of three generations of two families--the African family of a shamba-living, fig-tree worshipping witch doctor and the veddy British Treverton family of aristocrats who have come to Kenya, taken over their land, and, not surprisingly, torn down the sacred fig tree to build a polo field.  The British, as exemplified by Lord Treverton, are so arrogant and insensitive in the course of their decades of power, that the local population forms the guerilla Mau Mau secret society, committing all manner of murder and mayhem indiscriminately against both the British and those Kenyans who reject Mau Mau-style violence.<br /><br />Eventually, of course, the Kenyans win their independence, but not before the reader is confronted with a series of other overtly dramatic and/or sentimental plot elements:  a witch doctor putting a curse on the Treverton family, a wife steadfastly rejecting her husband's sexual advances from the beginning of her marriage, two mothers pretending for years that their own children do not exist, a lover hidden successfully for months in the garden, two passionate interracial affairs between \\"good\\" characters, a long-unsolved double murder, several suicides, secret betrayals, rapes, imprisonments,  numerous love affairs both serious and casual, a gay relationship,  and even the belief of a contemporary female doctor, who has straight hair and  \\"creamy skin,\\" that she is half Kikuyu.  For good measure, there are also a couple of graphic sex scenes and a series of genital mutilations.  The book is so unabashedly sensational and romantic that this reader found herself wishing the Mau Mau had been more successful.  Mary Whipple	2001-03-02

Brocker's purpose in writing this book was to memorialize the people who \\"lived, died, and were for the most part forgotten on a little parcel of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\\"  And such honor he bestows!  The Hansen's disease (leprosy) which afflicted these people was a terrible, disfiguring, and ultimately fatal disease brought to Hawaii by immigrants, but the steps taken to eradicate its spread by isolating the victims must have been at least as devastating to the family-oriented Hawaiians as the disease itself.<br /><br />It is difficult even to imagine a life and death worse than that which awaited the lepers in the Kalaupapa  colony.  Yet their lives surely would have been worse, had  it not been for the efforts of Father Damien, the Belgian priest who himself fell victim to the disease sixteen years after he began his work in the colony.  Historic photographs of Father Damien and his aides bring them to life and honor their efforts.  Brocker's descriptions and photographs of the inhospitable, barren, and windswept peninsula of Kalaupapa itself (chosen because it was so isolated and so unsuited to any other kind of settlement), make real the magnitude of Father Damien's efforts.  There were no trees, no grass, no fishing places--just wind, dampness, and pounding surf.  Most haunting are his photographs and stories of the poor souls who were wrested from their families and sent to Kalaupapa to die apart from them.<br /><br />Of these, the most affecting of all, of course, are the children's pictures.  Photographs of very young girls, sitting primly in rows, as if they were posing for a 3rd grade school picture, little boys sitting on the ground, as if waiting for a picnic, and the one I can't forget, that of a group sitting on the porch outside the boys' home, with a \\"small boy, who is hardly taller than the benches on which the others sit.\\"  Perhaps he was tiny Beka, aged four, from Maui, who, according to records, was sent all alone to live the remaining three years of his life and to die in a harsh and foreign place without any of his loved ones around.  With his photographs and text, Brocker does great honor to the lives of all these unfortunate souls.

Alexander MacDonald, the narrator of this warm and ennobling family saga, comments to his brother that  \\"Talking about history is not like living it...Some people have more choice than others.\\"  And there, in a nutshell, is the essence of this tender generational novel.  The MacDonalds are, in many ways, an \\"ordinary\\" family on Cape Breton, but MacLeod creates a history for them so alive that the reader experiences it, too, feeling their sorrow and joy, admiring their pluck and independence, and celebrating their loyalty and bravery as they make the hard choices their lives require.  They become heroes to us not because they have performed unusual feats but because they have achieved nobility within the collective memory of their own family.<br /><br />Alexander MacDonald, the speaker, no longer lives on Cape Breton.  An orthodontist, he travels weekly to Toronto to visit his alcoholic brother Calum, named  for the family patriarch who came to the island in 1779 from Scotland.  As he travels back and forth and reminisces, sometimes in Gaelic, with his much less fortunate brother, many generations of MacDonalds come to life, and we see how these forbears have shaped the two brothers and influenced their different, but shared, destinies.<br /><br />MacLeod is very lyrical.  Like a musician, he repeats certain themes.  Gaelic phrases echo throughout, almost like a refrain.  First names continue in different generations to remind the reader of historical resemblances and differences.  And always, in every generation, he celebrates the dominance of the original Calum MacDonald and of Cape Breton in shaping their lives.  MacLeod never stoops to sentimentality, however.  His main characters are all macho males living macho lives, and he includes no romantic love story to soften the harshness of life.  Still, he has created one of the warmest, most loving, and enduring family stories anyone will ever find.  The book pulses with heart, and it's wonderful!  Mary Whipple	2001-02-23

In this inventive and unconventional narrative, Barnes turns the old fiction-writing maxim, \\"Don't tell about something, recreate it,\\" on its head, choosing not to recreate anything at all.  Instead, his three main characters address the reader in soliloquies, each telling his version of events that have happened in the past and leaving it up to the reader to decide what really happened.<br /><br />Stuart, stodgy and predictable, was briefly married to Gillian before dashing Oliver stole her away.  Ten years have passed, Stuart has remarried, divorced, become financially successful in the U.S., and returned to England.  Oliver and Gillian are still married, the parents of two daughters.  As their lives once again intertwine, many of the old tensions revive, along with some new tensions, the result of the characters' changes in ten years.<br /><br />Barnes's characters are vivid, and their speeches to the audience are both dramatic and real.  One can easily see how the various characters would interpret events differently, and that aspect of the book is fun to read.  There are numerous disadvantages to Barnes's approach, however.  The characters are independent of the reader, isolated not only from the reader but from each other, and they feel like actors on a stage.who have not invited anyone in to share their lives.  The reader's role becomes that of an observer or a judge, deciding not only what happened but what will happen in the future.

This is a real treat to read, with a wonderfully appropriate grand finale which depends on surprise! A unique and suspenseful twist on the traditional murder mystery, this novel is based on the real-life character of Lord Lucan, who in 1974 killed his children's nanny by mistake instead of killing his wife. Though he vanished and has never been found, many have suspected that he has been housed and hidden over the years by a series of aristocratic friends.<br /><br />In this satiric approach to the true-crime genre, Spark gives us wacky, off-the-wall characters--including two men who claim to be the \\"real\\" Lord Lucan. Adding to the dramatic mix are variety of aristocratic \\"aiders and abettors\\" who have protected and financially supported Lucan for twenty-five years, a psychiatrist who was once a phony stigmatic but who is now treating both \\"Lord Lucans,\\" and several former acquaintances who now want Lucan caught, not because they believe that murder is wrong, but because times have changed--\\"Lucky Lucan failed to show up [for questioning], which was really lowering our standards....he was a very great bore.\\"<br /><br />Satiric and mordantly critical of aristocratic pretension, this is vintage Spark. Her plotting is tight, with no loose ends and no digressions, and her selection of details is exquisitely careful and controlled. Her themes and motifs, especially those of blood as it relates to both crime and breeding, are so intricately connected to all the characters and the plot, that it is difficult to discuss them without giving away the clever plot twists. And Spark does all this in less than two hundred pages. It is impossible not to read this at a gallop to find out what happens--while smiling the whole time at Spark's wry wit.

During days that he is not hunting, however, he stays with the Armstrong family, dysfunctional since the disappearance of the father, Jarrah Armstrong, and we see some niggling traces of humanity as M begins to respond to the two wonderful, resilient Armstrong children, desperately in need of his help.<br /><br />In other \\"quest fiction,\\" such as Faulkner's The Bear, we can distinguish between hunter and prey and gain some enlightenment about the role of man in the universe by observing the hunter's respect for his prey as it grows during the duration of the hunt. Here, however, the edges are blurred. Our view of whether M or the thylacine is really the hunter changes, as does our understanding of which is the more ruthless, and which, if either, triumphs during the hunt. Though the prose is brutally compelling and the sense of drama very high, the message here feels like a message, and it is very grim. This reader wished that it were the M's of this world who were extinct.  Mary Whipple	2001-02-07

Author DeWitt expresses her admiration, at one point, for \\"the type of person who thinks boredom a fate worse than death.\\"  And she obviously writes for this type of reader as she performs amazing literary and scholarly acrobatics in this unique and energetic novel which never flags--and certainly never bores!  Although DeWitt incorporates many esoteric subjects here--Japanese language, Greek verbs, Icelandic verse, Fourier's analysis, Arabic, astrophysics, and tournament chess, bridge, and piquet, among other things--she does this so entertainingly that they enhance, rather than obscure, the human story at the heart of the novel, even for readers like me with little interest in many of these subjects.<br /><br />Sybilla is the hard-working, single mother of Ludo, a 6-year-old genius who gobbles up even the most complicated subjects, seemingly overnight.  Despite his precocity, however, Ludo is a very engaging and in many ways, typical, child, and the relationship between mother and son is mutually warm, respectful, and endearingly protective.  Both Sybilla and Ludo are fans of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, and this forms the framework of the novel when Ludo decides to test seven fascinating and brilliant men Sybilla has known to see which, if any, of them might be his unknown father.<br /><br />This book has everything.  It is funny and sad and disarming and challenging--simultaneously amusing and poignant, and thought-provoking.  The many layers which emerge as Ludo engages in his quest should keep readers, critics, and book clubs intrigued and entertained for years.  But the book is at heart an absorbing human story--of identity, of aspirations and achievement, and, ultimately, of the love and connection which makes our personal journeys worthwhile.  A wonder-filled achievement from beginning to totally satisfying end.  Mary Whipple	2001-02-03

This is a \\"western\\" which gallops to life, and the reader feels the grit, smells the dust, and agonizes with desperate characters as they are tossed every which way, not by their own deliberate decisions so much as by the unpredictability of their Australian frontier existence.<br /><br />Ned Kelly, the Jesse James of Australia, becomes human here, not a monstrous blackguard so much as a man who is forced to make impossible choices.  In this tale, which purports to be the hand-written autobiography he wants to leave for his baby daughter, we follow his childhood in poverty, his reluctant \\"apprenticeship\\" to the villainous Harry Powers, his cruel imprisonment by corrupt authorities, and his attempts to stay out of trouble upon his release.  The judicial system's attack on his mother, however, becomes the catalyst for Ned's life in crime, a life which the reader understands could have been completely different, had authorities simply shown more compassion.<br /><br />Carey is masterful in using small details to show contrasts and to make the big picture come alive.  A new pair of soft boots achieves almost mystical significance--the ecstasy of their acquisition contrasting with the strength achieved through their sacrifice.  \\"Fresh bread and jam...barley and mutton soup,\\" served to Ned in jail, provide poignant contrast to the poorer, leaner fare on the farm.  And a red silk dress becomes a symbol for corruption in one context and love in another.<br /><br />This is a vigorous, exuberant, and uncompromising vision of wilderness life and death.  It is the sensitive portrayal of a young man forced to make impossible decisions to save and protect his family.  And it is a passionate love story told with a warmth and sympathy that is all the more poignant for its contrast with the murder and death which accompany it.  Satisfying and rewarding on all levels.  Mary Whipple	2001-02-02

Gilbert deftly captures Maine's wry, Down East humor and its flat, deadpan delivery in this seriocomic tale of lobstering and survival on twin islands, twenty miles off the Maine coast.  Independent, cussed, and fiercely loyal to their own islands, the inhabitants are virtually a law unto themselves as they compete for the lobster market, the only commercial venue open to them.<br /><br />In a deceptively simple style and the dry, straight talk of a native telling a tale which may or may not be a \\"tall one,\\" Gilbert introduces Ruth Thomas, the feisty product of a rare interisland marriage.  We come to know her relatives, the friends with whom she shares her challenging and sometimes monotonous life, and we watch her grow up and deal with the problems, conflicts, frustrations, and ultimate satisfactions of her isolation on the island.  As the one person who really has access to the rival \\"players\\" on both islands, Ruth is also a reluctant beacon of hope for the future of the islands.<br /><br />Gilbert's warm tale of this hard life perfectly captures the cadences and rhythms of the \\"down Maine\\" speaker.  Her characters sound and act real--though not one of the says \\"ayuh\\" even once!  Her story of the sternmen shows them to be stern, hard men, but the story has heart, and \\"it's a good'un.\\"  Mary Whipple	2001-02-02

The Feast of Love is a little like a multi-course meal, with a tongue-in-cheek appetizer to get you going immediately;  some light, amusing scenes to work up your appetite for the main course;  some real meat to the themes and major conflicts, which provide nourishment for the soul;  and a sweet conclusion to make you satisfied and happy.  I loved it.<br /><br />Baxter begins his novel as a character within the story, an insomniac writer named Charlie, who is walking late at night when he meets Bradley, another insomniac, on a park bench.  When Bradley tells him how he should title his book, comments on a proposed opening sentence, and suggests the subject,  \\"Charlie,\\" amusingly, follows his advice.  As we learn of Bradley's love troubles, along with those of a wide variety of other characters of different ages and backgrounds, we gain clear insight into their personalities and motivations.  Ultimately, we know not only who they are but what love is, not only for them but for ourselves--love in its most universal definitions and dimensions.<br /><br />Baxter wears his significant literary talents lightly, presenting scenes that often perplex their participants while the reader looks on with ironic, sometimes amused, detachment.  But the reader empathizes with the characters at the same time that s/he observes them.  Chloe,a young, punkish teenager who loves Oscar, a skinny former junkie, is a particularly memorable character--so finely and sympathetically drawn that many parents (and other fogies) may see teenage romance in an entirely new way.  An elderly couple longing for their son, who has disappeared, shows the depths of parental love and provides a perfect, complete foil to Chloe and Oscar.  Bradley and his wives, along with the lovers for whom they leave him, further illuminate the complexities of love and relationships, a reason some have described this book as a modern retelling of  A Midsummer Night's Dream.<br /><br /> Though some reviewers have called this novel \\"hilarious,\\" that term suggests a frivolity and superficiality that do not exist here.  Instead, I found the book poignant, sometimes sad, and very moving--a view of love which communicates directly with the reader's heart.  Wonderful!

Like small pieces of glass rotating and reflecting new patterns, Zelitch's story of the Holocaust, Zionism, and the founding of Israel appears in fragments and rotates upon itself.  Scenes move back and forth in time, between characters, between Hungary and Israel, and between first and third person narratives. The reader must work hard here to connect these fragments and to see how all the characters relate to each other, but gradually, the fragments evolve into a whole picture with a depth, scope, and historical grounding that are rare in fiction.<br /><br />Ostensibly, this is the intriguing story of Louisa, a young German Aryan who marries Gabor, a Hungarian Jew, as World War II is breaking out.  But it is equally the story of her feisty mother-in-law Nora, the primary speaker of the narrative, who decides to emigrate to Israel in 1949.  The reader learns of the problems each woman has faced in Hungary during the Holocaust, her family history, her involvement in intellectual and cultural life, and her personal relationships.  It is a book of enormous, epic reach.<br /><br />One of the difficulties of developing a story like this in fragments, however, is that the reader is often so busy connecting ideas that s/he remains somewhat distanced from the characters, being forced to accumulate information about them, rather than partipating in the action with them.  The characters become players on a stage, in a drama which is not completed until the end of the book.  Despite substantial background information, I never felt that I really knew Louisa and Nora or \\"got inside\\" their heads enough to be able to understand them or predict how they would behave.  Their motivations are often unclear because the fragment of the story which explains motivation appears later in the book.  The deliberate parallels between Louisa and Nora and the Biblical story of Ruth and Naomi give depth and scope to their relationship, but they do not fully explain it.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found this novel thoughtful, enlightening, and even important, but it didn't capture my heart.  Its unique approach to the Holocaust story, its slice-of-life pictures of early Israel, its themes, and its \\"big picture,\\" while truly admirable, do not generate a great deal of warmth or lead to complete characters which linger long in the reader's memory--at least, this reader's.

The sad, inexorable decline of a tiny, remote village of the Dingle Peninsula on the southern tip of Ireland is the framework for this affecting and engrossing Booker Award nominee. Setting his novel in one of the most inhospitable places on earth for farming, with its almost bare, rocky outcroppings, a thin cover of grass, and slopes more easily negotiated by mountain goats than men, O'Doherty presents tough villagers coping with the most basic problems of life, death, and survival.  Father McGreevy, the local priest to a congregation of fewer than twenty people, is being deposed as part of an investigation into the deaths of all five wives and one of the men in the village during a particularly harsh winter, which completely isolated the village from the town.  Long-standing conflicts between village and town are obvious.<br /><br />In fluid, almost lyrical, prose O'Doherty creates characters the reader cares about, while showing their limitations and \\"blemishes,\\" as they deal with the conflicts.  The suspense becomes almost palpable as details of the harsh winter are revealed, and rumors spreading throughout the town stretch the patience of the villagers to the breaking point.  As events spiral to their inevitable conclusion, the reader becomes trapped in the same whirlwind that sweeps up the practical villagers and experiences their same sense of desolation and loss.  This is a sensitive portrayal of the harshest of lives, and at the conclusion the reader is uncertain whether any single event could have changed the outcome.  Mary Whipple	2001-01-08

Like his superheroes, author Michael Chabon has pulled off an amazing feat of his own, challenging the dark forces of intolerance and elevating and empowering the little man in this terrific novel. Set in the late '30's and early '40's, the novel follows Joe Kavalier, a young Jewish refugee from Czechoslovakia, and his cousin Sam Clay, creators of superheroes and producers of comic books which attack the Nazis and inspire those who oppose them.  As the reader learns about the comic book industry and the sociological conditions which made comics so popular, s/he also experiences the cousins' personal frustrations as they work to gain freedom for Joe's family, deal with industry &quot;moneymen&quot; who take advantage of them, and search for enduring love.<br /> No brief summary of the action,  however, can begin to convey the depth and scope of this imaginative and original novel.  Chabon manages never to lose sight of the Nazi menace while putting it into completely new contexts, including magic, superheroes, Houdini-like escapes, golems, and comic book characters, and ranging from Prague to New York and Antarctica.  It is a novel of huge scope--and it is hugely entertaining!  One of the best novels of the year, it should certainly be a candidate for a major literary award.	2001-01-07

If you love books which transport you to another world (in this case, at least two different worlds in two different time periods), which give you fascinating insights into other cultures, which incorporate a good deal of history into an exciting and completely developed story line, and which introduce you to a main character so charming and intelligent that you hate to have her disappear at the end of the novel, you will be thoroughly captivated by Map of Love.<br /><br />Anna Winterbourne, an aristocratic young widow from England, travels to Egypt in the late 19th century during the height of British imperialism.  She observes (and resents) the condescending behavior of her countrymen towards the Egyptians and is intelligently critical of British military \\"adventures\\" there and in other Arab states such as the Sudan, South Africa, and Palestine.  As she comes to know the Egyptian people and falls in love with an Egyptian, the reader--along with Anna's granddaughter and great-granddaughter, who are reading the letters and diaries which reveal her story--learns  much about the historical betrayals which have so complicated presentday relations between western and Arab countries.<br /><br />Like most romances, this one requires you to accept a very high level of coincidence, but that is more than offset by  fine descriptive writing, fully drawn characters, and the placing of a great many very recent Middle Eastern events into their Arab contexts.  It is not surprising that this very well written book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.  What is surprising is that this Egyptian author is so successful in presenting events from an Arab point of view to a western audience--a view that is culturally honest without being polemical.

Melvyn Bragg's The Soldier's Return is the memorable and poignant story of Sam Richardson, a young man from rural England who has fought in the Burma campaign in World War II and who then returns home to a world totally different from the world he has left--everyone and everything has changed.<br /><br />Sam has seen such atrocity that he is now harder and less willing to show a soft side.  His son Joe, now five, doesn't know him.  His wife has been successful working two modest jobs and does not want to give them up.  Sam has been exposed to the outside world, a world which has shown him how limited his future is in the socially inflexible world of Wigton, while his wife Ellen, in contrast, has been supported by the friendships, traditions, and familiarity of this community, where she knows everyone.<br /><br />The tensions within the family and within individual characters grow and boil over, as stiff-upper-lip-ishness comes into conflict with the human need to communicate and share, creating real drama and intensity. Bragg's written dialogue is completely natural, and his descriptions and his narrative style are simple, as is his choice of vocabulary.  The reader will have no trouble following the various threads of the story while learning much about Cumbria, post-World War II social upheavals, and the kinds of personal problems that may have been typical for many other young soldiers.

There have been a number of dramatic, descent-into-madness books in the past few years (McCabe's The Butcher Boy and Murr's The Boy, among them), but Losing Nelson is so much more sophisticated and so much broader in scope that I hope it will not be categorized with these other, more limited (though still fascinating!) books.  It is a truly a remarkable novel, with a character so complete that one remembers him for much more than his obsession with Nelson and his descent into madness.<br /><br />Charles Cleasby, highly intelligent and very reclusive, believes that he and Adm. Nelson are the same person-- that he is, in fact, the dark side of Nelson.  At the outset of the novel, Cleasby is trying to reconcile his abiding belief in Nelson's heroism with Nelson's behavior in 1798,  when he aided the Bourbon rulers in Naples against the French and directly contributed to the outbreak of a civil war in Naples.  Strong evidence suggests that Nelson has betrayed a truce and that he bears responsibility for the hangings of hundreds of Neapolitans.<br /><br />Unsworth so thoroughly incorporates the life of Nelson with the life of Cleasby that we feel Cleasby's confusion about his alter-ego Nelson and  sympathize with his moral quandary about the Naples executions.  The historical detail throughout is both fascinating and pertinent in showing parallels between the characters and in highlighting their differences. The movement of the narrative back and forth in time and location is seamless.  Ultimately,  Unsworth raises the larger questions of what constitutes a hero and why a nation even needs heroes, elevating this book to a significance of scope and universality that few novels ever achieve.  This novel is utterly fascinating-- my favorite Unsworth novel to date.  Mary Whipple	2000-12-13

Beth and Jake Heke and their six children, along with numerous other Maori families, live in an urban ghetto of  government-supported housing, isolated from the rest of society and isolated, too, from their old culture, which once gave pride and a sense of identity to Maori families.  As the Hekes deal with poverty, drugs, alcoholism, unemployment, gang warfare, rape, incest, physical and mental abuse, suicide, and a host of other horrific family problems, the reader vicariously experiences their bleak and hopeless lives.<br /><br />Duff, part Maori himself, does not mince words here, recreating in bold, often raw, language the violence of their lives.  Pathetically, and most affecting to the reader, the children, forced to \\"grow up early,\\" accept these horrors as \\"normal\\" and try to survive any way they can, seeking even a small ray of hope for the future. Some do not succeed.  This look at almost unbearable human misery leaves the reader disturbed and angry-as the author, no doubt, intended-and grateful for the ray of hope that finally emerges at the end.  The book may be fiction, but it's a seething indictment of a real society.  Mary Whipple	2000-11-28

A critic quoted on the book jacket claims that The Debt to Pleasure \\"has no flaws.\\"  That may or may not be true, but the critic's obvious enthusiasm for the book certainly matches my own!  It is devilishly entertaining.<br /><br />Tarquin Winot, the speaker, is an artist, a dedicated gourmet, a brilliant and thoughtful philosopher, and an intolerant and arrogant supersnob who shares his lofty opinions with the reader as he travels from Portsmouth to southern France.  In sometimes long-winded sentences, Winot comments on effete subjects, such as the erotics of dislike, the aesthetics of absence, and his disinterest in the idea of interest, while simultaneously creating deliciously sensuous descriptions of the perfect bouillabaise, lamb with apricots, or pike in beurre blanc.<br /><br />Winot is so waspishly nasty, so full of condescension, that I almost abandoned the book as too rarefied to care about. Then the author \\"hooked\\" me with a few details that made me think that Winot might not be all he seemed to be--that he might be far more interesting than anything I had previously suspected.

This book is an act of literary magic--so astonishing in its depth and scope that you will probably never hear music the same way again!  J. D. Landis recreates the extraordinary love story of composer Robert Schumann and pianist/composer Clara Wieck, complete with their letters and details of their relationship.  But the author  also gives poignant context to their intense and oft-thwarted love by revealing the totally encompassing musical, literary, philosophical, and political climate of the day.  Anyone who has ever had any curiosity at all about the Romantic period--even negative curiosity about the sometimes sentimental and uncontrolled passion of the writing and music--will be totally won over here.  The book is amazing.<br /><br />Robert Schumann, one of the most controversial and least understood of composers, had ruined his promising concert career as a pianist by damaging his hand through overpractice and/or the use of a stretching device, an act never forgiven by Friedrich Wieck, Robert's teacher and the father of Clara.  Clara, on the other hand, eight years old when Robert sees her for the first time, is her father's triumph--becoming the most celebrated pianist/composer in Germany and the darling of audiences throughout Europe.  As she approaches maturity, Friedrich will stop at almost nothing to keep Clara from Robert.<br /><br />Landis creates wonderful scenes, not only of Clara and Robert, but also of how the world of young Clara expands to include Paganini, Goethe, Chopin,  Mendelssohn, Kierkegaard, and Hans Christian Andersen (whose cruel treatment by singer Jenny Lind will never by forgotten by the reader).  Scenes showing Robert's veneration of Schubert, Heine, Liszt, von Weber,  Beethoven, the young Wagner, Haydn, and Chopin, among others, are brought fully to life, and are particularly moving when his love for them must survive their often fatal illnesses and early deaths.  The final scenes which reveal the depth of love which both Robert, now institutionalized by his madness, and his devoted Clara feel for Johannes Brahms are perhaps the consummate expressions of romanticism.  Once Landis gets beyond the convoluted prose and long sentences of his first 25 pages, this book becomes a can't-put-it-downer.

Maurice Shadbolt, a New Zealander, has written a stirring novel of the mid-19th century wars there between the indigenous Maori and the British army and colonists who were determined to deprive them of their land and heritage.  In fast-paced prose and thoroughly involving scenes of both warfare and domestic life among the Maori, Shadbolt recreates the tragic and bloody battles which took the lives of thousands of British and countless numbers of outgunned and outmanned Maori.<br /><br />Shadbolt is terrific in recreating scenes in which the war strategies and ensuing battles of the real Maori leader Titokowaru come horrifically to life.  Through the eyes of Kimball Bent, also a real person,  we see the body count rise, feel the privations and hardships of the Maori, understand the ferocity of the British officers, long for the safety of innocent wives and children, and sympathize with the Maori fight for self-preservation.  Bent, an American from Maine, was dragooned by the British and defected both to help the Maori and to wreak his vengeance against sadistic British officers.<br /><br />What seems so strange to me (especially after just completing Potiki by the Maori writer Patricia Grace) is that, except when they are warring,  the Maori here feel like caricatures.  I almost gave up on the book in the first 50 pages or so because it seemed so Monty Pythonesque--Maori wearing black suits and bowler hats, carrying walking sticks, and using British slang and obscenities, all the while muttering wry and sardonic comments on history, religion, and the current state of affairs a la John  Cleese.  While there probably were some Maori who did become acculturated by the British, the satirical attitude with which they are depicted as a group just doesn't seem to jibe with the respect one feels for them in the face of their desperation and the years-long dedication with which they faced their foes in warfare.

I can't recall when I've ever felt so strongly the musical rhythm of an author's style, or the extent to which it changes to suit the tempo of the action and themes.  In the first third of this wonderful book by a very talented writer, conversations between the simple Mary and Granny Tamihana, the guardian of Maori traditions, echo and sound like chants;  between Roimata and Hemi, a happily married couple, they resemble duets with complimentary themes.  The scene in which Mary gives birth is a grand, complex chorus with the several family members singing over, around, and above each other as they fight for the narrative line.  Toko's story of his big fish is a soaring aria which ventures into a mystical realm, for Toko is a seer.  And all this music seems totally appropriate to the lives of these Maori characters living in harmony with the land and their ancestors.<br /><br />The middle third of the book changes, as Hemi, the father of the family, abruptly introduces the harsh notes of reality which occur when \\"the works\\" closes down, and he and his friends find themselves unemployed.  In mournful tones he comments on the loss of tradition, language, and connection to the land which are coming about as education is imposed on their children by outside authorities, and people such as himself accept outside jobs. Their very existence as a group is also threatened by developers who want to buy their land to put up hotels, build seaside parks where visitors can play with the dolphins and whales, and commercialize the lifestyle these Maori have enjoyed all their lives.<br /><br />In the final third of the book, as the Maoris fight for their land, the staccato, simple language is like the harsh beat of a war drum, and the songs disappear from the language, not returning until the rebuilding of the sacred house and the funeral of a key character bring about harmony and poetry once again.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine that Patricia Grace did not deliberately tailor her prose style to her subject matter, yet this seems so completely natural--so totally without artifice--that one wonders if this harmony of words and subject might be the ultimate, triumphant example of the unity of story and life which she so vividly celebrates in this memorable and touching novel.

Rahna Reiko Rizzuto, an exciting, young Hawaiian author, here uses the sordid story of the U.S. internment of Japanese-Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor as the framework of a family saga.  The internment of the Okada family, locked up in horse stalls at the Santa Anita race track, an internment camp, permanently scarred every member of the family.  Being torn from the fabric of society and isolated in pens was an experience so thoroughly degrading that the real people who lived through it have rarely opened themselves to discuss it (and who can blame them?), and the author's telling of the story is especially dramatic because the subject is so rare in fiction.<br /><br />Both masterful and uncompromising,  Rizzuto paints scenes of horror and cruelty within this family, all the result of frustration, a distorted sense of honor, a lack of communication, or a feeling of utter helplessness.  And while few of these scenes actually take place in the internment camp itself, nearly all are the result of the internment experience and illustrate its long-term effects.  There are powerful and affecting scenes of a grandmother's flaying, a young girl's abortion, a mother's heartbreaking abandonment of her three-year-old child, a brother's brutal kicking of his sister, a young soldier's death, and, most affectingly to me, a family's wresting of a child from a woman who has adopted and raised him, and would probably have given him a better chance for a successful life.<br /><br />While these individual scenes will stay with me for a very long time, the book itself really did not come together as a whole for me, however.  The alternating points of view among various members of the family are effective in allowing the reader to see why some characters behave as they do, but the impetus to all of the action and the key to the book as a whole lies in the character of Emi, the daughter of Kaori and mother of Eric and Mari, and she is the one person whose point of view we never see. She is an enigma, and we never really get to know her. As a result,  I'm still not sure \\"Why She Left Us.\\"  Most frustratingly, I'm also not sure whether the \\"She\\" of the title is Emi or the U.S. government.

If this book doesn't win the Booker Prize, then Margaret Atwood will never get to give Thomas Mallon his much-deserved comeuppance for the snide review he wrote of it for the New York Times Book Review.  Because I respect Mallon and have enjoyed more than one of his books, I took this review to heart (fool that I am), wasting several weeks before discovering for myself how much fun I've been missing out on!  Perhaps, however, Mallon was just playing the role of \\"The Blind Assassin\\" when he wrote it.<br /><br />Because of the number of excellent plot summaries already posted here, I'll save the space and not repeat them.  Atwood's female characters here are as complex and intriguing as they are in Cat's Eye.  Her descriptions are so specific that every aspect of the setting comes vibrantly to life, and it is easy to imagine every detail (yes, even the much maligned simile of a loaf of bread as bland-tasting \\"as an angel's buttock\\").<br /><br /> The plot evolves on three distinct, but parallel, planes, giving a triple whammy to Atwood's themes, while several different time frames keep the story full of mystery and excitement.  Best of all,  Atwood brings all the threads of the story together for a truly thrilling, rock 'em, sock 'em grand finale.  If you've been wondering why the odds are so good that Atwood will win the Booker, read the book.  This will certainly NOT be a consolation prize!  Mary Whipple	2000-10-23

This beautiful and idea-filled novel is so daring in its choice of subjects and scenes that one is stunned by its cumulative effect. In what may seem at first to be an unlikely or inappropriate juxtaposition, the author contrasts the horrors of the Holocaust with the pastoral, and seemingly simple life among the Masai in Kenya. This never feels demeaning, insensitive, or inappropriate, however. By developing both these subjects, Cartwright is able to illustrate in unique and imaginative ways the wider universal issue of ethnicity as a factor in the search for justice, love, and a Universal Spirit.<br />On the surface this the story of journalist Tim Curtiz's search for the truth about Claudia Cohn-Casson, a French Jewish researcher of the Masai, who was betrayed to the Nazis when she returned home in the final days of World War II.  Curtiz is planning to write a screenplay for an &quot;Out of Africa&quot;-type film to be shot in Kenya, and in his attempt to understand the &quot;real&quot; Claudia, he interviews both an elderly British ex-patriate, Tom Fairfax, who was Claudia's lover, and the elderly laibon of the Masai community which Claudia studied.  Both men suffered great losses as a result of their contact with Claudia, something with which Tim Curtiz, also suffering a loss, can identify.<br />As the narrative unfolds, it seems intentionally to follow the hypnotic, circular dancing patterns of the Masai as it twists, leaps, and turns back upon itself, while gathering in the details of Claudia's life, the mystery of her disappearance, and the complications in the lives of the subordinate characters.  The elasticity of Cartwright's prose is perfectly suited to this style, as he varies his sentence lengths to control the overall pace and moves from positively lyrical descriptions of the African savannah to turgidly doom-filled passages describing the cattle cars transporting Jews to the camps.<br />Award-winning author Cartwright deserves to have this excellent novel reprinted for U.S.  distribution.  Until that happens, however, interested readers might want to check it out at Amazon's site in the U.K., where it is readily available.  ENDnovel reprinted for U.S.  distribution.

Reminiscent of both Steven King and Patrick McCabe in creating an atmosphere of fear and dread, Naeem Murr creates in The Boy a young man/demon who embodies everyone's worst nightmare--the intelligent and psychologically astute predator.  Having grown up without the nurturing and love which makes us human, The Boy is being sought by Sean Hennessey, a social worker who was his foster father and may, in fact, be his real father.  Both Messianic and consummately evil, The Boy controls the action throughout the novel,  planning when, where, and how to wreak his vengeance against the world.  Mere murder is not satisfying to him--it must be agonizingly slow and degrading.<br /> Intensely dark and humorless, this is a taut and very fast-paced psychological thriller which draws you in because you think you  &quot;understand&quot; this damaged creature.  Murr further increases  reader involvement by giving deep background information about the victims, too.  You know why each victim was chosen and why each was so vulnerable to manipulation by The Boy, and you discover with horror that you, too, could easily be a victim because The Boy &quot;found his form in others, in their memories.&quot;  This novel is so absorbing that one overlooks the very convenient and well-timed coincidences in order to prolong the fun of reading.  The perfect short novel to read all in one sitting!	2000-10-15

This luciously depicted novel is both a vivid evocation of life in eighteenth century Paris and an homage to the least celebrated of our senses-that of smell.  In language so onomatopoetic it must have been an almost insuperable challenge for the translator, Suskind tells the tale of Grenouille (Frog), an orphan on the streets of Paris whose hard life would have destroyed a less single-minded pursuer of the sensuous life.  Grenouille's sense of smell is so subtly attuned that he can distinguish a single, elemental scent among the various aromas and stenches bombarding him.  He can identify individuals from their unique scents, and he is willing to kill to preserve or distill the most glorious of these.  As Grenouille moves from his apprenticeship in a butcher shop (depicted in odoriferous detail) to that of a perfumer, the reader is bombarded with scents so intoxicatingly described that s/he may reach for the nearest atomizer in order to participate personally in the sensuous celebrations.  One of the most gloriously descriptive novels you will ever read, it is also an unforgettable commentary on depravity, unfettered arrogance, and ironically misplaced idealism, which culminates in a final, thunderous scene of exuberant depravity.	2000-09-30

This stimulating and thought-provoking murder mystery provides a unique insight into the waning days of the Nazi occupation of Prague.  A vicious killer is stalking, torturing, and butchering women, and both the Gestapo and the local Prague police are searching for the killer.  Both groups are also concerned with saving themselves, their country's interests, and as many supporters as they can in the confusing days at the end of the war.  The psychological astuteness with which Kohout depicts both the killer and his searchers gives a credibility to this frenetic period rarely seen in fiction.  Though it is, of course, easy to identify with the underdog Prague police, Kohout goes beyond mere surface characterization here to create in Morava a fully rounded character, filled with self-doubt but dreaming of a future. And with remarkable even-handedness, he also creates in Buback a Gestapo agent who is more than a caricature or an unthinking Nazi automaton.  As the killer's actions become increasingly lurid in the frenzy of the final days, the reader recognizes numerous parallels with the Nazis' scorched earth policy and with the behavior of Czech partisans bent on wreaking vengeance.  This insightful, carefully wrought, and fast-paced action novel with its unique glimpses of a turbulent time and place will keep you reading well into the night!	2000-09-29

Although I usually like Ishiguro,  I found this book disappointing, lacking coherence, its purpose muddy.  The first half of the book is suspenseful, tautly constructed, and realistically presented, as we learn of Christopher Banks's history and of the ironies of his parents' disappearance.  Once he arrives in Shanghai, however, the book splits into two seemingly disconnected halves-the first half realistic, the second half absurd.  In the first half, Banks has been revealed as intelligent and sensitive, but in the second half he suddenly and cruelly abandons his own adopted, orphaned daughter, leaving her in England while he searches for his missing parents.  He believes (strangely) that somehow if he can find his parents, he'll be able to avert World War II.  His search for them is expedited more by an inordinate number of extraordinary coincidences than by the detective work for which he is supposedly world-renowned.  The plot stumbles, and the suspense is compromised.<br />Since Ishiguro has dealt in past novels with the idea of imperfect memory and/or with characters whose deluded visions of themselves are presented ironically to the reader as facts, one cannot help wondering, while reading the second half, whether Banks really is a great detective, whether he really is doing all the absurd things he presents to us as real events in Shanghai, and whether the author is deliberately showing him in a surreal, rather than real, world.  If this is the author's intention, it is by no means clear--there are too few clues in the first half to cause the reader to actively question the view of reality presented there. In addition, it is not accompanied in the second half by any heightened sense of introspection or by any change from the realistic tone and style of the first half.  Neither Banks nor the reader learns anything significant on any level other than that of plot.<br />Ultimately, I found myself haunted by the drama of Banks's search and by his need to resolve the mysteries in his life but frustrated-and annoyed--by his ultimate lack of change and by the unresolved mysteries with which the author leaves us.  The author made me feel like a pawn, the victim of literary trickery.e the mysteries in his life but frustrated-and annoyed--by his ultimate lack of change and by the unresolved mysteries with which the author leaves us.

Unlike War and Peace, Confederates spurns all romanticism, employing  instead the dignity of ordinary men and women and the mundane details of  real life to convey the horrors of warfare with a realism perhaps unmatched  in Civil War literature.  With no comic relief, no hints at happy endings,  and no escape from the inevitability of this nightmare, the cumulative  effect of Keneally's novel is staggering.<br />The Confederate army we meet  here consists of ragged and hungry teachers, musicians, small farmers,  orphaned children, men in their 60's, conscripts, and even the sorely ill  and walking wounded, who share  their stories and simple dreams as they  trudge resignedly and painfully across Virginia toward their destiny-the  Battle of Harper's Ferry/Antietam.  Despite the tactical brilliance of  General Tom &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, the battle itself eventuates in  the most horrific blood-letting and soul-wrenching trauma I've ever seen  described.  Homely details, described in a plain, almost offhanded manner,  lend great irony and bring the enormity of the carnage into focus:  split-rail fences with their &quot;crops of dead,&quot;  cornfields with  human remnants &quot;lying in heaps that must be climbed,&quot; young  soldiers forced to tread on &quot;a mat of Christian boys,&quot; and the  very air above the cornfield &quot;flying with bits of the corn crop and  with limbs, naked and clothed, and with haversacks and heads and  hands.&quot;<br />I cannot imagine any Civil War novel which will affect the  reader more profoundly than this one.  Exhaustively researched,  historically accurate, brilliantly depicted, and absolutely unforgettable,  it pulses with the lives of our forebears and makes gratitude seem  inadequate for their sacrifices.	2000-09-08

Katharina Blum's murder of a newspaper reporter, to which she has  confessed on the opening page, is not the point of attack for a mystery  story, despite that implication on the book jacket.  There is too little  suspense and character development to make you care much about her.  Instead, Boll uses the murder and its aftermath to offer a cautionary tale  about overzealous police investigators and  the unfettered tabloid  press--showing how the press descends on Katharina and everyone who has  ever come into contact with her, twisting words, creating false impressions  based upon  police department leaks, casting aspersions, ruining lives, and  inciting Katharina to eventual murder.<br />Sound familiar?  The novel may  have been startling, and even controversial, when it was published in 1974,  but no contemporary reader familiar with the tabloids at the supermarket  checkout or with sensational talk shows conducting outrageously one-sided  investigations will find this depiction of the press even slightly  shocking.  In fact, the methods of the press in this novel seem  unrealistic, not because they are so extreme, but because they are so  obvious, crude, and lacking in subtlety.  Boll may have been prophetic with  this novel in 1974, but it is a product of its own time.  While it may  confirm that the conflict between responsible journalism and irresponsible  sensationalism has a long history, it offers few useful insights for the  present day.	2000-09-08

Straddling  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, The Radetzky March uniquely  combines the color, pomp, pageantry, and military maneuvering of the last  days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the more modern political and  psychological insights of the twentieth century, giving this short book a  panoramic geographical and historical scope with fully rounded characters  you can truly feel for.<br />Atmospheric effects are so rich and details are  so carefully selected that you can hear the clopping of hooves, rattling of  carriage wheels, clang of sabers, and percussion of rifles. Parallels  between the actions of man and actions of Nature, along with seasonal  cycles, bird imagery, and farm activity, permeate the book, grounding it  and connecting the author's view of empire to the reality of the land.  Loyalty, patriotism, and family honor are guiding principles here, even  when these values impel the characters to extreme and sometimes senseless  actions, as seen in a duel.<br />Significantly,  there are no birth scenes  here, only extremely touching scenes of aging and death, adding further  poignancy to the decline and fall of the empire itself.  And just as  Trotta, in the end, has the little canary brought in to him, commenting  that &quot;it will outlive us all,&quot; perhaps this novel, too, will  someday emerge from its obscurity and live as the classic it deserves to  be.	2000-09-07

This completely frank, thought-provoking, and often wryly humorous account  of life in Berlin before the fall of the Wall will go straight to your  heart with its fascinating stories and tales from both sides of the Divided  City.  With poignancy and warmth, the author creates believable characters  who adhere to their own truths, not necessarily the expectations of the  reader.<br /><br />The personable, unnamed speaker in this first person narrative is a  writer trying to create the story of a man \\"caught in a back-and-forth  motion over the Wall, like a soccer goalie in an instant replay, always  taking the same dive to miss the same ball.\\"  Virtually all the  Berliners we meet here--from both East and West--are in the same situation  as the unfortunate goalie, as they, too, go back and forth, repeatedly  mistaking the moves of people from the other \\"side,\\"  misinterpreting signals, and often, in their ignorance, failing to  \\"get it.\\"<br /><br />The author provides an amazingly complete, though  somewhat sanitized, picture of the Wall-jumpers--not those poor souls who  were brutally machine-gunned by Wall guards, but people like the speaker  who come and go across the Wall with relative impunity because they do not  call attention to themselves. And Schneider is quick to point out that most  of the East Berliners are fairly satisfied with their lives, which are  depicted with much warmth, as families and friends spend a great deal of  time with each other, undistracted by the responsibilities of  \\"freedom.\\"<br /><br />The fascinating philosophical discussions and  personal revelations that occur among friends from both sides may sweep  away your preconceptions about life in Berlin, as they did mine, and you  may find yourself reevaluating your thinking about society and politics in  general, and about Germany, in particular.

Few of us, however, have had any equally memorable images  of Berlin in the years immediately after that destruction--until now, with  the arrival of Eduard's Homecoming.  Here author Peter Schneider presents a  compelling story of a young West Berliner who returns from an 8-year  fellowship at Stanford to take a position in a research institution in East  Berlin after the fall of the Wall.  As Eduard resumes his professional  research in Berlin, he must also resolve problems in his marriage and a  bewildering array of financial and legal difficulties with an inherited  apartment building, now full of squatters. Schneider does an absolutely  astonishing job here, developing his story on several levels while creating  laser-sharp images and incisive cultural commentary.  He illuminates the  whole city, from its physical appearance to its social interactions, and he  describes buildings, roads, cafes, apartments, night life, theatre, and  people from all walks of life so vividly you feel, upon completing the  book, that you could easily navigate Berlin without a map.<br /> The book is  witty, humorous, and filled with a sense of the absurd, as Edward finds  himself dealing, often unsuccessfully, with the political, social, and  institutional resentments between &quot;wessis&quot; and &quot;ossis.&quot;  Though they are officially &quot;reunified,&quot; they no longer share the  same goals, expectations, or even history, obviously paralleling some of  the problems in Eduard's marriage.  A book which can be read on many  levels, from marriage to political science, it is successful on all of  them.  Best of all, the comments on society and politics are so lucid you  will find yourself seeing Berlin--and the U.S.--through new eyes.	2000-09-03

While it has all the ingredients for a greatly  exciting read and touches on all aspects of society in the Austro-Hungarian  empire--worlds of the court, the army, journalism, night life, the law,  popular entertainment, and even prostitution--it really doesn't draw you in  or involve you.  There's a curious disconnect between the characters and  the reader, akin in many ways to the disconnect between most of the  characters and each other, perhaps because there are many of them in this  short novel. The visit of the Shah of Persia and his one-night-stand with a  young Viennese woman provide fertile ground for wonderful dialogue and  lyrical descriptions, but the characters are like exhibits in the wax  museum which plays a part in the conclusion of the novel.  In short, this  novel is intriguing primarily for its detailed and exacting recreation of  an historical context, but its large scope and small size act as barriers  to reader involvement.	2000-09-01

Rarely has an author shown in such a delightfully humorous way, the extent to which fantasy, including sexual fantasy, dominates both the conscious  and unconscious life of the main character. On the surface, Mr. Phillips, a  likeable, 50-something accountant, seems very ordinary, predictable, and  restrained.  Beneath the surface, however, he's a tiger, with an energetic  fantasy life that never quits.  From his first semi-conscious moments  before getting out of bed, a time in which he rates his waking-up dreams  from 1 to 10, he shares his innermost longings, repressions, and concerns  with the reader and comes to life in a uniquely amusing way.  The author  does a remarkable job of resisting the temptation to let the humor go over  the top here, preferring, instead, a subtler (and ultimately funnier)  approach--even in the midst of his liveliest daydreams, Mr. Phillips does  not forget that he is an accountant at heart, calculating data, numbers,  percentages, and the odds for his fantasies.  The reader will be charmed by  Mr. Phillips and thoroughly entertained by his offbeat views of the world  and the surprising numbers he dreams up.	2000-08-29

This is a strange animal, neither fish nor fowl.  The book is marketed as  the fictional confession of a real, and seemingly fascinating,  character--writer, painter, swindler, companion of famous Romantic authors,  probable murderer, and criminal transported to Tasmania.  Publishers  highlight the fact that Andrew Motion, the author, is both Poet Laureate of  Great Britain and a professor of creative writing, and words such as  &quot;brilliant,&quot; &quot;memorable,&quot; &quot;engaging,&quot; and  &quot;convincing&quot; attach to the book and appear in reviews.  With  credentials like these, this book should be one of the most vivid and  exciting reading experiences of the year, if not the decade.<br />Unfortunately, this is not the case.  The book is so erudite--so like a  doctoral dissertation--that the reader never gets close to the subject.  The voice of Wainewright, done extremely well in the formal language of the  period, nevertheless keeps him at an unbridgeable distance.  Wainewright  himself never admits his crimes--in fact, does not even recognize them as  crimes--and seems to be solely concerned with his own ends, not  characteristics allowing for reader identification.  Most unfortunately,  footnotes so heavily burden the narrative they constitute almost as many  pages as the novel itself, and they bring any flow the author does create  to a juddering stop.  Appearing at the end of every chapter, rather than at  the end of the book, they act as deadweights throughout.<br />Andrew Motion is  a respected biographer who appears to have chosen to write a novel because  it's the only way he can fill in the gaps in Wainewright's shadowy history,  but he is too much the conscientious scholar to be able to exploit the  privileges which fiction allows him.  We end up, ironically, with a  footnoted, scholarly account of Wainewright, a man who lived almost totally  in the moment.	2000-08-27

On the Black Hill is an elegantly written homage to the inelegant life of  rural Wales, a life in which no one ever strays far from the farm--there  are few opportunities and little motivation to do so. Spartan lives are  enriched by stories and gossip,  slights are never forgotten,  feuds reach  epic intensity, and bottled-up frustrations simmer till they explode.  Through rich and vivid descriptions of the minutiae of daily existence, we  come to know twin brothers Lewis and Ben Jones as they grow up and are  shaped by their family and their small community.  The townspeople become  our own friends or enemies, depending on their behavior towards the twins,  and we empathize with them as they use their limited resources to struggle  with the Big Questions which concern us all--questions of life, love,  spirituality, death, cruelty, justice, and ultimately,  happiness.

The fact that you eventually love the book and  root for the characters' happiness makes him a miracle maker.<br />William  Lloyd is a 44-year-old doctor, whose adolescence is laid bare in the  letters he has written to his family while a teenager at St. Mark's School.  By turns smarmy, arrogant, and devious, he is both subtly and overtly  manipulative, ingratiating himself with whoever is in power, wherever he  is, both as a teenager and as an adult.  Humility and respect for others  are virtues incompatible with his belief in his own moral and social  superiority.  His children are even worse!  When William meets Jeanne Prie,  a hospital worker in France, where he has been sent during World War I, he  finds himself exposed to values and experiences totally foreign to him and  begins the long, tortuous process of self-enlightenment, a road he  negotiates with the enormous difficulties of the self-blind.<br />It is a  testament to the author's vision and immense writing skill that at some  point in the first half of the novel he leads us to the slow realization  that Lloyd is not a uniquely unpleasant man, that he is the aristocratic  product of an age which does not question the morality of social class or  its values and behaviors, and we slowly realize that much of the barbarity  of World War I itself is a direct result of this same societal blindness.  This is more than a brilliant book with an exciting story.  It is a  realistic recreation of people with the values and mores of the age  behaving &quot;normally&quot; under what become extraordinary  circumstances.	2000-08-15

Poking fun at everyone's views of reality, Gilling here  satirizes all levels of Tasmanian society, from the local pamphleteer, who  declares  that if it looks like a seal and acts like a seal that it is a  seal, to the Reverend Kidney, who tries to find a place for it in the  theological chain of being.  And since we readers do not know, for sure,  exactly what the creature is, we become willing and amused participants in  the author's greatest joke of all--on us.<br />In prose that is perfectly  suited to his broad but light-hearted satire, Gilling keeps the reader  constantly entertained with his terse descriptions and ironic detachment.  To the question of what it is like to be kissed by a seal pup, for example,  he answers tersely, &quot;It's like nuzzling tripe.  Or blowing your nose  on a stinging nettle.&quot;  A short novel with bold and offbeat humor,  startling imagery, and unforgettable action scenes,  Sooterkin will amuse  anyone looking for a literary change of pace.for a literary change of pace.	2000-08-14

Barker herself once described this as a novel of &quot;cornball perversion,&quot; and no one who reads it will ever dispute that!  It is  filled with the weirdest group of gonzo characters ever assembled, among  them Ronny, a homeless man whose real name is Jim;  Jim, a hairless man  whose real name is Ronny and who works spraying weed killer along the  roads;  Luke, a photographer of pornography who smells like fish; and Lily,  a violent and rebellious teenager who suffers from a clotting disorder and  worships The Head.  And if these characters were not already bizarre  enough, Barker also opens the Pandora's box of their not-in-the-textbook  psyches to the reader--showing them to be even more off-the-wall than we  had ever dreamed!  Providing fertile ground for all the aberrations to  flourish, the author sets the characters in a remote seaside resort/nudist  colony during the off-season, with additional forays to a nearby boar farm,  the Lost and Found Department of the London Underground, and a bat cave in  Sumatra, where a character we know only from her letters is searching for a  hairy hominid with no big toes.  Obviously, not your grandmother's  novel.<br />Wide Open is like nothing you've ever read before-absolutely  original, sometimes wacky, sometimes poignant, sometimes violent, and  always fascinating.  The fluidity of Barker's prose keeps the reader  zipping along, despite the fact that we can't always tell when she's  putting us on, aren't always sure what's going on, and often suspect there  are deep themes here if only we could catch our breaths long enough to  figure them out.  This is an absolutely exhilarating wild ride if the  reader is willing to be &quot;wide open.&quot;	2000-08-13

It's very earnest, reflecting the author's obvious commitment to human rights and her concern about  abuses-she's even donating some of her royalties to human rights  organizations.  So I feel almost like a traitor when I say I felt the book  to be curiously schizophrenic.  The book is set in Chiapas, Mexico and in  Nicaragua and Guatemala, areas in which an indigenous population has been  systematically brutalized by corrupt governments, exploited by  &quot;freedom&quot; movements, and terrorized by just about anyone with the  power to do so.  Horrifying and heart-breaking examples of such brutality  abound here, especially in the last third of the book.<br />Yet the first  third of the book concerns itself largely with the failed romances of the  various main characters, especially of Kate Banner, a 42-year-old nurse  from Indiana. This pre-occupation with romantic relationships continues  throughout the book, perhaps as a way to connect the settings in several  different countries and in several different time periods, and perhaps as a  way of illustrating that even in the midst of terrible wars, love can  flower.  However, with a large cast of characters, flashbacks which cover  many years, and settings in three Latin American countries, plus,  occasionally, the U.S, the development of character which makes a reader  care about the romantic outcomes is missing.<br />While some readers may find  that the focus on romance makes it possible to bear the horror of the  abuses, I found myself thinking that such a focus leads to an unfortunate  trivializing of the years-long commitments many of these expatriate  volunteers have made to the human rights struggle and, more importantly,  that it removes the focus from the very real, life-and-death upheavals in  the lives of the native population.  The depictions of  the abuses were  very powerful, vivid, and often heart-breaking; the romances, by  comparison, frivolous.  Though love and war can coexist and can be the  subjects of powerful novels, they just do not seem to coexist comfortably  here.and war can coexist and can be the  subjects of powerful novels, they just do not seem to coexist comfortably  here.	2000-08-11

Bliss is a lively, entertaining, and thought-provoking seriocomic novel, and Peter Carey is a terrifically amusing writer with a great ear for  dialogue, a wry humor, and a broad vision. He delights in poking fun of us  and our foibles, while saving his barbs for corporations and institutions.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed Bliss, I know I would have enjoyed it even  more, and maybe even loved it, when it was published in 1981.  I feel Bliss  to be just a bit dated now--still well worth reading and lots of fun, with  many extremely funny scenes--but less relevant with its environmental  messages and its anti-Big Business needling than it must have been when  these messages were fresh, new, and more importantly, uncommon.  As it was,  Carey's approach now feels a bit patronizing at times and the environmental  message, just a bit didactic--and old.<br />The book opens with Harry Joy,  an advertising executive,  having an out-of-body experience as he  &quot;dies&quot; from a heart attack.  When he comes back to life, he is  convinced that he is in Hell.  Since his wife is having an affair with his  business partner, his son is selling drugs, and his daughter is a sexually  precocious junkie, it is easy to see why Harry is convinced that his life  is Hell and why he feels a captive to it.  As he seeks enlightenment, Harry  recognizes that Krappe Chemicals, a client, is polluting the environment  with cancer-causing fumes, sees a cancer map showing the rates of cancer  near industrial polluters, and meets Honey Barbara, an environmentally  conscious prostitute with a heart of green.<br />Carey's satire here also  includes the vagaries of religious doctrine,  the absurdities of police  procedure, the abuses of the mental health &quot;industry&quot; and its  institutions, the fear of Communist conspiracies, and even of the trustee  selection process for the State Gallery, which draws from  &quot;the very  inner circle of society.&quot;  It is lots of fun to read, with some  laugh-out-loud funny scenes, but its thematic punch seems to have dulled a  bit over time.some  laugh-out-loud funny scenes, but its thematic punch seems to have dulled a  bit over time.	2000-08-09

Art lovers, and particularly Vermeer lovers, have been so lucky this year to have had two &quot;Vermeer novels&quot; available at the same time!  And  both of them are wonderful!  Some debate has appeared on the Amazon pages  for the two books--Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier and Girl in  Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland--as to which book is &quot;better,&quot;  a  debate likely to continue.  Both books are short, both are extremely well  written, both involve a hypnotizingly seductive Vermeer painting, and both  tell of the influence of the painting on the lives of the main characters.<br />In Girl With A Pearl Earring, author Chevalier focuses her literary  microscope on Griet, a maid in the Vermeer household who becomes an  assistant to the painter.  Griet is a young woman who maintains her  integrity despite the turbulence and social pressures to which she is  subjected in the household.  Life in Delft and in this family during the  time of the painting is replete with petty jealousies, economic pressures,  class distinctions, religious  differences, and political and social  uncertainty, and Griet has to navigate her way through this milieu. It is  through her character and domestic situation that one comes to know Vermeer  and his painting.<br />Girl in Hyacinth Blue, on the other hand, is not a  &quot;character novel.&quot;  Here the author does not zero in on one  character or even the painting as an end in itself. Instead, Vreeland takes  a broader, more global view, using the history of a hitherto undiscovered  Vermeer painting to work backward from the present to the painting's  inception in Delft.  The &quot;story&quot; here is a careful tracing of  themes--the relationship between personal love and responsibility to  mankind in general, the role of art in the lives of ordinary people, and  what constitutes lasting value both in art and in human interactions. In  seven or eight chapters we see how the painting has affected the lives of  its various owners.<br />Ultimately, comparing these beautifully wrought  novels is like comparing pearl earrings to hyacinths.  Both are gorgeous;  each is unique.various owners.<br />Ultimately, comparing these beautifully wrought  novels is like comparing pearl earrings to hyacinths.

Not a detective story in the conventional sense, Motherless Brooklyn is as much the story of Lionel Essrog as it is the story of a murder, and in this  sense it is particularly appealing.  Essrog is doubly removed from the  mainstream-he has grown up in an orphanage without the kind of nurturing  which gives humans their ability to empathize with each other, and he has  Tourette's Syndrome, which makes him involuntarily touch and pat objects,  count or repeat actions, and, most annoyingly for him, blurt out nonsense,  rhymes, and sometimes obscenities at oftentimes inappropriate moments. He  is not an easy character to identify with.<br />Yet Jonathan Lethem, the  author, is not using the Tourette's symptoms as a literary trick.  He makes  the reader care about Lionel without pitying him. Lionel is trying to find  the murderer of Frank Minna, a somewhat shady character who has mentored  Lionel and three others from the orphanage since they were young teenagers.  Lionel comes to believe that he may be the only one who cares enough about  Frank to be able to solve his murder, and he begins to think that Frank  counted on him to do this by the statements and actions he made in the  moments immediately before and after he received his fatal wounds.  As  Lionel works to find Frank's killer, as he tries to attract a woman and  sustain a relationship, and as he evaluates the relationships he has had  with the other orphans, Lionel becomes more mature and more aware of his  unusual relationships with the outside world.<br />The author's recreation  of the Tourette world is so vivid and realistic that I (like other readers,  perhaps) looked up information about the author himself experienced this  syndrome. (No.)  His imaginative descriptions, especially those presented  from Lionel's point of view, are often both humorous and uniquely offbeat.  And his ability to keep the reader fascinated with this character and his  story is absolutely dazzling.	2000-08-02

With Groundwork, Robert Welch distills into one heady brew  four hundred years of Anglo-Irish conflict and the historical relationships between the Condon and O'Dwyer families.  He does this by presenting four-  or five-page stories of individuals and events at seemingly random dates  and stirring them together.  Some stories are in the first person, giving  an effervescence to the characters and an immediacy to events, even very  ancient events.  Other stories are in the third person, providing color and  allowing the reader to &quot;store&quot; the information for future use.  The individual stories are very short, the cast of characters is very large  (necessitating a dramatis personae at the beginning of the book), the time  frame is huge, there is no real &quot;plot,&quot; in the traditional sense,  and time here is cumulative, rather than linear.<br />Despite all this,  Groundwork is not difficult reading.  Somehow Welch manages to make it all  work, and even a casual reader with little or no background or interest in  the history of the Irish people will find it absolutely fascinating and  often thrilling.  On the most superficial level, the daily lives of the  Condon and O'Dwyer families in the 20th century capture the reader, who can  identify with them and share their tribulations--a girl who finds herself  pregnant and abandoned, a son who becomes a monk, a father whose children  die during an epidemic, a wife who finds that her husband has been  unfaithful.<br />Welch is not writing a melodrama here, however.  These events  are related to the ongoing history of the Irish people, with some entries  here dating back to the Elizabethan period.  Betrayals in the 20th century  parallel some depicted in earlier centuries; the struggle to survive as  Irishmen in a country dominated by the British is similar, regardless of  century; the seemingly thankless efforts of scholars to preserve the  history, culture, and language of the Irish continue unabated through time;  and the desire to achieve respect, both individually and as a people, never  wanes.  As Katherine Condon remarks on the death of her mother, &quot;I'd  like to be with her among the dead, and along with all the Condons and  O'Dwyers that have lived here for so many centuries.  We are all alike, all  sad and thoughtful, and full of rancour and feeling.&quot;  And Welch  includes it all in this book.nabated through time;  and the desire to achieve respect, both individually and as a people, never  wanes.

This book already has many excellent plot summaries and analyses of symbols on these pages, and certainly does not need additional ones from me.  However, one aspect that I have not seen mentioned anywhere here is  the importance of the title in giving additional significance to the book's  various levels of meaning.  It is here, I think, that the full measure of  Coetzee's overriding vision of  &quot;dis-grace,&quot; or absence of grace,  is most easily seen.<br />In its most superficial, obvious dictionary meaning  of grace, the main characters' lives lack &quot;beauty and charm,&quot;  as  they try to deal with the fates they've been dealt in the aftermath of  apartheid  (Lucy on her farm, Lourie in his changed college faculty  position), their fates as the result of individual actions by other  characters (Lourie and Melanie, Lucy and Pollux, et.al.), and their fates  as the result of their own actions.  The characters are also unsure, often,  of what constitutes &quot;right&quot; or &quot;proper&quot; actions and  often unable to make themselves do what they believe to be right.  Their  definitions of rightness itself have been called into question, and  Coetzee's view of them and their fates is dark and uncompromising.<br />The  characters lack &quot;thoughtfulness&quot; to others and show little  &quot;mercy&quot; or &quot;clemency&quot; as they go about their lives.  They often act spontaneously and selfishly.  Lourie's behavior towards the  dogs is more merciful than his behavior toward his fellow humans, and  Coetzee may be offering this as a ray of hope for the future--one has to  start somewhere to deal with the changing issues of power vs. compassion.  Whites collectively abused power and Lourie individually abused the power  of his faculty position; they cannot expect compassion from the people  whose lives they affected, now that they are no longer in power.<br />Now  that apartheid is officially over and a new black society is growing and,  at times, exacting tribute for past abuses, one can say that the  &quot;grace&quot; period has expired, something all too obvious to Lucy in  her efforts to farm her land.  Her decision to raise a child in this  environment brings another sense of resolution, and possibly another a ray  of hope.  Unfortunately, one cannot help but wonder whether the grace of  God will shine equally on all the characters, making them equally strong  and pure of heart. One wonders how much an &quot;eye for an eye...&quot; will  be the preferred judgment, both politically and in the personal lives of  the characters.<br />Coetzee's prose is unadorned, plain, lacking in  &quot;grace notes&quot; which give life and brilliance to music but which  sometimes mask the message when applied to prose.  It is probably not  coincidental that Lourie's planned Byronic opera changes in the end from a  broad, orchestral  accompaniment to that of the honest and uncompromising  plink-plink of a banjo.  Somehow it seems not only appropriate but a  &quot;graceful&quot; denouement to this complex book.imes, exacting tribute for past abuses, one can say that the  &quot;grace&quot; period has expired, something all too obvious to Lucy in  her efforts to farm her land.

After reading the reviews, all of which emphasized the traumatic doom and gloom of the plot, I expected this book to be both depressing and hopelessly melodramatic.  I almost didn't read it, never expecting to  become as caught up in it as I was.  The four main characters were so  appealing--so vulnerable with their obvious personal flaws--that I couldn't  help but root for them to &quot;make it.&quot; At the same time, it was  impossible not to recognize also that they simply did not have the  self-awareness to do so.<br />The characters and their motivations are  believable, their mistakes understandable, and their miscommunications  plausible--for most of the novel, that is.  As other readers have pointed  out, the conclusion is &quot;movie-like,&quot; with a grand finale that  ties up all the loose ends.  I did not find it incongruous, however.  The  sense of inexorability resulting from the increasingly more serious  miscommunications of the characters seems to demand a &quot;showdown.&quot;  The sense of impending doom is almost palpable and needs  resolution.<br />Anyone interested in the craft of writing would find it  fascinating, I think, to study how the author takes four relatively  &quot;normal&quot; characters through a series of seemingly innocuous  events which, in combination, lead to total disaster.  Well deserving of  its National Book Award Finalist medal, in my opinion.	2000-07-21

Behind the Mountain is a unique creation, more than a close, personal look at a most unusual place, Tasmania, \\"an appendix, an after thought\\" to the mainland of Australia.  It is also the memoir of a  brilliant, scholarly self-exile's return after twenty years and his  coming-to-terms with the people and places that made him who he is.<br /><br />Conrad  had \\"escaped\\" from Tasmania at age twenty to attend  university at Oxford and to start a new life.  He had burned in the back  yard all his diaries, exercise books, and \\"anything that might  incriminate [him] by attaching an identity to [him].\\"  He had left his  home and family behind, intending never to return, believing that  \\"Home was where you started from, not where you stayed.\\"  Twenty  years older when he writes of revisiting Tasmania, he has discovered that  despite his attempt to escape,  \\"Tasmania had set the terms of [his]  life.  The home you cannot return to you carry off with you: it lies down  the at the bottom of the world, and of the sleeping, imagining  mind.\\"<br /><br />This search for identity and roots informs his travels within  Tasmania and gives the book an immediacy and liveliness lacking in so many  other studies of place.  Tasmania, he explains,  is \\"an offshore  island off the shore of an offshore continent,\\"  its residents  therefore the  \\"victims of a twofold alienation,\\" with nothing  between them and Anarctica, the end of the world. Conrad turns his eagle  eye, his thoughtful sensibility, his absolutely limitless vocabulary, and  his extraordinary skills at description to the recreation of Tasmania from  the air, from the water, from the farm, from the mountain, and even under  the ground, all in vivid word pictures.  You will travel with him, and  experience the great good fortune of seeing the island through the eyes of  a gifted and introspective native whose twenty-year absence has given him a  perspective on life in Tasmania that enable him to communicate it with  \\"outsiders.\\"<br /><br />Best of all, Conrad permits the reader to share  his discovery that he had \\"placed [his] trust, mistakenly, in the myth  of self-invention.

On the surface a picaresque adventure, with a cast of sailors engaged in all manner of mischief during their voyage from the Isle of Man to Tasmania, the book is also the vivid,  sorrowful drama of the extermination of the aborigines there.  Using  personal memoirs and/or letters from four major characters, author Kneale  brings these seemingly incompatible plot lines to life and provides focus  for the ship's meanderings.<br />Illiam Quillian Kewley, the irrepressible  ship captain from the Isle of Man, is always just a heartbeat away from  apprehension by authorities.  Rev. Geoffrey Wilson, his Bible-thumping  passenger, believes that a literal interpretation of Genesis puts the  Garden of Eden in Tasmania, and he's about to prove it.  Dr. Thomas Potter,  another passenger, is a phlebotomist who believes that his own success is  proof of his high position on the chain of being, with the Manx crewmen far  below him, and the aborigines just a step up from the apes.  Peevay, a  somewhat educated aborigine with whom the reader greatly identifies, is a  foil to show how the tunnel-visioned, British colonial/missionary spirit  produces everything but &quot;improvement&quot; for the aborigines.  The  story and setting are further fleshed out with entries from Tasmanian  colonial governors, landowners, schoolmasters, prison inspectors, prison  superintendents, and their wives.<br />Some readers have criticised the book  for having too broad a scope.  I really liked it.  I do think that it would  have been very helpful if the publishers had included a map of Tasmania.  Having read Peter Conrad's extraordinary memoir, Behind the Mountain:  Return to Tasmania, I already had such a map and some knowledge of the  topography of the island, and I think this made it easier to visualize the  actions and explorations on and around the island.  Not a book to be read  in dribs and drabs-reading big chunks at a time helps keep the action in  focus.	2000-07-15

This early (1970) &quot;novel&quot; by Michael Ondaatje is a collage of poetry, narrative,  memoir, photography, journalism, and fiction surrounding Billy the Kid. Ondaatje  poeticizes Billy's thoughts, giving us &quot;insight&quot;  into the inner man, while, at the same  time,  creating a kind of suspense about the inevitable outcome. By constantly  shifting the narrative focus and point of view  from Billy to some of his cohorts, the  women  who loved them, and the &quot;lawmen&quot; who sought them, Ondaatje avoids  the  need for transitions which would normally  challenge the biographer of a legend. And  by  allowing time to be circuitous, rather than linear, Ondaatje is able to  give flesh  and bone to the impressions he  creates by enlisting the reader's help in &quot;organizing&quot;  his material. In short, this is an impressionistic  word-painting which gives freshness  and  vibrancy to an old saga of the Wild West.	2000-07-11

With easy, almost casual, lyricism, Niall Williams spins the separate stories of two  Irish families, then weaves them together to create his story of love. And like many  other Irish writers, he conveys a love that is simultaneously  both romantic and  religious, though decidedly  not ecclesiastical. When Nicholas was twelve, &quot;God  spoke to [Nicholas's] father for the first time. God didn't say  much. He told  [Nicholas's] father to be a  painter, and left it at that....&quot; Answering the heavenly call,  the father leaves his family for long periods of time  and spends the rest of his life  trying to  create masterpieces, finally succeeding, only to have virtually all his  work  destroyed by the most earthly of causes:  cows. Similarly, in another family, a  brilliantly musical boy, while engaging in an energetic, enthusiastic paeon  of  happiness is suddenly and mysteriously  struck down, unable to move or speak.  Both  families must simply accept the seeming arbitrariness of what has  happened.<br />  As Williams develops these  stories, his focus is clearly on the earthly, mundane  aspects of life with its hope, its humor, and its crushing  disappointments, but he  conveys a strong  sense that a Higher Power is &quot;in charge,&quot; however unfathomable  His actions might be to the mere mortals  involved. In an ending which is part  religious mysticism, part magic realism, and part pure romance, the  ultimate  resolution takes place, leaving the  reader delighted by the happiness of some  characters but uncertain at the costs to others.

Nora Okja Keller, along with Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Susanna Moore, Kiana  Davenport, and a host of other distinctive young Hawaiian writers is breathing new  life into  the novels of Hawaii's &quot;melting pot.&quot; In Comfort Woman, Keller  simultaneously presents two stories--one of  Rebeccah Bradley, a young daughter  of an  immigrant who wants to be accepted by the culture in which she lives, and  one of Akiko, who is so badly damaged both  emotionally and physically by her  experiences  during World War II that she is unable to adapt completely to any  world, apart from her own.<br />Keller is particularly  sensitive as she presents and  honors two very  different cultures, and the reader will learn much about Hawaiian  and Korean traditions and history in this elegant,  compassionate novel. Rich in  imagery and  detail, Keller's Comfort Woman is the most beautifully crafted and executed  novel of the  many Hawaiian novels I've read.	2000-07-11

Coe's The House of Sleep is a wryly humorous, literary chess game that keeps the  reader both smilingly amused and intellectually enthralled. The intriguing characters,  the complex plot, the alternations between two time periods twelve  years apart, and  most of all, the humor, both  dry wit and almost slapstick send-ups of academia and  research, keep the reader constantly involved, often with a smirk  on his/her face.

When asked, rhetorically, by his sister, &quot;Whatever happened to the dinosaurs?&quot;,                               Ralph, the main character responds, &quot;Their habitat altered...A change of climate.&quot; In                                his rebellion against his parents, their closed,  religiously fundamentalist point of view,                               and  his father's financial blackmailing regarding his career choices, Ralph                                intentionally changes his physical habitat and  his climate by escaping to South Africa                               with  his bride. <br />Working as a lay person at a mission and vigorously opposing                                apartheid, Ralph and Anna eventually are  imprisoned, then banished to                               Bechuanaland,  now Botswana. It is here that the savagery which creates a                                permanent and terrible climate in their marriage occurs, a  savagery not limited to                               one race as Ralph and  Anna had perceived in South Africa. <br />As the story bounces                                from the present in England back twenty years to Africa, the  reader lives through                               the vivid and terrible  African experiences and simultaneously sees how they have                                permeated the lives of these good, but often naïve, people.  Both Ralph and Anna                               have rejected the  traditional religion of their parents in favor of doing good deeds in                                their family lives and through a social service  trust. But as Ralph's uncle James                               points out,  &quot;There is nothing so appallingly hard...as the business of being  human.&quot;                               <br />While the reader cheers as  James grows and eventually embraces life, s/he also                                fears for Anna, who remains emotionally closed, despite her good  deeds, fearful                               that she &quot;should lose  everything, one of these days.&quot; As the events resolve                                themselves and the &quot;competition in goodness&quot; comes  to an end, we see real humans                               trying to put  aside the petrified past and to change the climate of their lives, and we                                will, perhaps, evaluate our own lives.  Can we  accept change, or are we dinosaurs at heart?	2000-07-11

What a thrill to read a novel by a first time author so skilled and so committed to his  subject that he can reject all the conventions and still get his surprising book  published--receiving rave reviews on two continents in the process!<br /><br />Miller sets the  book in the eighteenth  century and begins with a graphic autopsy of the main  character. Here he recreates the philosophical and scientific  attitudes of the period,  attitudes which are  alien to our own, and which he will explore as a subtext  throughout the book. He summarizes the life of the main  character--which he spends  the rest of the  book recounting--in the first chapter, eliminating any climactic  excitement he might have created. His main character is  a man with the inability to  feel pain,  someone with whom the reader cannot possibly identify, and his  adventures are weirdly melodramatic, so unusual the  reader's interest lies primarily  in their  curiosity.<br /><br />Yet the book \\"works,\\" and very often thrills.  Somehow he does  manage to make the reader  care about James Dyer and his fate, and he does create  excitement in a plot which skips from small town England to the  court of Russia.  Miller's masterful and  controlled use of description is a primary factor in his ability to  further the action of this unusual story and bring  the characters and the period alive.  This  reader was awestruck by Miller's creative daring--and by his success.  Mary Whipple	2000-07-11

If you have ever driven yourself to near distraction trying to trace a family  genealogy, with duplicate names, multiple marriages, and family migrations, you  might have prepared adequately for Lost Man's River, which is,  essentially, a  detailed family genealogy. And  though you may be fascinated by some of the characters, be prepared to do a  great deal of page-flipping  to try to keep all the characters all  straight.<br />There is not much direct action. Except for the ending, the  most exciting events take place in the past and  surround the death of E. J. Watson  when the  now fifty-year-old narrator, his son Lucius, was a child. The action that  takes place in the present occurs primarily  through interviews forty years after E.J.  Watson's death as Lucius tries to separate truth from myth.<br />The book is  not fatally dull because of the historical, sociological, cultural, and  geographical insights the author also provides.  Illustrating the conflicting cultures and  motivations of very poor whites, blacks, Indians,and &quot;mixed  breeds&quot; as they hunt,  fish, drink, and  interact, often disastrously, in the Florida Everglades, Lost Man's  River also traces the life, death, and possible  salvation of a wild and much  threatened  natural environment.<br />With its large cast of characters, complex familial  relationships, and carefully researched  depictions of the forty year time span of the  &quot;action,&quot; this is a book of enormous reach. It is not surprising  that it took the author  twenty years to bring  it to fruition.ng  it to fruition.	2000-07-11

There's a comfortable &quot;old-shoeness&quot; to picking up a Hassler novel. One doesn't  read Hassler primarily for the plots, though they are sometimes dramatic and always  include a grande finale. Rather, one reads him for his wry  depictions of ordinary  humans and for his  gentle, but trenchant observations about midwestern,  middleclass, or academic life. The Dean's List is a sequel to  Rookery Blues, and it is  helpful, but not  necessary, to have read that.<br />Though the plot line here is not as  insistent as in some of his other novels, one  doesn't really care. Who can read this  book  and not be amused by characters like Dot, &quot;traumatized in...youth by  the  Great Depression,&quot; a woman who  &quot;hangs up her used paper towels to dry.&quot; The  annual fund-raiser dinner at the Hi-Rise housing for the elderly  is a classic--  collecting funds to build rest  room facilities on the main floor so that residents  &quot;caught short&quot; won't have to go upstairs to their  apartments to find relief. Lolly  Edwards's  planning and attending her own full-blown wake so that she can see her  friends and out-of-town relatives and hear all her  eulogies is so remarkable one  wonders why  more people don't do it!

Lovers of poetry will thrill at the dense images in Anne Michaels's Fugitive Pieces,  its obliquities, its visions from the inside, its view of time as a &quot;gradual instant,&quot; and  its intensity of focus. Even non-lovers of poetry  may find themselves engrossed for  an hour, or  more, while &quot;covering&quot; just ten pages, as this reader did, at one  point.  There have been many Holocaust books,  all of them stories of horror, but none  have  accomplished what this author has in engaging the mind while, at the same  time, emotionally exhausting the reader with  passion.<br />Within the linear framework of  a  novel, she describes the events that occur in Jakob Beer's life, but she  presents  these events through his tormented  mind-a mind which does not operate, of course,  in linear time. The events are compressed and embedded in poetic language  which  requires the reader to bring his/her  own mind to bear on them, and as the reader  participates in the imagery and &quot;decodes&quot; the language, the  events and their horror  truly become the  reader's, too.<br />Michaels also employs musical themes which she  develops symphonically throughout the novel when Jakob  thinks of his missing  sister, further  engaging the reader's emotions. In the Greek settings we experience  what are essentially one- or two-character Greek  dramas, which both involve the  reader and  allow the events to achieve grand scope and universality. While some  may carp about the extent of the self-analysis or  about the less than taut organization  of the  last part of the book, I cannot imagine any reader who will not be  overwhelmed by the magnitude of Michaels's achievement  here.of the self-analysis or  about the less than taut organization                               of the  last part of the book, I cannot imagine any reader who will not be                                overwhelmed by the magnitude of Michaels's achievement  here.	2000-07-11

In this age of pop culture  and instant bestsellerdom for many books whose primary value seems to be their  bankability as future films, it's disappointing that a  book this good remains relatively unknown. Yet author Vanderhaeghe probably  would not have been  surprised by this. In  fact, one of the main themes of this absorbing and satisfying  book is the power of film, &quot;the glory of American  lightning,&quot; and the different goals  to  which it can be adapted by &quot;artists&quot; and &quot;visionaries.&quot;<br />  Structurally, the book tells two stories  in alternate chapters set in the Canadian Wild  West of the l870's and in Hollywood in the l920's. The author makes no  real  attempt to create suspense about the  identity of the Englishman's boy of the 1870's  and who he has become by the 1920's.  Instead, he chooses to reveal small parts of the continuum of history  between these  dates until at the end the full  story of the Englishman's boy is revealed. At the same  time, the thematically subtle juxtaposition of specific events  from these dramatically  different times and  places shows how little human nature has changed and how  much it is important to be true to ideals and values, whatever  they may be and  however they may have to  accommodate the changes of history.	2000-07-11

Leslie Forbes's talents of narrative and description and her desire to go far beyond  the limits of the usual murder mystery make this reader anxious to read her second  novel. This novel, however, is her first novel, and here her reach  results in a lack of focus and  confusion  about the main character's motivation. Is the heroine's mission to find out  who, if anyone, killed her brother-in-law's  first wife, in order to save her sister from  the same fate? Is it to solve the mystery of who is killing the hijras and  why? Is it to  uncover an art forgery and  smuggling operation? Is it to reveal the slimy underside of  contemporary politics? Is it to find out who she really  is?<br /> Here it seems to be all the  above.  With a half Scottish, half Indian heroine who is also an illegitimate  child, in  addition to eunuchs, transvestites,  movie stars and directors, art collectors and  forgers, politicians, and killers, the reader has a lot of characters to  try to keep in  focus. To this melange the  author adds deliberate parallels between this action in  Bombay monsoon season, Shakespeare's The Tempest, and not one,  but two,  different Indian film versions of  it. Embellished also with detailed research into the  history of weather prediction, the lost wax method of casting,  gilding techniques, the  chemical use of  poisons, and land reclamation processes, this book is a real  cornucopia which would have benefitted from judicious  editing to highlight the  author's  considerable talents and broad vision.siderable talents and broad vision.	2000-07-11

A finalist in 1994 for both the Booker Prize and the Whitbread Award, Paradise hides major themes and ideas within the seemingly simple story of Yusuf, a twelve-year-old boy in rural East Africa whose father sells him to a trader to settle a debt. East Africa is in turmoil--on the verge of World War I and the fighting which eventually develops between the Germans in Tanzania and the British in Kenya. Cities are growing, populations are moving, merchants are trading and selling, and colonialists from many countries are vying for influence.<br /><br />When Yusuf is sold to his \\"uncle\\" Aziz, he leaves his remote rural village in what is now Tanzania and joins a trading caravan, traveling to the highlands and eventually on an ill-fated trading safari to the remote interior, discovering whole new worlds as he goes. In eight years of travel, he \\"progresses\\" from the countryside to a coastal city, from simple subsistence to the complexities of urban, mercantile life, and from his childish pleasure with a shiny coin to adult love.<br /><br />As a young child/adolescent, Yusuf is an obvious symbol of Tanzania itself at this early stage in its history. Just as Yusuf must come of age, so also must the country as the various groups contending for influence make choices about how much they will accept, reject, or adapt to outside influences. As Yusuf comes into contact with tribal chieftains, Muslim traders, Indian shopkeepers, and German empire builders, the reader observes the impact of all of these groups both within Yusuf and within the loose, artificial borders of Tanzania.<br /><br />Creating vivid images primarily through his selection of the perfect detail, Gurnah uses simple, poetic language to tell a delightful story loaded with important social and political observations, conveying clearly and objectively the historical background of the country in which the author was born. Dialogue is often filled with humor, and Yusuf becomes a real person, not a cardboard symbol. A novel which begins as a beautifully realized coming-of-age story develops into a story of high adventure, social and political realism, and eventually love.

The Ventriloquist's Tale opens and closes with addresses  by a mysterious, third person ventriloquist/narrator, representing the old Amerindian  culture of  myth and magic of southern Guyana.  This narrator indicates that he is  not the hero of the book because, as he tells the  reader, &quot;Your heroes and heroines  are  slaves to time.... They've forgotten how to be playful and have no appetite  for  adventure.&quot;<br />  As the narrator unfolds the stories of the McKinnon family, half  Scottish and half  Wapisiana, we see  illustrated in their lives the conflicts (and occasional melding) of  their ancient ways with western science, religion,  and exploitation. The narrator and,  one  understands, the author come down strongly on the side of the ancients, as  the  Amerindian characters enchant, amuse, and  play with us while they show us their  struggle with European intruders, including, at one point, Evelyn Waugh in  search of  inspiration. We laugh with them,  even as they face privation and hardship, and see  with their eyes how ridiculously arrogant and ignorant the intruders  are, because the  intruders do not see that  &quot;everyday life...[is] an illusion behind which [lies] the  unchanging reality of dream and myth.&quot;<br />Despite the  repellent, incest subplot,  we continue to like the characters, we are  intrigued by the old beliefs that the eclipse of  the sun by the moon is itself an  incestuous  act, and we understand how limiting it is to reduce eclipses and  relationships solely to equations and to write research  papers on the structural  elements of myth.

William Corker, ever-so-proper, and presumably celibate, has spent his life caring for his mother and his domineering sister, and now, at age 64, he has made the break, found his own apartment, and is living, joyfully, on his own, above the employment office where he works.  The inner thoughts, memories, and poignant regrets of Corker as he approaches old age, contrast delightfully with the decidedly uncelibate, hormone-induced thoughts of his employee, 17-year-old Alec.  Berger illuminates every possible intergenerational contrast and conflict here, evoking great humor and equally great sympathy for Corker and Alec, both of whom the reader recognizes as naïve.<br /><br />Within this delightful and amusing story, however, Berger deals with serious universal themes related to one's life goals and responsibilities, how one wants to be remembered, and how personal freedom is defined.  After caring for others for sixty-four years, Berger's only desire is \\"I do not want to die as I am, when I die I want to be different, I want to be less ignorant of the consequences of not being good.\\"<br /><br />Corker takes an irreversible step into his independent life during a tipsy travelogue of Vienna.  It is here that Berger uses language most brilliantly to reveal the many ironies of Corker's life.  What Corker actually says, what he knows, and what he would like to say to and about the other characters in the audience, all of whom have affected his life, are combined in this one stunning scene.  We can observe him taking chances for the first time and experiencing \\"the general triumph of having spoken out and been listened to.\\"<br /><br />Simultaneously, however, the reader is privy to ironic events that are taking place outside the lecture hall, events over which Corker has no control and which will force him to continue living his new, \\"free\\" life, whether or not he wants to. The epilogue which shows us Corker two years later, reveals Berger's consummate irony: Corker is still speaking out and still living free, though not in the way that either he or we would have predicted.  A fine study of a man at the end of his life, the novel showcases Berger's masterful use of irony and brilliant manipulation of language, making this a novel that language lovers will not want to miss.

Do not be misled by the jacket cover-a photograph of a beautiful young  woman in Victorian dress gazing wide-eyed at an idyllic background scene  and suggesting a  romantic interlude.  The jacket blurb itself refers to a  &quot;young woman who finds love and freedom in the midst of a devastating  war&quot; and goes on to suggest that this is her story.<br />Perhaps the  publisher is being deliberately ironic here.  Ladysmith, South Africa,  was the site of one of the most horrific and bloody episodes in the whole  sad story of the Boer War, a war that was waged between England and Holland  for control of another country's riches and in which thousands of native,  as well as foreign,  people met unnecessary and unimaginably gory ends.  And Foden describes this horror without reservation.  I can assure you,  &quot;love story&quot; is not what you will remember or care about  here.<br />Foden's characters come from the British ruling class, British  journalists (including Winston Churchill), British and Irish regiments,  British settlers and expatriates, Indians (including Mahatma Gandhi),  native families displaced by the war, and, of course, the Boers.  The  reader quickly becomes caught up in the lives of  individuals from each of  these groups, feeling genuine sympathy for many of them and mourning the  tragedies which befall them all as the siege and the skirmishes continue  unabated.  Like the siege itself, there's a hopelessness to each of their  stories, which Foden carries to their conclusions (in some cases at the end  of World War II) by appending a final section aptly entitled  &quot;Monologues of the Dead.&quot;  This is a beautifully wrought story of  unimaginable carnage.	2000-07-10

Spanning the years from  the present backward  to the creation of the painting in the 1660's, the  book is as intricately and subtly composed as one of Vermeer's paintings.  Each episode illustrates two different kinds of love-both  personal,  private love and a larger universal love or sense of responsibility.  At  the same time, each episode also traces the ownership of the painting and  gives glimpses of the role of art in the lives of ordinary people.  Beginning with the dilemma faced by a teacher who acquired the painting  from his father, a low level Nazi functionary during World War II, it then  moves successively backward to the stories of the Jewish family which owned  it, to a father who bought it to commemorate an early, lost love, and  backward still to an the unhappy French wife of a functionary stationed in  Holland and enjoying an erotic interlude.  Ultimately, it regresses to the  life of the Vermeer family and the daughter who sat for the painting.  Girl  in Hyacinth Blue is a literary gem of understated complexity.	2000-07-07

If you check www.amazon.co.uk, you will see that this is a popular book among young European intellectuals who delight in finding the parallels between aspects of this book and the writings of lesser known European  philosophers.  Many indicate that they come back to this novel again and  again.  I found myself thinking, however, that this might  not have been  necessary if the author had been less ambiguous, more specific. Ostensibly  the story of four students, one of whom has disappeared, during a time of  political tumult, the book explores philosophy, politics, social upheavals,  the characters and their inner lives, the historical past and its effect on  the present, the specific mystery of Immanuele and her fate, the  relationship between love and death, the connections between physical and  idealistic love, the effects of fear, the relationships between  dreams/reality/nightmare/fantasy, the bird and water &quot;symbols&quot;  and their possible meanings, etc.<br />  Though I liked the book and admired  the &quot;reach&quot; of the author, I felt that in many ways the reach was  greater than the grasp and that the book was not successful as a novel in  its own right.  Alternating between ambiguity and stark reality, between  moral conundrums and fleeting nightmare, between staccato sentences and  ethereal moods, I found myself looking for more coherence. Readers who  consider buying this book would do well to seek an alternate opinion on  www.amazon.co.uk.	2000-07-07

Although Nolan's prose has often been compared to that of other, more famous writers-James Joyce, Dylan Thomas, W. B. Yeats, and Gerard Manley Hopkins, for example-his  style is more accessible, making  his story more  readable, more emotionally powerful, and more personally involving than  anything I've read by these other great writers.  Minnie O'Brien lives,  loves, ages, aches, and ultimately haunts.  She's an extraordinary  character presented in an extraordinary way by an equally extraordinary  author.<br />The basic story line is simple: Minnie O'Brien, an Irish  countrywoman with a love for the land and her family, watches her three  children grow up and leave the farm.  As she ages into her eighties, she  tries to keep the farm going, waiting for her youngest son, from whom she  has never heard a word since his departure at age 17, to return to claim  the land.  But to describe the book in these terms is like describing  Ulysses as a story about a man walking around Dublin.  Nolan brings her to  life by following the first rule of fiction: &quot;Don't tell about  something; recreate it.&quot;  He does this, in part, by using vivid,  emotionally charged words in new ways, sometimes using adjectives and nouns  as verbs, conveying not only the emotional sense but also an action:  In  describing Minnie's actions at the death of her husband, we find that  her  cries were &quot;cartwheeling around the room,&quot; before &quot;she  sacked her voice of screams&quot; and dried her eyes, going downstairs to  &quot;perform the miraculous loaves and fishes reenactment,&quot; for the  neighborhood wake.  Minnie's connection to the land, her love for Peter,  her devotion to her children, her commitment to what is good, and her  ability to keep dreaming of the future, even as she is dying, are all part  of the banyan tree of her life, one which will continue to bloom long after  one finishes this book.	2000-07-04

Although reviewers certainly have ample reason to praise the nuns' unusual combination of pagan and religious ritual, their imaginative story-telling, and the honest pleasure they find in their &quot;cloistered&quot; lives,  not enough praise is given, in my opinion, to the quirky humor of this  book.  Whether you are an agnostic who chuckles to see religious practices  carried to outrageous extremes or a devoutly Catholic believer with the  healthy ability to recognize when true faith goes over the top, you will  find this book a delight.  Painted with a very broad brush, the novel will  keep you smiling, even as you admire the author's skill in sympathetically  creating a most unusual cloistered world.	2000-07-03

When this book was recommended to me as &quot;the greatest war story since War and Peace,&quot; it was described in such a way that I was confused as to whether it was fiction or  non-fiction.  This confusion of fact and  fiction is both the book's strength and its weakness, I think.  The  reviewers before me have all shown their love of history in their reviews,  and they all seem extremely knowledgeable.  In their admiration for this  book, they cite the author's careful depiction of the battle itself, the  details that make the action vivid, bloody, and unrelenting, and his  ability to create plausible historical figures.  I don't disagree with any  of this praise.<br />As a novel, however, The Battle is certainly not War and  Peace-or even Cold Mountain-its claim to being a novel resting primarily in  the fact that the author recreates not only the battle, but the (invented)  conversations and thoughts of the participants.  Although he does this  well,  I was disappointed that the book felt so skeletal, largely lacking  in the unique, personal details which contribute to the development of  real, breathing humans with whom the reader can identify and who make  &quot;novels&quot; come alive.  Although the author does include a minor  love interest and glimpses of  the author who later calls himself Stendahl,  the &quot;biggest&quot; character for me was Vincent Paradis, a young  private whose opinions, observations, and movement among camps provide the  author with a vehicle for organizing this immense amount of material.  The  book seems almost totally driven by the real movement of the real battle,  and it feels like a good history book.  I would have enjoyed getting to  know Napoleon as a real human facing human crises.	2000-07-03

Desmond Barry's gritty story of Jesse James, his life, companions, and motivations for crime is a haunting, often violent, narrative counterpoised against the quieter tragedy of Joshua Beynon, a young boy living a  hard-scrabble existence and in search of a hero.  And whereas James comes  to thrill at the killing that becomes an easy part of his life, Joshua  regrets every day the accident in which he claims a life.<br />As the book  unfolds, we learn of the anarchy which characterized much of the post-Civil  War frontier, and we meet those who take advantage of it and contribute to  it--Quantrill's Raiders, Wild Bill Anderson, Cole Younger,  the James  brothers, the Pinkertons, and a host of other legends of the West.  We  learn what, if anything, motivates each of them and cringe at the  unimaginable--and casual--bloodshed which is such a part of their lives.  And despite the horrors these outlaws commit, we come to understand that  underlying all this crime there is a kind of &quot;chivalry,&quot; an  unvoiced code of expected behavior even among the most vicious of killers.  It is this code which Robert Ford, Jesse James's assassin, has broken, and  we are not surprised at how he meets his own end.<br />Unlike the previous  reviewer, I found it easy to become swept up by the story.  I was  continually impressed by the author's thoughtful selection of details to  illustrate his themes, by the bleak precariousness of the lives lived by  ordinary people, and by every man's ability to blur the lines between good  and evil to justify his own actions when necessary.  Anyone who has ever  thought of the Wild West as romantic would do well to study this  well-researched and vividly written novel.	2000-07-02

This totally absorbing novel was written originally in 1982 as a pop novel for Japanese consumption.  Now translated into English, it is the very personal, emotional story of the effects of political forces in both the  U.S. and Japan on a bi-cultural family in the days leading up to World War  II and its immediate aftermath.  In its honest, straightforward, and  completely unashamed evocation of the heartfelt feelings and conflicts of  Japanese family members, people we truly come to care about, the book may  be unique--we are so rarely allowed to see inside such a family and to  share its joys and heartbreak.  And this is truly the book's strength.<br />The Japanese father, American mother, and their children have always  been able to straddle the cultural divide, comfortable in both countries,  as the father engages in his diplomatic duties.  Betrayed by the Japanese  hierarchy and naive to the fact that Japan has planned to attack Pearl  Harbor even while his attempts to avert war are continuing with President  Roosevelt, Saburo Kurushima, his American wife, and his family suddenly  find themselves without an identity.  Unable to accept the Japanese  betrayal but obviously unable to live in the U.S., they return to Japan to  try to put together some semblance of a life, additional and unlikely  victims of the Pearl Harbor catastrophe.  Although a book written for  Japanese domestic consumption might have sugarcoated the issues which still  make Pearl Harbor a living sore for Americans, Kaga's integrity and honesty  are admirable here.  Anyone who has enjoyed Wouk's War and Remembrance or  Piercy's Gone to Soldiers will find this book a fascinating and unusual  companion to those.	2000-07-02

David Malouf, the talented Australian author of this novel, often writes of cultural conflict or misunderstanding, and he never fails to convey the tensions felt by his protagonists as they grapple with the demons they  face.  I probably should have had more faith when I began this novel, but  the plot line is so bizarre that I couldn't imagine becoming involved with  these characters. Exiled to a remote part of Asia Minor where he knows no  one, does not understand the culture, and does not speak the language, the  Roman poet Ovid, after failing to become an integral part of his new  community,  makes contact with a wild child who has been living with  wolves, the only being more isolated than he.  As the unlikely pair begins  to communicate, the author's themes of identity, value, and truth take  shape and lead to an inevitable conclusion.  Ultimately, I did begin to  identify with Ovid and to share the feelings of the wolf child, a tribute  to the awesome ability of this author to create new worlds.	2000-07-02

The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction is not a prize for Best Novel of the Year or Most  Enjoyable Fiction of the Year. Pulitzer specified that his prizes go to books which  study the social, political, and MORAL conditions of the people, and  Martin  Dressler: The Tale of An American  Dreamer certainly fulfills those requirements  well, and gracefully. Martin Dressler is a parable, a relatively short  narrative with a  moral lesson about American  dreams and their importance, even when the  implementation of these dreams fails. In this sense the books seems to be a  particularly American book. As a nation of  immigrants, most of us have been  brought up  on the belief that if you dream high enough and work hard enough, that  you will succeed. And most of us, too, are aware  of the power of advertising, as  Martin  Dressler was, and the need of an entrepreneur to create and sell new  dreams to the public. That we never really identify  with Martin or feel that his  character  develops beyond a few traits which illustrate the message of the book may  be  as much a problem with the form of the  parable as it is with the author's ability to  write novels. Accustomed as we areto books which create unique and  vivid characters who pursue their dreams, we tend to  be as much interested in  the characters as in  the dream. Millhauser wants us to think about the American  dream itself more closely, and he does this with a fast-paced  story of success and  failure which never  resorts to didacticism. Is it my favorite novel? No. Do I think it deserved  the Pulitzer? Probably yes.re which never  resorts to didacticism. Is it my favorite novel? No. Do I think it deserved  the Pulitzer?

With remarkable understatement, a fellow airline passenger tries to prepare Fran Shore for her life as an expatriate wife in Saudi Arabia. A cartographer by profession, she is told, \\"You're redundant. They don't have  maps.\\"     As Mantel unfolds the action, and  lack of action, which take place in the apartment complex where she lives, and in the business community, Fran cannot help but try to create mental maps to make sense of the  culture that has enveloped her.     Bored and frustrated, she is unable to discover what is really happening in the  \\"empty\\" flat upstairs, unable to understand the lives which her devoutly Muslim female neighbors accept as  completely normal, and so overwhelmed that she  wonders, \\"Am I visible?\\"    And that, perhaps, is the point. She IS visible in a heavily veiled world, destined  never to comprehend fully either the daily  lives or culture of her hosts, a culture within which she has tried, unsuccessfully, to maintain her own values.     As Fran  leaves the flat in which she has spent eight months, neither she nor the reader will ever know completely what has happened in the \\"empty\\" flat above or in the now empty flats once belonging to her friends.

Maskell, a thinly disguised Anthony Blunt, is one of several  by now  well-known Cambridge spies from the thirties and forties. Banville vividly  recreates not only the political and social  turmoil of the period but also the  intellectual experimentation and the search for values spawned by these  turbulent  times. The depiction of decadence,  drunkenness, sexual depravity, and social  snobbery, combined with intellectual arrogance and political naivete, all  show the  reader how someone could have been  seduced into becoming a willing spy. Though  it is difficult to feel any real sympathy for Maskell, one can understand  his need for  significance--for something  bigger in his life--and equally, his eventual need to reject  that role. In prose that is astonishing in its facility and  virtuosity, Banville sweeps  away the  fustiness of previous journalistic accounts of the Cambridge spies and  creates flawed, breathing humans	2000-06-27

If someone                              told me that the vividly bloody  action of King Philip's (Indian) War in Massachusetts                               and a Muslim-Hindu holy war near the Coromandel Coast in India were  connected,                              I might look askance in disbelief  that such atrocities on opposite sides of the world,                               committed for totally different reasons, could possibly be related.  If that someone                              then told me that a narrator  might locate a missing three hundred year old jewel by                               using a virtual reality program developed by her MIT  researcher/lover, I'd be                              picturing a  bodice-ripper with Fabio on the cover. And if that someone still had the                               nerve to suggest that all the above could be  combined seamlessly, knowledgeably,                              and  totally successfully in one astounding novel of fewer than 300 pages, I  absolutely                              would not believe it.

With Mooncranker's Gift, Unsworth creates a haunting, exotic, and ultimately erotic climate in which purity and corruption are engaged inextricably in simultaneous battles for the souls of men and women. Farnaby first meets the philosopher Mooncranker when Farnaby is a thirteen-year-old adolescent living with his uncle's family in Surrey and trying to deal with his parents' impending  divorce. Relying heavily on his religious faith to sustain him at this time, Farnaby finds his life permanently  affected when Mooncranker presents him with a  bizarre and ultimately horrifying crucifix.<br /><br />Ten years later, his uncle sends him to search out the alcoholic Mooncranker in Istanbul, a search which finally allows him to confront Mooncranker and to explore the relationships between divinity and decay, freedom and obligation, sex and degradation, and love and death. Uniting these  themes is the overriding question of what makes us happy, and why.<br /><br />As Farnaby reconnects with Miranda, his first love and eventually Mooncranker's secretary and lover, the separate strands of their lives conjoin. At a remote Turkish spa with baths and a variety of strange and  troubled guests, the principals all meet, and  Farnaby, and we, eventually understand Mooncranker's true \\"gift.\\" Counterbalancing beauty with  repulsion, innocence with  violation, and  idealism with cynicism, Unsworth creates a uniquely hypnotic vision of the moral turmoils which engulf us all. n Mary Whipple	2000-06-27

Sherman Alexie is a fantastically gifted writer, and Reservation Blues and his short  stories are recognized as masterpieces. This book, however, is so different in its  focus and execution that one wonders what Alexie's motivation  was in publishing it.  The main character is  despicable--and obviously mentally ill. He brutalizes the most  innocent of victims, shocking the reader with murders  which could not be more  loathsome in their  graphic detail. This violence is gratuitous.  We are given no  understanding of the man or his motivation.<br />  Some might argue that because he was stolen from his  Indian mother and given to  whites to raise  that he never felt part of either the white or Indian worlds, and that this  is his  justification, if not his motivation.  But he was an infant when this happened, however  disgraceful it was, and his adoptive parents were loving ones. It's the  old Nature vs.  Nurture theme, and Alexie  seems to be saying here that Nurture counts for less than  nothing if it takes place in a white environment. Perhaps  Alexie is trying to turn the  tables by having  an Indian exact the kind of gratuitous violence against the white  world that has been exacted against Native Americans.  If that is the case, he has  confused the  issue by having his killer be part of neither culture, with no social  values  from either culture infusing his  actions. And if Alexie's point is that other Indians are  justified in feeling like his killer, one wonders why his  depiction of Indian life in  Reservation  Blues, for example, is so bleak and why his main characters there  escape to the white world, &quot;[singing]  together...with the shadow horses....a song of  mourning that would become a song of celebration.&quot;hy his  depiction of Indian life in                               Reservation  Blues, for example, is so bleak and why his main characters there                                escape to the white world, &quot;[singing]  together...with the shadow horses....a song of                                mourning that would become a song of celebration.&quot;	2000-06-27

Had this beautifully wrought novel not received some publicity for winning the                               Governor General's Award in Canada in l996, I'd never have known of its                               existence,  and what a sad oversight that would have been in this age of pop culture                                and instant bestsellerdom for many books whose  primary value seems to be their                               bankability  as future films. Yet author Vanderhaeghe probably would not have been                                surprised by this. In fact, one of the main themes  of this absorbing and satisfying                               book is the  power of film, &quot;the glory of American lightning,&quot; and the  different goals                               to which it can be adapted by  &quot;artists&quot; and &quot;visionaries.&quot; <br />                               Structurally, the book tells two stories in alternate chapters set in  the Canadian Wild                               West of the l870's and in  Hollywood in the l920's. The author makes no real                                attempt to create suspense about the identity of the Englishman's boy  of the 1870's                               and who he has become by the  1920's. The author has a bigger vision than that.                                Instead, he chooses to reveal small parts of the continuum of history  between these                               dates until at the end the full  story of the Englishman's boy is revealed. At the same                                time, the thematically subtle juxtaposition of specific events  from these dramatically                               different times and  places shows how little human nature has changed and how much                                it is important to be true to ideals and values, whatever  they may be and however                               they may have to  accommodate the changes of history. <br/>                              In  this astutely crafted story of wolfer/hunters, Indians, Hollywood moguls,  young                               strivers toward success, Socialists,  preservers of the status quo, barely surviving                                traders, immigrants, hard men, and &quot;visionaries&quot; who would  impose their dreams on                               the masses via film,  the reader is caught up in the swirl of history and asked to think                                about the extent to which history is simply a  succession of random events, whether                               the  events have been imposed upon us, and how much, if at all, we can control  our                               own dreams and our futures	2000-06-27

The Armenian massacres of 1896, in which the fiancee of the protagonist was raped and then murdered, provide the point of attack for \\"Rage of the Vulture.\\" Twelve years have passed, and the protagonist, an Englishman named Robert  Markham, now married and a father, is posted  to Constantinople in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire.<br /><br />Determined to avenge the death of his former fiancee,  Markham becomes involved in Byzantine  political intrigues conducted by an assortment of exotic characters. Markham is by no means a hero, and his failings of  character are consistent with the decadent  atmosphere of the city.<br /><br />As the Ottoman Empire crumbles, Markham tries to assuage his own sense of guilt and to act. This tumultuous period at the geographical  intersection of East and West is depicted in a gripping narrative which informs the reader at the same time that it  excites, and anyone who has been to Istanbul  will immediately recognize the key sites of the action. Of all of Unsworth's fascinating books, this is my favorite. n Mary Whipple	2000-06-27

Although I have loved other Rushdie novels and admired their complexities, I found  this novel disappointing on a number of levels, not least of which is its clumsiness in  style. Rushdie here veers from narrative to philosophical exposition,  and even  polemic, sometimes within the same  paragraph. He appears to distance himself not  only from his characters but also from his readers. The reader is jarred to  no  purpose when the narrative, which already  switches back and forth in time and  location,  is interrupted yet again for turgid philosophical ramblings which do  nothing  to advance the plot and seem to serve  primarily to give the illusion of depth to a  shallow, too-long story.<br />  At times the  author patronizes both the reader and his characters: &quot;Doorman Shetty  doesn't know it, but he's echoing Plato. This  is what the great philosopher has  Phaedrus  say in the Symposiums's first speech about love....&quot; Two pages of  philosophy follow.<br />  In the conclusion of the book, when it is necessary to tie up the loose  ends, the  author devotes many pages to  &quot;telling about&quot; the action, rather than recreating it and  allowing the reader to draw his/her own conclusions.  In case we have missed the  many parallels he  has made between his characters and the classical myths, he  summarizes them for us. In the final two chapters, he also  shifts the focus, startlingly,  to the  narrator, rather than keeping it on the two characters who have been the  center(s) of the novel. And even on the last  page, the author feels it necessary to  explain, even providing us with the unifying theme of the book, should we  need it: &quot;In  my lifetime, the love of  Ormus and Vina is as close as I've come to a knowledge of  the mythic, the overweening, the divine. Now that they've gone,  the high drama's  over. What remains is  ordinary human life.&quot; The delights of this book, and there are  many, are so deeply hidden in verbiage and in the  exaltation of theme that this  reader, at  least, got tired of the shrieking and longed for a simple song.o characters who have been the                                center(s) of the novel.

I enjoyed Foreign Bodies and found it well written, though I don't especially like the  bright, breezy, slangy style that many writers seem to affect these days. The  book raises some interesting questions about justice and does a  good job of  presenting cultural and  philosophical conflicts between East and West. However, I was uncomfortable  with the  didacticism at the end which combines  with what must be called resignation, at best, and cynicism, at  worst--i.e. we must be patient with the lack of justice  and the complicity of  authorities in  subverting it because the faith of Mei and Andy will conquer all in the  end.  Mei shows no real sign that she will  exercise control of her life, and  Andy will  ultimately waste three years of his life seeing himself as another Job.  While  many &quot;Bad Things Happen to Good  People,&quot; many other bad things are avoidable,  and some bad things are absolutely changeable.  In my opinion, these  characters were too passive to be realistic.	2000-06-27

Set in Alexandria and Cairo just prior to and during World War II, One of Us  depicts the efforts Britain made to control Egypt, Suez, and the destiny of the region.  As  its protectorate was ending, plenipot Malcolm Cheyne believed that the best  way  to control Egypt was through young prince  Farouk--to make him &quot;one of us&quot; by  sending him to school in England, providing tutoring by a young Briton,  James Peel,  and even trying to provide for him  a British bride. As representatives of Britain  enjoyed the sensuous pleasures of Alexandria, manipulated events in Cairo  and at the  palace, and even attempted,  eventually, to influence the by-now King Farouk by  forcing his abdication, feeling quite justified all the while, Farouk  showed how  &quot;one-of-us&quot; he really  was. Playing the Nazis against the British, ignoring the terms  under which Egypt became &quot;independent,&quot;  attempting to seduce Ambassador  Cheyne's wife,  and leading a sensuous life the British ironically considered  debauched, Farouk showed himself to be student who learned  his lessons well. A  fascinating look at a  Egypt in the forties and at Farouk before he became a caricature  of himself.	2000-06-27

In an age like the present, in which even a minor event can sometimes be elevated to  a \\"life-changing experience,\\" one hesitates to say that one short book permanently  changed someone's perception of the world, but it  did for this reader. I was  absolutely stunned  by Caryl Philips's The Nature of Blood!<br /><br />  The  book deals primarily with Eva, a 21-year-old concentration camp survivor  and  her life, thoughts, and memories. A second  major story line involves Othello, hired by  the Doge to lead the Venetian army against the Turks in the late 15th  century, and his  life and passionate love for  Desdemona, the daughter of a Venetian aristocrat. The  two seemingly disparate stories are connected thematically, rather  than narratively, as  the book alternates from  character to character and across time lines. Two other  characters (Eva's uncle and an Ethiopian Jew who immigrates to  Israel) have their  space here, along with a  15th century trial of Jewish money-lenders in Venice, which  connects obliquely with the Othello story.<br /><br />  The novel, which is not linear and does not follow a typical  narrative pattern, is very  impressionistic,  more like a symphony than a traditional novel, with movements and  complimentary themes playing in counterpoint to each  other, The author experiments  successfully  with a variety of voices and points of view, switching back and forth  through nearly 500 years of history and several  pain-filled settings as he illustrates his  themes. It is an intense and emotionally involving story of cultural,  religious, and ethnic  persecution, rivaling  Anne Michaels's Fugitive Pieces in its impact. A truly remarkable  achievement.

There is a great deal of wry humor in  this book, as well as genuine shock and pathos as the main character tries to figure  out who he is and who he will become.  Although some have disdained this book because of &quot;stereotyping,&quot;  I think  it is important to recognize that the  whole concept of the stereotype evolves from the  fact that often there really ARE certain national or ethnic  characteristics observable in  a citizen's  actions! As someone who has worked daily (and very happily) with Japanese  nationals, I resent stereotyping when it interferes with  someone's ability to recognize uniqueness and individuality, but  I do recognize, as  the author does, that  there is a national character involved, too. As the author of this  novel lived and worked in Japan for many years, one  must conclude that he would  not have done so  if he had not enjoyed his life there and the friendships he  presumably made with many Japanese people. I suspect that  many Japanese readers enjoyed this book, too.	2000-06-27

If you are looking  for a book that contains fully integrated themes, a controlling idea, and a  sense that the author has shaped and limited her subject matter, you may be  as disappointed as I was.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Kiana Davenport is  prodigiously talented with the ability to describe ineffable beauty and  horrific ugliness, to use vivid verbs better than most other writers, to  create characters the reader cares about, and to keep her various  narratives moving along smoothly.  Unfortunately, she also gave this  reader, at least, the feeling that she was also &#34;pushing  buttons,&#34; calling up subjects and images that the reader may already  be well familiar with in order to add to the emotional impact of her  story--Hitler's treatment of gypsies and people of color, Japanese  atrocities against comfort women, the excitement of the early jazz scene in  New Orleans, the plight of the women left behind during a war, injustices  against Hawaiians.<br /><br />Her additional resentment against Americans that she  feels have spoiled the &#34;paradise&#34; of the native Hawaiians--the  earliest missionaries, the sugar barons, and even those who argued for  statehood--is palpable, and the political speeches near the end of the book  sound more like newspaper reports used in a term paper than part of a  narrative whole.  In short, a story that starts in Hawaii, moves to New  Orleans, to Paris during World War II, to Shanghai, to Japanese prison  camps, and ultimately back to Hawaii during the push for statehood, is a  story of such enormous scope that this reader, at least, wished the author  had limited her material more effectively and concentrated on developing  relationships more fully.  The theme of prejudice against Hawaiians,  however realistic it may be, is just not enough to bridge the enormous  spatial dislocations of the narrative and keep the reader enthralled with  her characters.eep the reader enthralled with  her characters.	1999-12-19

Makine is an extraordinary writer with many wonderful gifts and great accomplishments.  In this book, however,  the gifts seem to be wasted--or  at least used for dubious effect.  The tale of Olga Arbyelina is  beautifully crafted and presented, but  the actions which give impetus to  the story are repulsive--incest with her son, initially done while she was  drugged and unconscious, but eventually continued, justified to herself,  and  even welcomed.  Olga is only marginally a sympathetic character.  She  seems so sick and seems to learn so little that one wonders why this book  was written.  The universal themes one would expect to see used to try to  justify the subject matter seem missing here, though Pauline Melville uses  similar subject matter in The Ventriloquist's Tale to great and even  positive effect.  The denouement and Olga's madness seemed to me neither  sad nor unexpected.  Ultimately, I found myself wondering why the author  chose to write this story, a romanticized, melodramatic, and  unsatisfying  journey into darkness.	1999-10-16

It is such a pleasure to find a book which grapples with some of the Big Ideas of history. Surely the theory of evolution and the publication of Origin of the Species are among the most life-changing developments in  intellectual history in the past two hundred years.  McDonald does justice  to these, attempting to present momentous ideas with the seriousness they  deserve while at the same time creating compassion for the people whose  immediate lives and religious beliefs are seriously challenged, if not  threatened.  Though some may feel that the use of 19th century language and  vocabulary are pretentious, I found them completely appropriate to the  subject, creating a realistic setting for the ideas and themes.  Since  fiction by definition involves pretense, the use of &quot;dated&quot;  language is not necessarily a failing.  This is a challenging, fascinating  work, which is, at the same time, great fun to read.	1999-07-12

Barker might have entitled this novel Still  Another World, so many overlapping worlds does she present here.  On the surface it is the story of  Nick and the complex life he now shares with his second wife and new son,  his ex-wife and daughter, and his strange stepson.  It is the story,  too, of  the Fanshawe family, a much earlier, and also troubled, family  that once inhabited the house Nick is now restoring.<br />But it is  especially the story of Geordie, Nick's 101-year-old grandfather and the  worlds he has known, including the world of war.  Although Nick learned as  a child that &quot;You had to be two people, one in each world [of family  and of school],&quot; he has always believed that his grandfather  &quot;never changed; belonged to only one world.&quot;  Now that Geordie  is dying, however, Nick learns of Geordie's other worlds: his family life,  his difficulties after World War I, his marriage, his war nightmares,  the  haunting death of his brother in battle, and his mother's comment that the  wrong son died.  And we see the tyranny of memory as Geordie relives his  brother Harry's dying moments.  Geordie himself says, &quot;I know that  what I remember seeing is false.  It can't have been like that, and so the  one thing I need to remember clearly, I can't ....It's as clear as this  hand...only it's wrong.&quot;<br />These vividly depicted battles, real and  symbolic, all raise questions of responsibility and blame as each character  assesses the accuracy of his own memory.  Even the supernatural is evoked,  peripherally,  as characters consider whether they have really seen what  they think they have seen.  As Nick gains knowledge through his time spent  with Geordie, he recalls their visit to the &quot;ageless graves&quot; of  Thiepval, which keep perpetually alive the traumas of a terrible war, and  he recognizes the contrast to the graves of the tiny churchyard in which  Geordie will lie, with names hidden by moss, old mourners dead and  forgotten, and  gently decaying stones.  And he and the reader recognize  that &quot;there's wisdom too in this.&quot;<br />Barker's tightly constructed  plots and themes, her vividly drawn characters, her evocation of  atmosphere,  her deft use of settings to enhance the drama, and her ability  to communicate new visions,  all testify to the brilliance of this novel,  one which may, itself, escape the erosions of time and its  &quot;obliterating grass.&quot;d  forgotten, and  gently decaying stones.

Hilary Mantel often includes the theme of exploitation in her novels, but nowhere is it as prominent as it is in The Giant, O'Brien.  Set in the 18th  century, it is the story of the naïve Irish giant Charles O'Brien, who,  poverty-stricken, allows himself to be taken to London where he will be a  &quot;freak&quot; for the amusement of the public. Everyone wants to profit  from him, from his Irish friends who accompany him, to the agent who  contracts with him and the people who house him.  Amiably, he tells tales  on his travels to amuse his companions, all paralleling in some way the  freakishness of his own life and all ending badly:  a proud woman's  beautiful child is taken and a &quot;yellow child, its skin flapping, its  eyes running and its nose snuffling&quot; is substituted; the seven dwarves  are beaten to death, &quot;each dwarf watching the pulping of his  brother&quot; while &quot;Snow White&quot; is punched in the face, spat at,  and driven from the cottage by fire; a pig-faced girl, instead of being  rescued by the love of a prince, lives a long life of loneliness.  Sensitive and  creative, the Giant is a marked contrast to Dr. John Hunter,  a &quot;scientist&quot; who collects bones, does research on diseases, and  even accidentally inoculates  himself with syphilis, allowing him to study  it more closely.  Hunter's goal is to acquire the bones of the Giant.  As  both the Giant and Hunter become more ill with the progress of their  diseases, the book reaches its climax, leaving the reader to ponder many of  the conflicts Mantel has illustrated-creativity vs. scientific research,  naivete vs. knowledge, hope vs. despair, charity vs. exploitation-and  ultimately, the big question: in what ways, if any, have humans risen above  the level of animals.	1998-12-03

Louis is a thoroughly captivating protagonist, a 13-year-old boy whose attention vacillates between Elroy, his Action Man adventurer, and Valentina, the fortyish romance novelist whose work his mother is translating and with whom Louis is in love. As he comes to know Valentina, Louis wrestles with adolescent urges while contemplating some of life's Big Questions. Valentina's sudden disappearance and Louis's compulsion to find her, however, startle the reader by changing the focus of the book from Louis's character and what he may learn about life to whether or not the mystery will be solved, a significant change. Louis has been reading Le Grand Meaulnes and, later, Crime and Punishment and obviously wants to emulate the detective heroes of these books. In this respect the author may be playing games with the reader. Tremain, like Valentina, is borrowing from other sources, Russian sources, to help her story along. Her decision to create parallels with Crime and Punishment also show how unrealistically Louis relates to Valentina--it's certainly no coincidence that Louis's last name is Little and the &quot;heroine&quot; is his Valentina--but the tone of Crime and Punishment is so brooding and heavy that the parallel didn't feel appropriate here. Tremain, like Valentina, is writing a romance, complete with distressed damsel locked in a tower and waiting for rescue by a knight.  It's an enjoyable story, carefully crafted, with no loose ends, a story in which the reader can appreciate the author's creative process almost as much as its results.	1998-08-07

Set in the 20th century, a fact made clear only because cars and tractors are mentioned once or twice, this novel feels as if it could have been set almost any time over the past 2000 years.  Kurds, Armenians, Yedizis, Turkomans, and even Bedouins inhabit the Turkish/Iraqi border, just after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Time here is not linear, nor is the novel itself, spiralling instead through generations, forced exilings, attempts to settle down, unconscionable atrocities, and rises and falls in fortune.  The novel doubles back upon itself and shows its characters and the mores of its many cultures from different perspectives.  Throughout all this,  a Greek-like chorus of village gossips comments maliciously on the lives of the main characters.  This is especially disconcerting because the main character, Ismail Agha, a Kurd, is a good man who cares for his neighbors.  When he is rich he is admired and respected, but when, in sympathy for his poor neighbors, he uses all his riches to help them and becomes as poor as they, he becomes the subject of their vicious but seductive gossip, slandered by the very people he has helped, who decide that he has found and/or stolen a buried treasure.  Details of the successive depredations by different cultural entities are vividly presented, with the author often using nature and its wildlife to show parallels or contrasts between human and animal behavior.  With the flavor of  a collection of folk tales, this novel offers a unique glimpse of a world largely hidden, except in headlines.	1998-07-12

To the bleak setting and fast pace reminiscent of Louis L'Amour, Turner Hospital adds the philosophical depth and urgency of a Joseph Conrad.  Her deft use of time warps and her creation of a sympathetic main character add drama, suspense, and excitement to what might otherwise be a dark and heavy reading experience.  Unique in setting, theme, and plot, this is a compelling novel sure to captivate and hold the interest of even the most sophisticated reader.	1998-03-24

A tough New Englander rooted in and by  the soil, Aimee holds stubbornly to her ideals in an unforgiving environment, thereby becoming a truly &quot;modern woman,&quot;  one with whom the reader will certainly identify.  Her totally candid views of her stultifying life on the farm, her obvious need for comfort and love, and  her fears and loneliness in the Lowell mill, where she, friendless, attempts to become independent, all give warmth and power to her character. One also cannot help but respond with sympathy to the role her mother is destined to play, while understanding, too, the inevitability of Aimee's rebellion and its consequences.  The story structure itself is somewhat contrived and the plot predictable, an illustration, perhaps, of the lack of choices in the lives of mid-19th century women, but this is a character story and the lack of a unique plot may be appropriate. Whether Aimee's story is approached from a psychological, historical, geographical, or feminist perspective, one will find much satisfaction on every level.	1998-03-01

When it reappears at the book's conclusion, the reader's view of the behavior of some &quot;ordinary&quot; Germans during and after World War II is changed.  Schlink sweeps up the reader and totally immerses him/her in dramatic tension, quick narrative pace, and thought-provoking views of the German past by creating a unique love story involving singular characters and spanning  several decades. The book would have had a longer lasting effect for me, however, if an important &quot;secret,&quot; one which, in fact, impels Hanna's actions, had not been obvious to me from the start.  Her behavior as the book progresses simply confirmed my early suspicions, preventing the suspense from developing fully.  By the time the author formally reveals Hanna's secret, almost 2/3 of the book has passed.  Additionally, I am not sure that protecting this secret is sufficient motivation to rationalize the full extent of Hanna's self-destruction. Michael's philosophical questioning, which adds immeasurably both to the thematic scope  and pleasure of this book, does not fully explain his motivations, his actions, or his inactions, at least on the human level. Nevertheless, this is a totally absorbing, memorable novel with unusual characters in unusual conflicts, one which will reverberate long after you close its covers.	1997-11-16

Bapsi Sidhwa's Cracking India will expand and alter your view of India, Pakistan, and the British Raj.  Using a child-narrator, a literary device over-employed and often unsuccessful, this author has found the perfect vehicle for conveying the heart-breaking story of the Partition of India in l947, without being coy and without descending into bathos.  Lenny,  as the child of a Parsee family, is part of no ethnic majority, and as a result, she roams freely through the  Sikh, Muslim, Hindu, and Parsee society of her household and neighborhood in Lahore.  Because she is lame and receiving private schooling, she is at home when momentous events and important conversations occur, and because she is very young and has no ethnic biases, she observes the disintegration of her society with the puzzlement of an outsider.  An active, loving person, Lenny makes us see the personal and emotional costs of the founding of Pakistan, especially to women and children.  Whether your interest is historical, literary, or feminist, Cracking India will illuminate the dangers and tragedies of creating artificial geographical boundaries.	1997-10-27

If someone told me that an author could transplant a seventeenth century female Protestant from Salem, Massachusetts, to the excesses of southern India and have the character enjoy that life, I might raise an eyebrow at its improbability.  If someone told me that the vividly bloody action of King Philip's (Indian) War in Massachusetts and a Muslim-Hindu holy war near the Coromandel Coast in India were connected, I might look askance in disbelief that such atrocities on opposite sides of the world, committed for totally different reasons, could possibly be related.  If  that someone then  told me that a narrator might locate a missing three hundred year old jewel by  using a virtual reality program developed by her MIT researcher/lover, I'd be picturing a bodice-ripper with Fabio on the cover.  And if that someone still had the nerve to suggest that all the above could be combined seamlessly, knowledgeably, and totally successfully in one astounding novel of fewer than 300 pages, I absolutely would not believe it.  I still don't.  Yet that is exactly what Bharati Mukherjee has done in The Holder of the World.  In doing so, she manages to create a true literary bridge between East and West, reaching so far back to the roots of our respective cultures and thinking that for the first time in the dozen or so novels I've read by Indian authors, I feel as if I'm beginning to understand how and why we and they became who we are	1997-08-28

The French have a bold champion in Andrei Makine.  With his lyrical evocations of France's past, his depiction of France as the epitome of culture and refinement,  the music of  his language, and the obvious love for the culture which he evokes and shares with the reader, it is easy to see why he has won French prizes for this book.<br /> But one does not have to be a Francophile also to find it gorgeous. The narrator of this seemingly autobiographical novel is a young Russian  reminiscing about his remarkable French grandmother, a woman who, after her marriage to a Russian, lived nearly all her adult life in Siberia and whom he visited summers as a teenager.  And it is also the story of the importance of dreams, how they meld imagination and recollection and how they infuse our lives, giving meaning and joy, especially in times of want or sorrow.<br />The narrator's dreams, sparked by the stories his grandmother tells of turn-of-the-century Paris/Atlantis, are not limited by real-life privations, or limited to his own era, country, social circle, or family.  Instead, they allow him to roam through an earlier Paris, to know presidents, to banquet at sumptuous dinners of innumerable courses, to experience romantic love, to share a culture and language with Proust, to see the Paris opera or the circus.  Though he admires the &quot;tempestuous streets&quot; of Paris, so different from the &quot;perfect social calm&quot; and &quot;somnolent tranquility&quot; of Siberia, he discovers, not surprisingly, that his peers resent his inner life-it is &quot;a provocation in the eyes of those who live...in the present.&quot;<br />While the narrator tries to reconcile this constant emotional tension with the simultaneous pressures of adolescence, we come to know his grandmother as an extraordinary woman, a woman who chooses to remain in Siberia where she has suffered greatly and where her husband lies buried, and we can ache for her grandson, whose desire to learn firsthand what she already knows causes him turmoil.  To call this a coming-of-age novel would be to do it a great disservice-the narrator's journey to self-awareness is absolutely unique and provides a thrilling new perspective from which the reader can contemplate his/her own lifet she already knows causes him turmoil.

When asked, rhetorically, by his sister,  &quot;Whatever happened to the dinosaurs?&quot;, Ralph, the main character responds, &quot;Their habitat altered...A change of climate.&quot; In his rebellion against his parents, their closed, religiously fundamentalist point of view, and his father's financial blackmailing regarding his career choices, Ralph intentionally changes his physical habitat and his climate by escaping to South Africa with his bride.  Working as a lay person at a mission and vigorously opposing apartheid, Ralph and Anna eventually are imprisoned, then banished to Bechuanaland, now Botswana.  It is here that the savagery  which creates a permanent and terrible climate in their marriage occurs, a savagery not limited to one race as Ralph and Anna had perceived in South Africa.<br /><br /> As the story bounces from the present in England back twenty years to Africa, the reader lives through the vivid and terrible African experiences and simultaneously sees how they have permeated the lives of these good, but often naïve, people.  Both Ralph and Anna have rejected the traditional religion of their parents in favor of doing good deeds in their family lives and through a social service trust.  But as Ralph's uncle James points out, &quot;There is nothing so appallingly hard...as the business of being human.&quot;  While the reader cheers as James grows and eventually embraces life, s/he also fears for Anna, who remains emotionally closed, despite her good deeds, fearful that she &quot;should lose everything, one of these days.&quot;  As the events resolve themselves and the &quot;competition in goodness&quot; comes to an end, we see real humans trying to put aside the petrified past and to change the climate of their lives, and we will, perhaps, evaluate our own lives: How human are we? Or are we dinosaurs?	1997-08-20

This multileveled novel tells of a young woman who escapes her Irish family, studies music with world class artists and composers, carves out a personal and professional life in a world dominated by men, and then returns briefly for the funeral of her estranged father and reconciliation with her mother.  But it is also a search for grace in its various definitions.  As a composer, Catherine looks for the &quot;notes between the notes...graces, grace notes.&quot;  A Catholic who no longer believes, she sees &quot;music as the grace of God...a way of praying.&quot;<br /><br /> Appalled by the cruelty and intolerance which &quot;religious&quot; men have shown each other throughout history,  she believes that &quot;her act of creation [not religious dogma]...define[s] her as an individual...and define[s] all individuals as important.&quot;<br /> She embarks on a series of religious compositions at the same time that she rejects the church and its teachings about marriage and family.  Choosing not to marry the father of her child, she nevertheless recognizes her daughter as a miracle, a profound mystery which &quot;there was no form of music to celebrate or mark...&quot;<br /><br /> Filled with symbols of Fatherhood, baptism, ascension, rebirth, and ultimate triumph, MacLaverty's Grace Notes is a compelling and sensitive exploration of a young woman's attempt to reconcile her humanity with the universal mysteries of creation.	1997-08-19

The Kirkus Review notwithstanding, this is a much more accessible, though not patronizing, account of a young woman's coming to terms with her family background.  True, it is not &quot;panoramic,&quot; as was Stones from the River. It is, in fact, the opposite, a story of just one real, fully drawn American adult woman who is pregnant, not the story, however wonderful Stones is, of a symbol whose life is different in every respect from that which most of us face daily.  Though The Salt Dancers deals with common enough themes--alienation, the search for love, the desire to reconcile with the past--so do many other novels.  What makes The Salt Dancers worth reading--indeed, what makes most good novels worth reading--is the fresh approach the author makes to these themes.  Hegi's presentation of the distortions of memory alone make the book worth reading.  Those who are expecting a sweeping novel in the tradition of Stones from the River may be disappointed.  This reader, however, found The Salt Dancers more personally involving	1997-08-07

Nobody knows half of what goes on."	\\"The Kingdom is not a logical world.\\"  July 24, 1997<br /><br />With remarkable understatement, a fellow airline passenger tries to prepare Fran Shore for her stay as an expatriate wife in Saudi Arabia. A cartographer by profession, she is told, \\"You're redundant. They don't have maps,\\" an observation which Fran quickly discovers to be correct-she is redundant, irrelevant, and unimportant in this culture, and there is no way for her to participate in this closed society.  With her social life limited almost exclusively to her apartment complex and the foreign business community, Fran writes in her diary, trying to make sense of the culture which envelops her<br /><br />Unable to participate in the world belonging to her Muslim neighbors and unable to explore Jeddah on her own, Fran, bored and frustrated, finds herself fixating on the mysterious activities and strange, painful noises emanating from the supposedly empty apartment above her.  Her female Muslim neighbors seem to accept this mystery without any sense of curiosity, and, to her dismay, she can discover nothing about what's happening up there, despite her growing horror at what she suspects is happening.<br /><br />Overwhelmed by unanswered questions and by the restrictions on her life, Fran wonders, at one point, \\"Am I visible?\\"  And that, perhaps, is the point. She IS visible in a world which values veils, a woman who does not fit into the culture, destined never to comprehend fully the daily lives of her hosts.  Soon the mystery of the flat upstairs and the growing number of empty flats around her assume symbolic significance.<br /><br />Mantel is masterly at creating a sense of place, not surprising since she lived in Saudi Arabia for four years, and with a sharp eye for detail, she creates a devastating portrait of the lives of Saudi women.  With a sense of detachment, she also portrays Fran as a foreigner who means well but has no idea of how she is regarded by the Saudi women who are her neighbors.  The novel is darkly humorous, and consummately ironic, especially in its conclusion.  A fascinating book filled with ambiguities and the differences of perception which arise from different cultures, Eight Months on Ghazzah Street takes a close look at life in Jeddah as it is seen both from the inside and from the outside, and shows the reader that \\"The Kingdom is not a logical world, and besides, logic is not an ornament of young ladies.\\"  Mary Whipples, and consummately ironic, especially in its conclusion.

Of the thousands of books I've read, this is the first one which really made me feel that the author \\"let the story tell itself.\\"  For most of the book, there's no sense that an author is pulling strings or trying to create.  She \\"merely\\" presents fully drawn characters, and they truly live on the page.<br /><br />Yet at the conclusion, the admiring reader realizes that every conflict and ultimate reversal in the book has had a fine hand guiding, but never obviously controlling, it--from Josie's psychological imprisonment to McGreevy's escapes, from her frustrations in love to his satisfactions, from her experiences that life is something that happens to her to his belief that one must mobilize to work toward a higher goal, from their attitudes toward the church to their conflicted feelings about the IRA.<br /><br />Somewhat extravagant in its romanticism at the end, that extravagance, nevertheless, is totally appropriate to its subject, its characters, and its Irish setting.	1997-07-18

Although I thought the style of her earlier novel, Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers was a bit too cute, given its sometimes tough subject matter, I think Yamanaka's current book, Blu's Hanging, is much more controlled.<br /><br />Though she again uses a child's point of view, she expands her visions of life and death, Heaven and Hell, and love and sex, showing a variety of types of each and giving her book a strength and universality which I missed in Wild Meat....It is more a novel in structure, less a series of episodes in the life of the main character.<br /><br />The beginning of the book has some scenes which I wish had been more subtle, but she develops these unpalatable episodes and creates parallels to them throughout the book, giving a depth and symbolism which enhance her messages.  In short, Blu's Hanging is a book to read because it is a good book which goes beyond its very specific setting of a poor family with children growing up on Molokai.

Setting this book in the mid-1800's on the nearly uninhabited north coast of Australia provides David Malouf with plenty of leeway to explore some of his favorite themes.  The book begins with the return to &quot;civilization&quot; of an English cabinboy who had gone overboard twelve years prior and had been nursed by aborigines. With the north coast now being settled by people fearful of the shy aborigines who they think may be a threat to them, all the characters feel isolated: the settlers from life in England, from the more populated centers of Australia, from the aborigines, sometimes from each other, and certainly from the strange young man who has made contact with them; the former cabinboy from his &quot;countrymen,&quot; from the society of the sailors he served, from the aborigines who nursed him, and from the new society now being established on the north coast.  All have differing views of reality, different values, and different understandings of what is important.  The reader is forced to question what constitutes &quot;civilization&quot; and to ponder the extent to which we can have a &quot;real&quot; world without recognizing the importance of the supernatural and those who allow it to inform and transform their lives.<br /><br /> As in &quot;The Conversations at Curlow Creek&quot; and in &quot;Harland's Half Acre,&quot; Malouf's main character  must decide whether he will live in civilization as he has found it.	1997-04-25
