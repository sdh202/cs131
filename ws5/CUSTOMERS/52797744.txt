This is the fourth book in the Lady Grace Mysteries series, about Lady Grace Cavendish, a thirteen-year-old Maid of Honour at the court of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />It's late November of 1569, and thirteen-year-old Lady Grace Cavendish, a Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth I, can't wait to visit the Frost Fair on the frozen river Thames. But while visiting the fair, she and her fellow Maids discover a dead body in a boat frozen into the ice. When Grace discovers that the dead man's body has two coins on his eyes, and that those coins are counterfeit copies of a new coin that has not yet been released, she knows she has another mystery to solve. With the help of her best friends, Ellie the laundry maid, and Masou the tumbler, Grace is determined to find the villain responsible for the counterfeiting and murder. But every suspect seems to lead to a dead end. Will Grace find the true criminal in time?<br /><br />This is another great Elizabethan mystery adventure with the very likable Lady Grace Cavendish. Told in the form of Grace's diary, this book not only has a great story, but brings to life the world of England in 1569. Readers who enjoyed the first three Lady Grace Mysteries won't want to miss this book, and new readers who love historical mysteries should definitely give this series a try. I can't wait to read the fifth book in this series!	2005-10-07

It is set shortly before the anime, Sign, and tells the story of Albireo, a player in very popular online role-playing game The World, and the mysterious AI girl he encounters in a dungeon.<br /><br />Albireo is a solo adventurer in The World -- he is proud to have gotten his character to a high level playing on his own. One day while playing the game, he encounters a silent little girl in red, Lycoris, who is a NPC (non-player character, or AI). Meeting her activates an event that he is determined to finish. Shortly after, he runs into an annoying newbie player, Hokuto, who knows nothing about the right way to play the game. Alibreo is desperate to get rid of Hokuto, but she blackmails him into playing with her. So Albireo is forced to try to complete the Lycoris event with annoying Hokuto following him around. Along the way he uncovers some surprising truths about how The World really works.<br /><br />As a fan of the other .hack stories (the games, animes, and manga), I was very glad to see this novel translated into English. It gives a more detailed backstory for the creation of The World and helps set the scene for the events that take place in the later stories. I'd highly recommend this novel to all .hack fans, and if you're new to The World, this is a great book to start with.	2005-10-07

This is the first in the four part Kingdom Hearts manga, which retells the video game's story in manga form.<br /><br />Kingdom Hearts is the story of Sora, a young boy who lives on an island with his friends and dreams of traveling to other worlds. One night, his wish comes true in a way he never imagined when his island is invaded by fiends, the Heartless, and he is swept away to a strange new place. In this new city, Traverse Town, he meets Donald and Goofy, who are searching for the missing King Mickey, as well as some of the characters from the Final Fantasy series. In hopes of finding his own missing friends, Sora joins Donald and Goofy as they prepare to travel to other worlds in search of clues. Part one concludes with the end of their adventure in the first world they visit, Wonderland.<br /><br />I really loved the Kingdom Hearts game so I was looking forward to reading the manga when I learned about it. The art is very cute and it's a fun way to go through the story again without replaying a 30 hour game, especially with the Kingdom Hearts II game coming out soon. I'd recommend the manga to all Kingdom Hearts fans and I look forward to reading the other three volumes.	2005-10-07

This is the third book in the Lady Grace Mysteries series, about Lady Grace Cavendish, a thirteen-year-old Maid of Honour at the court of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />Thirteen-year-old Lady Grace Cavendish and the rest of the Maids of Honor are on summer progress with Queen Elizabeth I and many other members of her court. While they are staying at the home of the Earl of Leicester, the Queen's old suitor, a series of mysteries accidents happen, all apparently targeting the Queen. Are they truly accidents -- or is someone trying to damage the Earl's reputation? Could it be the Queen's latest suitor, a Swedish prince, whose chances at winning Elizabeth's hand in marriage would be better if she was to become angry with the Earl, believed by many to be her one true love? Grace, with the help of her friends Ellie the laundry maid and Masou the tumbler, is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery before more damage is done.<br /><br />Readers who enjoyed the first two mysteries featuring Grace are sure to like this third book in the series. I highly recommend this series to readers who enjoy mysteries set in historical times. The Elizabethan setting is very interesting, and the characters are very likable. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.	2005-10-07

This is the fifth book in the Lady Grace Mysteries series, about Lady Grace Cavendish, a thirteen-year-old Maid of Honour at the court of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />It's January 1570, and a new visitor is arriving at court. Banoo Yasmine is a young noblewoman from the Middle Eastern country of Sharkand.

In England, she hopes to regain her fortune so she can return to Sharakand and restore the rightful ruler, and has decided to ask the Queen for help. However, soon after Banoo Yasmine arrives, the Heart of Kings, the famed ruby of Sharakand, disappears. Grace's friend Ellie, a young laundrymaid at the palace, is blamed for the theft when the ruby is found in her laundry basket. Grace knows Ellie would never steal and is determined to find the real thief before her friend is punished for something she did not do.<br /><br />I loved the first four Lady Grace mysteries and am pleased to say I loved this one as well. As always, Grace is a great character who brings to life the world of Elizabethan England, and the historical details are excellent. I can't wait to read the upcoming books in this series. I would recommend this series to readers who love historical mysteries or who have a special interest in the Elizabethan era.	2005-10-07

This is the second book in the On the Run series by Gordon Korman, about two young runaway siblings who are determined to find the evidence necessary to free their parents, who have been sentenced to life in prison for the crime of treason.<br /><br />Fifteen-year-old Aiden Falconer and his eleven-year-old sister, Meg, are still on the run from the authorities, continuing their search for evidence they hope will free their parents. They know that their only chance is to track down Frank Lindenauer, the old family friend who, claiming to be a CIA agent, talked the Falconer parents, who were criminologists, into making terrorist profiles that fell into enemy hands. Hoping to learn something about where Frank may be now, the siblings travel to Boston in search of one of Frank's former girlfriends, who may be able to tell them something. They must find a way to survive in the big city while avoiding the law enforcement officials who are still determined to capture the kids.<br /><br />This book was just as exciting as the first book in the On the Run series, Chasing the Falconers. I would recommend this book to all readers who enjoyed the first book in this series, and I think these books would be a good choice for reluctant readers, because they have a lot of suspense that keeps the pages turning. I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series.	2005-09-14

This book is one of the Dear Canada series, which are historical novels, written in diary format, about fictional girls during different periods of Canadian history.<br /><br />Victoria Cope, who lives in the town of Guelph, Ontario, begins her diary on her eleventh birthday. Because her mother is unwell, her father decides the family will take in a Home Child, an orphan from England, to help with the housework. The girl who joins their household is a small, quiet twelve-year-old named Mary Anna Wilson. Through Victoria's diary, we learn of Mary Anna's plight -- her mother died, and she has been separated from her younger brother and sister. Victoria also tells of the daily life for a young girl in Canada in 1897 and her decision to try and help Mary Anna find her family.<br /><br />This was the first book I read in the Dear Canada series and I loved it. It was very well written and keep me interested the entire time. The characters of Victoria and Mary Anna were very realistic and likable, and their stories showed how very different life was for rich children and poor children in the late 1800s. This book is still one of my favorites from the series and I'd highly recommend it to young readers who enjoy historical fiction in diary format.	2005-09-12

The year is 1850, and twelve-year-old Jack Harkett has always lived on his own on the London docks, picking pockets in order to survive. He has no memories of a home or a family. One dark night, a ship sails into port. Jack hopes to steal some money from the rich passengers. But this ship is nearly deserted, and a swarm of bats emerges from it and flies off into the night. The only living human is a young boy named Benedict Cole. Ben is around Jack's age, but from a wealthy family. Ben has just returned from Mexico, where he had gone with his father, an anthropologist, on an expedition in the jungle to study Mayan ruins. But the expedition went horribly wrong when its leader, Sir Donald Finlay, was possessed by the Mayan vampire bat god, Camazotz. Now Sir Donald has returned to England with Camazotz's army of vampire bats, and unleashed them upon unsuspecting London. Jack, Ben, and Ben's older sister Emily, decide they are the only ones who can stop the vampires, and set out to do so against the odds.<br /><br />I love historical fiction as well as thrillers so I really enjoyed this book, a vampire story set in Victorian London. The characters will appeal to kids and the book is age appropriate for middle schoolers, but the unique mythology of the vampires and the exciting story may appeal to older readers as well. This book was a real page-turner, and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the other two books in this trilogy.	2005-09-09

This is the first book in the Blast to the Past series, about the adventures of a group of kids who travel through time and meet famous historical figures, while learning how little it takes to change history.<br /><br />Abigail and her classmates always enjoy Mondays at school, where their teacher asks them \\"what if\\" questions about historical events. This particular Monday, their teacher, Mr. Caruthers, arrives late at class, looking disturbed. After lessons, he confronts Abigail and a few of the other students with some shocking and disturbing news - he just came back from a trip to the past, where he learned Abraham Lincoln was ready to give up on freeing the slaves after a series of battles that the Union Army lost. Mr. C was unable to persuade President Lincoln to change his mind, but he hopes the kids may have more luck. So he sends them back in time, where they meet President Lincoln and must try to persuade him that he will be successful and it's still worth fighting for freedom.<br /><br />I think this book would be a good choice for reluctant young readers -- the characters will appeal to kids, and the book is a fast-paced read that teaches history in a fun way. Kids who already love to read and enjoyed books such as the Magic Tree House series are sure to enjoy it as well.	2005-09-09

This book is one of the Dear Canada series, which are historical novels, written in diary format, about fictional girls during different periods of Canadian history.<br />When Genevieve was about five years old, she and her older brother, Chegual, were the sole survivors of a raid on their Abenaki village. They were rescued and brought to Quebec, where they were taken in by a childless couple, the apothecary and his wife. Not long after the apothecary died, but his wife, Madame Claire, continued to raise the children. Genevieve eventually became more French than Abenaki following her education by the nuns, but her brother never adjusted and eventually left. Now Genevieve is twelve and the year is 1759. She continues to live in Quebec with her adoptive mother, Madame Claire. A war rages between France and England over control of some of the North American colonies, and Genevieve finds her peaceful life changing in many ways when the city of Quebec is put under siege by the British. Her brother returns to the city with his best friend, only for them to go off to battle to defend Quebec with other Indian allies.<br />This was one of the best books in the Dear Canada series. Although it was very sad at times, it was also hopeful. Genevieve was an interesting character - part French, part Abenaki, but fully neither. She was able to give a unique view of the French and Indian War. I'd definitely recommend this book to readers who enjoyed other Dear Canada books.	2005-09-05

This book is part of a new historical fiction series called Portraits. This series imagines what the lives of young girls in famous paintings might have been like. This particular book is based on one of the ballet paintings of Degas.<br /><br />Sylvie Bertrand is a young girl who is studying to be a ballerina at the Paris Opera Ballet School in 1870. Due to poverty, her mother had to leave the ballet to marry years ago and now she is living through her hopes and dreams for Sylvie - if she could not become a famous ballerina, then Sylvie must. Although Sylvie likes the ballet, sometimes she wonders if she will ever have a life beyond her mother's dreams. Her older sister, Chantal, hated the way her mother lived through her and decided to rebel, pretending to be lazy so she would be forced to leave the ballet. When the Franco-Prussian War breaks out and Paris falls under siege, Sylvie gets a glimpse of the real world where there is sickness and starvation. She struggles with how it contrasts with the perfect fantasy world of the ballet. As the situation in Paris worsens, Sylvie decides she must do something to help and in her quest learns even more about the harshness of the real world, but she also learns that ballet is not just her mother's dream but hers as well.<br /><br />I really loved Kathryn Lasky's books for the Dear America and Royal Diaries series, and this book was just as good. This is a very promising new historical series and I definitely look forward to the other books. I'd recommend this book to readers who enjoyed the author's other historical novels, and to new readers who like historical fiction as well.	2005-08-21

This book is one of the Dear Canada series, which are historical novels, written in diary format, about fictional girls during different periods of Canadian history.<br /><br />It is 1721. Twelve-year-old Sophie Loveridge's father has always been a dreamer. Due to his refusal to be practical, the family has never had much money, and so they have lived at the home of Sophie's wealthy uncle, who is a merchant involved in the fish trade. Every summer, ships he owns are sent to New-Found-Land, in the New World, where there is abundant fishing. Sophie's father decides if he can go on an adventure, he can write a book and become famous like the author of Robinson Crusoe. But his dream changes Sophie's life when her father decides his wife and daughter must come along on his New World adventure. He decides they will travel on one of the fishing ships - and when fall comes and the ship returns to England, they will stay behind and spend the winter in the wilderness. Sophie doesn't want to leave England. She hates life on the ship and when they arrive in New-Found-Land she is frightened by such a lonely and desolate place. She becomes happier during the summer as she makes a few friends - the wives of two of the fishermen, an old fisherman who keeps an eye out for Sophie, and the old man's grandson. But when winter comes and almost everyone leaves Sophie is unperepared for how cold and hungry and lonely the winter will be.<br /><br />This book wasn't really one of my favorite Dear Canada books. I still enjoyed it, but I found it slow moving at times, and not as interesting as some of the other books. The character was likable but her family was rather strange and therefore hard to relate to. I would recommend it to readers who are interested in this time period or who want to read all the Dear Canada books but if you are new to the series I would suggest starting with one of the others - my favorites are Orphan at My Door, Banished From Our Home, and With Nothing But Our Courage.	2005-08-19

This new book in the American Girls Collection tells a story about Felicity's best friend, Elizabeth Cole. It is set in the winter of 1775, between the Felicity books Felicity Saves the Day and Changes for Felicity.<br /><br />Elizabeth, with the help of Felicity, loves to play pranks on her snobby older sister, sixteen-year-old Annabelle. When Annabelle becomes betrothed to a rich English nobleman, Elizabeth has a hard time understand why her sister is so happy to marry and move far away to England. Annabelle's betrothed, Lord Harry, turns out to be a clumsy, quiet young man who is ordered around by his older sister, Miss Priscilla. Elizabeth joins Annabelle's etiquette lessons with Miss Priscilla as an opportunity to play pranks on her sister, but her plan backfires. Due to her secret tricks, Annabelle behaves oddly, while Elizabeth appears a proper young lady. Because of this, Miss Priscilla decides she wants to take Elizabeth back to England with her after the wedding, to train her to fit into English society and later find a husband there. Elizabeth now must find a way to convince her parents and Miss Priscilla that she must remain in Virginia.<br /><br />This wasn't a terrible book, but it was one of the more disappointing ones in the American Girls Collection. It was really different from the Felicity books. The plot was very silly, and Elizabeth seemed rather different from her character in Felicity's stories. And there was much less of the historical detail than in the main Felicity series. I'd recommend reading this book if you want to read the whole collection, otherwise you could probably pass on it. It's not a terrible book, but there's nothing really great about it, either.	2005-08-06

But it's not the reunion they have been imagining since she first disappeared, almost a year ago. They can't get back to their own lives -- Mom must remain underground as a member of The Resistance, a group opposing The Company, the spy organization she used to work for until she learned of its unethical goals. But now, she is taking Andrew and Evie to join her in hiding. The danger still remains, and Andrew and Evie are horrified when they learn their father is on the opposite side, as a member of The Company. When Mom gets captured, can Andrew and Evie rescue her?<br /><br />Kids who enjoyed the previous Spy X books are sure to enjoy this one as well, and I'd recommend the whole series to kids who enjoy mystery and adventure series.  Unfortunately, it seems to be the last book for now. I hope there are more books in this series later on, as this one leaves a lot open.	2005-08-02

This book is from the Heartsong Presents historical series, sweet historical romances in various settings with an inspirational theme. This particular book is set in Greenland in the year 996 A.D.<br /><br />Disa always lived isolated from her Viking community in Greenland. She and her parents had converted to the new religion of Christianity, which made them outcasts. And when Disa drowned as a young girl, her mother was able to resuscitate her, causing the other settlers to fear her as someone who had been brought back from death. Because of this, Disa's widowed mother, who is dying, fears her daughter will be left alone after she is gone. So her mother makes a bargain with Thorvald, a man who has been exiled to Greenland for a murder he denies committing, to marry Disa after she dies. When Disa learns of this shortly after her mother's death, she is angry and doesn't want to marry Thorvald, a man she doesn't know, and who doesn't share her faith. But she must in order to protect her land from a greedy neighbor. Can Disa and Thorvald find love in their arranged marriage?<br /><br />This book was another good historical romance from Darlene Mindrup, with yet another unique setting. I had never read a book with this setting before and I really liked it. I also liked how it was more about the day to day life of the Vikings rather than exploring and going to war. I enjoyed the romance as well as the historical detail. I'd recommend this book to readers who enjoyed other books by this author or who like historical romances with unusual settings.	2005-07-31

This book was originally published as \\"A Picture of Freedom,\\" and was part of the Dear America series, fictional diaries of young girls during American history. This book tells the story of a young slave girl who longs for freedom just before the Civil War.<br /><br />The year is 1859. Clotee has lived all twelve years of her life as a slave on the Belmont Plantation in Virginia. Although she has known no life other than that of a slave, she has secretly learned how to read and write, and that ability gives her a glimpse of the world out there. To practice, she keeps a secret diary that she hides in a hollowed-out tree. An orphan most of her life, Clotee has managed to make the best of her circumstances, and writing is one of the few things that brings her any joy. When a tutor comes to the plantation to teach the master's young son, Clotee figures that he'll just be another prejudiced southerner. But he's an abolitionist that further expands Clotee's horizons, and he may be able to give her the one thing she longs for: freedom.<br /><br />This was a wonderful book that brought to life the world of a young slave girl in the pre Civil War south. Clotee came alive and seemed like a real person with real hopes and dreams. I highly recommend this book to young readers with an interest in American history.	2005-07-31

She hears tales of strange \\"feathered people\\" who will attack the settlers. But she has more immediate concerns - the dreadful Billington boys, who mercilessly tease Mem and her friend Hummy, the ever present seasickness, and the daily boredom during the long, tedious sea voyage. But once she arrives in the New World, things become even worse. During the long, cold first winter at Plymouth, many settlers become sick and die. Mem is frightened that her family might be next. When spring comes, she thinks they are safe - until her mother falls ill and dies. Can Mem find the strength and courage to go on without her mother? And can she come to accept her future stepmother, quiet, sad Mistress Potts?<br /><br />What I liked best about this book is that it told what a young girl who sailed on the Mayflower and lived at Plymouth Colony might have thought and done. In making the main character a young girl, the author brought the history to life, and I really like the fictional diary format used in this series - it makes you feel really close to the characters. I'd definitely recommend this book to young readers who enjoy historical fiction.	2005-07-31

This book is from the Heartsong Presents historical series, sweet historical romances in various settings with an inspirational theme. This particular book is set in the Roman port of Ephesus in the year 62 AD.<br /><br />Seventeen-year-old Sara is an ordinary young woman from a Jewish family that has converted to Christianity. She and her family live in a small village near the Roman city of Ephesus. But a chance encounter with Antonius, a wealthy young man who is a Tribune in the Roman Legion, changes her life. When Sara's brother Dathan incurs a gambling debt, Antonius pays it off to prevent the family from being sold into slavery. He takes Sara back to his home in Ephesus, hoping that she can help his sister, Diana, who has been suffering for some time from a mysterious illness brought on by grief. Sara is now a slave, but she can't hate poor Diana, whom she befriends, and she can't even hate Antonius, whom she finds herself attracted to. But he is one of the hated Romans who relentlessly persecute her people, and she is only a slave. Is it possible that things could ever work out between them?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the setting of this book, but I didn't think the romance was as well done as in the other book I read by this author, A Light Within. It may be because this was her first book and she was still a new writer. But she did a good job of bringing the historical setting to life, and the characters were at least somewhat developed. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoyed others by the author but new readers should try one of her others first.	2005-07-14

This is the second graphic novel in the W.I.T.C.H. series. It tells the same story as the third and fourth W.I.T.C.H. novels, Finding Meridian & The Fire of Friendship.<br /><br />In the first story, the guardians - Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia, and Hay Lin - learn that their math teacher, Mrs. Rudolph, is actually from Metamoor. Is she good or evil? Meanwhile Will is dealing with problems at home, as she suspects her recently divorced mother is dating one of her teachers, causing a strain in the mother-daughter relationship. As they continue to investigate the disappearance of their friend, Elyon, they search her house and discover it contains a portal to Metamoor. They travel there and find the city of Meridian, where Elyon is. When they refuse to join the side of Elyon, who has joined with Metamoor's evil ruler, Taranee is kidnapped and the other Guardians are forced to escape back to Earth without her<br /><br />In the second story, the girls must carry on in Heatherfield while trying to come up with a plan to return to Meridian and rescue Taranee. There is tension as Cornelia blames Will for what happened to Taranee. Meanwhile Taranee is held in a magical prison where Elyon is deceiving her, making her believe her friends have forgotten her. When the other Guardians finally travel to Meridian, they discover new dangers in their search for Taranee.<br /><br />Readers of the W.I.T.C.H. novels are sure to love this graphic novel, which is just as good as the first graphic novel. I like the books, but I really love this comic version so much more. The art is really cute, and beautifully done, and I think the comic format is just so much better for telling this story. I can't wait until the next W.I.T.C.H. graphic novel is released, and I highly recommend this comic to all W.I.T.C.H fans.	2005-07-14

After two months they finally reach their destination, only to be told they must turn back because there are not enough supplies for them to spend the winter there. Isobel continues to describe in her diary her life over the next year as her family suffers many hardships while trying to build their new life.<br /><br />This was a very good book from the Dear Canada series, although not among my top favorites. I really enjoyed the early 1800s setting, and Isobel's diary narrative was interesting and moved along well. I'd recommend this book to readers who enjoy historical diary fiction.	2005-07-03

This book is one of the Dear Canada series, which are historical novels, written in diary format, about fictional girls during different periods of Canadian history.<br /><br />Mary MacDonald is a young girl who lives with her family in Albany, New York. But in 1783, after the American Revolution, the family is forced to leave their home just because they supported the British in the war. They decide to head for Quebec, in British Canada. The journey is long, difficult, and dangerous, and the family faces many hardships along the way. Their troubles do not end when they reach their new home and must build a new life in the wilderness from almost nothing. Mary describes her life in her diary as she makes new friends, finds romance, and suffers through hardship and tragedy.<br /><br />This book is one of my favorites in the Dear Canada series. As an American, I also found it interesting to read about the other side in the Revolutionary War. Most of the Loyalists were just ordinary families who happened to support the side that lost, and as a result their lives were turned upside down. Mary was a sympathetic character who came alive in her diary, just an ordinary girl whose family happened to be on the \\"wrong side.\\" I highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy historical diary fiction.	2005-07-03

The Guardians are worried about their friend, Elyon. Elyon grew up with them in Heatherfield, but she turned out to be a member of Metamoor's royal family, who had been brought to Earth for safekeeping after her parents died. Although her older brother, the evil Prince Phobos, has lost some of his influence over her, Elyon is still under his power. He has announced Elyon's coronation as Queen, but Elyon doesn't entirely trust him. And the Guardians feel he may be up to something. They travel to Metamoor, hoping they can convince Elyon that something is truly wrong before it is too late.<br /><br />This was another good book from the W.I.T.C.H. series. It would be very confusing for new readers, but I'd recommend it to all the readers who have read the first ten books in the series. I can't wait to read the next book in the series which concludes this story arc. I'd recommend the series mostly to young readers who enjoy fantasies with strong female characters. However I am much older then the target audience and enjoy this series a lot, especially the comic excerpts featured at the beginning and end of each book.	2005-07-01

Rachel is devastated to leave her beloved Africa and travel to cold, lonely England. She finds herself coming to care for her \\"Grandfather,\\" but hates living a lie, and fears the Pritchards will someday follow her to England. At the same time, she is determined to find a way to return to Africa and reopen her parents' hospital.<br /><br />Listening for Lions is another excellent historical novel by Gloria Whelan, who is one of my favorite authors. Rachel was a very likable and determined character, and I loved the unique storyline and historical setting -- the author brought the African and British settings to life. I recommend this book to all readers who enjoyed previous books by Gloria Whelan or who love historical fiction.	2005-06-07

Grace knows Ellie would never steal and is determined to find the real thief before her friend is punished for something she did not do.<br /><br />I loved the first four Lady Grace mysteries and am pleased to say I loved this one as well. As always, Grace is a great character who brings to life the world of Elizabethan England, and the historical details are excellent. I can't wait to read the upcoming books in this series. I would recommend this series to readers who love historical mysteries or who have a special interest in the Elizabethan era.	2005-06-07

This series is set in Biblical times and uses a diary format to tell the stories of fictional young girls who encounter notable women of the Bible.<br /><br />This book tells the story of Laila, a twelve-year-old Jewish girl living in Egypt in the years 1527 and 1526 BC. The Jewish people once had a good life in Egypt, but the current Pharaoh is a cruel man. He forces the Jewish men to labor for him, building fortress cities. Laila and her best friend Miriam are worried about their people. When Pharaoh issues a decree stating that all Jewish baby boys must be killed at birth, the girls are horrified but determined to find a way to help. Soon after, however, Miriam's mother learns she is pregnant. Miriam's father believes the child will be a baby boy who has been chosen by God to someday free their people from slavery in Egypt. But when the baby is born, will they be able to protect him?<br /><br />This book is my favorite of the Promised Land Diaries I have read so far. Laila is an appealing character and her diary narration is fascinating. Through it, I learned a lot about life for the Jewish people in ancient Egypt, as well as the customs followed by the Egyptians. This was a very good retelling of the story of Miriam and her baby brother, who later became Moses, through the eyes of an ordinary young girl, and it also tells a lot about life in the ancient world. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy retellings of Bible stories or who like historical fiction set in this era.	2005-06-07

Sir Drear's lessons are very boring, and Alissa hates them. However, during a lesson in the portrait gallery, she notices a new painting she has never seen before. Sir Drear refuses to talk about it, so Alissa asks many of the people around the castle about the portrait. She learns the man in the painting is Sir Grendon, who was Sir Drear's grandfather, and the steward to Alissa's great-grandfather. However, during a time of tragedy in Arcadia, he apparently fled, abandoning his responsibilities to the people. Alissa feels there is more to this story and determines to uncover the truth.<br /><br />This was a good second book in the series.

They may have solved other mysteries, but this time a man is dead and it's just too dangerous. Gwyneth and Hereward resent this, and decide to investigate the mystery on their own anyway.

As with the previous books, the Medieval setting is very well done and the story is a real page-turner. I look forward to reading the fourth book in this series and seeing what adventures the Mason children experience next.	2005-05-22

He accepts a job in the small town of Sleepy Hollow, New York. But from the time the Lancasters arrive in town, strange things begin to happen, events that seem to have no explanation outside the supernatural. Sleepy Hollow has always been a town of legend and myth, but now it seems that those legends are coming alive. And when an apparently headless horseman begins murdering people in town, Shane and Aimee begin to fear for their lives, and the two teens decide to try and uncover the truth, even though the adults insist it must be an ordinary murderer dressed up as the horseman.<br /><br />This book was a lot better than most teen horror books I've read. I thought it had a very interesting and unique concept, a modern retelling of the legend of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow. Shane and Aimee are releastic teen characters that act like real siblings do. Due to violence and some language, I would only recommend this book to readers ages 13 and up. I think teenagers who enjoy horror stories will enjoy this book a lot.<br /><br />Reviewed by Rebecca Herman for Flamingnet Book Reviews, [...]	2005-05-21

It tells the same story as the first two W.I.T.C.H. novels, The Power of Five and The Disappearance.<br /><br />In the first story, Will is a young teenage girl who is new to the town of Heatherfield. At her new school, the Sheffield Institute, she meets four other girls -- Irma, Taranee, Cornelia, and Hay Lin -- and they quickly become friends. Soon after, however, strange things begin to happen in Heatherfield. The girls seem to have developed mysterious powers as well. They learn they are the Guardians of the Veil and have the power and responsibility to protect earth from invasion by the creatures of Metamoor, another dimension that is populated by evil beings. In the second story, the girls' friend Elyon has disappeared, and as they search for her, they encounter more trouble from Metamoor.<br /><br />Readers of the W.I.T.C.H. novels are sure to love this graphic novel. I like the books, but I really love this comic version so much more. The art is really cute, and beautifully done, and I think the comic format is just so much better for telling this story. I can't wait until the second W.I.T.C.H. graphic novel is released, and I highly recommend this comic to all W.I.T.C.H fans.	2005-04-30

This quartet tells the story of a young girl and her horse in Medieval Ireland.<br /><br />Nine-year-old Lara lives in fourteenth century Ireland, where she is the daughter of her clan's leader.

But they stay longer in England than intended, and eight years pass before Annabelle and her father board the Titanic on it's maiden voyage to America, returing home at last. But Annabelle is shocked when she encounters Lawrence Caldwell on board the ship. In England, Lawrence was Annabelle's childhood love, but she never expected him to return her feelings because he was six years older. Seeing him again only reminds her of that.

Will they realize their love in time, before tragedy strikes?<br /><br />This was a pretty good sweet historical romance set during the tragic voyage of the Titanic, although I did find it a bit hard to get into at first.

Sixteen-year-old Lady Margarethe lives at the castle of her aunt and uncle as she studies music, under the instruction of Willem. Willem is a landless young nobleman, the younger son of a poor noble family. Margarethe and Willem are secretly in love, but because Willem will never have land of his own, they will never be able to marry. And now the time has come for Margarethe to be betrothed. When Margarethe's uncle learns of her and Willem's love, he sends Willem away to work at the castle of his ally, Lord Otto. But soon Margarethe must also travel there, and seeing Willem again only makes it harder -- especially since she is soon to be betrothed to Lord Otto's son Gregor. Gregor is a good and kind man, but Margarethe knows that she will never love him the way she loves Willem. Can Margarethe and Willem find, by some miracle, a way to be together?<br /><br />This was an enjoyable sweet historical romance. The setting of Germany and the musical theme made it very unique and different from other Medieval romances.

This book is from the Heartsong Presents historical series, sweet historical romances in various settings with an inspirational theme. This particular book is set in early nineteeth centry America.<br /><br />In a small Connecticut town in the early 1800s, seventeen-year-old Emily Goodman feels little happiness. Her mother is cruel to her, and soon her married older sister, Elizabeth, will move to the New York frontier with her husband David and his family. Not only does Emily feel sadness that her sister will leave, but also because David's younger brother Jonathan will be moving as well. Emily has feelings for Jonathan, but if he leaves she will never learn if he could love her. When Elizabeth becomes pregnant, she and David decide to stay behind another year, for the baby to be born and grow a bit before moving to the frontier. To help her sister with the baby, Emily comes along when Elizabeth and David finally move to New York the next year. Emily is very excited to see Jonathan again, and is thrilled when she finds he loves her. They make plans to marry, but Emily feels she must seek her father's approval, and when no word comes, she wonders if they will ever truly be together.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the details of life on the New York frontier of the early 1800s, and the romance between Emily and Jonathan was very sweet. The setting of this book and the hardships faced by the early pioneers really came to life. However, Emily's determination to seek her father's blessing for her marriage, and the delays that followed, seemed to be there less for the story and more to keep the book going, as Emily and Jonathan realized their feelings for each other early on. I would have preferred if the book had spent more time on Emily and Jonathan falling in love, and less on their long wait afterward. Still, I overall enjoyed this book. It was a nice sweet story of early American life.	2005-03-18

This particular book is set during the voyage of the Titanic in 1912.<br /><br />Twenty-four-year old ship's stewardess Esther Mason is tired of waiting. For several years, she has had a relationship with fellow steward John Addison. But John is reluctant to give up the life at sea, and Esther wonders if he will ever want to marry her and settle down; it always seems to be just \\"one more voyage.\\" Now, they have both been assigned to work in first class on the maiden voyage of the Titanic, and Esther knows she won't be able to avoid John forever; they need to find out where their relationship really stands. Meanwhile, Esther finds herself becoming involved with Philip Winslow, a wealthy passenger in first class. Philip had led something of a wild life, but finds himself drawn to Esther and wanting to become a better man for her. John sees what he thinks is a relationship developing between Philip and Esther, and fears the worst. Esther struggles to decide the right course for her life as the Titanic sails toward tragedy.<br /><br />This was a pretty good historical romance that should appeal to readers fascinated by the story of the Titanic. It was rather predictable; it was pretty obvious to me what Esther's final choice would be. However, it's not really any more predictable than other romance novels. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy a sweet romance and who love to read books set on the Titanic.	2005-01-24

This book is from the Heartsong Presents historical series, sweet historical romances in various settings with an inspirational theme. This particular book is set in Massachusetts during the early years of the Revolutionary War.<br /><br />An ardent Patriot, eighteen-year-old Delight Butler carried messages in 1776 Boston, hoping to do her part for the cause of liberty. But then her father decided to move his family from the British-occupied city to the quiet countryside town of Chesterfield. A year and a half passes, and Delight longs to do something for American independence. When Henry O'Neill, a wounded British soldier, is brought to the Butler home for recovery, Delight resents having to care for one of the enemy. A poor Irishman, Henry had enlisted in the British army in hopes of starting a new life in America after the war. However, Henry's time in the Butler home convinces him the British are wrong, and that the colonies should be free. And soon Delight and Henry begin to fall in love, but Delight fears for the future and Henry doesn't believe she loves him.<br /><br />This was a pretty good romance that fans of colonial settings should enjoy. The romance and characters were better developed then in many other Heartsong books, but the ending was rather abrupt and I wish it could have had more detail. I'd recommend this book to readers who enjoy sweet historical romances with early American settings.	2005-01-17

Ever since she saw her first ghost at the age of two, Susannah Simon has been a mediator - in other words, a contact person between the living and the dead. It's her responsibility to help troubled spirits move on to the next world. And it's a responsibility she has always resented. At sixteen, Susannah just wants to be a normal teenage girl, worried about clothes and boys, not dead people. And now that her mom's remarried, she's had to leave New York City, the only home she's ever known, to move all the way to northern California. Her new stepdad's not too bad, but her three stepbrothers are a pain, and on the first day of school, she's confronted by the angry ghost of Heather, a girl who committed suicide over Christmas break. Susannah figures it won't be too hard to get Heather to move on - until it becomes clear that she's the most violent spirit Susannah has ever encountered. Heather won't rest until she gets revenge on her ex-boyfriend for breaking up with her.<br /><br />This book starts off a great series by Meg Cabot that is one of my favorite series ever. The next five books are just as great. This series combines mystery, suspense, humor, and romance, and so will appeal to teens with various tastes in reading. I also highly recommend that all of Meg Cabot's fans give it a try - even though this series is very different than her other books, in my opinion, it's her best ever.	2005-01-14

High school sophomore Susannah Simon - Suze for short - is getting used to her new home in southern California following her mother's remarriage. It's a pain living in the same house as three annoying stepbrothers, but at least she's making friends at school and even has met a guy who seems interested in her. But as usual, her role as a mediator - a human who helps guide wayward spirits to their final resting place - gets in the way of her social life. One night, the ghost of a woman appears to Suze, begging her to tell \\"Red\\" that he wasn't responsible for her death. Suze does some asking around and comes to the conclusion that the woman means \\"Red\\" Beaumont - who, unfortunately, is the father of Suze's prospective boyfriend! Of course she's upset that the only guy who's ever asked her out may be the son of a murderer. But nothing can prepare Suze for the web of intrigue she uncovers, which includes a corrupt businessman, a string of disappearances, and possibly even a vampire! This entertaining teen series combines mystery, suspense, and humor for a great read. I'd recommend that all of Meg Cabot's fans give this great series a try.	2005-01-14

Sixteen-year-old Suze Simon never likes being a Mediator, a person able to see and communicate with ghosts. But it can be especially annoying when she's trying to enjoy a sunny California spring day on the beach and encouters the spirits of four teenagers who died in a tragic car accident. The ghosts are out for revenge and want to kill Michael, who was in the other car and who they believe deliberatley ran them off the road and over a cliff. Now Suze has to protect Michael, which means pretending to like him, and going out on an actual date with him! But when Suze, Father Dominic, and Jesse visit the scene of the accident, they discover evidence that leads Suze to wonder if Michael truly did murder those teens. And if her suspicions are true, her own life may be in grave danger. I highly reccomend this book to readers who enjoyed the first two books in the series, and all of Meg Cabot's fans should give this wonderful series a try.	2005-01-14

This is the seventh book in the South Seas Adventure series. This series is about the adventures of Abby Kendall, a young teenage girl, and her family and friends as they travel the South Seas in the late 1840s.<br /><br />Fourteen-year-old Abby Kendall and her family and friends have sailed to the beautiful island nation of Tahiti. They plan to trade there, but they've also made the trip for a special event: Uncle Samuel's wedding to Lani, a beautiful half-Hawaiian woman who has traveled with them for several months. But while exploring the royal palace with one of their new Tahitian friends, Abby and Luke discover that Jean-Paul, a French artist, is being held captive. Jean-Paul is being forced to paint portraits for the Queen's evil cousin, Chief Ono. They also discover hints of a possible conspiracy against the Queen. While trying to help Jean-Paul, Abby herself is taken captive. As she tries to discover what is going on in the palace, Luke and the others must come up with a plan to rescue her.<br /><br />Trouble in Tahiti is another great book from the South Seas Adventures series. As always, it was very enjoyable to read about Abby, her family and friends, and the new people they meet during their travels. I loved the exotic and unique setting of Tahiti, and the story was a real page-turner. Readers who have read the previous Abby adventures won't want to miss out on this book.	2005-01-11

This is the fourth book in The American Adventure series. This series tells about the lives of children from many generations of a fictional family throughout American history, from the settling of Plymouth by the Pilgrims through the end of World War II.<br /><br />It's 1635 in Boston, and life for fourteen-year-old Phillip Smythe and his family, which had changed so much for the better, is turned upside down by a series of disasters. Phillip had been so happy -- his frail younger sister, Leah, was finally healthy, and his dream of becoming an apothecary's apprentice had come true. But a terrible cyclone that strikes Boston changes all that. Phillip's father's carpentry shop is destroyed, and Mr. Smythe must travel to England to earn enough money to rebuilt. Shortly after Mr. Smythe leaves, Phillip's older brother, John, becomes involved in drinking and gambling, and then family's home burns down. Even more hardship and tragedy follows, and Phillip feels as if his dreams have died forever.<br /><br />This was probably my least favorite of the American Adventure books I have read so far. I was happy to see it was a direct sequel to the previous book in the series, Dream Seekers. However, I was disappointed by how much tragedy happened in this story, in particular the death of a character which I felt to be very unnecessary; enough bad had already happened. I would only recommend this book to readers who want to read the entire series. I personally feel the ending of Dream Seekers was a better conclusion to the story of Phillip and his family.	2005-01-08

This particular book is set in British-occupied Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War.<br /><br />It's September 1777 in Pennsylvania, and the Revolutionary War rages throughout the land. Meredith Elliot receives a message from her brother Matt, a Patriot spy. Matt fears he will soon be captured and has sent Merry a note to pass on to General Washington. The same day, she meets Will Castleton, a young Englishman from Boston. The next day, Merry and her Aunt Mina travel to Philadelphia for a shopping trip and a visit with Merry's father, who works as a doctor there. Merry passes on the message -- and soon runs into Will again. When British soldiers invade Philadelphia the next morning, Merry and her aunt are trapped in the city. Merry and Will then begin to fall in love, but although he appears neutral, concerned only with the family shipping business, Merry doesn't want to trust an Englishman, especially when she is passing on messages to the Patriots. Life becomes even more dangerous for her when Major Hastings, a cruel British officer, begins to suspect that Merry is a spy. As Merry fears for her safety, she also worries about the fates of Will, who has returned to Boston, and Matt, who never sent another message.<br /><br />This was a pretty good sweet historical romance. I loved the setting during the American Revolution; this setting is a favorite of mine but not too common in any type of romance. The setting and historical background were nicely developed, but the characters and romance needed more work, especially considering this is a romance, after all. Merry was the most developed character, but even she didn't really come alive. Will's point of view is never given so his character suffers even more. The strength of the book is really in the historical setting, which is the best part of it. Therefore, I would recommend this book to readers who, like me, are big fans of this time period.ders who, like me, are big fans of this time period.	2005-01-02

Now she must leave her home to travel north to Rene's home in Brooklyn. Rose must adjust to being mistress of her own home, to being a married woman, when in many ways she is still just a child.<br /><br />This book is another excellent history novel by Ann Rinaldi, based on the life of her grandparents, Rose and Rene. Rose was an excellent character, and the author really showed how she was caught between girlhood and womanhood. I also loved how this book was written in the form of a diary.

Anacaona's story begins in the year 1490 when she is about sixteen years old. Her uncle is the cacique, or supreme ruler, of their province of Xaragua, located in what is now Haiti. Anacaona and her older brother, Behechio, have been raised to become the future rulers of Xaragua. But Anacaona gives up her birthright to marry Caonabo, the cacique of the nearby province of Maguana. Anacaona loves her husband and is happy in her marriage, and her joy only increases after the birth of their daughter, Higuamota. But life for their people is about to change forever when strange pale-faced men arrive from the sea and threaten their way of life and their very survival.<br /><br />The author has done an excellent job at bringing to life Anacaona and her Taino people, and their life before and after the arrival of European explorers. This book shows how tragic the \\"discovery\\" of the Americas ultimately was for these native people, who were nearly all decimated within a few decades of Columbus's arrival. This book is an excellent addition to the Royal Diaries series, but it is not really for younger readers of the series. Due to some of the content, I would recommend it more to teen readers who enjoy this series or who are interested in this subject.	2004-12-25

This book is from the Heartsong Presents historical series, sweet historical romances in various settings with an inspirational theme. This particular book is set just after the end of the Civil War in Alabama, as the Reconstruction era begins.<br /><br />It's May 1865, and the Civil War is finally over, but for Grace Cunningham, the hardship has not ended. Her older brother died in battle, and she and her mother haven't had word from her father in so long that Grace assumes he has died as well. Just nineteen years old, Grace must keep their Alabama farm running so that the bank does not take it away and sell it to Yankee carpetbaggers, for her mother is not strong enough emotionally. One day, a Northerner, Jonathan Parker arrives, bringing Grace's father's Bible -- and the news that he has most likely died of a terrible illness. Even though he is a Yankee, one of the enemy, Grace finds herself falling in love with Jonathan. But Jonathan is determined to return to his home in Kentucky once he fulfills what he sees as his obligation to Grace and her mother -- and following him would mean leaving her beloved home.<br /><br />This was a pretty good sweet historical romance set in the Alabama countryside immediately following the Civil War. However, the characters were a bit weak -- Grace fell in love with Jonathan very fast, and since the entire book was from Grace's third person point of view, a look at Jonathan's side of the story is never given, which I would have liked. Fans of sweet romances who enjoy this historical time period might want to give this book a try, however. It's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.	2004-12-23

But after a long and difficult sea voyage, the Mayflower arrives in Cape Cod in the dead of winter. On deck one night, Elizabeth sees Dorothy Bradford, one of the other passengers, standing by the railing, but tells no one. The next morning, Dorothy has disappeared, presumed drowned. Elizabeth feels terrible guilt and is determined to hide her secret, fearing blame. Soon after, both of Elizabeth's parents die from disease. Elizabeth feels all alone, without family and with few friends, and burdened by the terrible secret she hides.<br /><br />This was a good historical novel about the voyage on the Mayflower and the settling of Plymouth colony. Elizabeth Tilley was a real passenger on the Mayflower, and the authors did a good job at imagining what her life might have been like in the first years of the colony. I would recommend this book to young readers who enjoy stories about Colonial America and the Pilgrims.	2004-12-17

Her guard is Laramie, the son of the outlaws' leader. But Laramie is not like the other outlaws. He finds himself struggling with his duties as Ariana's guard, and knows in his heart it is not right to hold an innocent young woman prisoner. And Ariana finds herself strangely trusting him. Laramie comes up with a daring plan to help her escape, even though it means separating himself from his father forever. But will the plan work?<br /><br />This was a decent historical western adventure, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the other book I read by this author. This was mainly due to the ending of the book. Toward the end of the book, the author threw in a plot device that seemed to be there in order to place one more obstacle in the path of the characters so that the book would be a bit longer. I still enjoyed this book overall, I just wish the ending had been less contrived. I would recommend this book to fans of the author, but new readers looking to try a Janette Oke book would be better off reading a different one instead.	2004-12-12

A loan is due soon at the bank, and if they don't pay, they will never be able to protect their secret.<br /><br />This was a good sequel to \\"Angels Watching Over Me\\" that continues the story of Mayme and Katie, and introduces some new characters as well. I really enjoyed the first book, and this was an excellent sequel. It brings to life the dangers of the post-Civil War South and is a heartwarming story of friendship.

She loved her \\"mammy,\\" Tessie, and spent her days playing with Tessie's son, Grady, who was like a little brother to Caroline. But when her father sells Grady, Caroline realizes her views on slavery are not the same as those shared by the rest of Virginia. The time she spends in Philadelphia with relatives after the death of her mother only cements her view that slavery is a moral wrong that must be ended. But returning to Richmond, she realizes that will be a lot harder than she imagined. Against her own will, Caroline finds herself falling in love with Charles St. John, the son of a wealthy Richmond businessman and a defender of slavery. Caroline and Charles become engaged to be married, but the Civil War breaks out just three months before their wedding was to take place. Charles goes off to fight for the Confederacy, even though Caroline begs him not to. When her father leaves as well, Caroline finds herself alone in Richmond and torn in two. She struggles with her conflicting loyalties to her home and family, and to the cause she so strongly believes in.<br /><br />This was an excellent historical novel. Caroline was a wonderful and very human character who came alive through her first-person narrative. Her struggles felt very real to me. The author brought to life Virginia just before and during the Civil War very well. Although this book was very long, I never lost interest in it. My one complaint is that the final thirty pages were told in a third-person point of view. I would have liked the whole book to be narrated by Caroline; it felt odd after four hundred pages for the viewpoint to change. However, it doesn't really take away from the book that much; overall, I still loved it.

Although George doesn't judge Charles, some of the other boys at school do, and it makes him uncomfortable. And soon he has more worries, as a series of unexpected earthquakes shake Cincinnati.<br /><br />This was a pretty good book from the American Adventure series. I was a little disappointed that the earthquakes didn't play more of a role in the story, however. Given the title of the book, I thought they'd be one of the main focuses, but the first one didn't show up until about halfway through the book. Still, I did enjoy this book, and would recommend it to other readers who enjoy the books in this series.	2004-11-29

This is the seventh book in The American Adventure series. This series tells about the lives of children from many generations of a fictional family throughout American history, from the settling of Plymouth by the Pilgrims through the end of World War II.<br /><br />It's the spring of 1721 in Boston, and eleven-year-old Rob Allerton has problems. He would like to study to be an apothecary with his good friend, Dr. Boylston. However, his wealthy stepfather, Josiah Foy, has forced Rob to become an apprentice at his shipping business. In addition, Rob is constantly fighting with his stepbrother, Thomas, who resents Rob and is constantly teasing their little sister, Rachel. But soon these problems begin to seem trivial, when a deadly outbreak of smallpox hits Boston. Dr. Bolyston wants to give people an experimental inoculation he believes protects against the disease, but Rob's stepfather forbids anyone in the family to get one. Can Rob persuade his stepfather to change his mind before it's too late?<br /><br />This was another good book from the American Adventure series. Rob was a sympathetic character, the story was interesting, and I enjoyed the colonial setting. Readers who enjoyed the other books in the American Adventure series will definitely want to read this one as well. I also recommend it to readers who are new to the series and are interested in this time period in history.	2004-11-25

This is the sixth book in the South Seas Adventure series. This series is about the adventures of Abby Kendall, a young teenage girl, and her family and friends as they travel the South Seas in the late 1840s.<br /><br />Fourteen-year-old Abby Kendall and her family and friends are sailing through the Indonesian islands when they spot a peaceful little uncharted island. They decide to stop for a rest and to gather supplies there, and on the island meet Sulia, a native woman, and her eleven-year-old granddaughter, Paloa. Abby and Luke befriend Paloa and explore the beautiful jungles of the island. But the island is deceptively peaceful, with many dangers lurking, including giant lizards that remind Abby of dragons, powerful earthquakes, and a simmering volcano that threatens to erupt.<br /><br />This book is another exciting adventure featuring Abby and her family and friends. I loved the unique setting of an Indonesian island, and as always the likable characters were very fun to read about. I highly recommend this book to readers who enjoyed the first five books in the South Seas Adventures series, and I can't wait to read the final two books in the series.	2004-11-20

This is the twelfth book in The American Adventure series. This series tells about the lives of children from many generations of a fictional family throughout American history, from the settling of Plymouth by the Pilgrims through the end of World War II.<br /><br />Eight-year-old Paul Lankford's father has been away fighting in the American Revolution for most of Paul's life. Because he has only seen his father a few times in the past six years, Paul barely knows him. So when the war finally ends in 1781 and Paul's father returns home, he has a difficult time adjusting to the change. Paul's father is very strict, and doesn't seem to understand Paul at all. Paul would like to be a shipbuilder, like his Uncle Ethan, but he fears telling his father he doesn't want to follow in his footsteps as a printer. Over the next two years, Paul struggles to form a better relationship with his father and gain the courage to determine his own future.<br /><br />This was probably among my least favorite books in the American Adventure series. It wasn't a bad book, but I found it hard to get interested in, because it didn't really have a strong plot. It also seemed to have more historical details and less story in it than some of the other books in the series. However, I would recommend it to readers who, like me, want to read the entire series.	2004-11-18

Lady Jane Grey, who was Queen of England for nine days at the age of fifteen before being executed for treason, narrates her story beginning at age nine. Unloved by her parents, young Jane had an unhappy and lonely childhood. Sent to court at age nine, she finally gained happiness as a maid of honor to Queen Katharine, wife of King Henry VIII. Even after the king dies, Jane remains a member of Katharine's household, but even that happiness is lost when Katharine dies in childbirth after remarrying. Returning home, Jane must once again endure her parents' cruelty, as they scheme to arrange a marriage for her that will bring them wealth and power. But when the young King Edward, Jane's beloved cousin, dies, Jane is unprepared for how far they will go. Staunch Protestants, Jane's parents are determined that Edward's Catholic half-sister Mary will not become queen -- and so they force their daughter to accept the crown of England in a plot that is doomed to failure.<br /><br />This was an excellent historical novel for teens that tells the tragic story of Lady Jane Grey. I was really looking forward to reading this book, because I love historical novels about royalty, and Ann Rinaldi is one of my favorite authors. I am happy to say I am not disappointed at all. Ann Rinaldi brings Jane to life as an intelligent girl, observant and wise beyond her years, who against her will became a pawn in a power struggle she wanted no part in. This makes the inevitably sad ending even more tragic. Teen readers who are interested in historical fiction about royalty should definitely read this book.	2004-11-14

When twelve-year-old Emilie Borner's parents decide to emigrate from Germany to America in 1855, she has mixed feelings. She is excited about the better opportunities her family will have in America, but she will miss her best friend, and is worried about her older brother Karl, who wants to stay in Germany. Her worst fears come true when Karl runs away just before the family is to board the ship. Even worse, Emilie's mother decides to stay behind and search for Karl, while Emilie, her father, and her younger brother continue on to America. The long voyage across the ocean is difficult, and is made worse by Emilie's longing for her mother, and the fact that Rosamund, a mean girl from her village, is traveling on the same ship. Rosamund seems determined to make things worse for Emilie. What awaits the Borners in America? And will Emilie ever see her mother and Karl again?<br /><br />Although not among my top favorites, this was an enjoyable story about a young immigrant girl's life. However, I felt that the ending was very abrupt, and I would have liked to read more about Emilie's life in America, as most of the book took place on the ship. However, young readers who enjoy historical fiction immigrant stories will most likely still enjoy this book.	2004-11-13

This book is from the Heartsong Presents historical series, sweet historical romances in various settings with an inspirational theme. This particular book is set during the Acadian removal from Canada in 1755.<br /><br />Seventeen-year-old Angelique Boudreau couldn't be happier, for she is soon to marry nineteen-year-old Joseph Landry, the man she loves more than anything in the world. But it's October of 1755, and life for Angelique, Joseph, and the other Acadians in their town of Grand Pre, Nova Scotia is about to change forever. One terrible day, the Acadian men of Grand Pre are deported by the British, and Angelique fears she will never see her father and her beloved Joseph again. Because her mother is eight months pregnant and feeling very poorly, Angelique is left behind with her when most of the Acadian women are deported as well. Angelique and her mother struggle to make it on their own until they can find out where the men were sent and follow them. Meanwhile, Joseph struggles with his unbearable longing to see Angelique again as he must care for her sick father. Will Angelique and Joseph ever be reunited?<br /><br />This book was a nice, sweet story, which I really enjoyed as a fan of sweet romances. I also loved the unique historical setting. However, the ending was a bit abrupt, and Angelique and Joseph were apart for much of the story. I would have liked to see a bit more of them together. I would still recommend this book to both teens and adults who enjoy sweet historical romances, as it is overall an enjoyable read.	2004-11-11

He had to leave all his friends behind, and is worried about the greater threat of Indian attack. When he meets an Indian in the woods named White Wolf, Phillip wonders if he can really trust him. And the health of his sickly younger sister, Leah, seems to have worsened since the move. Meanwhile, Phillip is struggling with how he will tell his father, a carpenter, that he doesn't want to study his trade, but learn to be an apothecary instead. Phillips wonders if he will ever be able to make his father proud of him, while still making his own dreams come true. And will Leah survive her latest illness?<br /><br />Although I enjoyed some of the other American Adventure books more, this was still a pretty good historical novel for young readers about a time period not written about too often. I would recommend it to those who have a special interest in this time period, or who want to read the complete series.	2004-11-09

Violet is a wealthy British girl who was sailing to join her father, who works in China for a trading company, when her ship was attacked and burned by pirates led by the infamous Zai Ching. But instead of being grateful for being rescued, Violet acts haughty and stuck-up, and steals the attention of everyone around her, especially Abby's best friend Luke and her mother. Abby's excitement at visiting the exotic land of China and exploring the city of Shanghai is spoiled by Violet's presence. When they must take Violet further south to join her father, a journey that means sailing through pirate-infested waters, Abby resents that they are now in danger because of Violet.

I enjoyed the unique historical setting, and Mollie and Ida were likeable characters. I recommend this book to young readers with an interest in this historical period or setting.	2004-11-07

Mayme Jukes and Katie Clairborne both grew up on plantations near the same town in Shenandoah County, North Carolina, but their lives were vastly different. Mayme was born into slavery, while Katie enjoyed a privileged life as the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. But in the final days of the Civil War, the two teenagers are thrown together when both of their families are murdered by marauding outlaw soldiers. Fleeing from the massacre of her family, Mayme stumbles across Katie's plantation, where she is the only one left alive. Mayme stays to help Katie, and eventually the girls become close friends in spite of their differences. But can these two teenage girls survive on their own, and hide the truth that they are all alone on the plantation?<br /><br />I highly recommend this heartwarming historical novel about two girls from very different backgrounds who, after suffering a common tragedy, come together to help each other out, eventually becoming the best of friends. Although labeled as an adult book, I think this novel would have the most appeal to teenagers, because of the young characters. I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series and finding out what happens to Mayme and Katie next.	2004-11-05

Awaiting execution for treason after she was Queen of England for just nine days, sixteen-year-old Lady Jane Grey looks back on her short life. She had some happiness as a child, but her parents were distant. A cousin of the Tudor ruling family, she spent some time at court as a young girl. Eventually, her parents had her married to a man she didn't love, or even like. Meanwhile, England is caught in turmoil, as the young Protestant king, Edward, dies. Jane's male relatives scheme to have her crowned Queen of England instead of Edward's Catholic half-sister Mary, although Jane wants no part of it. Powerless to determine her own destiny, she is forced to accept the crown of England and is caught up against her will in events that can only end in tragedy.<br /><br />This excellent historical novel brought to life the tragic story of Lady Jane Grey; as a big fan of historical fiction about young female royals, I found it particularly interesting. She was just a young girl who had no say in her own future and wrongly lost her life as a result of a plot she had no real part in. I highly recommend this novel to young adult readers who like to read historical fiction about royalty; I think it would particularly appeal to readers of the Young Royals and Royal Diaries series.	2004-10-28

This series is about the adventures of Abby Kendall, a young teenage girl, and her family and friends as they travel the South Seas in the late 1840s.<br /><br />When her mother becomes ill with a mysterious fever, thirteen-year-old old Abby Kendall's father decides to send her and the other children away from Hawaii. Abby, her younger sister Sarah, and their adopted Hawaiian brother Kini join Luke as he travels back to his Aunt Dagmar's home in California. It's April 1848, and soon after arriving, the children learn that gold has been discovered in California. When Luke's aunt treats them terribly, forcing them to be servants, the children decide to run away and find gold so they can return to their family. But soon after they arrive in the goldfields, Abby begins to worry about Luke. Luke has caught \\"gold fever,\\" and only seems to care about being rich. And to make matters worse, children are disappearing from the goldfields, and Abby fears for the safety of Sarah and Kini.<br /><br />This book is another great adventure featuring Abby Kendall and her family and friends. It's both a sweet story about family and friendship, and an exciting historical adventure. I love the California Gold Rush setting as well; all the books in this series have really interesting settings. I recommend it to all readers who enjoyed the first two books in Abby's South Seas Adventures series.	2004-10-09

I was very much looking forward to this book, as I am a big fan of Barry Denenberg's books from the Royal Diaries and Dear America series, and I love historical fiction set in the ancient world. However, this book has many problems. It is the story of a young boy, Atticus, who is brought as a slave to Rome after his small village is destroyed by Roman soldiers. His sister and mother die in the attack, and Atticus and his father are separated in slavery. Atticus ends up being purchased by a wealthy and powerful lawyer, who treats him well. Eventually, Atticus becomes a spy for him, trying to find traitors to the Empire. I thought the plot of this book was good. But that's about it. First off, the writing style was terrible. The book was written more like a nonfiction book than a novel for children. I can't imagine kids enjoying the style at all. There is very little dialogue. There are also historical errors. The cover says the story is set in 30 B.C. However, in the book, Atticus says he was born in 82 B.C. This would make Atticus over 50 years old. So obviously, one of the dates was wrong. And neither date fits with the story, as Rome was still a republic until 27 B.C. The story also has some minor plotholes that don't really make sense. I really cannot recommend this book at all, due to its numerous problems. It's too bad it has so many mistakes. If not for the mistakes, I personally would have enjoyed it, although I still don't think it would have had much appeal for young readers. I don't know how the mistakes got past the editor; I suppose the publisher can be blamed for putting the wrong date on the cover.	2004-09-22

Unlike many other people in England, Edith is lucky. Even though her father died when she was a young child, Edith and her mother still live a comfortable life. They have a good home, and are able to afford to have two servants. Edith's mother is on the Board of Guardians at Stoneleigh's workhouse, and because she hopes Edith will someday take her place, she begins bringing Edith with her to the workhouse to learn how it is run. What Edith discovers horrifies her. She never knew how bad conditions are at the workhouse, and how terrible life is for the people there. She begins to take a special interest in Rosie, an orphan girl her own age who has lived in the workhouse since she was a very young child, and decides to try and educate her so that she can someday leave and find employment.<br /><br />Although this book didn't seem to have that interesting a premise, unlike some others in the My Story series, I ended up really enjoying it. It was very well written, and flowed along well, so I never lost interest. I enjoyed reading Edith's diary and learning about how different life was for the middle class and the poor in Victorian England.

Pearl has never known freedom, and after her brother was sold away and her mother died, she and her father escaped, but had to leave Pearl's little sister behind. Hannah becomes determined to help Pearl and her family reunite and reach freedom in Canada.<br /><br />Young girls who enjoy historical fiction will most likely enjoy this book, especially if they enjoy series such as Dear America. However, this book did have some flaws, particularly that the characters were not all that developed. However, I enjoyed the unique letter format, and the historical details about life in the 1850s.	2004-09-19

Sixteen-year-old Suze Simon is a mediator -- a person who can communicate with ghosts and help them move on to the afterlife. And if that isn't enough, lately her life has been getting even more complicated. Suze is in love with Jesse, the ghost who died at her house 150 years ago. But he is dead, and she is alive, so they can never be together. And Paul, a fellow Mediator, is so determined to get Suze to date him that he threatens to do something that will prevent Jesse from ever meeting Suze -- prevent his murder 150 years ago. Paul thinks if Jesse isn't around, Suze will love him. But can mediators really travel through time? And if time travel IS possible, can Suze make the difficult decision to allow Jesse to live out his life in the past -- and doom herself to never meet him?<br /><br />This book is a thrilling addition to the wonderful Mediator series. I highly recommend it to all fans of Meg Cabot's books. It has lots of action, suspense, romance, and humor, and the story kept me turning the pages, unable to put it down.	2004-09-16

Even though she will not have to marry for three more years, Grace still dreads being betrothed. Elizabeth plans a lavish ball where Grace may choose her future husband from among three suitors. Everything goes as planned, until the day after the ball -- when one of Grace's rejected suitors is found dead, and the man she has chosen for her betrothed is the prime suspect! Now Grace must get to the bottom of the mystery and find the real killer so that she may clear the name of her future husband.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to readers who love a combination of historical fiction and mystery. Because it is written as Grace's diary, it also has a lot of appeal to fans of Dear America, The Royal Diaries, and other diary-format historical fiction. I can't wait to read more of Grace's adventures. I really enjoyed the historical setting and the diary format, and Grace is a very likable character.	2004-09-16

When the workers go on strike, Angela joins them, but in the end they accomplish little but to show their strength. She also describes personal tragedies, the loss of family and friends to illness, and then the devastating fire in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, where her sister and some of her friends work.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this new book from the Dear America series.

It's June of 1778, and thirteen-year-old Sarah Moore has been living with her relatives in Williamsburg for a year when she receives the news that her mother and new baby sister are seriously ill back home on the Kentucky frontier. Sarah immediately leaves Williamsburg to return home. When she arrives, she finds that their home has been burnt to the ground by Indians, her family is living at the fort, and her father and older brother have gone off to fight the Indians. Sarah must struggle with the challenges of living in this harsh frontier land, with the constant threat of Indian attacks and worry over her family.<br /><br />Readers who enjoyed the previous two books about Sarah Moore will definitely want to read this one as well. Although the Sarah's Journey books are not among my top favorites, they are still sweet, well-written, and historically accurate stories that will most likely be enjoyed by young readers who enjoy historical fiction set in colonial and pioneer times. I particularly enjoyed the colonial frontier setting of this book and the first in the series. It's a setting I'd really like to see more of, as it combines my two favorite historical fiction topics, colonial times and pioneer life.	2004-09-14

Lizabeth Merchant's father is a banker, and her family is among the wealthiest in the small town of Cape Light, Massachusetts, in 1906. Lizabeth often resents her younger sister, Tracy, who is just four years old.

But then scarlet fever comes to Cape Light, and Tracy becomes very sick. Now Lizabeth must choose between staying with her sick sister, and being able to participate in the contest.<br /><br />This book was another charming story from the Girls of Lighthouse Lane series, and had a good message about the importance of family.

This book is written in the form of letters between two friends. Elizabeth Walton and Abigail Matthews are both eleven years old in the summer of 1609, and are the best of friends. But their lives take very different paths when Abigail's family decides to leave England to settle in the new colony of Jamestown, Virginia. Saddened by their separation, the friends keep up a regular correspondence with each other. Elizabeth's life continues much as it always has, although more is expected of her as she grows into a young lady. But Abigail's is vastly changed. Shortly after arriving in the New World, she loses both of her parents -- her mother dies of starvation, and her father is killed by Indians. In the years that follow she struggles to understand why so much hardship has happened to her.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first half of this book, but in the second half it went from dealing with Abigail's personal struggle with her faith in the midst of so much tragedy, to being a bit too preachy when it dealt with the conversion of Pocahontas. Still, it was well written, and well researched with interesting historical details, both about life in Virginia and life in England from 1609 to 1614, a time period I particularly enjoy to read about. I also liked the fact that it was written in the form of letters, because it was a unique idea. I would recommend it to readers who are interested in this historical period and who do not mind the religious content, or who feel they can overlook it.	2004-09-10

But Sarah's Uncle Ethan suspects Gabrielle of being a Tory spy. Could Sarah's beloved tutor and friend really be their enemy?<br /><br />Stranger in Williamsburg is another good adventure featuring Sarah Moore. The author's descriptions of Williamsburg and the daily life there during the Revolutionary War were very interesting. However, I preferred the frontier setting and pioneer story of the first book about Sarah. Young readers who enjoy historical fiction, particularly stories set in colonial times, will probably enjoy this book. I look forward to reading Sarah's next adventure.	2004-09-09

Twelve-year-old Angelique Richard has lived her whole life on her family's farm in Grand-Pre, Acadia, as part of a large, loving family. But the year is 1755, and life for everyone in Acadia is about to change forever. The British government has been imposing more and more restrictions on the Acadian people, due to the war with the French. Although the Acadians wish to remain neutral, the British refuse to trust them. Angelique's father and many of the other men are thrown in jail for signing a petition in protest of this unfair treatment, and even worse is to come for the people of Grand-Pre. This is one of my favorite books from the Dear Canada series. I loved reading Angelique's diary, as she went from telling of everyday life -- doing chores, going to church, fun times with her brothers, sisters, and cousins -- to the difficulties she faces as the British impose more restrictions on her people, and then to the unjustified deportation of her people, and Angelique's struggle to retain hope in the heartbreak that follows.

But one day while Pandora is fetching water, she meets the philosopher Socrates, and what he tells her changes her life forever. She is even more determined to determine the course of her own future when she meets his young disciple, Phoenix, whom she knows she would marry if only she had a choice. Now Pandora must choose between a secure but joyless future, and throwing away everything she has for a chance at happiness.<br /><br />I enjoyed this look at life for a young teenage girl in ancient Athens, but I did feel it was a bit too short, in particular I would have liked to see a more developed ending as it was a bit abrupt. I'd still recommend this to readers who are interested in historical fiction set in the ancient world, and I look forward to reading more from this new series.	2004-07-28

Twelve-year-old Florrie barely remembers her father, who died when she was very young. Now her mother has remarried, and Florrie's new stepfather, who is a trader, has decided to take his new family to Santa Fe, where he is part owner of a store. Florrie begins her diary as she, her younger brother, mother, and stepfather set out from Missouri on the Santa Fe trail. She describes the hardships they face crossing rivers, mountains, and deserts, but also the joys, as she makes new friends and experiences the wonders of the beautiful wilderness. This wasn't one of the best Dear America books, but it was still very good, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the series.

The Rodgers and their fellow settlers face the bitter cold of winter and the scorching heat of summer, endless blizzards, a disastrous plague of locusts, as well as illness and death.<br /><br />Land of the Buffalo Bones is an excellent addition to the Dear America series that described the hardships of life on the prairie in the 1870s.

She spends as much of her days as possible horseback riding, her favorite pastime. But everything changes in the summer of 1857. Sisi's older sister, Helene, has been chosen to marry their cousin, Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria. Their mother is taking Helene to meet Franz Joseph, and has decided to take Sisi along in hopes of finding a husband for her as well. But when Franz Joseph meets Helene and Sisi, he decides it is Sisi he wants to marry. Sisi becomes engaged to Franz Joseph, but she is far too young for the responsibilities she suddenly finds herself facing as the future Empress.<br /><br />This is not one of my favorites from the Royal Diaries series, but it was still a very good book that I recommend to fans of the series. I only wish it could have been a little longer, as Elisabeth's diary is only 93 pages. Also, some parts really could have used more detail.	2003-03-14

At first I wasn't sure how good this new Dear America book would be, since Katelan Janke, the author, is just fifteen years old. But I was pleasantly surprised, since she has written a book just as good as many of the Dear America books written by adult authors. Katelan Janke has written a fictional diary of a young girl living in Katelan's own hometown during the Great Depression. Twelve-year-old Grace Edwards has lived on a farm near Dalhart, Texas for her whole life. But it's 1935, and the region is suffering from a terrible drought as the entire country is devastated by the effects of the Great Depression. Grace describes her daily life in a diary as her family faces hardship and sorrow. She describes their determination to hold on and to never give up hope, even as many of their friends and neighbors abandon their homes in the hopes of finding a better life elsewhere. If you have doubts about reading this book because of the author's age, you shouldn't. Katelan Janke is a good writer and has written a good book for the Dear America series.	2002-10-18

Eighteen-year-old Miranda Thurston is the daughter of U.S. Cavalry Major Charles Thurston. Miranda's mother died in childbirth, and as her father's only reminder of his beloved wife, she has been overprotected her whole life. Although she has grown up on the frontier, she doesn't believe the rumors about Cheyenne raiding parties. She sneaks away from Fort Walters to visit a friend's ranch and finds herself captured by Shadow Walker, a Cheyenne warrior. Shadow Walker was orphaned at a young age in a raid by white soldiers. Now the soldiers have captured his uncle, and Shadow Walker wants revenge. He is dismayed to find that his captive is just a young girl, who will be of little use to him. When Miranda rebels at every turn, Shadow Walker takes her on a journey into the wilderness to teach her a lesson. But on that journey, captor and captive discover feelings for each other that they never would have expected.<br /><br />This was a pretty good book, but it was probably the weakest in the Avon True Romance series. The ending was too abrupt -- it should have been longer and more developed. The story did keep my interest the whole way through, but ultimately I found the love story to be rather unbelievable. Still, I would recommend this book to teens who have enjoyed previous books in the series and want to read the entire collection.	2002-10-01

This book is the longest in the New Jedi Order series yet, at 606 pages, and it's also the best. In spite of the long length, there's not a single boring moment. In fact, the book sucked me in from page one.<br />Early on, we learn that the Yuuzhan Vong have developed vornskr hybrids, called voxyn, that hunt Jedi. When the Jedi discover all the voxyn are queens, Anakin Solo proposes a mission to go behind enemy lines and destroy the original voxyn, so that no more can be created. Anakin leads a strike team that includes Jacen, Jaina, Ganner, Tahiri, and several characters from the Young Jedi Knights series. They arrange to be &quot;captured&quot; by the Yuuzhan Vong, as that is the only way to get behind enemy lines. The mission to kill the voxyn queen is the main plot in the book, but there are also several other plot lines, including one focusing on Han and Leia, and another on Luke and Mara, who are determined to protect their infant son Ben.<br />To go into any more detail would most likely spoil this amazing book, so if you've been following the New Jedi Order series, I'll just recommend that you read this book. It's so vital to the overall storyline and full of tons of unexpected plot twists. There was really only one thing I didn't like, and that was the death of a major character. While the death was certainly well-written and heroic enough, the choice made of which character to kill was a poor one. Other than that, the book was superb. My only other complaint, besides the death, is that the next book, titled Dark Journey, won't be out until February. Star Wars fans will not want to miss this thrilling book.	2001-10-30

Unlike it's predecessor, Conquest, this book dealt with multiple plotlines, but the author handled all of them excellently, especially considering the book's short length. Luke and a very pregnant Mara are awaiting the birth of their son, but just as Mara's Yuuzhan Vong disease begins to effect her again, they are forced to flee Coruscant to avoid arrest. Anakin, Tahiri, and Corran go on what should be a simple supply run for the Errant Venture, but run into the Peace Brigade and must flee into hyperspace. Kyp convinces Jaina and Rogue Squadron to help him destroy a new Vong superweapon located at Sernpidal. Han, Leia, and Jacen are on a mission to set up a system to bring people and information out of occupied territory. And meanwhile, among the Yuuzhan Vong, Nem Yim continues her heresy. In my opinion, this was one of the best books from the New Jedi Order series. I especially enjoyed reading about Luke, Mara, and their child, and Anakin and Tahiri's growing romance was very cute. I reccomend this book to all Star Wars fans.	2001-07-30

The year is 1905, and, hoping for a better life, eleven-year-old Su-Na, her parents, and her two younger sisters have traveled from Korea to Hawaii. But life there is not all that they have expected. There is no school, and the low wages paid to immigrant laborers are barely enough to survive on, especially after a new baby is born. After a year in Hawaii, the family travels to the town of Riverside, California, where Su-Na and her sisters attend school while their father works as a fruit picker. But after two years during which Riverside begins to seem like home and another baby brother is born, their life is shattered by violence and prejudice. Once again the family must move, this time to the mining town of Idria. The work there is very dangerous, and Su-Na, now an independent, headstrong teenager with dreams of her own, constantly quarrels with her traditional parents. This was an excellent addition to the American Sisters series that brought to life the conflicts that exist in immigrant families, between the traditional parents and their increasingly Americanized children. I highly reccomend this book to young readers who enjoy historical novels, such as the Dear America series.	2001-06-17

I usually don't read children's movie novelizations anymore (after all, I'm 16), but there wasn't an adult version, so I picked up this one. I'm sad to say I was very disappointed. The story was exciting, and I think it will make a good movie. But the author didn't do a good job describing the action scenes, in fact he did such a bad job I couldn't figure out what was going on. I'm sure the kids this book was meant for will be even more confused. I was rather surprised at how badly this book was written, because I read the author's original novel Survivor, a prequel to the film, and I loved it. It's really not worth reading this book. Just wait for the movie to be released in theaters.	2001-06-16

The year is 1937, and twelve-year-old Alex O'Connell and his parents have returned to London now that his mother has accepted a teaching position at Bembridge. He longs for sunny Egypt, and for the friends he left behind there - although not for the life-threatening adventures he had fighting mummies and other evil creatures. When his parents are asked to lead an expedition to Egypt in order to stop Italian and German soldiers from ransacking Cleopatra's newly discovered tomb, Alex jumps at the chance to come along - but is disappointed when he is ordered to stay at the British Embassy in Cairo while his parents get to travel to the tomb and have all the adventures. Alex is reunited with his friends - Matt, the son of the British ambassador, and Rachel, a Jewish girl who fled Nazi Germany with her father. The three kids discover information that they must get to their parents - but will three kids be able to face the burning desert, Italian soldiers, their old enemy Ungricht, and a score of mummies? I reccomend this book to fans of the two Mummy movies, and to those readers who enjoyed the first Mummy Chronicles book.	2001-06-12

All thirteen-year-old Eric Kirby wanted was a chance to get to see real, live dinosaurs up close. So when his mom's boyfriend, Ben, offered him the opportunity, he jumped at the chance. Eric and Ben will get to parasail over the Jurassic Park Island, observing the dinosaurs from a safe distance. But something goes very wrong, and the two fall from the sky onto the island. Only Eric survives the fall, and he is trapped in a hostile prehistoric environment where he is the prey. It will take all of his wits and courage to stay alive until help arrives - but how can one kid survive among the deadliest predators ever to walk the earth? This was a thrilling story, not only for fans of the movies, but for readers who like adventure stories. The book ended with a cliffhanger that will lead into the new Jurassic Park movie, so now I have to wait until the movie comes out to find out what happens to Eric, which won't be for a whole month, or read the novelization. Still, this was an exciting, although short, book.	2001-06-12

It is November of 1941, and the United States is beginning to prepare for a possible entry into the second World War. On the sea voyage home, Bekah meets Scott DeAngelo, a naval ensign from New York. Although she feels an attraction to Scott, Bekah is afraid to fall in love again - she has forced herself to believe that a loveless marriage would be better than the possibility of another loss.

This book, the final in the EverWorld series, was very dissapointing. If it were not the last book, it would still be poorly written, but it would not have been as bad. This is due to the very open ending. Us, the loyal fans who have followed EverWorld since the beginning, deserve a better ending, one that TRULY tells what will happen to the characters now. If you're a loyal fan, you may as well go ahead and read this, but you won't find the closure you're looking for. You'd almost be better off pretending #11 was the last book. This ending simply does not do justice to the great series that EverWorld is.	2001-04-23

The scenario of this book was quite frightening: What if predatory dinosaurs and humans were forced to co-exist? Which species would survive? The answer is quite terrifying. The novel opens with descriptions of terrifying killings over several years, and gives hints of a terrible scientific experiment gone wrong. Flash forward to 2004, when the real story begins. Although there are some secondary characters, the main characters of the story, at least in my opinion, were Nancy and Daniel, two young schoolchildren from New York City. It is they who first begin to suspect the truth even when the adults around them refuse to consider the possibilty that dinosaurs have somehow come back to life. As raptors take over New York City, the two children stuggle to hold on to hope for survival in a world gone wrong, even as millions of people are dying around them. The children's courage was quite inspiring, as was the courage of those who were willing to sacrifice their lives for humanity. The ending was hopeful, yet terribly sad. Allthough the jumps in the narrative made it a bit confusing and hard to follow at times, the good outweighed the bad. The novel was an excellant first effort, especially considering that the author was younger than me when he wrote it. I would give the book 4.5 out of 5 stars.	2001-03-08

It's October, 1609. Although her best friend Jessie Bolton has returned to England with her grieving father following her mother's death, nine-year-old Elizabeth Barker is hopeful. The small colony of Jamestown, Virginia, is finally beginning to feel like home. The birth of Lizzie's baby sister, Abigail, has brought the Barker family joy. And Lizzie's twin brother, Caleb, will join the family come spring. But nothing can prepare Lizzie, her family, and the other colonies for the hardships they will face over winter. There isn't nearly enough food to last until the next ship arrives in the spring, and as soon as the first snow falls, disease once again breaks out among the colonists. Lizzie fears for her life, for her parent's lives, but especially for the life of little Abigail, whom Lizzie fears may not be strong enough to survive the winter. Lizzie and her new friend Mary cling to each other for comfort and pray for deliverance, yet even their strong spirits may not be enough to keep their families alive. As Lizzie struggles through the death of friends and loved ones, family and strangers, and starvation and sickness, she fights to keep her hope alive and to never give up. Told through Lizzie's spirited diary entries, this book continues the story begun in Our Strange New Land. Both that book and this one reveal what life might have been like for a young girl during the difficult winter of 1609-1610 in Jamestown Colony. I highly reccomend this book to all fans of the Dear America series, especially those that loved the first book about Lizzie.	2001-02-10

It's a pain living in the same house as three annoying stepbrothers, but at least she's making friends at school and even has met a guy who seems interested in her.

One night, the ghost of a woman appears to Suze, begging her to tell &quot;Red&quot; that he wasn't responsible for her death. Suze does some asking around and comes to the conclusion that the woman means &quot;Red&quot; Beaumont - who, unfortunately, is the father of Suze's prospective boyfriend! Of course she's upset that the only guy who's ever asked her out may be the son of a murderer.

Angel Eastland is a sixteen-year-old girl growing up in Canada in what she believes in the year 1987. She has never lived in one town for more than a few years, and although her parents are loving, she has always suspected that something strange is going on. And she has always been jealous of Michael Vallant, the boy she never met but who always had been in every town she moved to, but had moved away a year before she arrived. But finally, Angel and Michael's paths collide - and cause a shocking discovery. It's really the late 21st century, and Angel and Michael are among the few survivors of a group of genetically engineered children that the public hated enough to attempt to destroy them completely. And now the twisted scientist who created the children 17 years ago is determined to capture Angel and Michael to use as pawns in his evil scheme. I might have given this book five stars except for the fact that at times it was confusing, and some things in the book seemed to contradict others. For example, Angel is the narrator, and we know her thoughts from early on. No thought of her special abilities are mentioned until halfway through the novel, when she suddenly is revealed to have always known she was different. The novel is still enjoyable, however - it just could have used a little bit more effort to make things mesh together.	2001-01-19

But Jake, whose parents were captured by the Yeerks, is depressed - and he fears that they are starting to slip up. It's beginning to look more and more likely each day that the Animorphs are doomed to lose the war. With the freedom and lives of everyone on Earth at stake, they are forced to make a difficult choice - one that could have terrible consequences. They decide that the time has come to make more Animorphs. This, like the last few Animorphs books, was very tense and gripping - I read the whole thing through in an hour, unable to put it down. With only four more books left and a cliffhanger ending to this one, I eagerly await the conclusion to the series. If you're an Animorphs fan, you'll definitely want to read this one.	2001-01-13

Eleven-year-old Mercy Carter lives with her family in Deerfield, Massachusetts, the most remote settlement in the English colonies in 1704. Although life in Deerfield is both difficult and dangerous, with countless chores for even the youngest child and the constant threat of Indian attacks, Mercy takes comfort in her family and her faith. But even her prayers are not enough to save many settlers from brutal deaths at the hands of the Indians, and they aren't enough to save Mercy, who is among the survivors, from capture. Forced to march three hundred miles north to the Indian village in Canada through the brutal winter cold is almost more than Mercy can bear, and many do not survive the journey. Once she arrives in Canada, she finds herself a servant, and her only comfort lies in her faith, her prayers, and the faint hope that she will be ransomed and reunited with the surviving members of her family. Yet as time goes by, Mercy begins to think of herself as less of a captive, and more of a daughter of the tribe. And as this happens, Mercy wonders - if given the chance to become &quot;English&quot; again, would she even want to take it? Is she even still Mercy Carter, the Puritan girl from Deerfield, or an entirely new person? This was an absolutely wonderful book. The author really was able to get inside Mercy's head, to make the reader feel what she was feeling, as she struggles to love and not hate, to mourn her lost family and friends yet be happy among the people responsible for the deaths, and to remember her old life without causing herself pain. I can't say enough good things about this book, so I'll just highly reccomend that you read it.	2001-01-07

Raised as a Catholic at a Spanish mission in Northern California along with her younger brother before the two of them were taken in to be the servants of a wealthy Mexican family on their ranch, thirteen year old Maria Rosalia de Milagros barely remembers her Indian mother, who died of smallpox when she was six. She doesn't even know who her father was, only that he was a white man, or even what her real name was - Maria Rosalia was the name given to her by Padre Ygnacio, the priest who saved the lives of her and her little brother. Even though she is well treated by the family she works for, the Medinas, Maria Rosalia longs to know who her parents were. Her only hope would be to find Padre Yganico, and she doesn't have any idea where he is after all these years. Still, Maria Rosalia is able to find joy in holidays and celebrations, in writing in her diary, and in a new American friend, but there is a great deal of sorrow as well. This was an excellent addition to the Dear America series that revealed a great deal about a way of life that has vanished into the depths of time, and taught me about a period in American history that I knew little about.	2001-01-07

But now it seems as if the Yeerks have finally discovered that the &quot;Andalite bandits&quot; are really a group of humans. This new discovery puts the resistance, and the future of Earth, at risk. The Animorphs must protect themselves and their families at all costs. But to do that, they've got to do the unthinkable - reveal their secret. And along the way, Tobias will make a discovery that changes everything. This was the best of all of the recent Animorphs books - I can't even think of one in recent memory that tops it. It had drama, humor, sadness, and emotional depth all in one. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. If you're an Animorphs fan, you MUST read The Diversion.	2000-12-31

Soon, it begins to appear as if there may be a connection between the burned man and the missing teens - but can Cole find the link in time? If you liked the movie The Sixth Sense, or the first book from this series (titled Survivor), than I would highly reccomend Runaway to you as well. My only question is when is the next book coming out, since it didn't say in this book. On a last note, one thing I like about this series is that unlike many tie-in series, the books actually seem to be linked together, in one continuing story.	2000-12-31

Mike Slade, a private detective murdered by a corrupt official in 1961, has been brought back from the dead to get his revenge - and he's also looking for Betty. Angel's not sure exactly how to handle Slade - is he an enemy or an ally? True, he's been attacking police officers left and right, but at the core it seems as if all he wants is justice. This was different from many of the other Angel novels in that it was more of a mystery story, but I would highly reccomend it to fans of the show just the same. Jeff Mariotte, author of the excellent Angel novel CLOSE TO THE GROUND, does not disappoint in this one.	2000-12-31

Finally, after all the pain, violence, death, and grief of the past few months, Gaia Moore has finally found some peace. She and Sam are together at last, and she has discovered Oliver, the uncle she never knew she had. Oliver has even offered to take Gaia to live with him in Europe - but now that she's finally happy in New York, she's not sure she wants to accept the offer. Little does Gaia know that Oliver's offer is part of a larger, twisted scheme orchestrated by his true self, Loki - the man who unknown to Gaia has caused every bad thing that has happened to her ever since she moved to New York. And if she isn't careful, Gaia will fall right into Loki's trap - a trap she may never be able to escape. Although Gaia's ignorance frustrated me throughout the entire book, I would still highly reccomend this to all fans of the series. It's going to be torture waiting until March for the next book, Missing.	2000-12-30

Even though Amy Candler is far from being an ordinary twelve-year-old girl, she's usually interested in the same fads as most other kids her age. But not lately. All that the kids at her school seem to talk about these days is Cherry Lane, a hit teen soap opera. Amy just doesn't understand why everyone likes Cherry Lane - she thinks it's an idiotic show. Amy's mother insists that Amy's superior intelligence is the only reason she's not addicted to Cherry Lane. But when the kids at Amy's school all begin to behave perfectly, Amy suspects something strange is going on - not a single student has been given detention in over a week! Amy's determined to find out the cause of the strange behavior before her friends all become permanent zombies! This wasn't one of the best Replica books, but it was interesting in a somewhat scary way, and Cherry Lane seemed like a hilarious parody of all the teen TV shows.	2000-12-07

Eleven-year-old Hattie Crosby, daughter of Ellen Tandy from the first American Quilts book, is growing up on the Illinois prairie in 1856, at a time when the issue of slavery has already begun to tear the nation apart. Hattie's parents are abolitionists, especially her New Englander father, but Hattie's best friend, Dora June, is the daughter of the local constable, whose job lately has been to capture runaway slaves. Dora June's father forbids her to play with Hattie because he suspects Mr. Crosby is helping runaways. Hattie herself begins to wonder if her father could be involved in the Underground Railroad. What she discovers - he is indeed helping runaways - changes everything. Suddenly Hattie is aware of times when she suspected strange things were going on. And now all the Crosbys must be extra-careful, what with the constable being extra suspicious. As the months go by, Hattie dares to hope - that the runaways will go undetected, that the baby her mother is expecting will be born healthy, and that her father will forget his longing to move the family to &quot;bleeding Kansas.&quot; But nothing can prepare the Crosbys for the tragedy that awaits their little town. Like the first American Quilts book, this was very much a family story, but it was also a story about what happens when people allow suspicion and hatred to overwhelm them, and as such, it delivers a powerful message. Highly recommended to girls ages ten and up who enjoy books such as the &quot;Dear America&quot; series.	2000-12-07

Thirteen-year-old Francesca Vigilucci has always lived a privileged life in Washington, D.C., as the daughter of a wealthy lawyer. The year is 1913, and things are changing for women in the United States - although it seems as though life in the Vigilucci household is no different than it has always been. Francesca knows that her parents expect her to marry a wealthy man and raise a family, but that's not the life she dreams of. She longs to attend college and start an exciting career, instead of living a life like her mother's - a life that would be boring to Francesca. The only person she can share her dreams with is Laura, a girl her age who works as a servant in the Vigilucci home. The girls long to attend the suffragist parade to show their support for the women fighting to win the right to vote, but with Francesca's grumpy, traditional aunt in town, will they be able to find a way? This was another excellent addition to the American Diaries series. Kathleen Duey brought to life both the suffragist movement and the varying social conditions of the wealthy and the impoverished in early twentieth century America. As always, I look forward to reading the next book in the series.	2000-12-04

Buffy and her friends have got their hands full with helping Buffy's mother out with the annual Sunnydale Sidewalk Art Festival and patrolling to make sure vampires don't prey on the unsuspecting artists. Xander is especially eager to help out - a young artist named Justine has attracted his attention. Justine tells Xander she senses psychic powers surrounding his aura. Xander thinks that means he's psychic, and he allows Justine to do a Tarot card reading for him. After that, Xander begins to act more than a little strange. At first, Buffy thinks he's just infatuated with Justine, but he's not the only one acting weird - after Oz gets a Tarot reading, he begins to act like Xander. So Buffy and Willow go to investigate Justine, who acts pretty weird herself. When Willow is next to fall victim, Buffy learns that Justine struck a deal with the evil demon Kali. Justine plans to hand the world to Kali in exchange for becoming a famous artist. What Justine fails to realize is that the only way Kali can be satisfied is if the entire universe comes to an end. And not only that, but Justine's method of handing the world to Kali involves killing twenty-two people by trapping their souls in paintings of the Tarot cards - and Willow, Oz, and Xander are doomed to be her latest victims. But if Buffy doesn't find a way to stop Justine, it won't be just her friends who will be dead - but everyone in the entire world as well. This was another great Buffy novel by Diana G. Gallagher, who also wrote the excellent Prime Evil, which came out earlier this year.	2000-12-04

It's the winter of 1776 in Philadelphia, and as the Revolutionary War begins, it threatens to tear nine-year-old Hope Potter's family apart. It's been just Hope, her mother, and her thirteen-year-old brother Ethan ever since Christmas Day, when Hope's father was forced to leave home under circumstances the family still doesn't understand. But in spite of her worry for her father's safety and her increasingly fragmented family life, complicated by arguments between her mother and brother over which side in the war is the right one, Hope is forced to continue with her daily routine of school and chores, with only the comfort of her best friend and her mother to ease the pain the war is causing. But in addition to the sadness, there is also excitement and joy, with the celebration of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the birth of Hope's baby sister Faith. This book (like the other My America books) is told through Hope's journal entries, which use old-fashioned language and an innocent, childlike view of the world to sound as if they were truly written by a young colonial girl. I highly reccomend this book to young girls who enjoy historical stories.	2000-11-29

Twelve-year-old twins Hester and Philena, indentured servants to Madame Sarah Kemble Knight in her Boston home, have no memory of their parents. Yet their predictable life, the only one they know, is about to change. Madame Knight receives a letter summoning her to New Haven. She decides to bring her fifteen-year-old daughter, Polly, along, as well as Hester. But a devastated Philena is forced to stay behind, to care for Madame Knight's mother, Goodwife Kemble. However, Goodwife Kemble sends Philena and the family's Indian slave, Cato, after Madame Knight, to give her something she forgot to bring along. Before the two can catch up to the travelers, Cato runs away to freedom, abandoning Philena in the wilderness. She must travel on, completely on her own. Even when she finally catches up to Madame Knight, Polly, and Hester, things don't get much easier. The four travelers face every danger imaginable on the difficult journey by horseback along the Boston Post Road, but Hester and Philena discover things about themselves and each other that they never knew, and find their own hidden strength and courage. I highly reccomend this book, and the entire series, to girls who enjoy historical fiction.	2000-11-23

But Ross doesn't exactly show his appreciation - in fact, he doesn't show it at all. To get out of doing things he's supposed to do, like chores and schoolwork, he makes up outrageous stories. And then one day, strange things begin to happen. They start out when Ross sees an exact double of himself. Then, he starts to get terrible headaches, and things he touch get destroyed. Ross learns that his constant lies broke the barrier between fact and fiction, and as a result, he is trapped in a nightmarish parallel world. Now Ross must figure out how to return to his own world.

The secret of the mysterious installation the Solo children found on Corellia in the first book of this trilogy is out. It is a planetary repulsor, and their is one just like it on each of the other planets of the Corellian System. The planetary repulsors are an ancient system, used to bring the five planets of the system to their present location, most likely even before the Old Republic came to be. The repulsors can also be used as weapons of mass destruction - and all the various rebel groups in Corellia want to get a hold of them. The Solo children are in hiding with their Drall tutor Ebrihim, his aunt, Ebrihim's droid, and Chewbacca in the repulsor on Drall, where Anakin activates the repulsor, inadvertently letting their evil cousin Thracken know of their location, and the group is promptly captured. Lando and Luke are with the ships from Bakura, and Leia, Han, and Mara are desperately negotiating for the repulsor on Selonia, for it is the only thing that can stop another star from being forced to go nova by Centerpoint Station's mysterious technology. This was a thrilling conclusion to the Corellian Trilogy that I highly reccomend to Star Wars fans who enjoyed the other two books in the trilogy.	2000-11-09

During her first semester as a freshman at Somerset University, eighteen-year-old Jenna Blake solved several mysteries while working as an assistant to the medical examiner. She dealt with the death of her best friend, and found a boyfriend she thought she loved in Damon, even though others disapproved because Jenna was white and Damon black. Now, she's come back from Christmas break for her second semester. One night, two students - a black couple - are attacked by a white man, and the girl is killed. Black students, a minority at Somerset, are quick to call it a racial crime. Then a white student is killed by a black man, and racial tensions explode. The situation doesn't help Jenna and Damon's relationship, which begins to fall apart. Jenna is determined to solve the crime before any more people are hurt, even if she can't save her relationship. But how will the police be able to catch a killer that no two witnesses can even give a similar description of?

In the aftermath of the attack on Corona House, the Solo children, their Drall tutor Ebrihim, and Chewbacca flee to Drall, unable to go into hyperspace due to a damaged hyperdrive. Luke and Lando, unable to enter the Corellian System due to a large interdiction field that prevents hyperspace travel, hurry back to Coruscant to report that the Corellian System has been completely cut off, and later manages to enlist the aid of the Bakurans in obtaining ships to attack the Corellian rebels. Leia is held captive in Corona House, but manages to escape, along with Mara Jade, who was attending the trade conference. Han Solo, captured by his evil cousin Thracken Sal-Solo, leader of the Human League, must trust his life to a Selonian named Dracmus if he wants to escape.

So Laura, her mother, and her seven-year-old brother board her father's ship and sail north to the Arctic, where they must face excitement, danger, and long days of boredom before they can return home. This book featured lovely drawings and was told through Laura's diary entries. Laura's character was based on two real daughters of whaling captains, Laura Jernengan and Mary Williams.

The Serpentene are a wealthy group of demons who live their lives disguised as humans, making the majority of their money through telemarketing. When Angel receives a job guarding the Serpentene community against a group of Quake demons, Cordelia is thrilled - the wealthy Serpentene plan to pay well. Angel is suspicious, though - he doesn't understand why the Quake demons would be after the Serpentene. True, the Quake demons are attempting to kidnap four people, each connected to one of the elements - earth, air, fire, and water - for a ritual, but the Serpentene just don't seem to figure in there. Angel does find a connection between the four potential victims and the evil law agency Wolfram and Hart, however. Now he must stop the ritual - for as a vision of Doyle's reveals, there may be more at stake then just four lives. The entire city of Los Angeles may be at risk. This wasn't the best book in the Angel series, but I thoroughly enjoyed this new Angel novel and it brought back memories of the days when Doyle was on the show.	2000-11-02

This book picks up about two months after Jedi Eclipse. In the first few pages Jaina, who is still flying with Rogue Squadron, is injured in battle and temporarily loses part of her sight. On the planet Duro, where refugees from those worlds captured and destroyed by the Yuuzhan Vong invaders are being brought, Jacen is working at his father's side. Ever since the events at Centerpoint, he has been especially confused and conflicted. He knows that the Vong must be fought, yet he is afraid that by using the Force to strike back, he will step over to the dark side. Back on Coruscant, Mara discovers that she is pregnant, and she worries that her disease might harm her unborn child. When Mara and Luke discover that a Jedi apprentice went missing on Duro, they take Anakin and head there to check it out. The main plot in this book was Jacen's dillema. After the events in the last book, Jedi Eclipse, I found his character to be quite irritating, but how he resolved his issues in this book redeemed him for me. I liked how Mara and Jaina were featured more than they were in the Agents of Chaos duology, especially seeing as how they are two of my favorite characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this latest addition to the New Jedi Order, which is easily the best so far. I am looking forward to the next book.	2000-10-31

It's her responsibility to help troubled spirits move on to the next world. And it's a responsibility she has always resented. At sixteen, Susannah just wants to be a normal teenage girl, worried about clothes and boys, not dead people.

Susannah figures it won't be too hard to get Heather to move on - until it becomes clear that she's the most violent spirit Susannah has ever encountered. Heather won't rest until she gets revenge on her ex-boyfriend for breaking up with her.

Luke has recieved permission from the New Republic to set up a Jedi academy, and he goes off to search for potential candidates.

However, I'm quite glad I finally read it, because I was pleasantly surprised. The only movie character feature in a prominent role is Wedge Antilles, the fighter pilot from the trilogy. His background is described in detail here. The main character of the novel is Corran Horn, a young man from Corellia who is on the Empire's death list. Two and a half years after the events of Return of the Jedi, Wedge decides to reestablish Rogue Squadron, accepting only the best of the best. The only real problem I had with this book was that some of the stuff in the space battle scenes was just a bit TOO detailed. Other than that, it was an enjoyable, quick read.

I confess, this book was a bit slow moving at first, but I managed to get into it, and from then on I enjoyed it. Leia, now Chief of State of the New Republic, goes to Corellia for a trade summit. Han and their three children come along, so the trip will be something of a vacation for them. Exploring his home planet for the first time in years, Han is shocked at how much it's changed for the worst. Meanwhile, Mara Jade has recieved a strange message intended for Leia, and Luke has gone off with Lando, who is in search of a rich wife (that was the one distracting subplot - hope it starts to make more sense in one of the next two books). The kids wander off during a visit to an archaeological and discover a strange technology. As tensions on Corellia worsen, a new leader threatens to rise from the shadows - with possible explosive and deadly results. If you're new to the Star Wars books, this is probably not the best book to start off with. You're better off reading them in chronological order, which I haven't done, unfortunatley. But if you have enjoyed other Star Wars novels, I would reccomend this one.	2000-10-22

Because the shoe has a piece of pompon on it, she shows it to the cheerleaders, who discover it is the principal's shoe (turns out someone stole the principal's socks, shoes, and pants that morning). Tina, the most popular girl in school and leader of the cheerleaders' clique, asks (well, ask is a loose word - more like FORCES) Jendra to become the mascot for the cheerleaders. After a super-weird initiation ritual in which she discovers the cheerleaders worship a &quot;sacred&quot; pompon, she's had enough. But the cheerleaders won't let her leave. Is she truly doomed?

Ten-year-old Eileen Treacle's young life ended tragically when she drowned under mysterious circumstances in the summer of 1825. 174 years later, a group of seventh-graders go camping near the very creek that little Eileen died in. Accompanying the campers are two teachers and four high school seniors. One of the seniors, Cecilia Northrup, is the narrator of the story. Cecilia only agreed to go on the camp-out because her boyfriend Mark, her best friend Jane, and Jane's boyfriend Noah were going. From the start, things go badly. One of the kids claims to have seen the ghost of a little girl in the woods near the campground. Several kids are injured, and weird things begin to happen at night. The personalities of Mark and one of the teachers, who both fell in the creek, change suddenly and drastically. Cecilia is frightened, but no one except for one little boy believes her when she claims something wrong is going on. It may be up to her to save her own life and the children's as well.

For the annual seventh-grade class trip at Parkside this year, the school has recieved a grant that will enable the students to travel to any destination in the United States. Amy, a student council member, suggests Washington, D.C. - the place where she was &quot;born&quot; as part of the cloning experiment Project Crescent. Amy thinks visiting Washington will give her some insight into her origins. Interspersed with Amy's adventures touring Washington with her classmates are her mother's experiences working on Project Crescent thirteen years ago. Recently finished with graduate school, working to support her little brother Neil, who was dying of a rare genetic disorder, Nancy Candler was searching for work that would actually mean something. She found it on Project Crescent, where she hoped the work she did in genetic engineering would someday help people like Neil. A chance encounter with someone who her mother knew all those years ago makes Amy wonder what Nancy Candler is not telling her. The bitter tale of betrayal that unfolds before her could cost Amy her freedom - and possibly even her life. This was one of my favorite books in the Replica series. It further explored Amy's roots as a clone, explained her mother's motivation in working for the project and then doing everything in her power to cover it up, and just how Nancy Candler came to adopt Amy as her own daughter. A must read for all Replica fans.	2000-10-09

Halloween is approaching, and words has it that the ghosts of the victims are haunting the campus. Phoebe thinks if she uncovers the truth behind the events that happened in 1958, the ghosts will be able to rest in peace. So she determines to find out the truth.

The triplets think it will be fun if everyone gets their fortunes told, and shy Maggie reluctantly agrees. But while her friends get ordinary enough futures predicted by the fortuneteller, what Maggie is told is anything but ordinary. The fortuneteller tells Maggie that she has evil powers. And it soon becomes clear to Maggie that something is very wrong indeed. Bad things are happening to everyone around her, and soon even the triplets have turned on her. The only one still on Maggie's side is Glen, a boy she has always had a secret crush on. Glen claims he can help Maggie. But is she right to trust Glen - and what are the origins of her terrible powers? Can she get rid of the powers, or will she have to learn to live with them? And why does Glen believe her when no one else does? Read to find out. If you're an R. L. Stine fan like I am, I can guarantee that you won't be dissapointed by this book.	2000-10-08

Things are really starting to heat up in the struggle for Earth. Jake is fighting his own personal battle - whether or not to reveal the invasion to the public. Going public could mean getting the support they need, but it could also mean that the Yeerks, feeling threatened, would use nuclear weapons to blast entire cities into oblivian. And now the Yeerks have captured one of the members of the free Hork Bajir colony. Even though the Ellimist made the valley difficult to find when he created it, with a Hork Bajir guide, the Yeerks are sure to find it. Jake knows that this is one battle they are doomed to lose, but the Hork Bajir are determined to fight for their home. Meanwhile, a parallel story is being told - that of one of Jake's ancestors, forced into the role of leader of a small band of Union soldiers forced to fight against overwhelming odds. While this story destracted a bit from the contemporary one, it was actually an interesting tale, and it made this book one of the more unusual Animorphs books. The endings (to both stories, present and past) were very sad, however.	2000-10-08

This book picks up two months after Hero's Trial left off. Leia is overseeing the evacuation of worlds targeted by the Yuuzhan Vong invaders. Han and Droma are still searching for Droma's relatives. The Jedi Knights are split in two about how to best fight the Vong. Jedi Wurth Skidder has undertaken a dangerous undercover mission on a Vong ship. And while their sister Jaina is flying with Rogue Squadron, Jacen and Anakin Solo have gone to the Correlian system to attempt to rearm Centerpoint Station. The New Republic hopes to lure the Vong fleet to the Correlian System by making it appear virtually defenseless, then decimating the fleet using Centerpoint and the planetery repulsors in the system. This was an exciting conclusion to Hero's Trial, and an excellant addition to the New Jedi Order storyline. The only real problem I had with the book was the exclusion of Mara and Jaina, two of my favorite characters. It's ridiculous that Mara would just sit their on Coruscant hoping her disease was gone, and Jaina could have easily been added into the story by having Rogue Squadron participate in some of the space battles. But the book was an overall great read, nonetheless. I'm counting the days until I get Balance Point.	2000-10-07

The last couple of New Jedi Order books, which were the Dark Tide duology, focused mainly on the various Jedi. So it makes sense in a way that this book is mostly about Han Solo, since he was pretty much ignored in those two books. After Chewbacca's memorial service on the Wookie home planet, Kashyyk, the Solo family returns to Coruscant, where Han runs into Roa, an old buddy from his smuggling days. Desperate to avenge Chewie's death, he agrees to go off with Roa in search of a mercenary band working for the Yuuzhan Vong. At the same time, the Vong allow a New Republic ship to capture one of their priestesses, Elan, and her &quot;familiar,&quot; Vergere, a creature that is certainly not a Vong but not any other recognized species either. Elan and Vergere are supposed to pose as defectors so they can arrange a meeting with the Jedi, during which Elan will unleash a disease. Although the outcome was somewhat predictable, quite a few of the twists and turns along the way were anything but predictable. This is another five star book from the New Jedi Order series. I just started Jedi Eclipse (the sequaL), and it's sure to be great as well.	2000-10-03

Sixteen-year-old Megan resents her grandmother, who disowned Megan's mother for marrying a man of another race, and who does not think of Megan and her brothers as her grandchildren because they were adopted. But at her grandmother's request, she has come to spend two weeks at her mother's childhood home, a large house in the Maryland countryside. When she arrives, she immediatley recognizes the house from her dreams - even though she had never been there before, or even seen a picture of it. Now that she is at the house, the dreams intesify, even to the point of her sleepwalking. Then Megan discovers the story of her great-aunt Avril, who died at age sixteen. The death was suspicious, and some people in the town still suspect she was murdered. Soon, Megan begans to dream that she is Avril, and then she begins to wonder if she is in fact Avril reincarnated. With the help of her cousin by adoption, Matt, who may be a reincarnation of Avril's lost love, Megan sets out to find the truth - before she dies in this life as well. I reccomend this book to teens who enjoy mysteries and thrillers. I can't wait to read the next Dark Secrets book.	2000-09-30

When a new all-female rock band playing at the Bronze seems to mesmarize the male audience in a seemingly unnatural way, Buffy takes notice, but she doesn't really have the opportunity to investigate further. On patrol one night recently, she discovered some human bones that had been picked completely clean. And there's a new vampire in town named Solitaire, who can apparently move about during the day, unharmed by the sunlight. When Willow manages to identify the bones through personal items such as wallets and jewelry found with them, the Scooby Gang discovers that all the victims were young males, students at either the high school or UC Sunnydale. Then one night, Willow dissapears, and Solitaire decides to strike at Buffy by attacking both Giles and Angel. Now Buffy must defeat Solitaire, discover who killed all those guys, and rescue Willow from whoever captured her. Can she accomplish all three things in time to save her friends? This Buffy novel was filled with action, suspense, mystery, and a surprising conclusion. I highly reccomend it to fans. And I really like the new cover design, on a side note.	2000-09-30

I have read the new Kit books because when I was younger I loved the American Girls Collection and was curious to see how I would view a new book now. I actually enjoyed them. This book was an enjoyable story about a spirited and resourceful girl's attempts to help her family through the hard times of the Great Depression. It's Christmas, 1932, in the story, and Kit worries that with the fact they may lose their house looming over them like a dark cloud, they won't be able to enjoy the holiday. Kit has just had a fight with her best friend, Ruthie, and is forced to spend her afternoons with her mean Great Uncle Hendrick, who is ill and needs Kit to help him out and run errands for him. Although in the typical spirit of this series most problems are resolved by story's end, some things are left unanswered, and only the completion of the series will tell if the family gets to keep their home. I would reccomend this series to younger readers, although for this age group there are more realistic historical series, for example, the My America series, a younger version of Dear America, and Pioneer Daughters by Jean Van Leeuwen, set during the American Revolution.	2000-09-28

The Animorphs believed that when they contacted the Andalite home world, at least some of their troubles would be over. But their salvation is not coming from the Andalites, at least not anytime soon. The Andalite forces believe the Animorphs have ulterior motives in warning them of a Yeerk trap, and refuse to come to their aid. So the Animorphs are still on their own. When they learn the Yeerks plan to start World War III, a nuclear war that will leave most the civilized world in ruins, they begin a desperate race against time. The fate of the entire world hangs in the balance as the Animorphs attempt to stop the Yeerks. And even if the Yeerks are stopped, will the cost be greater than it was worth? I really love this new story arc in the current Animorphs books, and can't wait to read #47.	2000-09-25

It's early 1940, and Europe is poised on the brink of World War II. But all Spike is concerned with is obtaining a magical necklace known as Freyja's Strand for Dru, to celebrate the eightieth anniversary of her rebirth as a vampire. They travel to Norway, to the lair of a demon who supposedly has the necklace. He agrees that he will give it to Spike and Dru if the two kill all the young woman currently in training to become the Slayer, as well as the current slayer herself, Sophie Carstensen, a sixteen-year-old Danish girl who has fled with her watcher, Yanna, to London, now that the Nazis have occupied her homeland. While Spike and Dru hunt down and begin to kill the potential Slayers one by one, Sophie and Yanna are dispatched by the Council of Watchers to the battlegrounds of France to kill the vampires who have gone there to feast on the dead and dying soldiers. When the Council learns of Spike and Dru's activities, they send the pair to follow them and keep them from further killing, and gather the remaining girls in the Council's London stronghold as the Blitz rages around them. I especially loved this new addition to the Buffy series because even though Buffy herself was not in it all, it combined two of my favorites, history and horror. It's a great read for Buffy fans if you don't mind the fact that she doesn't appear at all. And of course, Spike and Dru fans will especially like it. Kudos to Christopher Golden for the great job he did on this book.	2000-09-25

She goes to school, is flunking math, worries about her single mom's new boyfriend (who just happens to be her math teacher!), and has fun with her friends. The not-so-ordinary part is spending summers in France with her super-rich politician dad, who her mom was never married to, and her annoyingly proper grandmother. But at age fourteen, Mia gets the shock of her life: her father is the prince of a small European principality, and a disease has left him unable to have any more kids. Which means that Mia's going to be stuck being Princess Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldo, heir to the throne of Genovia. But Mia's not ready to take princess leasons from her grandmother and contend with the media and her overnight fame - in fact, she's not sure she wants to be a princess at all!

As the only non-Catholic girl at the school, she finds herself an unwelcome outcast, teased and tormented by the other students, especially snooty Elinora, who pretends that she wants to be a nun to avoid suspicion while sneaking out at night to see a boy. Lizzy's only friends are a slightly crazy old woman who lost both her husband and only son to the Civil War, and a travelling carpenter hired to build a staircase at the scool. But even with these two friends, Lizzy still longs for the day her father will return for her, and she wonders if that day will ever come.

I was so happy when I got this book, because I've been waiting for a new novel from Karen Cushman ever since The Ballad of Lucy Whipple came out,  and that was back in 1996. Matilda Bone does not dissapoint. Some  professional reviewers have called Matilda whiny and unlikeable, but I  disagree. I came to care about Matilda, and watching her learn and grow. In  fact, I devoured this book in one setting. The story is about  fourteen-year-old Matilda, who was raised on a manor in the Middle Ages  after her mother runs off and her father dies. For the most part, her  bringing up is handled by a priest who tells her that little more that  piety matters. So when she comes to Blood and Bone Alley to work as an  apprentice to Red Peg the Bonesetter, she can do little else but believe  that since the people she is surrounded by do not pray constantly, they are  ungodly. I could understand Matilda's unhappiness - she was torn from the  only home she knew, and her extrene religious views were a byproduct of her  upbringing. Don't listen to the professional reviewers; I'm a  fifteen-year-old reader, and I loved this book!	2000-09-10

I read this book about a year ago, but I still remember it very well. Because the series (Young Jedi Knights) was all about Jacen and Jaina Solo,  they were the first books to really develop their characters. Jaina is  spunky and adventurous and has a real talent for mechanical stuff and for  flying. Jacen's talent is communicating through the force with animals, and  he keeps a collection of them in his room. In this book, when the series  stars off, the twins are fourteen years old and have left their home on  Coruscant to attend Luke's Jedi academy on the fourth moon of Yavin. The  plot involved the two adjusting to life at the academy and making some new  friends, including Tenal Ka, a warrior girl, and Lowie, a Wookie who is  Chewie's nephew. Jaina's father, Han Solo, gives her a hyperdrive to toy  around with, because she loves mechanical thigns so much. She finds the  wreckage of a TIE fighter from the battle of Yavin when the first Death  Star was destroyed. So she'll have her own ship with hyperspace  capabilities, she decides to install the hyperdrive in the fighter. That's  where the trouble starts. It turns out that the pilot of the ship has been  hiding in the jungle for twenty years. He doesn't know that the Empire has  fallen, and when he learns his ship has been repaired, he decides to steal  it and return to his command. And he doesn't care if he gets the kids hurt  or killed in the process. What I liked best about this book was that it was  a Star Wars story in which the main characters were my age. You don't have  to be a kid or teenager to enjoy the book, though. I think all Star Wars  fans will find it entertaining if they don't mind the simpler writing  style.	2000-09-09

Fans of Titanic Crossing will remember Emily Brewer, a girl that Albert, the main character, befriended aboard the Titanic. In this sequal, twelve-year-old Emily is the main character. Barely a week after the ship  sank, and just a few days after they finally arrived in America, Emily, her  widowed mother, and her younger brother and sister have come to live in  Baltimore. Thankfully, Emily's brother quickly recovers from the mysterious  illness that plagued him in India, where Emily's parents were missionaries  until her father's death. Emily is haunted by visions of those that did not  survive, especially because none of those people had to die if the Titanic  had carried enough lifeboats. Emily's mother tells her to stop dwelling on  those she couldn't save and start helping those she can save. So the rest  of the book from that point onward is about Emily discovering the terrible  conditions of child laborers, and her struggle to help them, even though  she is putting herself in more danger than she realizes. This story could  have been told without the Titanic background, but I liked reading about  what happened to the characters of Titanic Crossing, so I didn't mind.  There's less action in this one, but readers who want to know more of Emily  and Albert's (he's in this one for a short time) adventures will enjoy it  anyhow.	2000-09-05

Her father often goes away for long periods of time, leaving Ellen and her two brothers, one older and one younger, to  keep the family farm running. Life on the Illinois prairie in 1830 is  difficult, but Ellen and her brothers manage to find joy in simple  pleasures. Yet one day, everything changes without warning. Ellen's father  returns home with a woman named Julia whom he has just married, and Julia's  disagreeable son Silas. At first Ellen keeps herself at a distance from  Julia, still grieving for her mother, and resents Silas because he is a  troublemaker. Yet when the conflicts among the new family tensify and  threaten to tear them apart, Ellen realizes how much Julia and Silas have  come to mean to her. But is to late to help bring her family back together?  This historical novel, reminiscent at times of the Little House books,  brought to life the events that took place on the Illinois prairie in  1830-1831, including one of the worst winters on record, a terrible spring  flooding, and a prairie fire, while telling a heartwarming family story  featuring a spunky young girl who is fiercely loyal to her family.

Each of the seven stories in this book has as its setting a different western ghost town and is about a kid's encounter with a ghost or ghosts in  that town. The seven towns are Tombstone, Arizona; Shakespeare, New Mexico;  Maiden, Montana; Virginia City, Nevada; Grafton, Utah; Bodie, California;  and Fort Griffin, Texas. My two favorites in the collection were Buried  (set in Shakespeare) and The Magic Eye (set in Grafton), which certainly  taught the lesson to be careful what you wish for! I would reccomend this  collection to kids who enjoy reading ghost stories or who are interested in  ghost towns.	2000-09-03

I can't imagine that very many people would find the four stories in this book particuarly scary. The cover art makes the book look far more  terrifying than it is (although I did like the picture). But it's still a  good book. Each story is about one of the four sisters from Little Women.  In each story, the girl is ten, and she encounters a ghost or spirit. I  enjoyed the story with Beth the most, but the Meg and Jo ones were very  good as well. Amy's was somewhat dissapointing, because I didn't really  understand the end of it. I still give the collection four stars, because I  really enjoyed the other three. If you enjoyed the other books in this  series, you will most likely enjoy this one as well.	2000-09-03

Many readers will have heard  of Elizabeth Van Lew, an abolitionist who is well known to have pretended  to be &quot;crazy&quot; so she would not be suspected of being a spy. But  few will have heard of Mary Elizabeth Bowser, the daughter of two former  slaves that Van Lew set free. Liza, as she is called in this story, is sent  North by &quot;Miss Bet,&quot; as she calls Miss Van Lew, to get an  education. She returns to Richmond at age fifteen with her new husband.  When her husband heads north to join the black Union regiments, Liza agrees  to pose as a slave in the home of Jefferson Davis so she can listen and  learn, and maybe help the Union cause. Although both are in danger because  of their actions, they continue with their work because of their fierce  loyalty to their country. The diary format will appeal to readers of the  &quot;Dear America&quot; series, and the story will appeal to many fans of  historical fiction, particuarly girls ages eleven and up, who will enjoy  reading about the strong female characters.	2000-08-31

I read this book only because of that fact that when I was young, I  absolutley loved the American Girls more than anything else in the world.  And I'm glad I did, because they got me interested in history. Reading  books like these will encourage young girls to move onto more challenging  and realistic historical fiction as they grow older, such as the Dear  America series. This book &quot;introduces&quot; the newest American Girl,  nine-year-old Kit Kitteradge (who thought up that name, anyway?), who lives  with her family in Cincinatti during the Depression. (Again, problem: the  cover says the setting is 1934, the historical note says 1932. Not that  little girls are going to notice.) Kit and her family are affected by the  Great Depression, but her concerns are petty next to the larger problems  facing most citizens of the country. Her dad loses his business. Her mom  opens a boardinghouse. Kit has to give up her room to paying borders and  live in the attic. Not so harsh when there were kids not much older than  her living off their own wits. Kit wasn't exactly the most well-developed  character, either - she's just defined as liking and disliking various  things, and often acts selfish and spoiled, before suddenly realizing her  mistakes. Still, I give the book five stars because it is sure the  entertain the audience it is intended for.	2000-08-31

But  over a year of change, Meg realizes that accepting Susannah can only bring  good, and that there are ways that she can help influence her future, even  if she is not an heiress. This was a fascinating glimpse into a time period  that is not often written about in young adult fiction. Highly reccomend to  teen fans of historical novels.	2000-08-31

Most of the time, ten-year-old Lizzie Baker is happy with her family's life on the Tennessee frontier in the 1790s. Except for every fall, when  Lizzie's asthma becomes so terrible that she can barely breathe. And this  fall, it was so bad that Lizzie nearly died. The doctors and the local  midwife try several treatments, but none of them really seem to work.  Lizzie resigns herself to dying, and decides to just try and enjoy the year  she has left until next fall, which she surely won't survive - each fall,  her asthma gets worse and worse, and she couldn't possibly survive an  attack worse than the last one. Lizzie enjoys spending time with visitors  to the community - a wealthy surveyor and his wife and son. The wealthy  family, the Beaumonts, live by the sea in South Carolina. Some people say  that the sea air might help Lizzie's lungs. When the Beaumonts offer to  adopt Lizzie and take her to South Carolina, she must make a choice - stay  in Tennessee, where she will surely die but with the comfort of her family  nearby, or go far away where she could still die, far from home? I highly  reccomend this book. It's a great historical novel and an inspiring story  about a young girl's amazing courage and determination. I don't think I  could ever be as brave as Lizzie.	2000-08-31

As with the other books in the series, this was a pleasant enough story for younger readers about a little girl growing up during America's past.  But as with those other books, all of the conflicts are solved far too  easily. The plot of this book is easily summed up. The setting is during  the Great Depression. Kit and her two friends get into a fight at school  with a mean classmate. Their punishment is delivering the class donations  to the soup kitchen. There, Kit sees her father on the line for free food.  She realizes how bad her family's situation is. Her father tells her he has  to go away to find work. Kit finds a way to increase the income of the  family's boardinghouse, and her father gets to stay. Lack of realism here,  I'd say. If that was real life during the Depression, her dad probably  would have had to leave. But I won't fault the publisher for toning down  the harsher aspects of history - I read this series when I was as young as  seven.	2000-08-31

Arthur Cooper was a real person who, as a young man, escaped slavery in Virginia and went north to Massachusetts, where he married a free-born  African-American woman, had several children, and moved to Nantucket  Island, where in 1822 he was nearly captured by slave catchers but rescued  by the Quaker community. The narrator of this novel is a fictional Quaker  child, ten-year-old Phebe Folger. Arthur's wife, Mary, is hired by Phebe's  father to care for her mother, bedridden since a carriage accident several  months ago. Phebe has many concerns present in all children. She worries  for her mother and resents her older sister's efforts to educate her. Phebe  describes several months of her life as she gets to know the Cooper family.  When the family is in danger of being captured, Phebe helps to save them.  This was an inspiring novel about how a group of people, including young  children, saw a great evil (slavery) and did whatever they could to prevent  it.

Along the  difficult and near deadly journey down the river, they face an attack by  bandits and a fire. But it's when they are kidnapped and held for ransom  when they must truly work together.

He finds a  friend in Daniel, who works in the peleontology deperatment at the  Sunnydale Museum of Natural History. Daniel has found a spell to resurrect  dinosaurs, and the one who performs the spell will have one wish fufilled  in return. So Daniel decides to try it, and talks Kevin into helping him.  And before they know it, there's a live, demonically-possessed dinosaur  loose in Sunnydale, which Buffy mannages to capture and lock up in the  library. Now it's up to the gang to figure out how this extinct creature  came back from the dead. And time is running out, because three T-Rexes are  now running about as well! This book had lots of excitement, suspense, gore  (yep, you heard me right) and everything you'd want to see in a Buffy book.  And I loved the dinosaur storyline.	2000-08-29

I was worried that Fearless might begin to drag out as the series went on, especially when it was announced that the series had been extended from  twelve books to eighteen. Luckily I was wrong, as with the exception of the  Gaia/Sam thing, Fearless continued to be an excellant series. And even my  only problem was solved in this book. A lot happens. For one thing, Ella is  revealed to be TOTALLY different then we had though, and attones for her  past mistakes. But anyway, I'm getting ahead. Here's the plot: Gaia  believes Loki is her nice, friendly uncle, who wants to take her away to  Europe and give her a good home. Before she leaves, she wants to find her  father, who she glimpsed saving her life one day. That's really just a plot  device for her to stay in the city. She never finds him. (But he decides he  will find her!) But in the end everything is happy (until the next book,  that is). Finally a happy ending!	2000-08-29

Finally we hear Senna's side of the whole story, and it's not a pleasant one. Senna's voice.... well, it's completely different. She's arrogent, for  one, thinking she can have all of Everworld for her own, and she doesn't  care about sending the others home; to her, they are just pawns. But that's  the strength of the book. The author has managed to create this voice for  the character, an utterly despisable character. And then she makes you feel  sorry for her. Senna and the others travel to the Egyptian area of  Everworld in this one. Senna sees, for the first time in ten years, her  mother. She has lived all this time with her father, his wife (who hates  Senna since she's a product of her husband's affair) and his other  daughter, Senna's half-sister April, who doesn't try to disguise her hatred  of her.

This book starts up a ten-book story arc that could see the end of the war against the Yeerks and the salvation of the Earth. But... that's not  happening just yet. Instead, we see quite a bit in the way of changes in  this book. Marco's dad is an engineer and his company is working on  developing Z-space technology. The Yeerks decide that Marco's dad will have  to be infested, and Marco can't bear the thought of losing another parent.  So he breaks all the rules he sets for himself and tells his dad about  everything. The invasion of Earth. How Marco got involved in the war.  Everything. Now Marco and his dad have been targeted for temination by the  Yeerks. They fake their deaths and go into hiding. But the development by  humans of Z-space technology may offer a chance for the Animorphs to  contact the Andalite home world and ask for help. But first, they decide on  a risky mission to free Marco's mother from the grasp of the dying Visser  One. The Animorphs books are back on track with this new story arc, which  starts out with a blast.	2000-08-16

Growing up as one of the few Americans in China during the Victorian era, young Jenny never knew her real father, who died when she was just an infant. The only father she knows is the kindly man who married her mother  when she was a young widow struggling to provide for herself and baby  Jenny. The three of them lived a spare but comfortable life over the years.  But sudden tragedy strikes Jenny when she is just eleven, when her  stepfather and mother die within weeks of each other. On her deathbed,  Jenny's mother provides her with the instructions and money neccesary to  make the long voyage to the American east coast to live with her paternal  grandfather. Along the miserable ocean crossing and railroad trip across  the United States, the one thing comforting Jenny is the fact that she will  soon be with her grandfather, safe and loved. Instead, she arrives to  misery: her mother's letter never arrived, her grandfather is ailing, and  her uncle does not believe that Jenny is his niece, but is trying to  swindle the family fortune. So Jenny is sent to a dank room in the cellar  to become a servant. With many mysterious people surrounding her, she  begins to wonder just what is going on in gloomy Graymark House, and  whether someone could possibly be plotting against her. Bringing to life a  brave, resourceful young girl, this novel spins a dark tale of treachery  and sinister plots set against a shadowy 19th-century backdrop.	2000-08-14

There were so many things wrong about this book that I don't really know where to start. I guess I'll start with the fact that it seemed odd that  the author chose to make her main character, Laurel, fifteen years old when  the book was written at an upper elementary school reading level and is  suggested for grades four and up. Covering the same topic is the fact that  there is a romance in the story. It didn't really seem like a storyline  that would interest the age level this book is targeted to. Not only that,  but the romance happened much to quickly and had absolutley no feel to it.  In fact, I didn't care much about anything in this book. The characters  were all poorly developed and one-dimensional. Laurel had a bit more  development than the others, but that was probably only because she was the  main character. When I read a book, I usually become immersed in the story  and care about what happens to the characters. Not so in this book. In  fact, the only thing I cared about was that the book end quickly. Which it  did at around 85 pages. It's a shame this novel was so poorly written,  since it was based around an intresting historical event - the Missouri  earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 - that few books have been written about.	2000-08-14

It's the late summer of 1793 in Philadelphia, and fourteen-year-old Mattie Cook helps her widowed mother and her grandfather run a coffehouse. Mattie  resents her strict mother and dreams of expanding the coffeehouse and  becoming wealthy. But her mother seems determined to find a wealthy young  man to marry Mattie off to. But all of Mattie's concerns soon seem petty  when an epidemic of yellow fever begins to spread throughout the city.  Mattie's own mother falls ill and sends Mattie and her grandfather to stay  on a farm in the countryside, where she hopes they will be safe. But they  are turned away and forced to return to Philadelphia when a doctor mistakes  her grandfather's cough for yellow fever. Mattie comes down with the fever  and nearly dies, but is nursed back to health in a temporary hospital. But  she and her grandfather return to the coffeehouse to find that Mattie's  mother has vanished. They try to settle back into a normal routine, but a  sudden tragedy soon leaves Mattie on her own. Now, in a world turned upside  down, in a ghost city a shadow of its former self, Mattie must keep herself  alive and care for a little girl orphaned by the epidemic. This was an  excellant historical novel that brought to life the epidemic. Through  Mattie's first-person narration, I became immersed in the daily events of  her life and her fight for survival. Highly reccomended.	2000-08-14

This adventure set during the War of 1812 has many of the elements found in classic sea stories: There's storms, a shipwreck, pirates, a brave young  hero, and more.

Ever since his cousin Heather dissapeared while shooting a documentary on  the Blair Witch, seventeen-year-old Cade has been trying to find out what  really happened to her. To that end, he started a web site, hoping people  would see it and write to him with their own Blair Witch knowledge and  stories. One seemingly normal teenage girl, Laura, who seems like just  another Blair Witch groupie, comes to Burkittsville to see Cade. She comes  across as very annoying at first, but there's something very strange about  her. The way she claims to see things that aren't there. The photographs  she takes of empty woods that develop to show scenes of convicted child  murderer Rustin Parr's childhood. The way she is constantly drawn to the  ruins of Parr's home. And the strange, evasive manner Laura's mother uses  when Cade contacts her by phone. Cade has to find out what Laura's deal is  before it's to late for both of them. This was a cool horror story for  teens, and you don't need to have seen the movie to understand or enjoy it.	2000-08-08

It is with great hesitatation that eleven-year-old Nellie Lee Love begins  her new diary on New Year's Day, 1919. The diary was an unwanted Christmas  present from her mother that she doubts she will use much. But Nellie grows  to like writing in the diary. The entries early on describe her family's  fairly idyllic life in the small town of Bradford Corners, Tennessee.  Nellie's best friend is her older sister, Erma Jean, who's just ten months  older than her. There's Mama and Daddy, Nellie's grandparents, Papa Till  and Aunt Nessie (who live with the family), and various aunts, uncles, and  cousin. Their life is much easier than that of most southern blacks because  Nellie's father owns his own business, a funeral home. But soon tragedy  befalls the family, when Nellie's Uncle Pace, who has just returned from  the war in Europe, mysteriously dies, possibly at the hands of the Ku Klux  Klan. Erma Jean is with him when he dies, and something he tells her has  made her mute, too disturbed to speak. Daddy decides to move the family  north to Chicago, where their is more freedom and oppurtunity for black  people. Nellie describes many more things, both tragic and joyous, that  happen to her and her family, friends, and neighbors throughout the entire  years. Her diary, although fictional, is a window to the past and describes  a time period in American history I knew little about. This was an  excellant addition to the wonderful Dear America series.	2000-08-06

Taking the facts and filling in with what  was not known, the author has crafted a believable tale about the  difficulties and tragedies this family encountered, which included the  deaths of Harriet's mother and youngest brother. But what is certainly true  for the survivors is that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Harriet  is portrayed as a spirited, adventurous tomboy who develops a fierce  loyalty to her family. She often resents her older sisters, who try to curb  her spirit and keep her out of trouble. (Some things never change, no  matter what century it is!) This book starts of a series that would be  enjoyed by fans of the Dear America series.	2000-08-04

Dark Tide I: Onslaught lives up to it's ominous title from page one onward. The New Republic Senate refuses to believe that the Yuuzhan Vong  are a real threat. So Leia takes it upon herself to help evacuate the  refugees in the path of the Vong's merciless invasion of the Outer Rim  worlds. Anakin Solo accompanies Mara on what is supposed to be a restful  vacation for her on peaceful Dantooine, but the two end up having to fight  for their lives. Luke and Jacen Solo go to Belkaldan to see what is left of  the research facility attacked in the first New Jedi Order book, Vector  Prime. Jacen's twin sister Jaina, who is a super pilot in addition to being  a Jedi, joins Rogue Squadron (the Solo kids are starting to get really cool  now that they're growing up). Corran and Ganner investigate the wherabouts  of students on an archealogical dig. And here's where the real action  begins. Most everyone ends up on Dantooine, fleeing from the Vong. Now they  begin their desperate battle. If they lose, they all die. I loved how this  was action packed all the way through, and didn't drag at points like some  of the Star Wars books. I'm looking forward to reading Dark Tide II, Ruin.	2000-08-04

Fourteen-year-old Mary Driscoll and her family have lived in terrible poverty in the Irish countryside every since the potato famine began several years ago. When Mary is offered a chance to join her aunt and older  sister in America, the land of opportunity, she jumps at the chance to seek  a better life for herself. But after a long, stormy, and miserable ocean  voyage, Mary arrives in America to find that it is nothing like she  expected. She takes a job in a textile mill in Lowell, Massachusetts, where  she is scorned by most of the American workers and expected to work long  hours under terrible, unsafe conditions. There are few bright spots in this  account of the life faced by many girls in New England cities during the  mid-nineteenth century, and most of what happened to the fictional  character of Mary happened to various girls who lived back then and worked  in factories and mills. I would reccomend this to readers interested in  this particular time period in history, or to those readers who are fans of  the Dear America series.	2000-08-04

Fifteen-year-old Caitlin's entire world falls apart when she recieves the  news that her father has died in a shipwreck. Caitlin's older sister,  Rebecca, decides the best thing for the two of them to do is to move west  to Nebraska, where Rebecca is to marry a man she has never even met. But  from the day they arrive in Nebraska and Caitlin meets Rebecca's  husband-to-be, she knows this is going to be harder than she ever imagine.  Caitlin and Nate fall in love immediatley, but Nate is determined to remain  honorable and marry Rebecca, as he promised to do. Living in the same house  as Nate is sheer torture for Caitlin, especially after Nate and Rebecca  marry and Rebecca becomes pregnant. Although she eventually resigns herself  to never having Nate, a terrible tragedy gives them a chance to be  together, paving the way for an ending that is both happy and sad (with an  especially ironic twist in the end). I wish this book hadn't gone out of  print, because it's a wonderful book for teenage girls who love historical  romances, like myself (although I was actually quite young, only eleven,  when I read it years ago).	2000-08-04

In the spring of 1883, fourteen-year-old Teresa Viscardi and her large Italian-American family, which includes her, her younger brother and  sister, her parents, her aunt, uncle, cousin, and grandmother, leave their  home in New York City and decide to head west to Idaho to participate in  the founding of a utopian community. The community is to be called  Opportunity, but Teresa isn't of the feeling that the west is filled with  opportunity. She wants to return to New York City, where her friends and  home are. Instead, she's stuck, first on a crowded train, and then on a  covered wagon caravan, with her annoying family, of which her grandmother  and sister are the most annoying. Nanna is stubbornly traditional, and  pesky Netta reads Teresa's private diary. But when tragedy strikes, Teresa  realizes how much her family means to her, and she may be the only one who  can save them from disaster. I highly reccomend this excellant addition to  the Dear America series. It's a great read if you like historical fiction,  stories about pioneer life, or the other books in the series.	2000-08-04

Erna and Alfreda Anderson were two real passengers that traveled third class on the Titanic, but nothing is known about them, except that Erna  survived, and Alfreda did not. The author of this book has written a novel  that imagines who Erna and Alfreda Anderson were, why they were on the  Titanic, and how Erna made it out of the tragedy alive when Alfreda, her  relative, did not. The Erna of this book is a ten-year-old dreamer living  in the Swedish countryside, often at odds with her realistic,  sixteen-year-old sister Alfreda. Their father has been in America for  several years, and sends tickets for the family to join them. But their  mother must remain behind, so the sisters set off without her, arguing  along the way. They board the Titanic in England, and they're on their way.  Along the way, they finally manage to become friends. And how Erna  survives, and her sister does not, happens in a tragic plot twist that was  painful to read and had me nearly in tears. I highly reccomend this book.  It goes along well with Voyage on the Great Titanic, from the Dear America  series.	2000-08-04

Clotee has lived all twelve years of her life as a slave on the Belmont Plantation in Virginia. Now it's 1859, just before the start of the Civil  War. Although she has known no life other than that of a slave, she has  secretly learned how to read and write, and that ability gives her a  glimpse of the world out there. To practice, she keeps a secret diary that  she hides in a hollowed-out tree. An orphan most of her life, Clotee has  managed to make the best of her circumstances, and writing is one of the  few things that brings her any joy. When a tutor comes to the plantation to  teach the master's young son, Clotee figures that he'll just be another  predjudiced southerner. But he's an abolitionist that further expands  Clotee's horizons, and he may be able to give her the one thing she longs  for: freedom. I highly reccomend this beautifully written account of one  year in the life of a fictional slave girl who lived in circumstances  typical of the time. The fact that it is told through Clotee's diary allows  the reader to really get inside her head and know her innermost thoughts,  hopes, and dreams.	2000-08-04

This novel was built upon the fact that during the Middle Ages, executioners and their families were shunned, forced to live outside the  village walls and forbidden to attend church and social gatherings.  Thirteen-year-old Lily, the fictional main character, is cursed from the  moment she was born - her father is the village executioner. But because  her mother is the one to assist her father in his duties, Lily keeps to  herself in the forrest near their cottage, gathering herbs and healing  wounded animals, and taking comfort in her mother when her father distances  himself from them. Lily loses that one comfort when her mother sickens and  dies. Now Lily is doomed to be her father's assistant at executions. A  gentle, quiet girl, Lily cannot bear to see an animal in pain - she doesn't  know how she can ever watch executions. But Lily won't resign herself to  the fate assigned to her. This was an excellant historical novel that  brought the time and place of England in the 1400s, gruesome details and  all, to life. It was inspiring to read a story about a young girl who chose  to fight her place in life in a time when most people were forced to accept  whatever their circumstances in life turned out to be, whether they liked  them or not. I highly reccomend this novel to fans of historical novels  ages twelve and up (the more gruesome details might disturb younger  readers).	2000-08-04

And during that time, Jasper comes to think of  Plymouth Colony as his home. I highly recommend this addition to the My  Name is America series.

The fictional heroine of this novel, twelve-year-old Dovey Coe, narrates this story in a distinctly southern voice. Dovey never even tried to disguise her hatred of her vain older sister Caroline's wealthy suitor  Parnell Carraway. Seventeen-year-old Parnell was mean-spirited and  sadistic, tormenting Dovey and her deaf older brother, Amos, and trying to  persuade Caroline to give up her dreams of going to college. But in spite  of hating Parnell so very much, Dovey would never kill Parnell. But when  she is found in the same room with Parnell's dead body, that's just what  Dovey is accused of doing. Now, if she's going to win her trial, outspoken  Dovey has to keep quiet and let her inexperianced lawyer from the city take  care of things. I highly reccomend this novel. Fans of historical fiction  could definitley enjoy it. I would probably reccomend it to readers ages  ten and up, but I'm fifteen and I thought it was a wonderful story.	2000-08-01

But a woman they met at the airport finds them  rooms at a charming plantation house in the countryside that has been  converted into a bed and breakfast. Weird happenings, Phoebe's mysterious  illness, shady characters, and the disapearance of a new friend are only  some of the things that happen to them there. The sisters don't want to  believe in voodoo, even though they themselves are witches. But they have  to believe in it if they are going to fight it. This was a great Charmed  book. Like Whispers From the Past, I especially enjoyed the fact that it  had, for most of the book, a very different setting from that we see on the  show. Also there were some great plot twists that I never saw coming. This  was an all-around great summer read for Charmed fans.	2000-07-30
2350035:US	52797744	R17BWLJM2BFVK5	0743400402	7730541	How I Survived My Summer Vacation (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Vol. 1)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A killer collection perfect for summer vacation.	This book is a collection of short stories set between seasons one and two of Buffy. All six of the stories were excellant. In the first one, Dust by Michelle West, Buffy recieves gruesome visions of death every time she  touches a person. Buffy must face her own worst fears, and confront what  happened the night she died and was revived. The second story is titled  Absalom Rising and is by prolific Buffy writer Nancy Holder. A sorceror  named Absalom comes to Sunnydale and rallies what is left of the Master's  followers. His plan: have them steal the Master's bones so that they can  ressurect him. Now Giles, Jenny, Angel, Willow, and Xander must stop  Absalom and his followers without the help of Buffy, who is in LA with her  Dad. Next up is Looks Can Kill by Cameron Dokey. A shape-shifter who can  assume the shape of any living creature attempts to defeat the Scooby Gang  by the tried and true method of divide and conquer. His ultimate goal - to  capture Buffy by taking on the shape of one of her friends. The fourth  story, No Place Like..., is also by Cameron Dokey. It is set in LA and  involves Buffy trying to free the trapped spirits of a group of children.  Fifth is Uncle Dead and the Fourth of July. At a Fourth of July parade, a  group of zombie soldiers try to take over the town, and Giles, Jenny, and  Angel must put the zombies back to rest before midnight - or Sunnydale is  doomed. The last story is The Show Must Go On by Paul Ruditis. In this  story, the backstage crew (all vampires) of a travelling theater group  recreate death scenes from famous plays. The gang has to stop the vamps  before they kill everyone in the audience. This is a great Buffy book for  you to read on your summer vacation. Which, hopefully, will be exciting,  but not have any of the horrifying elements of the Scooby Gang's summer  vacations.	2000-07-27

Angel's newest job is pretty unusual for him - he's been hired as a bodyguard for seventeen-year-old Karinna Willits, the spoiled, bratty daughter of a Hollywood studio head. Angel can't really figure out why  Doyle had a vision of Karinna in trouble - she doesn't appear to be in any  sort of supernatural danger. But he figures he'll stick with guarding  Karinna and keep an eye out for trouble. He doesn't expect to be abducted  by an ailing sorceror who thinks by killing Angel he can trasfer Angel's  immortality to himself and live forever. Angel knows this all corrects to  Karinna SOMEHOW, but he just can't figure out how. The connection, revealed  in the end, totally shocked me, but I won't say what it is, since it would  spoil the whole thing. I didn't get why the whole subplot about bank  robbers was in there, but that's revealed at the end as well. Talk about a  plot twist! On a side note, I really liked the brief part about Cordelia  working for a short time as a tour guide. That brought a nice bit of humor  to a mostly dark story (although the darkness fits the mood of the show).  The ending was sad (but again I won't reveal what happens). I highly  reccomend this to fans of Angel, both the show and the books. One thing I  noticed: although the Angel books are classified as young adult books,  they're much darker in nature then the Buffy young adult books. They're as  dark as the adult Buffy books, in fact.	2000-07-26

The year is 1769; the place, Austria. The pressure is on thirteen-year-old Maria Antonia, youngest daughter of the Empress Maria Theresa, to excell so that she will be chosen to marry the future king of France. Antonia, as she  is called, must learn French language, fashions, customs, and etiquette so  that she can impress the king's messengers. She is given no time to act her  age; when she does attempt to enjoy life as a girl should, she is severely  punished. When she is sent away to France, her life is little better - she  makes enemies of the mistress of the current king, who is the grandfather  of her husband-to-be. She is forced to observe customs she can barely keep  straight. And she is having a hard time getting along with her fiance. I  viewed Marie Antoinette differently after reading this book. It was obvious  from the book and the afterword that Marie and her husband were not trained  well by their parents and teachers on how to become good rulers, and Marie  had been taught from the time she was young that the most important thing  was to look good. This is most likely why they became such bad rulers and  ended up losing their lives.	2000-07-25

Living in the tiny, remote settlement of Gonzales, Texas, in 1835, pioneer farm girl Lucinda Lawrence has just celebrated her thirteenth birthday. Her father is against war with Mexico - he learned the horrors of war firsthand  during the War of 1812. Lucinda's brothers find the idea of war glorious -  her oldest brother, Willis, is eager to fight against the oppresive  Mexicans. Lucinda's mother just doesn't want to lose anymore children - her  youngest, a baby girl, died during the journey from Missouri to Texas years  earlier. Lucinda's friend, Mittie Roe, wants her father to come home safely  from his trading expedition. And Lucinda herself isn't sure what she wants  - the Mexicans are treating the American settlers badly, but she fears the  war will go poorly for the outnumbered, ragtag settler army. But like it or  not, over the next few months, Lucinda and all her family and friends will  be swept up in the war for Texas independence. Some of them will survive,  and some of them will not. But through it all, Lucinda matures from a girl  to a young woman who knows where she stands and what is worth fighting for.  I highly reccomend this excellant book, particuarly to fans of the Dear  America series.	2000-07-25

Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Henry VIII of England, may live a life filled with comfort and luxury, but she is desperatley lonely. The year is 1544, and eleven-year-old Elizabeth is mostly ignored by her  father. Most of the time, she lives in a palace in the countryside with her  older half-sister, dour Princess Mary, her younger half-brother, sickly  Edward, their stepmother, Queen Catherine, and their servants. Only Kat,  Elizabeth's governess, seems to pay any attention to her. Elizabeth mourns  the death of her mother, who she barely knew, and the deaths of two of her  stepmothers. She wonders if her father truly loves her or views her as a  political tool that he can someday marry off to gain land or wealth. I  highly reccomend this book. Not only is it a richly detailed account of  life in 16th century England, but it also a story of a lonely young girl  yearning for her father's love.	2000-07-25

Remember Patience Whipple, called Mem, is a bit frightened at the thought of the New World her family is sailing to on the Mayflower. She hears tales of strange &quot;feathered people&quot; who will attack the settlers. But  she has more immediate concerns - the dreadful Billington boys, who  mercilessly tease Mem and her friend Hummy, the ever present seasickness,  and the daily boredom during the long, tedious sea voyage. But once she  arrives in the New World, things become even worse. During the long, cold  first winter at Plymouth, many settlers become sick and die. Mem is  frightened that her family might be next. When spring comes, she thinks  they are safe - until her mother falls ill and dies. Can Mem find the  strength and courage to go on without her mother? And can she come to  accept her future stepmother, quiet, sad Mistress Potts? What I liked best  about this book is that it told what a young girl who sailed on the  Mayflower and lived at Plymouth Colony might have thought and done. In  making the main character a young girl, the author brought the history to  life, and I really like the fictional diary format used in this series - it  makes you feel really close to the characters.	2000-07-25

Born into a wealthy Southern plantation family, Emma Simpson had every luxury she desired.... until the outbreak of the Civil War. Her father, brother, uncle, and the young man she loves go off to war - her brother and  uncle to die early on. But the hardships are not limited to the battlefield  - they reach out to touch Emma's sheltered, quiet home in ways she never  imagined possible. There are rumors that the slaves she thought faithful to  her family plan to run away. Deserters from both sides raid the farm,  stealing the food Emma, her mother, and her aunt and cousin, who have come  to stay for the remainder of the war, need in order to survive. And when  her already frail mother becomes desperatley ill, and soon dies, Emma has  only her aunt and cousin to turn to. But things become even worse when  Yankees invade the peaceful countryside and take over Emma's house to use  as headquarters. Confined to an upstairs room, Emma has now lost the one  thing left of her life before the war. But she is determined to never give  up and wait for the day her father and sweetheart will return home to her.  I highly reccomend this book. It showed how the Southern families lives'  were torn apart by the Civil War and how a lot of them practiced slavery  simply because it was what their families had been doing for generations  and they knew no other way of life.	2000-07-25

Living in Pennsylvania's Delaware Valley in 1763, thirteen-year-old Catharine &quot;Caty&quot; Logan's biggest concern is getting one of the boys at school, Jess Owen, to notice her without becoming vain - a sin for  Quakers like Caty and her family. But after a group of settlers massacre  the inhabitants of a peaceful Indian village, Caty is terrified that the  Indians will retaliate by attacking settlers. Her worst fears come true  when she and her little brother Thomas are capture by a band of Lenape  Indians and taken to their camp. Even though Caty is adopted into an Indian  family and treated with kindness, she rebels against her captors every  chance she has. It takes the love of a young warrior, Snow Hunter, once a  captive like Caty, but who chose to remain with the Indians, for Caty to  understand that the Indians are people just like herself, and she finds a  sense of belonging. The story was told in the form of Caty's diary. Mary  Pope Osborne did a wonderful job of bringing the language, customs, and  events of the 1760s to life.	2000-07-25

When their ship sinks in the ice of Antarctica, the crew of the Mystery despairs. They're in the middle of nowhere, and no one knows where they are. Setting out in their four lifeboats, the men soon lose two of the  boats and many of their supplies. The two remaining boats are separated and  are forced to make camp to do repairs. Jack Winslow, head of the  expedition, and his son Colin, who are at one of the camps, set out on the  chance that they will encounter another explorer or perhaps a whaling ship.  In spite of the fact that this is a very small chance, they are determined  not to give up hope. And at the other camp, Andrew, Winslow's stepson,  rallies the men on, believing his stepfather will do everything in his  power to find them. This is a great historical survival and adventure  story, but it's really not a book that would appeal to many people ages  9-12, unless they really are interested in the subject matter. It belongs  in the young adult section.	2000-07-24

Prue and Phoebe are afraid that Celeste, the girl Piper has been  assigned to, will find out their identity as witches. But Celeste seems to  be a nice kid who just got a bad lot in life. It's Daria, Celeste's  roommate at the home, that Piper and her sisters are suspicious of. She  seems to be dabbling in the dark arts - could she be involved with  warlocks? Or could it be Phoebe's new boyfriend, Kenji? Or Prue's new  friend, Adrienne, who works at a magic ship? All the Halliwell sisters know  for sure is that someone is after them - and that someone wants their  powers bad enough to kill them.

Well, they angered a bunch of African gods by refusing to offer up  an animal sacrifice. But the four teens refuse to give in to the gods, even  though Senna, the witch who got them trapped in Everworld, urges them to do  so. David, Christopher, April, and Jalil may not be on the good side of the  gods, but they have their real world smarts - so they have one advantage on  their side. Now they just have to find a way out.

I first read this book in March 1997 when it first came out. Even after three and a half years, and the reading of many more books, this remains of my favorite books ever. It brings the Oregon Trail to life and puts faces on the countless brave pioneers who braved the hardships of the trail to  make new lives in the west. The narrator is a fictional thirteen-year-old  farm girl from Missouri, Hattie Campbell. Through her diary, written in a  voice that truly sounds as if it belongs to a young girl from that time,  the reader experiances the events of Hattie's journey west - her friendship  with Pepper, a fourteen-year-old girl from the wagon train, the beginnings  of a romance with Pepper's brother Wade, and many others. Hattie was a  character that I really came to care about, and I was sad to put the book  down when it was finished, but since then, I have read it several more  times. Kristiana Gregory is an amazing author that has given a distinct  voice to each of her narrators in this book and her two other Dear America  books. I hope she writes another Dear America book soon; she's one of my  favorite authors from the series. I highly reccomend this book to  historical fiction fans.	2000-07-21

Obi-Wan finds Siri  difficult to work with, and she seems hostile and unfriendly toward him.  When Obi-Wan, Siri, and their masters land on the planet Kegan to search  for a baby who may have the potential to be a Jedi, they descover a strange  world that has not had any contact with off-worlders for over three  decades. When they are exploring, Obi-Wan and Siri are mistaken for  Keganite children cutting school, they are abucted and placed in a  detention facility where children are drilled to accept the rule of the  Kegan leaders. In this place where freedom is a memory and questioning  authority strictly forbidden, Obi-Wan and Siri must rely on their  connection to the force and to each other if they want to make it out  alive. I highly reccomend this series to all Star Wars fans. It's a  children's series, but you don't have to be a child to enjoy it - I'm  several years older than the suggested age level, and the book had me on  the edge of my seat.	2000-07-20

She figures she can rest there a  few days and then set out to contact her family. But when the Yeerks find  her, she must escape earlier than planned - but not without fighting a  battle first to protect her new friends. One of the things that made this  book much better than the recent books in the series, which were mostly  dissapointments, was that it had a new plot and setting that hadn't been  used yet. Highly reccomended to fans of the series.	2000-07-20

She takes Beth and runs away into the countryside, hoping to reach their relatives. They must escape persuit and survive in a harsh world. But Kazy is determined for little Beth's sake.

But they only get worse. Her father, a reckless dreamer, halts their journey when it has barely started, so that he can take a job working on the Erie Canal. All week long he leaves Mem and her siblings at a tavern; on his one day home, he spends the time drunk. Finally, Mem has had enough. Determined that Joshua and Lily have a better home, she decides to take them back to the relatives in Connecticut on her own. But their journey through the wilderness will be filled with hardship and peril, and will test the limits of Mem's courage, endurance, and love. This was excellant as a historical novel, but also as a tale of a girl who is determined to make a better life for her family. I highly reccomend it. It is especially good if you read the other two books about Mem, Journey to Nowhere and Frozen Summer, but it stands on its own as well.	2000-07-17

After so many formulaic fantasies for kids and teens (with afew exceptions) it was nice to see a series with a completely originalidea, that wasn't about dragons or wizards or unicorns, or the like. The anime style artwork complemented the story well. Kia and Ryushi are sixteen-year-old twins living in a small village with their father and brother, far from the conflicts that wage in their kingdom. They will not be protected forever. They must learn to fight for their home and their lives if they want to survive in the harsh world out there. I don't really agree with the publisher's suggested age level of ages 9-12. This book is good for that age group, but teens would enjoy it too. The book is not difficult to read, but very enjoyable and exciting.	2000-07-17

Colin and Andrew resent each other, there are arguments among the crew, and the journey is long and difficult.  And once they land, it's an even longer journey across Antarctica, that not everyone that sets out will survive. And back on the ship, Colin must deal with a mutiny among the small crew left behind. This was an excellant historical adventure story, different from many others for kids and teens.  However, I do not agree with the classification of the book as one for ages 9-12. With the older characters and a story that would appeal more to older readers, this book would be better classified as one for readers 12 and up.  I think teenagers who enjoy this type of book would be the best audience.	2000-07-17

Pen and one of the other  girls, Rose, are fortunate to end up in a fairly good position, and Pen  slowly adjusts to life in Virginia. But her other friends aren't as  fortunate, and long to escape. And soon Pen will have to make a choice  where she stands. I highly reccomend this novel to fans of historical  fiction. A similiar title I would reccomend is A Stolen Life by Jane Louise  Curry.

Mary O'Shea is no longer a child, but a young woman of eighteen. Having returned to her frontier home on the Great Lakes island of Mackinac after a visit with her sister, she is able to bid farewell to her ailing father before his death. Now she is keeping up the farm she inheirited with the  help of her older brother and his Indian wife. But when the English suitor  she refused, James, follows Mary to Mackinac to once more try to win her  heart, she finds herself torn between him and her childhood friend, White  Hawk, an orphaned Indian boy raised by a childless white couple. Her  feelings for White Hawk have become romantic, and a marriage to him will  allow her to remain on the island she loves. It was quite clear to me from  the beginning what the outcome of this book would be, but I enjoyed it  anyway. I am a bit sad that this is the final book, but it is a fitting end  - Mary, a child in the first book, has grown into a married young woman  with a home of her own.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this novel, and I'm looking forward  to the movie. There really isn't much point in summarizing the book since  most of you probably already know the plot, at least to some degree. My  favorite character is Rogue, probably because she's only a little older  than me, so I could sort of relate to her (although I'm glad I don't have  her power, since it sounded awful). I'm looking forward to seeing the movie  a lot more after reading the book.	2000-07-06

What I liked best about this book was that, through a fictional diary kept by Anastasia Romanov, youngest daughter of the last tsar of Russia, was that is showed her not as a royal figure but just as a girl with feelings  and concerns. The book begins in 1914. Twelve-year-old Anastasia and her  family lead lives of luxury in an elegant palace and enjoy frequant  holidays. Anastasia's biggest concern is learning her lessons in time. But  as the years go by, and Russia becomes involved in World War I, the Russian  people become increasingly dissatisfied, and in 1917, Anastasia's father is  forced to abdicate, and the family is exiled to Siberia. The diary ends  just two months before seventeen-year-old Anastasia and her family are  executed by revolutionaries. The book, except at the very beginning, was  really sad, but it brought the life the end of the Romanov dynasty and  young Anastasia's final years.

Madelaine must  avoid the seemingly charming Rory's flirtations without arrousing her  father's suspicions.

Fortunatley, the ending leaves it open for there to be more books, if the author decides to write  them. This book opens with Tristan and Genia trying to stop Tristan's evil  clone, Devon, from completely destroying all life on Earth. Tristan is also  threatening the moon, which has been colonized, and the government there  must find a way to save everyone. And the evil organization of Quietus is  trying to take over the Mars colony, where the other clone, Jame, lives.  Tristan and Genia temporarily stop the destruction of Earth, but then Devon  comes after them, and Mora, Tristan's ex-girlfriend, turns traitor and  joins Devon. Tristan and Genia are now in the final showdown with Devon, as  the fate of the world hangs in the balance. I highly reccomend the entire  2099 series. It is one of the best young adult science fiction series out  there. John Peel is an excellant writer, and if you liked 2099, you'll like  his other series, Diadem and The Outer Limits (inspired by the television  show).	2000-06-10

I never managed to get a feel for the characters, as they were never fully developed, remaining one-dimensional  throughout the story. The line between good and evil was just too generally  defined - Africans good, white people bad. Real life doesn't work that way.  And when I completed the story, I felt like something was missing, that I  hadn't read the whole book - it cut off so abruptly, at 86 pages, and the  historical note and pictures seemed there just to make it look longer. I  can't believe that such a short, unsubstational book is going to be $10.95.  I expected better from this previously high-quality series.	2000-06-10

Yet when he dies in a mining  accident, things become even more difficult, as she must care for the  children and pay the rent. Yet in spite of her bleak life, she finds some  hope in the children, and in the possibly of true love. I highly reccomend  this novel to historical fiction fans.

She plots to bring her other brother,  Alfonso, to the throne, while thwarting her brother's attempts to arrange a  marriage for her. She decides to take matters into her own hands and  arrange a marraige that will bring her happiness and political prosperity.  This was a wonderful book that brought Isabel to life, not just as a royal  figure, but as a teenager with feelings and dreams. I highly reccomend this  to historical fiction fans, especially if you enjoyed other books in the  Royal Diaries series.	2000-06-10

She manages to track down one of her clones, Annie, who is a ballet dancer and was raised  in Paris. Amy is trying hard not to be suspicious - Annie seems to friendly  and perfect to be geuinine. And then there's Andy. Amy met Andy at camp,  and he claimed he was part of another cloning experiment. But she hasn't  seem him since. Now, he just happens to be in Paris at the same time she  is, and his behavior is just as suspicious as Annie's. Amy's got to get to  the bottom of this before she falls into a deadly trap.

Andy is trapped in a deadly world on the brink of destruction, and his time  is running out, as he is the only living creature in all of Ghostworld. A  pretty good story, but a little weak at points.

Seperated from his father, whose fate he never learned, just before Earth was destroyed by the hostile Drej species, Cale Tucker was raised by one of his father's friends, Tek, a member of a peaceful alien race. Taken to  Tek's desolate homeland, he grew up longing for his father's return, and  eventually accepting that he'd never see him again. Tek is determined that  Cale, now fifteen, learn something of Earth and Humanity, so, along with an  orphan alien girl, they begin a journey that takes them throughout the  galaxy. This book explained a lot of how Cale became the person he was in  the movie - why he resented his father, why he looked down on drifter  colonies, etc. I highly reccomend this companion novel to science fiction  fans who are looking forward to seeing Titan A.

Whatever editor at Scholastic that let this series get to the presses needs to be fired. This series was an abomination. The teen horror genre isn't known for being particuarly good, but this is worse than anything  I've ever read from it. If possible, this book was even worse than the  first in this series - the writing was less choppy, but the plotting was  even more ridiculous and the characters even more cliched. I didn't find  the end particuarly satisfying either, and if the author is going to base  characters on real people, she should at least get her facts straight. The  characters of Mercy Smith and her four year old daughter, Dorcas, were  obviously based on the real people of Sarah Good and her young daughter,  also named Dorcas, accused as witches in 1692 Salem. However, while Sarah  was hung as a witch, her daughter was spared (probably because of her age,  she wasn't actually tried as a witch). In this book, both the mother and  daughter were hung. That was a glaring error. There is only one thing about  this book I can honestly say was good: It was short.	2000-06-07

E. yet, but judging by the novelization, this is an excellant original prequal novel. Set eleven years after the destruction of Earth by an alien species, the Drej, and around  four years before the film, this is the background story of one of the two  main characters, Akima. As a little girl, she was orphaned by the  destruction of Earth, and was raised by her grandmother in a makeshift  human space colony. After her grandmother's death and the colony's  destruction, Akima sets out to learn how to be a pilot so she can help what  is left of humanity find a new home. This novel explained a lot of Akima's  background and how she came to be a pilot and help find the Titan in the  movie. Highly reccomended if you are looking forward to the movie.	2000-06-04

The whole premise of this book can be summed up in one sentence: Now that they know Stephen is a murderer, can Joanna and Penn find a way out of the mess they created when they concealed Laurie's death? The simple plot  didn't really bother me, since there was a lot of suspense. And there were  some surprises (like the cabin fire that happened fairly early on, and some  later on that I won't spoil). But overall, it seamed that Penn and Joanna  found an unrealistically easy way out. I still reccomend this if you read  the first two books, because it does conclude the story.	2000-06-01

There wasbasically 200 pointless pages in which the cast of one-dimensionalcharacters went on and on about how wonderful Rebecca was (and I didn't particuarly think she was all that great). Then there were ten pages that were somewhat interesting (and earned the second star, since they sparked a bit of interest). This was one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It wasn't even suspensful, or scary, and it's supposed to be a horror book!	2000-06-01

Stephen, Laurie's killer, is about to  snap. Joanna can only pray Casey isn't his next victim. There was a lot of  suspense in this book, but it's probably been wrongly labeled as a horror  story.

Then there's the two new students: Jon, who Deirdre just started dating, and his creepy, accident-prone ex-girlfriend Anita. Can Deirdre and Dana find out who the real killer is before they become the next victims? This was basically the whole premise for this book. It wasn't a bad one for a horror story.

I will start my review off by saying that I am WAY older than the target audience for this book. However, I still found it to be an enjoyable and seemingly accurate portrait of the settling of Jamestown. The history is  made accesible to the younger readers by telling the story through the  diary of a child, nine-year-old Elizabeth Barker. Many of Elizabeth's  concerns and feelings could belong to contemporary children - she misses  her twin brother who was left behind in England, mourns the deaths of many  of her friends, just wants to have a good time playing with other children  her own age, and worries for her pregnant mother's safety. I think this  would be an excellent book to start out younger children on historical stories, and would definitley appeal to fans of the American Girls series.  I would have loved to have a book like this to read when I was younger.	2000-05-16

Although suspicious of the oddly human statue in the garden and the mysertious secret admirer who sends her letters and gifts, Kathleen dismisses rumors that the houes is cursed as little more than fairly tales. Little does Kathleen know that she is the only one who can break the curse and save Chance from eternal torment. But the one who cursed him, given eternal youth and beauty because of her worship of darkness, will do anything to stop Kathleen from freeing Chance, and time is running out. I thought this was a very good romantic suspense novel, and I really enjoyed the ending, which certainly proved that what goes around comes around!	2000-05-15

After her parents' divorce and her mother's emotional breakdown, seventeen-year-old Joanna goes to live with her father in a small North Carolina town. Joanna learns a girl her age, Laurie Jenkins, dissapeared a  few weeks ago. Joanna meets four of Laurie's friends, Penn, Casey, Stephen,  and Tessa. Because she is in love with Penn, she ignores her growing  suspicions about the group. But she better start trusting her instincts, or  she could end up like Laurie - or worse. I highly reccomend this series to  teens who enjoy thrillers. It was a very exciting page-turner.	2000-05-14

Sondra is an ordinary seventeen-year-old girl, or so she thinks. Then she allows her best friend, Mallory, to hypnotize her. She has a terrifying vision of burning alive, and then starts to have similiar dreams. She  visits a psychic who says that Sondra may have died in a fire during a past  life as a girl named Penny, and that her killer may be after her in this  life as well. Sondra's boyfriend, Zach, thinks it is Sondra's stepbrother,  Eric. Eric thinks it's Zach. And Mallory starts to act more and more  mysterious. If Sondra doesn't find out the truth soon, she may die in this  life as well. This was an exciting, page-turning book. Once I started it, I  could not put it down. And the ending was the complete opposite of what I  expected, which was good.	2000-05-13

When I realized there was a novelization that came out a month early, I went out and bought it. I was amazed. Novelizations usually are  inferior to the movie, which means this is going to be a spectacular movie  with great visuals (even if it is animated). The story is set fifteen years  after the destruction of Earth by an evil alien species, the Drej. The few  humans that survived are scattered throughout the galaxy. Cale is one such  human survivor. A little boy when Earth was destroyed, he is now twenty,  and still bitter that his father left him in the final moments of Earth.  But it turns out that his father hid the key to creating a new home for the  humans - a spaceship called the Titan. Only Cale can find it, making him  humanity's last hope. But the Drej are looking for the Titan as well. This  was an action-packed novel, and I can't wait to see the movie.	2000-05-11

It ended rather quickly, but that's to be expected in a two-book miniseries. And the end certainly proved the point that what goes around comes around. I would  reccomend this book to teenagers who like vampire stories, but anyone older  would probably find the story too tame.	2000-05-09

I really enjoyed this book, even more than the author's first, which was itself excellant. Jessica, the main character, seems a pretty average, unpopular teen at first glance. But she's actually published a vampire novel under a pen name. When a new boy enrolls at her school, he reminds  her a great deal of Aubrey, the vampire villian from her novel. It turns  out that he really is Aubrey, come to kill her. However, things become  complicated when the two fall in love. Both of these characters appeared in  In the Forests of the Night, and I was glad Miss Atwater-Rhodes chose to  write more about them. Jessica was only briefly mentioned in the first  book, but I thought right away that she would be a neat character. And I  never liked Aubrey much in the first book (although he was definitley a  cool villian!), but meeting Jessica certainly improved his personality. I  highly reccomend this wonderful novel to fans of horror and vampire novels.  The author is extremely talented, and I think it is wonderful that she has  become a published author while she is still a teenager. I hope she  continues to write more wonderful books like this one.	2000-05-09

Death, watching over the cemetary, sees Kristin  mourning at her sister's grave. He falls in love with her and takes the  form of a teenaged boy so he can be close to her, and make her love him.

Since this book is about werewolves, I expected it to be a horror story. It was more of a suspense story, but I still enjoyed it. I found it to be extremely sad, and haunting. I liked how there wasn't a perfect ending, but a hopeful one anyway. I reccomend this book if you like books with a touch  of horror, but more suspense and chills.	2000-05-06

However, there was enough suspense and chills to keep me reading. Miss Honeywell is one of those villians you love to hate, and I  felt sorry for poor Primrose (although she was a bit of a brat). And I  really liked the ending, which was kind of funny. I reccomend this book if  you want an unusual ghost story.	2000-05-06

Lately, the Animorphs books have been lacking effort. But this book changed all that. In one word, it was awesome.

I'm 15, and the Jedi Apprentice series are some of the best Star Wars books I've come across. They have great plots, characterizations, and action. Jude Watson has remained faithful to the movie characters, like Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, and created some great new ones, like Xanatos. I  highly reccomend this series to ALL Star Wars fans, young and old.	2000-05-03

An unusual family moves in next door, and Marvin gets a crush on the girl, prompting him to follow her into the swamp, where  he discovers a terrible secret about her that could change everything.

Thesepoor children's lives are so unfortunate, the situations they get intoso ridiculuous, it's hilarious.

Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst Animorphs books. (Theonly worse one was The First Journey). Basically it was a lesserrehash of #26, The Attack, and Megamorphs #2, In the Time of the Dinosaurs. Those were two of my favorite books, which is probably the only reason this got two stars instead of one. In any case, I only reccomend this to completists.	2000-05-02

Aside from The Innocent and The Invaders, this was probably my favorite Outer Limits book so far. I like how John Peel was able to take a television episode and add some fresh backstory, change a few characters around, etc. The character of Lisa changed the most. In the episode, she  was an unlikable, cheating woman. In the books, she's an impressionable  young girl who is simply misguided. Anyway, I highly reccomend this book to  teens who like sci fi.	2000-05-01

The Vampire's Love by Janice Harrell was a pretty good series, even though it wasn't as good as The Vampire Twins. However, the series was very short. I felt it could have at least been a trilogy, rather then two books. Also, the ending seemed a little neat, unlike the Vampire Twins, where the line  between good and evil seemed thinner.

Written by the orriginal author, K. A. Applegate, BACK TO BEFORE has everything I've come to expect from Animorphs. When Jake wishes that he never got involved in the battle for Earth, everything changes - and it's not, to quote the back cover, such a wonderful life! I thought that this was probably one of the best Animorphs books ever. I hope that that K. A.

Shadows Over Balinor was a good conclusion to the Unicorns of Balinor series; however, I felt that the book could have been a bit longer.

Of all the American Diaries books, Maddie Retta Lauren was my favorite. I really liked the main character, Maddie, a thirteen-year-old Confederate girl. At the beginning she seemed a bit spoiled, but by the end of the book she had definitley changed. She realized that both the Northerners and the  Southerners were fighting for what they believed in, and that slavery was  wrong. I liked the ending as well because it seemed very realistic to me. I  highly reccomend this book to girls ages nine and up looking for a good  historical novel.	2000-03-24

To be honest, I didn't expect much from this book; I bought it because I am a fan of the author's Roswell High series. However, I found this title to be suprisingly good. There wasn't much action, but the characters were  likable, and I really enjoyed the ending. Even though I had never been in a  situation like either Julia or Maggie, I could still relate to them. I only  had one question: The book seemed to focus just as much on Maggie as Julia,  so why was it called Julia?	2000-03-23

I found this book to be one of the best from The Outer Limits series. On a planet called Tarshish in the far reaches of space, a group of humans from an overcrowded Earth of the future build a colony from scratch. But when  hostile alien monsters attack, only the children survive. Now, they must  rebuild their homes without adult guidance, survive harsh conditions - and  years later, fight for their right to remain on the planet they now  consider home. While this was a short book, it was a quick, exciting read.  I could see how much these kids cared for their home and how they thought  of each other as one big family and helped each other out. Kudos to the  author for a story that is both exciting and heartwarming.	2000-03-23

Leaving at least some of the  formulas behind, #1 The Awakening sets up the main characters and the  center love triangle: vampire brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore, whose  fight over young vampire Katherine in Renassaince Italy led to their  turning, and Elena Gilbert, the human high school girl that will renew  their centuries-old feud.

The Gatekeeper Trilogy are the three best Buffy books ever, no question there. This was probably the best of the three; it didn't suffer that pesky &quot;bridge-syndrome&quot; that is  typical of the middle books in trilogies. The characters were well done as  always.

This was definitley my favorite Fear Street Sagas book. Margarete Fier was a really great character, and her power was pretty cool, too. The flashbacks were interesting as well, since you were able to figure it the  back story, which is sometimes kinda unclear in these books.

This book would be excellant even if the author hadn't written it when she was just thirteen.

She  must face who she is and the fact she is partly responsible, and learn the  truth about revenge and what really happened 300 years ago when she was  turned.

True, some of the dialogue and some of the actions were out of character, but it  was an entertaining read, which I think is the important part.

This was a very good Star Wars novel, much better than the last one I read, which was Planet of Twilight. I liked that this featured Leia and Han's kids more than most of the other books, but it was very dark in  nature. One event in it was..... surprising, and sad, to say the least.  (You'll have to read the book to know what I am taking about). By the way,  I wish the author had explained more about Mara's illness. How did she get  it, exactly? Will she be cured? Anyway, this was still one of my favorites  of the Star Wars novels, although it was dark and violent and very gory at  times.	1999-10-07

This is another great book by Ann Rinaldi. In telling the story of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, she uses the voice of Fanny McCoy, the youngest of the McCoy children, whose entire childhood was taken up by and destroyed by the  feud. When she was born in 1873, tensions were already high, and renewed  over a theft when Fanny was five. Two years later, when Fanny's favorite  sister, Roseanna, has an affair with a Hatfield, tensions explode. Over the  next ten years, Fanny loses numerous family members to the feud - a sister,  several brothers, nearly her mother, who barely survives, Roseanna, who  dies of grief - and she loses all chances of a happy and normal childhood  as she alternatley mourns her family and fumes with anger. More than just a  story of this famous feud, THE COFFIN QUILT was also a portrait of a young  girl who tries to rise about the hatred and violence she is surrounded by  as she grows up.	1999-10-04

Unlike other readers, I found it quite easy to believe this novel was fiction. I am only thirteen years old, but even I was able to easily  figure out that the United States Government would never trade white women  to the Indians for horses, especially considering the attidues the U.S.  Army and Government had toward the Native Americans in the 1870s, when this  novel takes place. And while the heroine's actions would have been deemed  punishable in 1870s upper class society, it seems hardly plausible that her  family would have gone to the extents that they did. In fact, all  plausibility went out the window within the first few pages of this book,  leaving room for the author to conjure up a rollicking, if highly  unrealistic, adventure with a likeable heroine, however unbelievable her  plight. And the auther did manage to throw in some interesting details of  19th century Native American life on the Great  Plains. Highly reccomend  for those who like adventure stories and don't mind distortion of facts in  their historical fiction. Those historical fiction fans out there who are  sticklers for reality may want to skip this one, however.	1998-12-29
