Excel is covered in depth. As are Word, Outlook and the fascinating new Infopath product that is an XML technologies client. <br /> <br />The writing is good. I could have used a few more non-screenshot graphics to illustrate the control flow between applications. But these are nit-picks. This is a solid book on automating and integrating with office using C# and .NET framework.	2005-10-07

If you're writing any type of database driven code and you think that you don't need to understand SQL, read this book. You do need to understand it, and this book teaches it very well. <br /> <br />Man, I'm so tired of cleaning up bad SQL code. Code that makes hundreds of queries when one would suffice. Or tables that have no primary keys. Or code that never makes use of joins. SQL is not horrible. It's worth understanding and knowing how to write well. <br /> <br />This book is well written, well illustrated, and makes learning SQL as pain-free as it can be. Please, please, please, read this book.	2005-10-07

The ordering of topics seems a little odd to me. The first serious chapters of the book start with XSLT, which is universally considered to be one of the hardest technologies in the XML world to learn. <br /> <br />In fact, it isn't until chapter 7 that you see PHP in the book at all. At which point the author goes over the SAX and DOM models of XML reading and writing. Which, in my mind, would have been the more traditional place to start the book. After a brief explanation of XML and it's usefulness. <br /> <br />Out of the 360 pages of the book only 100 of the non-appendix pages cover PHP. They do it well, but they have to do it at lightning speed since the majority of the book covers XSLT and DHTML. <br /> <br />That being said, there is good coverage of XML work in PHP in this book. And if you are having troubles with PHP and XML then there will be answers here for you. <br /> <br />The writing is good. Which brings up the whole experience by a notch.	2005-10-07

The coverage of the topics is outstanding in both it's breadth and depth. The tone is very readable. And the use of graphics, wow. This book is tremendous. It's going to instantly be \\"the TCP/IP reference\\". It blows the old classic, TCP/IP Illustrated, straight out of the water. This book is worth every single penny. No doubt.

The style is very practical with real world advice and stories. Screenshots are used very well. This isn't one of those 500 page bible tomes that covers every single aspect. <br /> <br />You can compare this book with O'Reilly's \\"EBay: The Missing Manual\\". This one comes out smaller and more focus. While the O'Reilly book comes out as more thorough and comprehensive. Both are good. It's just a question of how import eBay is to you. If it's something you do now and then and you just want to do it better, this is likely the book for you.	2005-10-04

Where other publishers will put out 1200 page tomes that are all screenshots, with APress it's mainly text. Well written, well organized, well presented text that is informative and straight to the point. <br /> <br />Seriously, there is a lot to know about Oracle administration. And Sam does a great job laying it all out. From the basics of schema maintenance, to some background on unix and linux (possibly the only fat in the book), to advanced topics like database monitoring, materialized views, and performance tuning. This is a master work. <br /> <br />I stronly recommend it.	2005-10-04

From the title you might think it had some information on the effecient data modelling for Oracle, you would be wrong. That's not in here, but what's in here is good all on it's own. Versioning, transactions, locking, the Oracle memory model, it's all in here. <br /> <br />The writing is good. If I had a complaint it would be that there could be a lot more illustrations. Particular in the section on locking and latching.	2005-10-04

It's not a reference, it certainly couldn't be in it's scant 200 pages. It teaches both the language and the framework by using example projects and walking through how they are built with a combination of code, illustrations and screenshots. The writing is good, if a bit terse. <br /> <br />If you are a VB beginner and you are looking for a step by step walkthrough, avoid the mega super bible 1,000 page tomes, and try something like this book in combination with a refernce book on the language and another on the framework. Though you could probably skip the framework one and just use the MSDN.	2005-10-04

It stars slow with an introduction to the topic and some chapters on process and specification that feel more management level in style. Then there are the chapters that cover the monitoring tools from installation through setup and continued use. The book is well written, but it could use some more illustrations. In particular in the tools chapters which are really at the heart of the book.	2005-09-29

The first set was problems with the production; the fonts are too big and the graphics are too large. On the content side I didn't like the way the narrative guides the book through a character story. I find that it obscures the point.<br /><br />That being said, I realize that everyone has different tastes. So if you like management books that are written as a story. With the addition of check-lists and bibliographies (?). Then you might want to give this book a look.	2005-09-29

The problem is that the coverage is too sweeping. There are too many screenshots and the coverage is way too broad. It's unclear to me how simply booting up a Linux distribution and playing with it for a little while isn't just as good as having this book walk you through it. <br /> <br />That being said, if you are really nervous about Linux and you want a canned walkthrough to show you how to install it and use the basics, then you should have a look at this book.	2005-09-29

It has some faults. The fonts are too big, the illustrations are too big and the margins are too wide. This book could have been about half as fat if it were just produced better. <br /> <br />But the content is great. There is a fast but thorough dive into C# syntax and form. After that there are numerous chapters on graphics, threading, web work, XML and more.

If you are looking for something about managing your personal digital identity, there is nothing here for you. In addition those looking for code samples beware. There are some XML code fragments but this is an architectural level book, which means, no code. <br /> <br />The writing is great, and the illustrations are used well to cut through what are often some complex interactions between multiple digital authorities. Definitely worth the look if you know what you are getting.	2005-09-29

It's a best practices guide for Lego. It teaches how to plan and sculpt Lego like nothing I have read before. It's definitely not the type of book that you get with a Lego kit.  <br /> <br />There is also a reference section at the end of the book which covers all of the different types of Lego pieces, which is really handy. <br /> <br />My reservation is that the book could have been larger. The author could have presented more examples to illustrate different types of Lego techniques. So if anything my four star rating is just my way of saying; more, more!	2005-09-29

Then it discusses the problem, gives a solution, and then discusses how the solution actually works. It gives you insight into the workings of Exchange within a practical framework. <br /> <br />The writing is good. It's a little stiff, but you would expect that from this type of format.	2005-09-29

In reality your digital identity is interspersed with your physical identity and both a very important. <br /> <br />This is the most accessible of the privacy books I've read.

It will give you ideas for your existing work, and inspire you to try out Ruby and Rails. <br /> <br />I thought I had seen the best from Dave Thomas with the Pragmatic Programmer and the Ruby pick-axe book, but this book tops both. It's well thought out and organized. The writing is engaging. The technology is well researched. The examples are great. Illustrations are sparing, and used effectively. <br /> <br />I can't come up with enough words to say how much I love this book. This is easily the best tech book this year. It's a must read.

It's a walkthrough from the basics that only covers actual coding at the end. Though even then it's not very deep. That's not bad though since it really is an architectural level book. <br /> <br />I do take the book to task on two accounts though. First it doesn't even mention Ajax, which is odd for a recent publication. And second it doesn't cover REST at all an only passingly mentions XML-RPC. The author says SOAP took over and is now the majority of the services going on over the web. When in reality the use of RSS and REST style XML protocols is, in terms of bandwidth, is crushing SOAP. Regardless, REST and Ajax are worth mentions here.	2005-08-26

It's far better than the stuff you will find on the W3C site, and it won't break your back like Michael Kay's excellent, but hefty, work. I have to ding it a little for lack of a complete reference on XPath. There is certainly information about the functions, but I would have like to have seen more depth on it. And the XPath appendix wasn't helpful. A language definition is definitely not what I was looking for there. Some common examples of XPath usage would be great.	2005-08-26

I've used Word since version 3.0 on the Macintosh and I still found a lot of new information here. There is even coverage of the specific problems with Word X. There are tips on avoiding crashes, modifying the interface, using small macros, power user tips and more. If you use Word on a daily basis this book is for you.	2005-08-05

For me this book was as scary as it was informative. The book taught me just how many different types of threats there were out there, and provided mechanisms for dealing with them. But it's up to me to do the work to get them implemented. No book can fix that. And certainly this book gave me a sense of priorities, which I appreciate. Since many security books treat unlikely threats with the same intensity as the most common threats. <br /> <br />Down to business. The book mainly covers Windows, which is so full of holes that it needs this trim 250 page book to cover it all. The different types of threats are covered in detail. Specifics are provided on bots, viruses, trojans and the rest. With this book you will be able to look at your task list to see if and how your machine has been compromised. <br /> <br />Easily one of the best books I have seen on Windows user-level security that covers real modern threats.	2005-08-05

Oh yeah, another Joel Spolsky book, just in time for... wha? It's only edited by Joel? Yep. This is a collection of article reprints, some without any editing or reformatting, with small introductions by Joel at the top of each article. That doesn't mean that the book is bad. It just means you need to know what you are getting for your dollars. <br /> <br />Myself, I'm not much on the article reprints. Granted, these are solid articles. But many can be found of the web and a book which could just as easily be implemented as a set of links on a web page with some annotations seems like a waste. <br /> <br />There are some jewels in here. In particular the Ruby introduction by \\"why the lucky stiff\\" which is just freaking awesome. Why APress decided to reprint his work as opposed to just get him to write a whole book is beyond me. He is a real talent in the world of engineer/authors. Especially given some of the competition, which from many proposals I have read have the writing skills of preschoolers on meth. <br /> <br />The topics in the book vary too widely for me to recommend this to any particular sub-group of engineer.  These articles will be enjoyable to any career engineer who has a passion for the profession.	2005-08-05

The formatting in this book is so bad in places that it's actually distracting from the content. Some material in tables is shoved into cells so small that it's difficult to understand. <br /> <br />That being said, the coverage of Plone is both thorough and well written. Given that I recommend the book.	2005-08-03

It also covers topics like XBox and TiVo networking. All of the in a compact little 250 page frame. <br /> <br />The coverage is end-user centric as you would expect given the title and the series. There are some tips for power users, but primarily the focus in the home user. There are some diversions like gaming lingo, but otherwise this is a solid and terse read.	2005-08-03

Perl is a \\"there are many ways to do it\\" language, and Perl programmers are adamant about finding clever solutions in the language. This book sets down a set of guidelines for the most professional way to do it. And in so doing pays Perl a lot more respect than it's paid in other books. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend that anyone writing Perl professionally should read this. But I do have an issue or two with it. For example, I think it was wrong to start off with a rule about brackets. That's one thing that people are religious about and there is no real reason to go one way or another. That starts the book on a weak premise. From which it quickly recovers. <br /> <br />Overall, a fantastic book. Well written and researched. It's the kind of book I would expect from Damian Conway and I wasn't let down. A must-read for Perl programmers.	2005-08-03

But this book is written well enough that the flow of test driven development for every type of code will work for an experienced Perl programmer. The book covers the fundamentals of test driven development. It also covers database code testing, and web app testing through robots. An excellent book on Perl and a great addition to the set of O'Reilly Perl books. <br /> <br />While you are looking you should also check out \\"Perl Best Practices\\", which is phenomenal.	2005-08-03

Tests are tough enough to get engineers to write. By providing a table driven testing toolkit the authors have made it a lot easier to develop test cases. And that will in turn mean more tests that are easier to manage. <br /> <br />That being said, I would have appreciated some more on the structure of the toolkit. This book definitely focuses on the tests, test composition and construction. Which is fine since  that is important. But I can see the ideas presented in this book being extended to other technologies. And to make that happen means presenting a deeper understanding of the internals of the framework.	2005-08-03

It is not a general book about writing portable code. Nor is it, as the sub-title explains, about multiple platforms, if your idea about platforms includes different programming languages. It's about C. It's about C++. And it's at the operating system and process level. And that's it. And that's enough. What's sad is that someone, probably not the author, felt that it wasn't marketable as just \\"Writing Portable C and C++\\". Great content, horrible title.	2005-08-03

It's an artifact of the complexity. But I can't hold that against this book. This thin tome is a well-written and illustrated walkthrough of all of the Log4J fundamentals. There are some insightful examples and good use of UML to illustrate message flows.	2005-07-25

Some of the programmers I have worked with talked a good object game but then created library code as objects. I like how this book tries to teach OO from a different angle. I have some issues with the production of the book. In particular I think the balloon metaphor was overused.  <br /> <br />If you are looking on a different take on teaching Java you might also want to look at \\"Head First Java\\".	2005-07-25

The writing is solid and the coverage is thorough. Graphics are also used effectively to illustrate what's often a very complex logic flow in Maven. Definitely a book worth reading for programmers using Maven.	2005-07-25

A book about interesting variations on a a programming technology. It really works. There isn't a lot of exposition about the code. So I wouldn't expect to learn Swing with this book. But I think you will learn a lot of new stuff about Swing with this book. A large part of the appeal of this book is that you will be inspired to stretch the limits of your Swing use through these hacks. If that sounds appealing to you then this book is definitely for you.	2005-07-25

The book is in full color, which is great for this content. The text is clear and illustrations are used effectively to explain what are often hard-to-understand mapping concepts. If I had to fault the book it would be that there is not enough on where to source the maps. But that's a trifle of a complaint. This is a must for anyone looking to get into dynamic mapping on the web.	2005-07-21

It's got a fun and quirky style that makes it accessible and fun, while being very informative. The book teaches the fundamentals of voice over IP protocols. It focuses primarily on Skype. There is some advanced material at the end that will interest even the advanced VoIP user. Highly recommended.	2005-07-21

These include collections, XML, some database access, and Swing. Roughly half of the book is Swing. The first chapter, which covers library design, is solid.  <br /> <br />The exposition is solid, if a little dry. The illustrations are good. The book does rely a little heavily on code to do most of the expository work. <br /> <br />I recommend having a look at this book in person before buying it. See if there is enough there on the topics that interest you to make it worth the purchase.	2005-07-21

This book is now an almost thousand page hardback tome. But all that extra bulk is not a bad thing in this case. Each sub-system is now covered in amazing detail. The illustrations are fantastic. And the book covers the bevy of Unix variants which makes it extremely valuable. Definitely a must have second edition for any programmer whose primary platform is Unix.	2005-07-21

Running at lightning speed through installation, building your first application, doing some simple persistence stuff through EJB (if there is simple EJB persistence), and then into monitoring, logging and performance work. Sounds like a lot, right? It's certainly is. Especially in just over 130 pages. Yes, read that again, 130 pages. So this book is super light on exposition. Expect to be taken on a lightning ride. And if that works for you. If that's not for you. If, for example, JBoss is your first Java environment, then I would look elsewhere.	2005-07-21

Where other Astronomy books focus exclusively on the hardware, or on the heavens, this book covers a wider range of topics. From telescope tricks, to how to meet up with astronomy buffs, to what to drink (or not drink) on your viewing nights. While the other books are helpful to teach the theory, this book is the glue that binds the night sky theory with the telescope in the back of the car on a mountain side reality.	2005-07-21

Each of the chapters covers a set of the UI controls and provides a set of code samples to show how the different features are used. More than most this book relies on the code to do the heavy lifting. Several example code blocks run several pages with no comments or interleaved exposition. <br /> <br />In a book like this I look for both a good walkthrough, and a good reference section. I find that the walkthrough is good. But the long-term reference value isn't there. So while you may get an education from it, you aren't going to be going back to it on your bookshelf looking for classes and methods. That being said, with today's IDEs and their integrated documentation, this may be all the book you need. Your call.	2005-07-21

But wait. There is no DOS prompt. There is Unix. So now what? Well, I recommend getting this book since it's an excellent walk through of the basics of the Unix underpinnings of the Macintosh OS X for the Unix newbie. File system access, networking, process control, and even a little bit of X11 is covered. Definitely worth a look. But I  would check out all of the many O'Reilly Mac books before deciding on this one.	2005-07-21

It's a completely new book. Where the original book was more of an advanced language features book, this book is much more focused on module use. Neither of which is bad. Perl's CPAN library is one of the features that make the language so attractive. So an entire book dedicated to that is really helpful. And the excellent writing and illustrations help as well. <br /> <br />I recommend both books. If you can get a copy of the first edition on Alibris get that. But don't hesitate getting this book if you are a Perl fan.	2005-07-21

And it does a great job at showing the benefits and pitfalls of making that switch. X Windows, compiling and coding, systems administration, these are all covered. But they are covered at the level of informing someone who already knows the basics. In other words, you won't be treated like an idiot. And I appreciate that. <br /> <br />If you are just starting out with OS X and you have had experience with other Unix environments, this is is the book for you.	2005-06-25

It's one hundred fairly short, but well explained and appropriately illustrated, hints and tips that cover the gamut of Linux issues. Don't let the Desktop word in the title fool you. Certainly there is a lot of information on Desktop tweaks, but the information is more than skin deep. There is security, networking and systems administration information. <br /> <br />As with all of the hacks books, take a look at the table of contents and if you find ten or so that interest you, then check it out.	2005-06-25

The writing is clear and is certainly at a level that is appropriate for intermediate or advanced users. The problem that I have with the book is the same on I have with most of the notebook books. They are great collections of random things. But how does that fit in with a programmers workflow when they are looking for solutions. Sure, it's excellent reading the first time through to get some advanced concepts down. But what about the reference value later? <br /> <br />That being said. There is some very cool stuff in this book. A lot of helpful information on XML, advanced forms issues, and advanced ASP.NET stuff. So have a look through the table of contents and see if there is anything that catches your eye, and buy on that basis.	2005-06-25

There are section on mounting a camera to a car, creating bullet time videos, alerting and fixing color and sound, and much more. In addition there is some helpful advice at the production level in how to organize and create your movie without pulling your hair out. <br /> <br />What I missed was any code. I would have loved a few hacks on how to create and edit video with Perl or some other simple language. But alas, none was to be had. The book definitely centers on the user level of video production. <br /> <br />If you are into home videos and want to take it to the next level this book is for you.	2005-06-25

If you know what you are doing already and want to get a jump start into Ajax then this is a good book for you. My problem with it is that the text relies too heavily on the code to convey the message. Which means that the book is better for advanced readers. I also would have appreciated some more emphasis on what works cross browser and how to handle older browsers.	2005-06-23

It's not complete enough to be a whole work on advanced VB. But it does have a lot of valuable information and insight on both desktop and web application development in VB. <br /> <br />There are some cool things in here; custom data binding, toolstrip hacks, embedding web pages, use of XPath and more. At the end of the day, if there is something in the table of contents that perks your interest, get the book.	2005-06-23

In this book Jared and William cover pragmatic project management with down to earth advice on real world topics. In particular I liked some of their novel approaches to dealing with some of the quirky personality types that we find in this business. That being said there are good sections on process, design, testing, quality control and more. Definitely a good book for those tired of the preachy Booch and Rumbaugh crowd.	2005-06-23

But this book goes far beyond that. In fact, it does an excellent job introducing technical topics in the larger world. For example, LDAP is given about five pages of explanation before we even get to how it's done on OS X. To me, that means this book is a comprehensive resource that will inform you about both the standards and their implementation in this environment. Obviating the need for a standards book. <br /> <br />If you are doing Mac OS X Server work, you need this book. The documentation in the operating system and on-line is tragic.	2005-06-23

It's a beautiful walkthrough of some amazing projects. But if you want to get any real use out of it you are going to have to do some serious neuronal crunching to make use of the high-end techniques presented here.

A short title is given, then some explanation and some code examples, then a nutshell summary of the problem. In this case the vignettes are always stated as problems, which gives the book a negative feel. But that's ok, since it's 'gotchas', right? <br /> <br />But enough about form. It's about the content. And the content here is up to snuff. An awful lot of time is spent on interop, which is appropriate. And some strategies are provided that will help you build classes that work well across COM. This implies, at least to me, that the book is well researched and I think it is. <br /> <br />The writing is good, if just a little dry. The code is hilighted to make it easier to read. And code samples are provided both in VB and C#. Definitely worth a look if you job involves writing components that need to work across languages.	2005-06-23

Everything from administration through use and automation is covered. In addition the author imparts some experience based wisdom about proper branching technique, which can be impenetrable at the best of times. There are some issues, the code is often a little long and sometimes acts as exposition. But for the moment I would rate this as the best Subversion book that I have seen.	2005-06-23
194437:US	50389232	R1LVLE1SZJ0KNM	0596100124	452984299	Database in Depth: Relational Theory for Practitioners	Books	5	9	12	N	N	Short primer on relational theory	I found this book far more accessible than Date's other book; \\"An Introduction to Database Systems\\". He provides an explanation of relational theory then demonstrates it in a simplified SQL format. Normalization is covered well. That's critical to understanding proper schema design. <br /> <br />The text of the book is a little dry and academic. Which I suppose is to be expected. In addition Date has his viewpoint expressed clearly in the book. An example is his aversion to the use of nulls.	2005-06-23

It reminds me of the bad old days of the \\"Secrets of the Game Programming Mega-Gurus\\". Happily this is where the similarity ends. This book is far better than any of the old books that essentially covered graphics primitives and left it at that. This book goes in depth on 2D and 3D graphics and covers specifically how these interfaces are used in a game setting with real examples. Simple example games are provided and their implementation is well documented. Even network programming was discussed.  <br /> <br />I'm pleased with this book, and the other recent gaming titles I have seen. Finally tech books that treat game programming with respect.	2005-06-23

This is compounded by the fact that the documentation for SSH just blows. This book, however, does everything but blow. In classic O'Reilly fashion the author decomposes the topic and covers it effectively from almost every angle with excellent writing and superb graphics. This is a great book for anyone who uses SSH, or who is having issues with it.	2005-06-21

It's been great since the first edition. This latest edition is a complete update for the needs of the modern C++ programmer, including all of the newer elements of the STL, and commonly used extensions like Boost. <br /> <br />The addition of color in this edition is an excellent idea. The color quickly draws your attention to the portions of the code that are important to the narrative. It's something that I wish were in more technical books. All too often the important elements of the code are obscured in all of the infrastructure code which isn't critical to the technology being discussed. <br /> <br />A must own for any C++ programmer. And definitely worth the look if you have the first or second editions and are still actively programming C++.	2005-06-21

But the rest of the magazine rocks! Great projects from simple marshmallow shooters, to a PC modded into the case of an Atari 2600, to robotic dogs and mice. There is ten solid pages on podcasting, both receiving podcasts and creating your own. If you thought the first one was great you will love this one.	2005-06-21

This book, on the other hand, addresses a variety of real feed production and consumption topics in a set of language.  You will learn the feed standards. But you will learn them through application, not abstraction. And I find that much more effective than a book that presents technologies at the standards level (most of which you never use anyway). Then leaves you hanging.	2005-06-21

It's classic O'Reilly, but it's better than that. Even the O'Reilly books have fallen short of being truly useful for shell scripting. I think this was primarily because the authors have been thinking more about language fundamentals then about teaching useful things. This book is targeted towards teaching shell scripting through practical application. This is the shell scripting book to get.	2005-06-21

It's hefty 500 pages covers a wide range of topics at a level that should work for most intermediate to advanced engineers. The author doesn't go into obsessive details or the step by step explanations so often seen in books on Microsoft technologies. Instead, the author treats us like we have brains. Thank you. <br /> <br />Secure SOAP services, networking, transactions, concurrency, security and more are all covered in an effective and thorough manner. Bravo.	2005-06-21

It's thorough and well researched. The writing is a bit dry but that's a minor quibble when it comes with the rest of this fine work. This is the best work I have seen on Windows 2003 security. Definitely worth a look and worth the money if this is your job.	2005-06-21

Most of the security in the book is at the user layer. How you can set up your system, and the network around you to secure your systems. I particularly appreciated the information on SQL Server, which is all too often not covered in security books. <br /> <br />There are some downsides, the book is fairly text intensive (which is something I don't usually cite). There could have illustrations to make the points more clearly. But the images that are there are effective and used well.	2005-06-21

Ranging from basic object oriented syntax and mechanics, to a nice piece of work on custom controls and other reasonably advanced topics. <br /> <br />There are lots of ASP.NET books out there. I think this one is worth the look. But you should check it out before you buy.	2005-06-21

But in reality the security of web applications is a whole, and a vulnerability in the application layer is just as bad as one in the web server layer. Ivan Ristic does a good job of talking about security at every layer and uniting it into a single reference. This is an excellent, focused, resource that is well written and makes difficult security topics easy to understand.	2005-06-21

It's around 300 or so one page fixes for common issues with Windows XP. Though there are two problems that I find with it. First I think sometimes the explanations are too brief. With a screenshot there is only space for a couple of paragraphs and often that is too little to really cover the topic. The other problem I have is that these small sections aren't cross-referenced. They each stand alone and don't work with each other. There could have been a lot more cross-reference work done. <br /> <br />If you are interested in this book you should also look at O'Reilly's Windows XP Annoyances book.	2005-06-21

In it's 1,000 pages this book finishes with Object Oriented Perl. And it spends at least four hundred on the language basics. <br /> <br />Why? Why couldn't this be the 'Pro' book the title describes. This is hardly pro at all. CPAN is given very short shrift. And in general, it's just a rehash of the topics covered in Programming Perl. And Programming Perl is the definitive source. <br /> <br />I'm really not sure why this book was necessary. It does have a different style than Programming Perl. It's a little less jocular and a little more mechanical. Reminiscent of books on Java, C# and Python. It is well written and illustrated. <br /> <br />I'm giving this four stars because I think it will work better for some folks than Programming Perl. Though I think everyone should start with Programming Perl.	2005-05-20

Books	4	18	20	N	N	Cursed by a bad name	If only this book didn't have the \\"Data Crunching\\" name. Far from being about data analysis this really a general book about different data formats (e.g. text, XML, database, binary) and how they are created and accessed in different languages. It's a reasonable fundamentals book. It also serves to introduce a wide variety of different technologies, without going into explicit depth about each. <br /> <br />As long as you understand what you are getting then I recommend this book. This is not a book about data processing techniques. Also, I recommend NOT using the material in the book that references SQL. The code does not use prepared statements properly and is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.	2005-05-20

Only to find it ankle deep in some academic work, where the formula is inverted and has all of the wrong units. Well, now we have a book where the author has done all of the hard work to get the formulae right, and organized into a concise form that is easy to use.  <br /> <br />I'm very happy with this book. It's strongly recommend for anyone looking for practical information and algorithms for simulations or games.	2005-05-20

The code samples still dominate and have little commenting to make them clear. But there is better exposition in this book. And the authors give some perspective as to why things work they way they do, and give some best practice style advice, which is appreciated. <br /> <br />Certainly the best J2ME out on the market as of May 2005.	2005-05-20

It's tome sized, which I normally don't like. But it covers the fundamentals effectively with well written text and effective use of graphics.

It's short, somewhat terse but not overly so. Graphics are consistently well used throughout. And the author has a genuine grasp of the subject. <br /> <br />If you are looking for an architectural level work, or a high level introduction to web services, then you may have found your book. But if you are looking for something that presents both the architecture and some examples of implementation you won't find what you are looking for here.	2005-05-11

For a book this big you would expect something with a ton of screenshots and page after page of code, but such is not the case. In fact, this book has better exposition than a lot of APress book's I've read.  <br /> <br />The authors do a very good job at not only explaining the technology but in providing some perspective on it's use as well. Between this book and Manning's \\"Spring Into Action\\" I would take this book.	2005-05-11

It's fascinating on both counts. Linux, Windows, and Apple operating systems are covered in detail. And case studies that demonstrate how files were analyzed on each of these systems is provided. <br /> <br />Definitely a solid work for anyone involved in this type of forensics work.	2005-05-11

I never thought that O'Reilly would be one of them. While I really like the content in the book, I hate the form factor. The pages are too small for the book's width.  <br /> <br />Anyway, enough said about that since it's not the author's fault. What the author has control over, the content, is great. All the basics are covered in a practical form that's easy to read and understand. The graphics drive the messages home without being overly complex. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in becoming part of the project management cycle of their application.	2005-05-11

That being said, I found the writing in the book to be terse for my taste. And the form factor of the book, which is an unusual in that it's hard bound (which is not a problem) and 8.5x11 (which is a problem). Why the book is this size is never explained. <br /> <br />Certainly worth the look for people that think that there is a point where Agile processes and UML can work together.	2005-05-11

Some of this stuff is pretty advanced.It's a pretty short book, around 200 pages, organized into 63 small recipes each at three or four pages. The topics covered are all over the map, from function objects to auto pointers. The only thing these have in common is that it's stuff you would see in practical use in the industry, which isn't covered by a standard book on syntax and templates.	2005-05-11

Where the reader has questions that require deeper explanation the exposition is there. The content is well researched and the author has obviously spent the time to do some complex information distillation for us. An ideal book for anyone looking to start with VB.NET programming.

There are a lot of screenshots and graphics, but it works well for the methodical prose that guides you through, what on it's face seems simple but can get complex as you go to professional grade database applications. <br /> <br />It starts with an introduction to the the complete system, then goes into user interface work, database design, queries, transactions, and finally advanced topics.  <br /> <br />As the title implies this is a book for beginners. There isn't enough advanced material in here for professional developers, and the pace of the book is too slow for those readers. But if you are just getting started, and VB.NET is your database weapon of choice, then this could be a great book for you.	2005-05-11

It's a summarization of a lot of valuable research that you can find nowhere else. Which to me is the definition of a great book. The authors take us on a world tour and give us background on the security concerns in all of the different countries. It's fascinating, insightful and even funny at times.

Installation, basics shell use, and primarily use of the operating system through the graphical user interface. The writing is good. But given the size of the book I think more could have been written about the fundamentals of the operating system, and in particular the use of the shell. The author just breezes over the use of Bash. A lot more could have been said there. <br /> <br />That being said, there are far, far, worse books on Linux. So in a way I'm just being picky. This is a fine book if you are new to Unix operating systems and want to try out SUSE for yourself.	2005-05-11

What I particularly like are the sections that cover how to take better photos in the first place and the sections that cover basic digital photography.   That's important because the photography is an end-to-end process where iPhoto is just a piece. <br /> <br />Excellent use of images and screenshots. Solid writing a good production value. Highly recommended for people looking to make iPhoto a central part of their digital photography workflow.	2005-05-11

And has depth without rabbit holing or glossing over material. The code is marked up with Manning's 8-ball annotation style, which I find very easy to read and understand. <br /> <br />I liked this book, the style of the writing, and the breadth of the coverage. But between this book and APress' \\"Pro Spring\\" I would take Pro Spring. It's got deeper coverage and exposition.	2005-05-11

This book does a great job, and I mean great, in giving a solid foundation in PHP and doing it very quickly (~300 pages). <br /> <br />Where it falls down is that the author doesn't provide tools for deciding which techniques to use where you have a choice. Particularly in the matter of database access. He presents the use of MySQL through the direct layer as well as through Pear::DB but doesn't provide any guidance in choosing one approach over the other. <br /> <br />That being said, for someone looking for an excellent introduction to PHP, as well as a fine ongoing reference work, you may have found your book here.	2005-05-11

There is some material on the end user side of the browser, adding extensions, working the browser, cool sites to go to. But overall I find that there is more content in here for developers. <br /> <br />What's here is very well written and researched. Graphics are used well but not overused, as is the O'Reilly style. As with all of the Hacks books these recipes are teasers and don't offer comprehensive coverage.	2005-05-11

It's far more insightful and biting than Dilbert. And the tech is spot on which just adds to the enjoyment. Definitely a must read for any professional programmer. You will laugh your ass off at some of the sections, and then cry woefully in others. I know it's an article book, and I generally don't like them. But it works here. Really.	2005-05-11

All of the basics are covered as well as some advanced topics. Easily the best book I have seen for someone looking for a walkthrough of iPod and iTunes use.	2005-05-11

Gotta say, I know the hardware and software hacking craze is taking off, but this seems a little over the top. Seriously, who is going to build an Apple I? Well, someone I suppose. Anyway, this is an interesting book even if you aren't going to do the work to put it all together. <br /> <br />There are 50 pages on hacking the Macintosh SE. Not quite sure what that's about since it's not mentioned anywhere.	2005-05-11

This book is just as fine of a follow on. The full color on every page, the excellent use of images, and the quality editing all add up to a very fine work indeed. If you loved the second one, buy this one. If high-end 3D graphics are your thing and you haven't read these books yet, buy both.	2005-05-11

The content is all over the place and the formatting should have at least gone through some sort of standardization process. I find this kind of book very lazy. At the very least, be sure check the outline to make sure what's being covered matters to you before spending the money on this one.	2005-05-11

But you will have to keep running to keep up. Most of the concepts are explained through copious amounts of code with little in the way of exposition. Tips and best practices are in the book, and I certainly appreciated that. A solid, if not completely pleasurable read for anyone interested in remoting with C#.	2005-05-11
245168:US	50389232	R2GNZURBGVO007	1590593952	541248167	Perl 6 Now: The Core Ideas Illustrated with Perl 5 (The Expert's Voice In Open Source)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	As good as it's going to get	Perl 6 is pretty confusing no matter how you cut it. Scott does a nice job here of demonstrating the features of six. And he does it in a way that makes more sense than the Apocalypse stuff that Larry writes. If you are going to be using six as soon as it comes out then you will want to have a look at this in the meantime. It's the first book or article I have read that explains the new features in ways that I can understand.	2005-05-11

If you want to put together a PC buy this book. It provides practical advice about hardware options. I really appreciate that. It's why I subscribe to Consumer Reports. So I appreciate that type of advice here. <br /> <br />Excellent coverage of all of the elements of the hardware design for a PC. Definitely recommended for anyone looking to build a PC.	2005-05-11

It covers the different audio formats, the mechanics of audio playback and recording and does it with effective use of graphics and some fine writing. Unfortunately it stops just short of podcasting, which is where I think a number of readers will be looking for. <br /> <br />There is some fine coverage of the legal issues involved on both the production and the consumption side of the fence. I'm pleased with this book. It's an easy and informative read.	2005-05-07
255463:US	50389232	R1MF08POD18DG4	0596100337	649371484	iMovie HD & iDVD 5: The Missing Manual	Books	5	23	25	N	N	Excellent technical and content coverage	This is an excellent guide to both of these applications. What I find particularly appealing is that the book doesn't just concentrate on the tech. It also teaches you about how to shoot good video and edit it well. So you can learn both the technique and the technology from a single source. That's the way it should be, and it's what makes this book so different from the rest. <br /> <br />Of course all of the basics are covered. The graphics are possibly a little overused. But that's ok for a walkthrough book. The use color throughout certainly adds to the appeal. The writing is solid. It's not so funny as to be distracting or too clinical as to be dry.	2005-05-02
255698:US	50389232	R1C94DW486QN0B	1590592395	819196779	Practical Common Lisp	Books	5	28	33	N	N	Best walkthrough of Lisp I've seen	Leaving aside the practicality of learning Lisp, this book is really amazing. I've read a couple of books on Lisp and never really gotten it until now. Generally they present some abstract math concepts, show how they work in Lisp and leave it there. This book takes it to the next level, the practical level, as you see in the title. <br /> <br />Macros, slots, object orientation, data structures, and more, are all discussed in detail without 'leaving it to the reader' as the other books do. <br /> <br />Finally! A good book on Lisp.	2005-05-02

The walktrhough goes from beginner to advanced use. And I found a lot of things that were new to me even as a long-time Firefox user. <br /> <br />There is good coverage of the extensions that you can add in. Graphics are used well but not overused. And there are only a few of the 'survey' style segments that are so frequently used in books that cover browsers. <br /> <br />Definitely worth the look if you think you aren't getting the most out of your browser (and you probably aren't.)	2005-05-02

The book presents small solutions for the kind of Linux problems that you find the answer to one week and promptly forget the next. This makes it ideal for end users like me who just need the occasional helping hand. <br /> <br />I'm downplaying the value of the book though. The explanations are given thorough coverage to teach you the why as much as the how. <br /> <br />Probably a great reference for systems administrators who work with Windows most of the time but need to administer Unix now and again. And a really nice piece of work for folks like me who just use Unix every once in a while and need some help with the commands.	2005-05-02

What I found lacking was the larger perspective. You will learn about the different options and what they mean but not why you want to use these functions.	2005-05-02

We have needed a practical text on data modeling for some time. The other works have been largely academic. In this book the authors use real world examples to work through the material, <br /> <br />Graphics are used extensively through the book. But that makes sense for the topic. The graphics are a combination of UML and relational diagrams. The tone of the text is jocular and down to earth. <br /> <br />This is an ideal walkthrough for engineers who have some experience using databases but now want to understand how to design databases well.	2005-05-02

But overall it's a fine introduction to Postgres. This isn't a general introduction as the title seems to imply. This text, graphics, and examples, all clearly relate to Postgres. <br /> <br />The book is fairly code heavy. With example of the use of Postgres in all of the popular languages. And a hefty amount of SQL examples to learn from and use. <br /> <br />A solid introductory walkthrough for anyone new to, or just starting to use Postgres.	2005-05-01

If hardware hacking is something that you enjoy you will probably find a lot to like in this book. Because in general it's all about the tips and tricks. <br /> <br />That being said this book, like all of the Annoyances books, is not a complete reference. You won't find the list of PC cards, but you will find tips on how to fix flaky USB connections and the like.	2005-05-01

I found the characters shallow and too numerous to keep track of. That would be fine if this were a war book, but it's not. It's a personal journey work, and the combat is secondary. Little insight is provided into Carl's state of mind as he meanders through Vietnam. And the end of the book leaves us flat as we are left with Carl in his living room watching TV. <br /> <br />A personal journey book like this one is supposed to invite us into his world with tremendous detail about the environment, and personal insights into what these events meant. This book doesn't provide much of either. <br /> <br />There are some interesting stories in there. That's why I give it three stars. But overall the book needs a lot more detail, fewer characters that are more fully animated, and some editing.	2005-02-25

This book has detailed walkthroughs of the creation of nine different compound images. The first, second and fifth are excellent. The other six are fine as well. If you are a photoshop user and you are looking for some new ideas and techniques this is a good place to start.	2005-02-08

This book works at a lower level than that, debugging routers, internet connectivity, file sharing, and the basics. Though the basics can be difficult. If I could fault the book it would be that the exposition for some of the recipes are a little too short. Simply introducing a solution as opposed to walking through it at a reasonable depth. That being said, sometimes sign posts are as valuable as step-by-step maps.	2005-02-08
357048:US	50389232	R2QPQHZ90J1GW2	1590594487	898254550	Mastering Oracle SQL and SQL*Plus	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Comprehensive and well written	This is an ideal introduction to Oracle SQL. I wish I had it when I was starting out. It's a combination reference and walkthrough that covers the fundamentals and some advanced techniques. The language is shown with graphs to show the syntax variations and the use of the operations is described in great detail. The text is a bit dry, but you can't fault it too much for that. An excellent book for those looking for an introduction to Oracle SQL, and probably useful for people with a mid level of experience as well.	2005-02-08

There is little exposition and the work is fairly short. If you know what you are doing and you are looking for a complete walkthrough then this is your book. If you are looking for a reference then this is not it.	2005-02-08

Most of the time is spent discussion mic positioning, filtering, and mixes. There is some coverage of analog versus digital, and some amusing anecdotes about the performers. It's a fun read for those looking to glean a bit more sage wisdom from the pros. There are no diagrams, detailed specifications or settings to impart. This is higher level, about the approach of sound design and how one works with tricky personalities.	2005-02-08
357391:US	50389232	R1DW5ICHCMCDU1	0823070794	771077707	The Billboard Illus Home Recording Handbk	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Best of the available batch in 2005	I took a look around my local Borders recently. Most of the books were about analog mixing. The most recent coverage was early Pro Tools. This book had the best coverage of recent technology. Plus it was good at explaining the fundamentals in an easy to understand way. Definitely good coverage for home rock and hip-hop recording and mixing. If I could fault it for anything it's that the depth of the exposition is scanty in places. The book could use some more detail in a second version.	2005-02-08
357541:US	50389232	RICNT5B7KGHF8	0764579010	188783092	Professional Assembly Language	Books	5	11	18	N	N	Solid walkthrough of x86 assembler	I do find it odd that in this day and age we are still talking about introductory assembler. But that being said, if you need it you need it, and this is a great place to to get an introduction to the x86 instruction set on the latest processors. Connections with Linux are also demonstrated. Graphics and illustrations are well used but not overused. The text is well written and engaging.	2005-02-08

The book has around 300 annoyances, each with an explanation of the problem and a solution. The annoyances, and the explanations, are all in play english for laymen.  <br /> <br />Some of these hints are given several pages to play out. One particularly good one discusses the selection of a web hosting service. There is even a table with prices, storage sizes, bandwidth amounts, and more. It's great information presented in an easy to use form. Other hints, like the explanation of why you can't return a TV that is greater than 27 inches, seem out of place. But those are few and far between. <br /> <br />There are a number of books out there for Internet users looking for helpful hints. This is the best one I have seen so far. The writing is engaging, the content is great.	2005-01-28

This book goes surprisingly in-depth, covering topics like adding effects to playback, transforming movies during playback, overlays, and a wide variety of topics. <br /> <br />All that is crammed into a trim 200 page frame. This is achieved by concentrating mainly on the code, and effectively using a minimum of images. That's a trick given the graphics intensive nature of the topic. <br /> <br />This is not a book for beginners, it's a fast-paced walkthrough for experience developers who want something less referential than the JavaDocs.	2005-01-27

At about 500 pages that's a tight squeeze, even for O'Reilly. Some of the coverage suffers, specifically I found the security information on PHP to be very scanty given the popularity of the language and how often web applications that use it are fraught with SQL injection vulnerabilities. <br /> <br />That being said, the writing is excellent, and the coverage that is there, which is at a reasonable level of depth, is solid. In addition, security is something you have to work at, so having an introduction to get you down the road is probably a good idea anyway. I'd like to see the next version have deeper information on web server security, but in the meantime this is a solid walkthrough of Linux security.	2005-01-27

A book that sparks your imagination about how you can use hardware and software to do practical and cool things. In this case to build little home helpers, like a TiVo for radio, a home theatre IR controller, a home theatre PC, and more. <br /> <br />The book spends about 300 pages on thirteen home hacks. They are separated into three parts; automation, entertainment and security. Each project starts with a list of materials then walks through a very detailed explanation of building both the hardware and software. <br /> <br />This is definitely a book for geeks. Specifically the type of geek that finds themselves at Radio Shack more than a couple of times a month. Certainly part of the value of the book is in the projects themselves, but a lot more of the value is in it's inspirational quality.	2005-01-24

If you aren't familiar the series there are one hundred hacks that cover a wide variety of, in this case, Google related topics. For example, how to determine the word of specific Google AdWords words. Each hack runs a couple of pages in length and has short code examples, usually in Perl, where appropriate. <br /> <br />A wide variety of Google topics are covered. From the basics of search use, through desktop integration, gmail, AdWords and finally into web page optimization. Part of this new version is the gmail content. <br /> <br />This was an excellent book the first time around. This second version brings it up to date with Google enhancements and gmail. Given the ever-widening variety of services my guess is that O'Reilly will need to split the coverage among a number of books in the future.	2005-01-24

The title, however, hints at a book that would discuss schema design and common XML issues. There is a need for that book, but this is not that book. <br /> <br />This book is a relatively short straightforward walkthrough of XML markup, data standards, searching, legacy conversions and performance. It's around 200 pages with around 20 pages. The tone is light but terse. Graphics are sparse and are used effectively. <br /> <br />I think this would be an ideal introductory work for someone just starting out with XML. Though I think there are other books that are as good or better. <br /> <br />If only this book had the content implied by it's title.	2005-01-24

Statistics and studies are cited, though some observations are more empirical in nature. The book becomes even more engaging when the author adds some personal stories. <br />        <br />It's a short book and a quick read. The content is suitable for laymen who want a new perspective of how America approaches marketing versus other countries in the world.	2005-01-24

There are nine in all. Each is shown with about ten pages of very detail exposition from the start of the project to the finish. There are a variety of styles used, from anime, to photo realistic, to pen. <br /> <br />The use of photoshop is well explained, though I think in the end this is more a demonstration of talent than it is a road map for how to use photoshop to build images.	2005-01-24

In this case I am definitely wanting more. About a third of the book is on basic operating system introductory material. The rest of the book starts to get in-depth on file system analysis, hacker trapping, and some basic data analysis. But then it ends. And I wanted more. <br /> <br />Definitely a good start at file system analysis, specifically on Unix machines. But you will definitely be left wanting more of the same.	2005-01-24

It's around 90 pages, though it feels even shorter. It's a series of 8 examples, about 10 or so pages each. Each walks through a very well illustrated example of taking a photo and either fixing it's flaws or tweaking it to have a more arty effect. One example is about making a panorama, in what seems like a very tortured way. <br /> <br />The perspective of this book also bothered me. It's written from the perspective of someone who understands what needs to be done to a photo but doesn't understand how to get Photoshop to do it. If that's where you are, then you will like the book. But I think the majority of us need to start with analyzing an image to find out what needs to be done. And that's not in this book.	2005-01-24

This is another architectural book in this crowded field. There is reasonably in-depth coverage of the role of each of the web services standards. Though I find the tone of this particular book a bit more accessible than the others. The author is plain spoken and pragmatic. <br /> <br />There is some code in the book, in C# and C++. Though this is certainly not the focus of the book. Which is a straightforward walkthrough from web service standard basics, through integration, security and into transactions. It's a fairly short book, with each chapter at around 30-40 pages and the whole book weighing in at 400 pages. <br /> <br />You will most likely have to buy other books and check other web resources to get in-depth coverage for your language of choice after taking the tour that is this book.	2005-01-24

Screenshots are used, but not excessively so. Often arrows are used to make sure that one screenshot covers as much territory as it can. It may seem odd to concentrate on screenshots, but that's what differentiates this book from some of the super bible style books that are just loads of screenshots with a few sentences between each. <br /> <br />About two thirds of the book is on the basics of the operating system; installation, file management, hardware management, networking, security, firewalls, etc. The last third of the book is on the basic applications; internet explorer, email, messenger and other. <br /> <br />A very solid walkthrough that will teach even the power user a thing or two they didn't know about Windows XP.	2005-01-14

It's a balanced blend of basic and advanced information that has a gentle learning curve that will take you all the way from creating your first spreadsheet through the basics of macro development. The book is organized into eight parts, though the first four make up the majority of the book. Part one covers the basics of editing, files, printing, saving. Part two is all about formula creation. Part three is about templates and lists. Part four is about charting and graphics. After that it's into networking, macros, and more advanced topics. <br /> <br />The writing is excellent and the use of screenshots is effective and not overwhelming as with other books. A superb walkthrough of the fundamentals of Excel.	2005-01-14

They range from solutions to difficult data analysis issues, to tips about graphing, pivot tables, and importing data from various formats, notably XML. <br /> <br />The book is organized into chapters around central Excel themes; editing, formulas, formatting, charting, etc. Each chapter has a set of annoyances with a description and a solution. These annoyances are sometimes bugs, and sometimes just difficult issues that reasonably advanced users will run into where the help is either insufficient or poorly written. The fixes are generally fairly short and contained within the bounds of Excel, though the book does point to external sites and software where appropriate. <br /> <br />Definitely a must have for the power Excel user.	2005-01-14

All of the key topics are covered, file and print sharing, active directory, IIS, .NET, VPN, the fundamentals of security, and even clustering. <br /> <br />One thing that struck me about this book was how much of it seems to come directly out of the author's experience. For example the security policy coverage is a blend of the straight technical material and practical advice on how good network security can be tailored to find the right balance of security and convenience. It's these practical insights that distinguish this book from just a straight feature review. <br /> <br />Certainly an easy buy for anyone doing administration work on Windows Server 2003.	2005-01-14

This book takes it seriously and presents both practical and architectural material at a level that used to be reserved for J2EE and .NET works. This relatively short book is packed full of well written and insightful content. It stars with the basics of PHP5 OO programming with detail about the mistakes in PHP4 that have now been rectified. That is taken all the way through advanced topics like reflection. <br /> <br />The author then switches gears and gets into the design of object oriented applications. Now that we have the right tools, how we should use them to make better systems, right? UML is covered, and so are design patterns.  <br /> <br />The later chapters of the book cover solid software engineering practices, like version control and unit testing, amongst other. <br /> <br />Not only will this book give you new ideas at a coding level, it will also open your mind as an engineer and get you headed in a direction toward architecture and large scale application design. <br /> <br />An excellent book. A must have for any serious PHP developer.	2005-01-14

The topic of workplace psychology can be done wrong in so many ways. You can present it too clinically and thus lack any practicality. And you can slide the other way and shower the user with pop psychology check-lists and acronyms. <br /> <br />This book walks the ideal path deftly and presents practical workplace issues with the right blend of psychology background and practical wisdom on how to handle individuals with personality issues. <br /> <br />The book is organized by disorder. Each type of personality is presented in it's own chapter with what to look for. As well as how to handle that individual as a boss, a coworker and as a subordinate. <br /> <br />A fascinating read on it's own, and practical advice for people stuck in tough jobs where they have to contend with coworkers who have personality problems.	2005-01-14

I won't do that hear. Though I feel that in a large way the fundamental issue with AOP, which is that it's a technology looking for a problem to solve, is the major problem with this book. <br /> <br />As with the other recipe books this is organized first into chapters around the fundamentals of the topic. Then within each chapter there is a set of problems, which are described, then solved using the technology. The solution is the described in detail and alternatives are provided. But where other recipe books tend to solve real world problems (e.g. connecting to Amazon web services), this book solves problems in the AOP technology itself. <br /> <br />Four chapters of the book are dedicated to implement GoF Design Patterns in AOP. This is interesting content. If you are an AOP enthusiast these sections alone will be worth the price of the book. But if you aren't a true believer you will not find justification for why you should implement the Design Patterns in AOP. You will only find out how they are implement. Take recipe 19.5, \\"Implementing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern\\". The problem is stated as, \\"You want to apply the chain of responsibility pattern using AspectJ.\\" Ok, but why would I want to do that? What is the benefit? What are the drawbacks? This is never discussed. <br /> <br />Obviously a buy for the AOP faithful. Probably a buy for those seriously interested in AOP. But we are all still looking for the book that justifies AOP in terms of solutions to real world customer problems.	2005-01-14

This most recent update covers Emacs version 21.3 in both it's terminal and GUI modes. It stars with basic text editing, keyboard navigation, selection, window and buffer management. Then into macros, advanced editing features. And on into how to use Emacs to edit various types of file, and use the editor as an IDE. The last chapters writing Lisp extensions, as well as integrating Emacs with CVS. <br /> <br />This is more than an introductory text, most likely even advanced users will find something new. But certainly this is a book that is ideally suited to beginners.	2005-01-14

Some of which are great, like this one. While others are little more than doorstops. The text is well written, though, like most Wrox books it relies heavily on code to do most of the exposition. Almost every topic you can think of is covered. Basic topics like controls, page design and security. Then onto more advanced topics like XML and mobile development. That's how you get to the tome size. But the coverage is consistently well written. So if you like your books in the all-in-one flavor, this is a good book for ASP.NET 1.1.	2005-01-10

Most pages have several screenshots with smatterings of text explaining each one. There is some coverage of shell access at the end of the book. But the book is primarily focused on applications like OpenOffice, Write, Gimp and the other GUI applications.	2005-01-10

Topics range in obscurity from reflection (which it starts with) to just above basic, using ADO.NET with stored procedures. Threading, which is always a difficult topic to explain, was covered in a well written fashion, but lacked illustrations, which I think would have brought a lot of clarity to the subject. Other topics were given some illustrations, but overall the book used screenshots for most of the graphics. Remoting was another area that could have used illustrations. <br /> <br />Overall well written, but could have been better organized and illustrated. Definitely worth a look over if you find that it covers topics of interest.	2005-01-10

These include threading, Swing, AWT, JDBC, Networking, JavaBeans and JNI. Some of the coverage is more in-depth than in other parts. In particular Swing and AWT are covered richly, while networking and JNI get shorter shrift. <br /> <br />Given that Swing and AWT are not at the core of modern Java development I would have liked to have seen more of this tome sized book spent on threading, JDBC and networking. And it would have been nice to see some serious coverage of EJB. That being said, what is there is well written, has good example code, and effective illustrations.	2005-01-10

It starts with a high level overview of the toolset. Then dives into document construction, then into tables, lists, mathematical formatting, and into user constructions and extensions for bibliographies, as well as other topics. PDF and Postscript formatting is covered. As well as AMS-TeX which is more extensions or mathematical formatting. <br /> <br />On the downside the substance of the text is only two-thirds of the book. Appendices make up the rest. Which necessarily means that the coverage is a little more terse than you would expect for a book this size. <br /> <br />That being said, this is still an excellent introduction to the TeX set of tools for anyone who is just starting out.	2005-01-10

It's certainly not an introduction to Struts and doesn't intend to be. This is a reference work for Struts users who are looking for canned solutions to problems like Tomcat security, Internationalization, or bread crumb trails. Each solution has a short description of the problem (with some background supplied), then the solution recipe and a discussion of the solution. <br /> <br />This is an easy to use, and read, reference format that works well for situations where you have a loosely organized set of common problems. Check the table of contents to make sure that you are getting solutions to the problems you face. If you find topics that interest you rest assured that they are covered well in the book.	2005-01-10

It starts with the very basics of program structure using standard I/O examples and simple data types. There is some well thought out material on the basics of object oriented programming with the pillars of OO described at a practical level. <br /> <br />Templates are covered a little, but probably not enough to have you building them without some more reading them. The Standard Template Library (STL) is also covered thinly. This is a basic language reference. External libraries aren't the primary focus. In particular you will find no coverage of window systems or graphic user interface APIs, like Windows or anything else. If you want a complete C++ book for Windows, this isn't your book. But then I don't think that would be a good book anyway. You should learn the fundamentals of the language, then get a book specific to the platform you are developing on.	2005-01-10

It's well written, even to the point of being entertaining at some points. Which is a lot to say for a security book. <br /> <br />The book covers topics at a remarkable depth without feeling overwhelming. Though it's light on strict reference material (which is easily made up with the MSDN) it still has reference value because of the deep level at which subjects are covered. In particular, his coverage of network authentication is excellent. Which is fantastic because this is such a frustrating issue in practice. <br /> <br />Definitely worth a look for anyone who wants to understand Windows security APIs at a deep level.	2005-01-10

The bugs range from rudimentary syntax mistakes to more complex and subtle bugs. Hints are given to help you along the way. These will definitely give you brain a spin. Much link the C lint bugs in that have been printed in Dr. Dobbs for years. If you enjoy logic puzzles and bug hunting you will like this book.	2005-01-10

About a third of the book acts as an introduction to the basics of VBScript for use in this context. He covers basics like variables, conditionals, functions, error handling, and more. The other two thirds of the book covers a variety of topics like shell extensions, ASP, XML, active directory and more. This is up-to-date stuff. <br /> <br />On the downside the exposition depends a little too much on code. But if you like that sort of thing you will do well with that. It's not unusual for tech books, but it's enough that I took a star off for it.	2005-01-10

It's obviously a well refined second edition where the authors have listened to the readers and understand how to present this very deep information in a lightweight informative way. I can't imagine any more material that could be poured into this book. Which isn't to say that the book is a dumping ground of material, what is in there is all well organized and integrated. <br /> <br />What's more, the formatting of the book itself stands as an example of design to be aspired to. <br /> <br />This is a phenomenal piece of work. It gets my highest recommendation. This is a fantastic book for anyone who uses TeX seriously. For those looking to start with TeX you should probably AW's Guide To LaTeX as well as this book.	2005-01-10

To have a new book on the subject is a welcome surprise. I would have preferred that the book had more exposition in relation to the amount of code, but that's a small gripe with what is otherwise a well written book. The basics are covered from the syntax of the language and the tools, to file management and logging. Then the author discusses scripting the common iLife applications. This is where I appreciated the up-to-date information as the other book on Applescript from O'Reilly is badly in need of an update. <br /> <br />I would have preferred some additional information on Applescript Studio, as this is an exciting new development for Applescript. But that is also a minor grip. <br /> <br />A must buy for those interested in a starting point for scripting their OS X box.	2005-01-10

And this is not a doorstop. It's very well researched, written and illustrated. It guides you through installation and use all the way to advanced topics. The chapter on replication is superb. As are the chapters on the schema and how the schema can be extended. <br /> <br />Sometimes you get a book and marvel at just how much work went into it. This is one of those books. An absolute must for anyone who is actively using, or planning to use, Active Directory.	2005-01-10

The book is organized into three major sections; an introduction, a project management process, and a specifications development strategy. The second section is excellent. The chapters are ordered in terms of workflow and the advice is clear and pragmatic. The third section is excellent as well. <br /> <br />I've never seen a project management book as focused and well organized as this one.

The book starts with an introduction to the architecture of Lucene, replete with a simple sample application, then goes into an in-depth review of the indexing, searching and querying. XML and HTML indexing are also covered. As are performance issues. The last chapter covers related technologies and other implementations of Lucene into other languages. <br /> <br />This is the best book I have seen on Lucene.

You will get a good introduction from it, but there will be a lot more to learn. There is a practical example with MySQL. Overall the tone is pretty dry and terse.

But at the same time the book often goes here and there with lots of extraneous information, which while interesting, is also distracting. <br /> <br />The book covers conventional project management in a compelling and interesting way, and offers practical experienced based insights. Based on that I would give it five stars. The centering of the management process around requirements is a great idea. And the use of lo-fi prototypes is genius. So there is great content in here. But, unfortunately the distracting content and the sub-par quality of the illustrations leads me to give it a four out of five. <br /> <br />Still, if you are looking for a way to break out of the mold of your current development process. And you are looking for something that could lead to a more compelling product design for your customer. You may find the answer you are looking for in this book.	2005-01-10

It's a short book that has a jovial style. It presents topics in that almost too enthusiastic HR style that has an unceasingly positive tone, lots of too-clever acronyms, and recipe answers for any problem. That's what you expect though. This is an HR book after all. <br /> <br />What I like about this book is that it presents a totally new style which is the antitheses of books like 'Who moved my cheese?' This book is all about nurturing the talents and uniqueness of the individual. Balancing individual needs against those of the larger company but with the emphasis tilted more towards individualism. <br /> <br />This is the ideal book for engineers to use to convince their managers to be flexible and healthier work environment that will bring better productivity and happier employees.	2005-01-06

Having given us a complete set of technical skills Mike now gives us common sense and practical design skills for Windows. With the full complement of skills in hand you will be able to complete the entire technical side of the application development cycle.  <br /> <br />The design fundamentals presented in this book are pretty basic and common sense. Just having use the Microsoft Office suite on Windows will have taught you many of these things. But what you will find is that the book not only gives you the 'how' of interface design, but also the 'why'.  <br /> <br />I've been on a number of projects where someone has spent the time to define what controls should be used in what context. When dialogs should be used. How menus should be organized. And so on. You should evaluate the book in this context as well. <br /> <br />An excellent companion to \\"Coder to Developer\\".

After that the book goes into Swing, applets (is anyone doing them anymore?), and then into debugging and file I/O. Funny, I would have thought that both of the final chapters would have been pushed forward. Certainly file I/O should go before Swing, right? <br /> <br />Frankly, I think too much time was spent on Swing. The book turned into a reasonably in-depth introduction to Swing and event oriented programming. When it probably should have gone into threading, regular expressions, file I/O and other fundamentals. The quality of the language discussion saved this book for me.	2005-01-06

That's the reason I like this book so much. It's mainly about the what to use Knoppix for, not about how Knoppix itself works. <br /> <br />There are recipes for doing a root kit, using knoppix for partitioning and boot management. The different flavors of knoppix are also covered. Gnoppix, ClusterKnoppix, Knoppix-STD and more. There is also some material on how to develop your own custom knoppix disc. <br /> <br />A must have book for anyone who wants to make use of Knoppix or a variant.	2005-01-06

Most concentrate on the technical side of the equation. Talking about the standards, the APIs, the cross-platform issues and other low level issues. This book takes an architectural route by covering every aspect of the SOA space with well written exposition and extensive use of UML. <br /> <br />One section, which I haven't seen in any other book on the topic, is on the managerial issues around SOA. How to tell SOA in the organization. How to build support the architecture. How to incent the engineers. These are important topics. And what's better is that the author illustrates the management level problems and their proposed solutions with real world cases studies. <br /> <br />An excellent book on SOA for readers looking for an architectural overview.	2005-01-06

It starts with a language walkthrough then goes on through the basics of objects and onto the APIs. Sections like XML, JDBC and others are covered at a fairly high level. The basics are covered by using example problem solutions. There isn't much for reference, but you wouldn't expect it from this book. <br /> <br />The coverage of the new features in the language, especially generics, is well integrated. I suppose the time of the dedicated Java 1.5 features book is over and now the new versions of the Java introductory books will include all of these new features. <br /> <br />A solid all-in-one walkthrough of the Java language and the basic APIs. Though myself I would buy two books. One on the Java language only, and another on the foundation classes.	2005-01-06

Consumers have a right to own what they buy, and fairly use it. And commercial companies and artists have a right to make money on products that consumers are willing to pay for. Finding the right balance is complex, and that's what this book sets out to do. <br /> <br />It's a relatively quick read at about three hundred pages. If you read just the first portion of the book you would believe that the author is firmly in league with the companies. He lays out in grim detail the cost of piracy at an economic level. In the later chapters he does a good job representing the consumer perspective and advocating for our rights. <br /> <br />He finishes up with a well reasoned proposal for striking a balance between these two warring factions. Companies want to make money. People want to own stuff. Cant' we all just get a long?	2005-01-06

We all want to think about everything the application should do when everything goes right. But such is not always the case and we need to think about what happens when errors occur and exceptions are thrown. <br /> <br />This book starts with the basics of exception handling. Going through the do's and dont's in a very well written and informative manner. It then presents the exception handling specifics for each of the API, from the Java core, all the way through J2EE. Perhaps the most interesting part is saved for last as the author presents design patterns for exception handling. <br /> <br />This is an excellent work on error handling. It teaches the basics and leaves you with a good feeling that have you tools at your disposal to handle the errors. As opposed to trying to effectively disguise your head as you stick it in the sand.	2005-01-06

It takes a case study approach to teaching test driven development on an application to track sports results. It's pretty code heavy, which is something that I don't like about it. But given the topic that is to be expected. <br /> <br />Test Driven Development is a tough topic to teach. I respect APress for publishing a book with a unique design to try address this problem. It's well worth the time because this unique development approach can be very powerful when it's employed properly. <br /> <br />I recommend looking into Test Driven Development if you haven't already. And this is a reasonable place to start if you like to learn by example more than by reading process documentation like the Agile books.	2005-01-01

It doesn't do that. It's a fairly screenshot intensive walkthrough of basic Oracle use in .NET.  It starts with connectivity, information retrieval and manipulation. Then exception handling, stored procedures and large object operations. There is some coverage of performance issues. <br /> <br />There is a lot of good content here. It's well written and organized. The screenshots aren't overwhelming and the sample code is good. A good book on Oracle use in .NET, even if it is a little mis-titled.	2005-01-01

Java is supposed to be \\"write once, run anywhere\\" (WORA). And in general Java and it's related tools are pretty close to that. So what does a book about Java on Linux bring? A little bit of information about make, which you probably won't use, but will use Ant instead (which is also covered). And information on gcj, which is unique to Linux. <br /> <br />Most of the book is about generic Java application development. Database persistence work using the standard persistence tools (JDBC, EJB). Web development using Tomcat. And UI development with Swing and SWT. None of which is Linux specific. The IDEs that are covered, Netbeans and Eclipse, are also not Linux specific. <br /> <br />So can't it just be a general Java development book? Sure. And it is that. Problem is that we have a glut of Java books. And the coverage of any one topic in this book, say JDBC as an example, is not so deep as to replace JDBC specific books that you will get from other companies. <br /> <br />As it stands, this book is a good high level introduction to Java application development both on the web and on the desktop.	2005-01-01

Using this mechanism you can attach geometry data to your records and then search them using geometric patterns. Think of Yahoo maps as a good example of this. in fact, the case study portion of the book is a mapping website that you can search and overlay points of interest on. In addition the book demonstrates, to some degree, finding the best route between two spatial points. <br /> <br />It's a thick book on a thick topic, hard-backed, and well illustrated. The style is as walkthrough. Going through each section of the SDO extensions and showing how they are used in context. It's not a good reference work.	2005-01-01

It then drills into ADO.NET, commands and finally into readers. There are a few chapters on Windows Forms and ASP.NET before the author gets into stored procedures. These could probably have been dropped, but they don't distract too much. The section on stored procedures is a little scanty. <br /> <br />Definitely a good book for someone just starting with database access in .NET who wants a step-by-step walkthrough. There is a small section on database fundamentals, but I wouldn't look to the book to teach you that. Best to get a book on database basics if you don't understand the fundamentals.	2005-01-01
405890:US	50389232	RBGUO54LX4HYI	0321219147	997830648	Linux Application Development (2nd Edition)	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Excellent C language introduction	This is a well written introduction to C development on Linux starting with the very basics of process and file I/O, going all the way through networking, regular expressions and lightweight databases. The first few chapters go over the differences between Linux and unix. Then cover development tool basics. <br /> <br />This is a high end reference that is light on screenshots (almost none), that has well written and annotated example code. It's reminiscent of the classic Advanced Unix Programming. With the exception that this book is larger and has better exposition. In particular this book will answer almost any question you have about file I/O, process management, and networking. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book. It gets my full recommendation.	2005-01-01

Starting with the basics each chapter is well written and illustrated and has a series of questions at the end to help you test your knowledge of what you have just learned. UML is used throughout as the illustration language. Later chapters deal with algorithms (e.g. storage, sorting, searching, etc.) <br /> <br />All of the features of the Java language are covered. Swing is used to teach the basics of UI. There is nothing on web application work. Collections are taught using the new generics features of Tiger. <br /> <br />A good book for those looking to learn how to program, and who want to start with the Java language and object-oriented design.	2004-12-29

As Djikstra said, \\"Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never show their absence\\". The alternative, presented well here by Roland, is to build applications based on algorithms and proofs that can be shown mathematically to be error free. <br /> <br />It's an interesting concept. And Roland does a good job of pitching the idea in the first two chapter and then running through the fundamental mathematical examples. Of course, proofs and equations fill every page. All of the code is in pseudo code. Illustrations are kept to a minumum, but are used effectively when they are present. <br /> <br />The fault I find in the book is with the subtitle; \\"Calculation Implementations from Specifications\\". To me this says that book will get into real world applications. Like how to prove a database form is without error. But the book doesn't get close to that. In fact, as I could see, it doesn't address that level of issue at all. All of the content is in the area of proving mathematical systems. About the most practical it gets is in sorting.	2004-12-29

The topic is pretty dry all on it's own but the authors here didn't help matters much. It's a clinical work on the fundamentals of the LSB at the code level. There is some information on the organization of the committee and the current status of the standards. <br /> <br />The information is well organized and the coverage is thorough and timely. I can only fault the book for it's tone. So I'm going to give it a reasonable ranking. I wouldn't buy this book unless you need to. It's not a fun weekend read.	2004-12-29

It steps through the API from dynamic object creation, through type, method and field inspection. The code examples are a little long but they are well annotated. The illustrations are minimal, but used well. <br /> <br />I would have liked more on how to use reflection to build extension mechanisms. And the section on code generation wasn't particularly good. <br /> <br />Worthwhile if you are going to be doing a lot of reflection work and you want an introduction to the API. There isn't much in the way of reference, and information on how reflection works in other languages is minimal.	2004-12-29

Nathan gives a bunch of common scenarios (parsing filenames, CSV, validating emails and SSNs) and gives us the expression in Perl. Followed by a discussion of the code, and further examples in PHP, shell script, VIM and others. <br /> <br />There is a small section at the beginning to teach you the fundamentals. But there is nothing at the level of Mastering Regular Expressions (O'Reilly), the classic work in the field. <br /> <br />This book is a good reference for those more interested in simply getting the job done, than in understanding how or why the pattern works. There are some bad examples. In particular the Spam filter example is almost worthless. But most of the examples are well written.	2004-12-29

It's a set of 100 small vignettes on the brain and on neuroscience. I found surprisingly little on how to change the behavior of your brain. Or practical ways to focus your attention, to become smarter or faster. That's what I was hoping to see. Though what I see instead is interesting all on it's own. <br /> <br />If you are interested in neuroscience, or the function of the brain. And little games of tweaking your perception that you probably learned in Psych 101 and hen forgot. You will probably like this book. <br /> <br />Though I should also mention On Intelligence (0805074562) from Times Books. That book explains the nature and function of intelligence as a coherent story, and doesn't suffer from being shoeboxed into a Hacks series form like this book does.	2004-12-29

The first few chapters debunk historical artificial intelligence efforts. The author then continues on to propose his theory on the function of the neocortex. Which is a hierarchal mesh of pattern recognizing nodes that propagate both forward and backward to predict the world and to react to changing responses. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book. It was a bit of a struggle in the first few chapters, but after he got into developing his own theories it turned into a page flipper that was hard to put down.	2004-12-29

The style is friendly and easy to read.  <br /> <br />There are a few oversized screenshots, and some of the code runs a little long without annotation. In addition the reference value could have been enhanced. The reference that is there is minimal and I'm not sure how useful it would be. There is some coverage of building add-ons for Office, which is too short to be useful and could have been dropped. <br /> <br />Despite it's faults the book is still a good end-to-end walkthrough of developing and deploying add-ins.	2004-12-29

It's a rocket ride through installing Tomcat, building servlets and extensions, and then into web application security. <br /> <br />It's comprehensive in it's coverage of Tomcat, and rarely strays from that mark. There is a small foray into database development, but that is mainly around connection pooling, which is a related topic. <br /> <br />Overall an excellent introduction to Tomcat. My only complaints are that the book could have relied less on code itself for exposition, and that the reference value could have been expanded on a little bit.	2004-12-29

It covers everything from unicode to Javascript, from security to the validity of the HTML. It teaches through an understanding of the technology, then covers ways to stress the technology to look for bugs. The sections on character encodings and performance testing are particularly well done. This is a must have book for QA professionals tasked with testing a web application.	2004-12-29

The author lays out in a comprehensive way an organization wide process to develop a secure information structure. The insights range from high level strategies, to lower level tactics, with a few very practical examples thrown in here and there. <br /> <br />Information security should be a critical concern of today's high-tech organizations. But so often it is forgotten, or relegated into obscurity because there was too much process or the security was too intrusive. The author strikes a good, pragmatic balance between convenience and security here. <br /> <br />The book is a short, easy read. Really a must read for CIOs and a should read for CEOs.	2004-12-29

Robert does a great job leading you through the fundamentals of algorithms and algorithm analysis. The visualizations are very well done. In particular the sort algorithm coverage is very well illustrated and described. <br /> <br />The best parts of the book are sorting and searching. A wide variety of algorithms are explained and demonstrated in detail. The code is solid and the writing is very good. <br /> <br />This is the set of Java algorithms books.	2004-12-29

Time, features, quality, these all turn the thrill of inspiration into the cool slog of a job. But sometimes the fire gets through. That's what happened at Apple with the birth of the Macintosh. And that's what Andy Hertzfeld, one of the primary team members on the first Macintosh, chronicles in this book. <br /> <br />The summation of the folklore.org site, this book is a set of about 100 stories. Each running about 3-4 pages on average. Starting with Andy's first day at Apple and ending around the time when Jobs' was ousted in a palace coup. The stories run the gamut from the deep technical to the interpersonal. They are well written and engaging. <br /> <br />A must read for those inspired by the original Apple Mac engineers.	2004-12-16

The iPod book for example spent eighteen pages on how to mold a new iPod console for your car. It would have been very easy for this book to go over that edge but it keeps it's focus and stays well within the realm of practical advice to enhance your home theater.  <br /> <br />The sections on how to enhance your projection TV is excellent and very practical. There is good coverage of speaker calibration, system maintenance, and TiVo. There is also good material on acoustic tremblers which will bring the experience really close to home. <br /> <br />A must buy book for home theater enthusiasts. There is lots of material here that you can find on the web, but it's better organized, illustrated and explained here.	2004-12-14

It walks through all of the external features, the software, and all of the gadgets and gizmos you can add on. In addition there are some pointers to useful third party software that you should have a look at. <br />  <br />The walkthrough of the basics of the system software are good enough to be a standalone book that would preclude other book purchases.

The term annoyances is a bit stretched. In general these are tips on how to get to hard to find, but very useful functions. The content is good and useful, though sometimes not what you want to hear. For example the advice on selective popup blocking in Safari is to switch browsers. <br /> <br />You will want to look at the table of contents to make sure that you are getting enough value for your dollar.

Java took that rope away when Gosling removed templates, operating overloading, and added garbage collection. But then he backed up the rope truck and unloaded threads on us. Now I see far too many programmers jumping into the world of Heisenbugs by building threaded applications without the proper understanding of their best use. <br /> <br />That's where this book comes in. It starts with the threading basics, but then goes on to show best practice strategies for the use of threads and architectures to manage threads. And what's more, the author gives us case studies that detail how these strategies and architectures are implemented. <br /> <br />There was a desperate need for this book, and the author has filled the void with excellent material. I strongly recommend this book to any Java programmer using threading. Which is to say, almost everyone.	2004-11-20

It takes a Gang of Four Design Patterns approach to various types of testing, starting with unit testing in the abstract, but then covering use of mock objects, test database, exception testing and other areas. It's a wide coverage area but the patterns remain fairly abstract. For those of a more pragmatic mind you should look at Manning's JUnit Recipes.	2004-11-20

Well worth the money for Windows users. There are a wide variety of helpful hints that will help you get the most out of your machine, and tell you a little about the fundamentals along the way. In particular I found the explanation of how to get laptops to go to sleep very rewarding, probably worth the price of the book alone, because it saved me from reinstalling the OS on what was otherwise a well behaved machine. Other notable helpful hints included information on how to clean up your desktop, speed up networking, fix wireless problems and to block popups.	2004-11-20

From the basics of the object and typing model, through the syntax and into a function reference. In my opinion most average XSLT users could probably get away with the XPath coverage in Michael's other book XSLT 2.0 for Programmers. But for those implementing XPath, or who are using it as a central architectural mechanism, you will want the in-depth coverage in this book.	2004-11-20

Otherwise the book is just page after page of bulleted lists. It's confusing, hard to read, and not worth your time. Read the O'Reilly book on XSL-FO instead.	2004-11-20

The book is in full color and the examples are of regular people and average pictures that present the problems we have all come to know, and wish to fix, underexposure, overexposure, too much shadow, too little contrast, etc. <br /> <br />Overall I like the book but there are some rough spots. In particular, the coverage of panoramas could be better. The author admonishes you not to pay for panorama software, which he overshoots on the price, and then lays out a complex set of steps that will result in an average panorama that will likely have perspective problems if you take the shots too close. In addition there was more that could have been said about the RAW format, which is critical to getting the most out of your camera. <br /> <br />Still, even with the downsides, this is a good book for digital photographers.	2004-11-20

Though the book is a reasonable introduction to HTML and CSS. On the positive side I thought the organization was good, the text was easy to read, the use of red to hilight important code fragments, and the reference section were all very good. On the downside I thought the Quick Start format made the book a little hard to read. And the Alice in Wonderland examples weren't always the most appropriate way to illustrate each point. I would have rather had examples that were closer to what we would see in the real world.	2004-11-20

There is some material on that to be sure but in general the book focuses on how to use the Pivot Table features of Excel. The advanced material is on how to script Pivot Tables using VB. The text is well written. The book is a little screenshot heavy, but you would expect that from this type of book. <br /> <br />It's a good book, and it will come in handy for heavy users of this feature. But for those looking for more on data analysis techniques you will probably be disappointed.	2004-11-20

This is a textbook covering security fundamentals from mathematical concepts, like cyphers and encryption, to the analysis of intrusions, viruses and worms through to policy aspects. About as concrete as it gets in terms of implementation comes in the second to last chapter on securing the internals of a C program. <br /> <br />This book provides an excellent grounding in the fundamentals of security. A must have for anyone studying security, or for those looking for a deeper understanding of IT security fundamentals.	2004-11-20

It teaches both at the policy level and the technology level. There are rollout strategies for security within an organization, as well as overviews of the latest technologies that can help you implement your security strategies. The book is well written and researched. Illustrations are used very effectively. I'm very impressed with this book. It's a solid piece of work.	2004-11-20

The chapters, which are essentially recipe answers to security questions are sometimes very short (2-3 pages). The text is very focused and terse. The coverage of the book is excellent though. It's wide ranging, and as long as you can keep up, relatively in-depth. The coverage of privileges and sessions is very good. Worth a look for security professionals.	2004-11-20

It covers all of the basics around installation, setting up blogs and writing entries. But then it goes into more advanced topics like alternating the template and adding plugins. And even more advanced topics like RSS, Atom, and writing your own plugins. This is thorough book that is well written and will cover everything you need to know to blog with Movable Type.	2004-11-20

The book lays the foundation, step by step, for understanding HTML tags and how to use HTML and CSS to lay out your pages and to get them formatted the way you want. The examples are practical and based in the real world. The text is very easy to follow and is easy enough for beginners to use.

Not only do they provide good syntax instruction, they also teach you about writing good PHP code. <br /> <br />The trouble comes in the SQL database access chapter, in it's use of string concatenation to build SQL insert, update and delete statements. That strategy is prone to SQL injection attacks, and just basic buggy behavior. What's worse is that the section on PEAR, where you would expect to see SQL done well, doesn't reference the PEAR SQL wrapper. <br /> <br />In addition the book only has two chapters on the Object Oriented properties of the language. Where the first is just an overview of basic OO methodology.	2004-11-20

None have made it as plain and simple as this one. Even though the title says AirPort the text covers any wireless router. The illustrations and screenshots are focused on the Mac AirPort and AirPort Express hardware, but the basics remain the same. A must buy for anyone looking for easy and practical walkthrough of basic wireless network security.	2004-11-20

These include billboards, letterhead, DVD boxes and the like. The techniques covered include photo manipulation, typography work, and completely artificial drawings. The author does a good job of explaining each design step-by-step and making it all very easy to follow. The designs are pretty slick and there are some good ideas to borrow there outside of the context of learning about Photoshop.	2004-11-19

It's easier to fix problems when you have better source material to start with. In addition I would have liked more information on how to judge a bad photograph. The book assumes you know when you have shadow or exposure problems, and concentrates on how to fix them. Most of us need to know more about why before getting into the how. <br /> <br />That being said the book is well written and has a lot of good examples. I also appreciate that the source material are average pictures. Too many photoshop books use models for the pictures when most of the readers are photographing our scruffy relatives, kids and pets. <br /> <br />This is a good book for digital photographers, but I think you should check out O'Reilly's Digital Photography: Expert Techniques.	2004-11-19

It's only two hundred pages or so. About 50 are the basics of RAW. It's a good introduction but I would have liked a little more camera-specific coverage. After that it's a 150 walkthrough of the features of the RAW converter with some rudimentary examples. The last chapter is on automation. The only book on RAW so far, it seems, and it's a good starting point on this very important topic.	2004-11-19

It guides you through installing Eclipse, starting your first project, and integrating with source control. There is a small section on writing a plugin, but it's not the emphasis of the book. <br /> <br />O'Reilly's Eclipse books spent about half their time on Eclipse and the other half on plain Java development which was a waste of space. This book spends on chapter on web development, and some of that chapter is spent on use of Eclipse in that context. It's a diversion in both the Manning and O'Reilly books, but the O'Reilly books are far worse. <br /> <br />This is the best introduction to end-user Eclipse that I have read. If you want a book on getting started with Eclipse as a Java development IDE, this is the one.	2004-11-19

This is one of the good ones. In particular because the book covers a variety of Photoshop design tasks from simple photo alterations, through typography work, and into ad layouts and compositing techniques. It's a full spectrum approach that will give you as much information on techniques as it gives you ideas for what you can do with Photoshop. All of the examples a presented step by step with an illustration at each step. The book is full color and the examples are high quality.	2004-11-19

This is that kind of book. It's relatively short. There is a brief introduction to the basics of the O/R mapping problem. Then it's straight into the heart of Hibernate. It starts by discussing persistent objects, then transactions, then into a fine section on performance, and finally a section of code generation as it's applied to Hibernate. <br /> <br />The coverage is a little terse. Graphics are used effectively but not overused. This is  not a for dummies book. It's for programmers who know their stuff and want a professional walkthrough of Hibernate architecture and implementation.	2004-11-19

In these examples the photos start bad and sometimes get worse. The problem is visible even on the cover. The photoshopped flag looks awful. <br /> <br />Definitely not the book for digital photographers looking to get the most out of photoshop.

It stars by covering JUnit and the test first methodology. It then covers testing a variety of types of code, including very notably HTML and GUI code. The last chapter, which is one of it's best is on the importance of unit testing in the entire lifecycle of development. This is an instant classic in the under-covered world of unit testing. A must buy for both QA and Developer alike.	2004-11-19

The Effective C++ series is mainly very low level hints that help you avoid the pitfalls that C++ has in store for you. This book, while showing a lot of code, gives a higher level perspective of the areas it covers (e.g. templates, STL, class design, namespaces, etc.). That perspective grounds you in an understanding of the topic, then binds that to some real world code examples. Both approaches are very valuable. I would recommend getting both books. You can't live without the practical advice of Effective C++ or the architectural material in C++ Coding Standards.	2004-11-19

The coverage is very in-depth. This is not a step-by-step book. The idea is to give you a fundamental understanding of the technology and then show it's application in Photoshop. The sections on building selections and using the sharpening features are particular standouts. <br /> <br />If you are the type of person who learns by understanding the fundamentals and not a raw process then it's a tossup between this book and Photoshop CS Artistry. The latter is a little more terse in it's style. This book is more relaxed in style so it's a little easier to follow.	2004-11-19

It never digs very deep into topics.  The coverage of UML editing, for example, is about 30 pages. But that's thirty more pages than most of the Eclipse books have on UML. And the coverage is of a wide variety of these topics, including Struts, web services, JSPs, and others. The basics are covered as well, starting with installation and the basics of starting up a project, going through source control, unit testing, and refactoring. It's all there. It's just set to a whirlwind pace that may leave you a little breathless. Good book, just not for very beginners.	2004-11-19

But there was little of that. What is there instead is a fairly high level walkthrough of web services standards that is reasonable well written. <br /> <br />This book acts as a field guide of sorts, illuminating a path but not providing enough depth to serve as a guide for implementation. Illustrations were under-used and the small amounts of code that were provided weren't given much in the way of annotation.	2004-11-19

It teaches the fundamentals of evaluating images and then shows you how to repair them effectively. If I could fault the book at all it would be that at times the effect is sometimes so subtle it's hard to see the fix, if not flatly impossible. But in most cases the problem is very obvious. This is a must have book for those looking to scan and fix very old photos so that they can be preserved digitally. This book teaches all of the tried and true analog photo fixing techniques with our new digital tools.	2004-11-19

But most of the book is in black and white, and the examples are pretty cheesy. The color insert section is there but it is dedicated to the display of some artists. What's sad is that the art in the insert is far better than what is in the example. I look for a book like this to both teach and inspire. It certainly taught the technique, but didn't inspire with it's form.	2004-11-19

It implies that it will cover a range of shells when in fact it only covers bash and zsh. That being said, the coverage of those shells is focused, well written, and useful. In particular the coverage of command line completion, and how to extend it, is excellent. There are two chapters on scripting, but in general this is an end-user book on how to use the shells as opposed to how to automate them. The book could have used some more illustrations, but overall it's an informative read that is well worth the look.	2004-11-19

But the majority of the book is in black and white, while competitive books are in full color and a lot shorter. There are two color inserts that show the color versions of what is explained in the rest of the book. The examples are not great either. In particular the filter examples seem to have been picked to show the most dramatic effect of the filter, as opposed to an optimal use of the filter to show it in it's best form. I recommend Adobe Photoshop CS One-on-One instead.	2004-11-19

First it provides practical insights in how to test various forms of code, from servlets all the way through to stored procedures. Second, by giving you all of these examples it will stretch your testing brain by giving you ideas that will extend your testing beyond what even this thick book manages to pack in.<br /><br />The first part of the book gives you the basics of JUnit. After that it's all recipes which come in the form of presenting a problem, then the solution and a discussion of the solution.<br /><br />If I had to find fault it would be that GUI testing is not covered. But that's a minor flaw since it's hard to find anything that covers that difficult topic in any way. A must own for an test-first JUnit developer.	2004-11-19

It taught me more about why behind exposure, color spaces, and image sourcing than any other book I have read. It provides a process for handling photos from the source to output in a variety of different media. The color spaces coverage is excellent. This is the book for those who want to understand the science and the concepts and then learn about the application having built a solid basis of technical understanding.	2004-11-19

Bruce is always practical and pragmatic in his approach and it's no different here. He covers test first development very well. There is also an excellent section on transparency. But much like a theme album this short book is supposed to be ingested whole. Definitely a must have for professional Java developers.	2004-11-19

It blends material on the technical aspects of digital photography work with advice on composition and other simple techniques for getting the best shot. The first half of the book focuses mainly on getting the best out of your camera with focus control, white balance, and using the flash the right way. The second half is on composition in various situations; headshots, panoramas, still lifes, photographing your pets, and more. The example photos also serve to give you great ideas for your own work. A short and excellent book. Definitely a good Christmas present (stocking stuffer) to go along with the digital camera under the tree.	2004-11-17

It stars with Textpad, then flies into Photoshop, then back into Textpad for a quick ride through the basics of HTML and CSS. There is some reference at the end, but frankly it's too little too late. The back of the book exhorts that you don't have to know everything to get your job done, and while that may apply to other fields like Powerpoint or Word, it doesn't work here. You need to understand the fundamentals of HTML if you want to go past the examples shown here. <br /> <br />For a complete introduction starting with the fundamentals I recommend O'Reilly's excellent HTML & XHTML : The Definitive Guide.	2004-11-17

But since the items covered are just spots of information from here and there around the landscape of web and design standards you need to check this book out in person to make sure you are getting your moneys worth. In particular I liked the material on CSS layout, but I was disappointed with coverage of basic topics like web safe colors, which requires a more in-depth discussion than the few paragraphs presented. Worth the look, but be sure to look before you buy.	2004-11-17
452880:US	50389232	R1PWU9ATTIAD4P	0764570781	250081595	Beginning Web Programming with HTML, XHTML, and CSS (Wrox Beginning Guides)	Books	4	27	29	N	N	Solid introduction to web front-end programming	I really like O'Reilly's Dynamic HTML, but this book is good as well. This book is more of a step-by-step walkthrough of HTML, through XHTML, CSS, layout and at the end an introduction to Javascript. The text is somewhat terse, but it's workable. Screenshots are somewhat heavy, but you would expect that in a book about a visual medium like the web. Some coverage, like Javascript, is a little too light to be genuinely complete in comparison with books like Dynamic HTML. Overall, a solid introduction to HTML, XHTML and CSS.	2004-11-17

Mainly this involves putting a new 'skin' on the browser by using customized graphics, like sheet metal, or custom buttons. There is one chapter on securing the browser from visiting certain sites. If you have an interest in using the software on the CD to build custom web browsers for PC then this book is for you.	2004-11-17

The form is a step-by-step walkthrough of each function. Each page is cut in half with text on one side explaining the screenshots on the other side of the page. The chapters go through each function from managing contacts, using the calendar, reading and writing email, to surfing the web and synchronizing with your Mac or Windows box. This is very thorough and up-to-date book for Palm users who like the step-by-step approach that is thick with screenshots.	2004-11-17

The format of the visual quick start guide series is two have two columns on what is already a fairly thin page. One column is explanation for the screenshot on the other side. That works great for learning about Powerpoint but isn't so great for basic C, which is mainly text. The screenshots just waste space and the code in the explanation side has to be so compressed that it is very tough to follow. <br /> <br />As an alternative you should try O'Reilly's Practical C, or Bruce Eckel's Thinking in C++.	2004-11-17

You would think that it is about formatting resumes and other business documents, as the title would imply. But the book is really a very basic introduction to Word that walks you through the menus and dialogs. Business documents are created but little or not time is spent on the form of the documents. Which is sad because all too often the form of resumes speak more about the technical competency of the individual than the content of the resume itself. <br /> <br />The book covers Word from the basics of using the mouse through to creating, formatting, and printing documents. There is some relatively advanced coverage of templates, which is surprising in this context. But overall the book covers just the very basics of Word in a screenshot heavy step-by-step manner. <br /> <br />As long as you know that you are getting a short beginners guide to Word you won't be disappointed.	2004-11-17

In particular the coverage of File Sharing between Macs, from Mac to PC, and over file sharing networks, is in-depth and excellent. Problem is that it's too short. If this is volume one I think they should have written volume two and put it in this book as well. The book just doesn't stand up to one of O'Reilly's in-depth Mac OSX books like Mac OS X in a Nutshell. That book doesn't cover specific topics, like File Sharing, in as much depth, but it does cover all of OS X and not just a small section like this book.	2004-11-17

Not just for myself, I wish people that designed some of these horrible documents and web sites would read this book. There is really practical advice to make good looking documents and sites. Not too flashy. Not too extreme. But solid, practical design that is far better than \\"doesn't suck\\". <br /> <br />Most of the book is set up so that one page shows what you shouldn't do and why, and the other page on the opposite side shows what you should do. This is a very effective way of presenting design material. <br /> <br />There is some reference material at the end of the book on the basics of typography and layout which should round out your practical design education. <br /> <br />Definitely a must buy. If only for the sake of the rest of us that have to look at your sites and documents!	2004-11-17

The new controls are covered in depth, as are portals and personalization. Themes and skins are given their own chapter. The book is code and screenshot heavy. Exposition is kept to the bare minimum and sometimes less. The material is also terse and advanced enough to only be suitable for those who are familiar with ASP.NET 1.0.	2004-11-17

It starts with the basics of surfing the web (using IE), but then continues on to cover advanced use of Google, email, stopping spam, instant messaging, videoconferencing, and even blogging. The coverage is terse and graphics intensive. Each of the 100 items is covered by two glossy color pages rich with screen shots with hilighting arrows and circles. Some topics, like web browsing, are covered by many items, while others, like blogging, only one or two. The technique is effective and appealing, and lends some excitement to learning about practical use of the Internet.	2004-11-17

Many screenshots are shown with arrows to the relevant buttons  and controls. The content is pretty rudimentary; start a new file, pick a theme, create some slides with some transitions. There are some pointers to places on the web were you can find out how to make more effective presentations, but in general the book focuses on the technical how more than how an effective presentation is put together. A solid starting point for very beginning Powerpoint users.	2004-11-17

Client code comes in a number of languages; C/C++, Java and Perl. The text is well written and very easy to follow. My only complaints are the graphics are used a little too sparingly. And I would have like to have seen more emphasis on LDAP policy, as opposed to the straight technical information presented. <br /> <br />Minor complaints aside, this is an excellent introduction to OpenLDAP for IT engineers looking to deploy it.	2004-11-12

You can go old school and get information on Mame games and building your own arcade machine. It covers portable with information on PDA games, hacking your Gameboy, and installing a PS2 in your car. It talks about the online world with combat strategies, how to game the systems to make money, and how to find and avoid cheaters. It's got great advice on how to build high end gaming PCs. Consoles are covered as well. He talks about overclocking them and chipping them to play import games. And that's just a sample. <br /> <br />Were this any other type of book I would say that the coverage is unfocused because it's too broad. But it's a Hacks book and these are intended for people with a clue to give them material on a wider range of topics. It starts you off and expects that you will run with it. For example, you get a lot of information about how to create a home arcade machine with Mame, but you won't get the detailed construction plans. <br /> <br />The text is well written, though he does tend to use the gamer lingo, so you may need a translator if you aren't up to the minute. Certainly the best book I have seen for people who want to push their gaming experience beyond what you can get out of the box from Electronics Boutique.	2004-11-12

The book is fairly simple in form. The first chapter is an introductory level discussion of message queueing with effective illustrations. The second chapter covers the .NET API for messaging with C#. The third chapter covers administration of the message queue. These three chapters are really the heart of the book. The final chapters cover advanced topics like transactions and triggers. MSMQ 3.0 is also covered. <br /> <br />The book is well written and makes good use of graphics to explain concepts like message flow and state management. A very good, very tight book.	2004-11-10

I'd read two head first before this one and I was impressed with those so I took a look and now, not only is it clear how they approached the topic, it's also clear to me that this is the best way to learn design patterns. <br /> <br />The Gang of Four book laid out the basics. Here is the pattern, here are some examples. The head first book goes a lot further. They show you good and bad examples of the pattern. They give solid reasoning behind the pattern. It's great.  <br /> <br />There are times when I would look at a piece of code and have the author explain to me that it was based on one of the GoF patterns. I would come away thinking, if that's the pattern, then that pattern sucks. It's clear that patterns can be misapplied. So understanding the the how design patterns are applied, and how they are commonly applied wrongly, or to an extreme, is just as important as understanding the basic mechanics of the pattern itself. <br /> <br />The example code is in Java, but I think this is an ideal book for anyone passionate about patterns.	2004-11-10

Books	3	62	66	N	N	Introduction for beginners, has technical flaws	I'd like to recommend this book because there is a lot going for it. The text is readable. The illustrations and screenshots are well done. And the book presents a nice learning curve from beginner to reasonably high level concepts. But the book has some technical flaws that other beginning PHP books do not. An example is the authors use of SQL, a primary feature of this type of book, which is implemented using string concatenation. This type of SQL is not only inefficient, it's also prone to SQL injection attacks which means that any code based on this book will have serious security issues. <br /> <br />There are some very good parts, however. The chapter that introduces relational databases is very well done. <br /> <br />I recommend O'Reilly's Learning PHP 5 as an alternative to this book.	2004-11-10

About half the book is spent on the front end with excellent chapters on JSP 2.0, JSTL, Servlets and front-end security. <br /> <br />Attention is also paid to the back end. Chapter 11, which weighs in at 50 pages out of 900, is on EJBs and the various O/R mapping and persistence objects. The back end coverage then continues on with chapters on messaging, XML processing, and web services. <br /> <br />This is not an all-in-one book. The coverage, with perhaps the exception of the front end, is not thorough enough to replace a full book on any one of these topics. In particular the chapter on persistence is far too brief for any thorough explanation of the topic. That being said this does act as a solid field guide to provide an end-to-end view of the landscape of J2EE development.	2004-11-10

It's important to know what you are getting is a book on HLA because the back cover says, \\"The most comprehensive guide to assembly language\\". Which is both hyperbole and factually slightly inaccurate. It's a very, very good book on an assembly language (HLA), but not all assembly languages. Nor should I think there would be a good book that covered all assembly languages, but that's beside the point. <br /> <br />There is some general value in the book that applies to almost any processor. The basics of registers, operations, pointers, the stack and other basics. But as you get deeper into the book it's clear that this is a work on HLA and HLA alone.	2004-11-10

It goes from application architecture basics through twenty-one chapters on using various APIs and services (with one on installation) to end on clustering and failover. Graphics are used quite heavily, often showing page by page use of various Wizards. <br /> <br />Where the book excels is in it's explanation of the various XML descriptor standards required to register web services, or message queues, or various other system services. Often these things are opaque mojo and the author demystifies these files and shows exactly where modifications need to be made. <br /> <br />The code samples are relatively short, just enough to flesh out the topic. <br /> <br />This is more a field guide than an indefensible reference work. The chapters are too brief and the coverage too scanty to be an in-depth treatise on any one topic.  As long as you understand this you won't be disappointed.	2004-11-10

There are a few sections, mostly at the end, which are specific to e-commerce. These include the order processing pipeline chapter and the credit card transactions chapter. <br /> <br />This is not to say the book is bad. It's very well written and the code is described step-by-step in detail. There could have been more emphasis on architecture, and a little more on e-commerce. I would also like to see some emphasis on the sticky legal issues like customer data management, password security, transaction security, and how and when to migrate the data off of the machines on the open Internet and back into safe storage on the Intranet.	2004-11-10

It's invaluable. Both the hardware and software (for PC and Mac) are covered in depth here. There is coverage of the basics; turning on and off lights, using control boxes and timers, and using a PC as your control hub. But, as with the other Hacks books there are other more esoteric topics as well. Such as heating your toilet seat, managing your sprinkler system, and using X10 for security. An excellent book. A must buy for X10 users.	2004-11-10

Instead of provided quick fixes for spam the author instead provides long term strategies to help you manage your email, fight spam and defeat viruses. In reality, there are no quick fixes. And people looking for them, both in the software world, and in this book, will be disappointed. <br /> <br />The book spends most of it's 320 pages on mail, both managing it and fighting spam. Managing mail is extremely important. Many of us live on mail but don't spend the time organizing it and creating a workflow to manage it. This book gives you those organizing skills by presenting the sage advice that took many of us years to learn. <br /> <br />The spam fighting material is also excellent. He starts by laying down basic spam fighting procedures (obscuring your address, having throwaway addresses, etc.) then adds on various products and services that will help you. <br /> <br />The virus section is relatively small in comparison to the spam coverage, but that fits it's relation to the problem. You can stop and defeat viruses, but email and spam is something that you have to handle on a daily basis. <br /> <br />For those looking for a quick fix set of solutions, this is not your book, but you don't have the right approach to the problem in the first place. For those willing to learn skills that will allow you to manage email successfully this is a fine place to start.	2004-11-10

As opposed to the usual code fragments glued together with the necessary minimum of expository text, this book takes it's time to explain topics in detail. It's clear that in it's third revision the author has learned how to teach the Java network APIs. <br /> <br />Topics covered include both client and server code with sockets and UDP, non-blocking I/O, and protocol and content handlers, as well as many others. This is very in-depth, very well written with effective use of graphics. And better yet you will learn about the protocols themselves as well as the APIs. <br /> <br />This is an outstanding book, easily the best book, on the Java network APIs.	2004-11-10

I personally find this high level approach refreshing, and I doubt anyone looking to set up wireless WANs would disagree as the problems are more in the design, signal propagation, spectrum planning and service provisioning. And these are the topic areas where the book excels.	2004-11-10

It's a comprehensive and powerful application that has a user interface that only a mother could love. That's why I found this book so critical. It's an end-to-end guide from the very basics of DVD construction through to using templates and building custom transitions. There are also pitstops along the way into building DVD games and creating easter eggs. <br /> <br />As with O'Reilly's other book on DVD construction, Adobe Encore DVD, one of the other benefits of the book is the content ideas that it gives you. Though I found the examples in this book slightly less appealing than those in the Encore book. <br /> <br />Very well written with appropriate, not overwhelming, use of screenshots and illustrations. This is a must have for DVD Studio Pro users.	2004-11-10

While the others cover offbeat issues around a topic this one offers straightforward solutions to every day problems. These including flashing your BIOS, adding more RAM or more power, dual booting and managing partitions. There are a few advanced topics thrown in, like overclocking and hacking startup performance. <br /> <br />This distinction is relevant because I fear some buyers may not buy the book because the Hacks books are generally geared towards professionals. Not so in this case. I think this book is a practical purchase for anyone looking for DIY maintenance on a PC. <br /> <br />If you are looking to build a new PC then be sure to check out O'Reilly's \\"Building the Perfect PC\\".	2004-11-10

It starts with a basic introduction to the field. He then goes into installing and using the Machinimation application that you will use to choreograph your film. <br /> <br />The book then follows the path of increasing complexity, starting with moving lights around, then adding actors, animating the actors, controlling the characters and adding visual effects. He then continues all the way through to capturing the video and audio and completing the filmmaking process. <br /> <br />One of the best chapters is the section of cinematography where the author strays from the introductory form to give practical advice about how to make a better film. The chapter on character development is also excellent, showing the development of a character from rough sketches to a full three dimensional model. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book. It was a well written introduction to a whole new field of artistic expression. Definitely a must buy for those interested in the field. Those who are curious may want to browse it, but won't find enough outside of the strict walkthrough to make it worth the price.	2004-11-09

The value is in the books completeness. If you follow all of the chapters you will have a lean and clean Windows machine. <br /> <br />The form of the book is step-by-step in nature with lots of screenshots (perhaps a few too many) to aid you. The chapters follow from the operating system through the software and into the hardware. Topics covered include uninstalling applications you don't use, organizing your files and Start Bar, killing spam, reducing your mailbox size, backing stuff up, doing a reasonably in-depth security sweep, and physically cleaning your system. Registry cleaning is covered for the brave of heart. <br /> <br />I think this is a must own for Windows users. It seems to me that people upgrade hardware to fix problems that are really just viruses or poorly maintained software. It's understandable because the Windows operating system is complex. But why drop hundreds or thousand on a new machine when you could buy a book like this and learn techniques that can bring the machine you already have back to life.	2004-11-09

From the cover I was worried that this was that type of book. But there is wisdom in the saying \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\". This is a very serious book about both the technical aspects of the job, and the serious non-technical process aspects of the job. As the author says in the first chapter \\"game programming is freaking hard.\\" <br /> <br />There are well written sections on 2D and 3D programming, including an excellent section on basic trigonometry. There is also some good timely material on working within the Windows framework. I would have liked some more material on 3D engines, but that's a minor flaw. <br /> <br />There are two very solid chapters on process and testing. And a very good chapter on techniques that you can use to survive the death march. <br /> <br />Game programming sounds fun and sexy but it's a very tough gig where the odds are stacked against you. Schedules are necessarily tight. Performance concerns are paramount. And the requirements are prone to change as the game play is refined. This means that all three points of the software project (quality, schedule, requirements) are in play. To survive you need knowledge, tools, wisdom, and a little luck. This book provides you with at least three of those four.	2004-11-09

The PHP language introduction at the beginning is a brief seventy pages which sets the tone for the rest of the book; fast and concise. <br /> <br />After the first three chapters that introduce PHP there is an excellent chapter on design patterns. From there he heads into PHP application design in another solid chapter that effectively mixes code and illustrations to demonstrate best practices. <br /> <br />I found some fault in the database chapter that follows. He shows the use of string substitution in building SQL queries. This is never ever a good idea because the database access is slow and more importantly, vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. He fixes it though by showing proper use of replacement operators with the section on PEAR. <br /> <br />The heart of the book, which I believe is the first seven chapters, finishes of with a strong chapter on exception handling. The chapters that follow cover XML, regular expressions, file I/O, and graphics. The regular expressions chapter is very good. <br /> <br />There are chapters on installing and configuring PHP and PEAR. There is also a very good chapter on extending PHP with C. <br /> <br />In the appendices are some reference sections. In particular there is a listing of PEAR modules that is handy, but not particularly well organized. I would have much rather have had the modules organized into groups of related technologies. <br /> <br />There is room for improvement. There could be more illustrations, and the text could use some more exposition. But this is a solid book that will be valuable for PHP programmers looking to flesh out their knowledge of the platform.	2004-11-09

The first part of the book is seven short chapters that introduce the API, and two more on integration and driver support. The second part of the book is a well designed reference section that isn't as graphically well presented as an O'Reilly book, but is as well organized. <br /> <br />The first seven chapters which walk you through the API from basic to advanced use are very well written. The code fragments are small and the illustrations are sparse but used effectively. <br /> <br />This is a solid piece of work. Highly recommended.	2004-11-09

There are chapters covering Wozniak and Jobs that are detailed and up to date. And there are timelines that make it easy to follow the progression of a number of aspects of Apple. This is particularly handy when following the hectic early nineties where Apple was releasing a different set of Macintoshes every couple of months. <br /> <br />However, unlike Cult of Mac, this book is far more dry in style than the company it documents. The point size of the content is almost unreadably small. And the layout is interesting, but not inspired. In particular the timelines which are in almost every chapter are drab. <br /> <br />Downsides aside, if you are a Mac enthusiast and you want to understand the history of the company there is no better source than this.	2004-11-09

The IRC protocol and client side commands are explored in depth. Numerous clients for Window, OS X, and Unix are covered. This basic coverage, which is about two-thirds of the book ends with an excellent chapter on managing channels.  <br /> <br />The advanced chapters cover installing an IRC server, using DCC, and some advanced security issues. <br /> <br />This book sets a comprehensive foundation of knowledge for IRC which is then supplemented by O'Reilly's IRC Hacks book. Beginners looking to get seriously into IRC will want to buy this book. More advanced users will want to look at the coverage of their areas of interest to make sure it's worth the investment.	2004-11-09

It goes from installation, through the C# language, into web forms and control, database access, web services and into advanced topics like caching, security and component building. And all of that is stuffed into a one thousand page frame. <br /> <br />As you can imagine, some of the material is a little short. For example the coverage of C#, which is intended for beginners, is a mere 50 pages. Other sections, like those on web controls, and the references at the end, are well apportioned to the topic. <br /> <br />The database section has significant technical flaws. It uses string construction to inject GET and POST variables into the SQL statement. This is an anti-pattern which can lead to bugs, SQL injection attacks, and poor cache performance. Do not use the SQL construction techniques in this book <br /> <br />The book also overuses screenshots and is light on architectural illustrations. <br /> <br />There are some good parts. The chapter on XML is excellent, as is the one on security. The latter is ironic as the SQL code is vulnerable to injection attacks. <br /> <br />There is some quality reference material at the end of the book, but it is not as well organized as O'Reilly books. <br /> <br />Overall I think this is a reasonable introduction to ASP.NET. You will need other books to fill out the rough spots. But for someone who already knows a language like Java this would be an ideal way to see the corresponding ASP.NET methodology at a high level.	2004-11-08

There are four parts to the book, and the first part, the fundamentals, is over 400 pages of a 1000 page book. Four hundred pages dedicated to teaching programming basics like memory management, file I/O, network I/O, and other basics. These basics are taught outside of SQL server altogether. The author argues that they are required for an understanding of the internals, but I wonder if they could have been moved to the back, or explained in the context of digging into the internals. <br /> <br />In addition there is some repeat coverage with Hendersons other two books. The coverage is still excellent, but one wonders why it needs to be there when people are buying all three books as a set. <br /> <br />For a book on internals there are some chapters that are written still at a very high level. For example the chapter on XML, which while it is a solid chapter, doesn't drill down the way you would expect from a book with this title. <br /> <br />There is some very valuable unique content in this volume. This is why I recommend it. Examples include the sections on the chapter on Data Transformation Services. But then there are some points, like the brief 'Pseudo techie tactics 101' which are funny, but add nothing and just as easily could have been on a website. <br /> <br />Overall, a little unfocused, but still very valuable for those that make a living on SQL Server.	2004-11-08

Particularly when the book is for experts. Unfortunately the WSE coverage is only 18 pages. <br /> <br />That's not a fatal flaw though. There are excellent chapters on general security and cryptography. And chapter 10 on code obfuscation will probably be the only book on IL obfuscation until the rumored Decompiling C# arrives. <br /> <br />The book is well written. The style is terse and to the point. One chapter is very screenshot heavy, but the rest use graphics sparingly and to best effect. <br /> <br />I'd like to see a more focused book on WSE, but in the meantime this is a good book on security topics for Windows in general, and for web services in particular.	2004-11-08

The writing is excellent and the insights are profound. There is little technical detail in the work. But that's not the point. This book is all about having a larger view of technology and it's place in our culture and how it is changing us. <br /> <br />If technology is a lifelong passion for you, then you will want to have a look at this. If the computer business is just a day job then you probably won't get anything out of this.	2004-11-08

The chapter on database design is fantastic. The chapter on views is excellent as well. But overall the book veering off topic now and again, which adds to it's girth (760 pages.)  <br /> <br />The book starts with a very solid introduction to stored procedures. As I say, the database design portion of the first part is probably worth the price of admission on it's own. <br /> <br />Part two is titled objects, which is a little deceptive since the chapter mainly covers functions, triggers, stored procedures and other structural elements. <br /> <br />Part three is where the book gets into XML and HTML. There is some introductory material on XML and XSL which is too brief to be a complete introduction for someone. That material is better presented in other books. But the material on XML queries direct to the SQL server is unique and valuable. <br /> <br />Part four on advanced topics has some good chapters. In particular the section on query optimization is well done and serves as a good introduction to the topic. But this part is where the book veers off course and into topics like testing, refactoring, XP, and an introduction to the .NET framework and C#. It's all interesting, but it's covered better in other books and the book overall could be shorter and more focused were it not for these sections. <br /> <br />Another downside is that Illustrations are a little underused. But the downsides aside, this is a great book, specifically for the first two parts including the excellent section on database design.	2004-11-08

An example is the books coverage of hierarchies. This type of data structure appears reasonably often in practice, but few books or courses cover querying hierarchies in SQL in an efficient manner. This book gives them the respect they deserve. <br /> <br />Other sticky topics include the ins and out of the SELECT statement, which is covered in depth. As well as an excellent section on triggers and transactions. <br /> <br />The transactions chapter is interesting because it is the only time the book goes into an introductory mode. Most of the book is at the expert level. No time is spent introducing the language or it's syntax. But the transaction chapter does spend some time on the basics. <br /> <br />There are some downsides. Some chapters are completely dominated by code with little explanatory text or annotations. And the book could have benefited from illustrations, any at all. <br /> <br />But the value of the book is in it's ability to pass on guru level techniques that will save you weeks of pain in routing out and fixing performance trouble spots. It's in this way that the book is worth every penny to the working SQL Server DBA or Engineer.	2004-11-08

It's an exploration of the world of whitehat and blackhat hackers, the FBI, and well, I really couldn't get through it because the writing wasn't very good. The dialogue in particular was painful to get through. The characters weren't very well developed. I would like to have been able to recommend this book. I think there are some interesting ideas in there, but they are just too far past all of the tough dialogue.	2004-11-08

In fact, I felt like I was reading an outline. Granted, there are code samples and the book covers all of the important basics, like security database access, validating user input and encrypting critical data. <br /> <br />This is good introductory material on the serious security issues that need to be dealt with when you are developing any web application (not just ASP.NET). But the organization, for me, really detracts from the value of the work. <br /> <br />The book is organized into chapters along the high level groups of issues like data security, sessions, and authentication. Then within each chapter there are a set of threats with discussions and example code. Think of it like a cookbook where the definition of the problem is a lot more terse. At the end of each chapter is a check list and a short FAQ section.  <br /> <br />This is not an introductory level book. This is for engineers who understand the ASP.NET framework and are looking for practical advice on how to secure their applications against malicious use.	2004-11-07

This is just like any Lego instructions you will find, but it's not in color, and there is English text to add more material about the reasons behind the design. <br /> <br />In addition there is Mindstorms control code to accompany each chassis design. The programming language is Not Quite C (NQC). Installation instructions for NQC are included as this is a step you will have to take in addition to the standard Mindstorms installation. <br /> <br />The bots range from just a small construction around the RCX control block to designs that are 'gargantuan'. They are as sturdy and well designed as those that you find in the original Mindstorms kit. <br /> <br />I was disappointed that there was not more emphasis placed on describing the program logic. I would have appreciated flow charts as most of the control logic is simple state machines. <br /> <br />Overall I think this would be a fine book for anyone serious about Mindstorms sumo.	2004-11-07

The author starts with the basics of DVDs, then takes you through projects, timelines, menus, links, and into burning DVDs. He also demonstrates how to use Encore in conjunction with other Adobe applications. <br /> <br />I was very impressed with the quality of the book. The illustrations are beautiful and very effective. The text is readable, but doesn't pander like a step by step book. Screenshots aren't used in an overwhelming way. <br /> <br />Given the introductory level of the book I would have liked to have seen a chapter on DVD examples. This would give us some inspiration in what we build and not just cover the how-to aspect. But this is a minor gripe and the book gets along very well without such a chapter.	2004-11-07

The text is built for programmers who already know a language. The type of reader who can handle a fairly terse text that assumes that you know the fundamentals of imperative programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Java, etc.). <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book a lot. The book gave me more credit than a book like Learning Python which starts at the very basics. And for a book of relatively few pages it gets into some cool topics like refactoring, unit tests, and functional programming very quickly. <br /> <br />If you want an introduction to Python that doesn't talk down to you then dive in Python here.	2004-11-07

Applications include protocols like telnet, mail, and the web. This is the heart of the book but there is also some discussion about the basics of networking at the physical layer including routing algorithms and packet structure. <br /> <br />The organization of the book is interesting. It starts with a high level introduction to network, then goes into applications, and ends up with the physical layer. Either way, the text is good, though terse, and the illustrations are excellent. <br /> <br />This textbook makes for a find way to learn the fundamentals of network applications and protocol design.	2004-11-07

In reality only the last chapter is on that topic and the majority of the book is on astronomy through the web and through custom software. As such this is an excellent field guide to desktop astronomy. <br /> <br />Organized like a trip through the solar system and into the universe the book contains multitudes of links and references to points around the web and custom software. The illustrations are primarily screenshots of the software. <br /> <br />Given the content on the book I think more attention could have been paid to organization. The embedding of hundreds of URLs makes the text hard to read. However, that doesn't negate the fact that there a lot of research has gone into making this a comprehensive guide to what is available for computer astronomy.  <br /> <br />Well worth the look for the look for the amateur astronomer or particularly for teachers looking to find online resources for their courses.	2004-11-07

The is book is about database drive web applications using C#. There are two whole chapters on the front end ASP.NET layer using web controls and C#. Not that this is bad, mind you. The text is well written, the organization is fine, the graphics and illustrations are well done.  <br /> <br />The book starts with an analysis of the architecture of an ASP.NET data-driven web application. It then goes into hooking up your pages to a database server, running commands on the server, and getting data from the server onto pages and editing it. Stored procedures are also covered. <br /> <br />Part three of the book was the best part for me. It starts with some practical advice about web application design that will save you a lot of time and frustration. It concludes with a case study that illustrates the real world use of what you have learned in all of the preceding chapters. <br /> <br />This is an excellent walkthrough of the basics of ASP.NET. If you are looking for an introductory material then you should definitely consider this book.	2004-11-07

Taking what was already an excellent first edition and growing it by 50%. He has updated all of the original chapters, the language walkthrough and the library reference. <br /> <br />Like most language books Programming Ruby starts with installing Ruby and then goes into a language reference; strings, classes, blocks, regular expressions, etc. It's all covered step by step with examples.  The second part, Ruby and It's World, is a grab bag of chapters on more complex Ruby topics like graphical user interfaces, Ruby GEMs, and embedding Ruby. <br /> <br />Part III is a concise reference for Ruby that is handy when you already know the language but need a refresher. And the final part is a library reference with examples of using each method. This is the invaluable reference that you will use in every Ruby project. <br /> <br />This is the book to buy to learn Ruby, and to use as a desk reference.

Each chapter covers a particular phase of his work experience and wraps up with some key takeaways. <br /> <br />Anyone who has been in the software industry for a while will find a lot to laugh and cringe about in this book. Personally I found the anecdotes informative and the condensed takeaways at the end very appropriate. <br /> <br />Behind all of the comedy Bill preaches the core principles of respect for yourself and your profession, and emphasizes professionalism.

The text imparts a solid understanding of not only how to build a PC, but also why you have to do certain things, and what choices you will have to make. There are full color illustrations that show you step-by-step how to physically construct the PC and connect all of the components together. These images are integrated into the text so that they fit directly with the explanatory text. <br /> <br />I also appreciate that the book takes an opinion. It gives you solid advice about what video cards to pick, how to choose a monitor, and other important decisions. Building a quality PC is as much about the components you choose as how you put it together and this book helps you with those decisions. <br /> <br />This is an excellent resource for those looking to put together their own machine.

The book is laid out like a thick hard-covered version of Wired magazine. Thick with pictures and clever layout, with relatively sparse text. <br /> <br />There is a little something to love for almost any fringe Macintosh group or phenomenon. There is a section on tattoos, Apple wear, the iPod, the Newton. Another small section links the Mac to pot. And a very cool section shows prototype Macintoshs of the future designed by enthusiasts. Another interesting section analyses Macintoshes in movies and tv, where the good guy is always Mac and the bad guy always uses a PC. <br /> <br />This is not a serious history of the development of the Macintosh. Other books have covered that. The book rarely gets deep into issues. It's about a phenomenon. About defining the phenomenon and rallying behind it, as opposed to decomposing it. It's a fun, self-validating read for Mac lovers. <br /> <br />This would make a perfect Christmas gift for your favorite Mac enthusiast. And it may make a good read for any Windows lover who is puzzled by the cult-like Mac owners.	2004-11-07

This book almost takes it a little too far. In particular I found the authors fifteen page step-by-step instruction on building a car console mount for an iPod. The other hacks are a bit more practical; using an iPod with Linux, streaming audio to an iPod, reading text on an iPod, replacing an iPod battery or using the iPod as a voice recording. <br /> <br />It's not just about the iPod. The book also has 50 hacks for iTunes. Including fun ones like putting album covers on your desktop, using the visualizer as a screen saver, and scripting iTunes with Applescript. <br /> <br />Despite the fifteen pages on building an iPod console the book is well worth the money for experienced hackers who want cool ideas for iTunes and the iPod.	2004-11-07

You have to understand how a machine operates to understand how you can get yourself out of trouble if you have a problem that you don't understand. Particularly when you are using a systems language like C, C++ or assembler. <br /> <br />This book provides an in-depth understanding of the working of a CPU.

This book is targeted at systems level programmers who need to understand the machine in order to make the best use of it. <br /> <br />Given that many programmers start by learning Java, and learn C as their low level language, I can see there being a good market for this book. If you are working on a large C or C++ application, or are writing C libraries for Java, and you don't understand the basics (memory management, stacks, bit shifting, assembler opcodes, etc.) you should get this book.	2004-11-07

It's an excellent and well thought out work that remains a classic in the industry.<br /><br />There are nine sections that start with an introduction to network then follow the network from the cable through to the applications (e.g. telnet, mail, etc.) and into security. This fourth edition is very current and covers the wide variety of wired and wireless networking mechanisms.<br /><br />This is text book so each chapter ends with a set of questions that test your knowledge of the chapter. Whether or not you intend to use it as a textbook this is must-have content for those whose career is networking.	2004-11-07

There are eight chapters, each covering a different malicious software or activity.  <br /> <br />The first three chapters cover the stuff you will encounter the most often; spam, spyware and viruses. These chapters together make up the majority of the book and are the heart of the content. <br /> <br />After that the book goes into scams and then inverts coverage from the malicious stuff done against the average Internet user to covering hacking and fighting the hacking. <br /> <br />This is not a for-dummies book. The content is designed for people of reasonable technical expertise. And the design of the book is a short overview to get you started on securing your computer and yourself on the Internet. This book is an excellent way to get started, but from there you will have to guide yourself or make purchases of books that provide more in-depth coverage of specific topics, like security a Windows box.	2004-11-07

The text is pretty terse and there are a surprising number of a screenshots for a book so small. The book starts with an introduction to testing. It then gives a high level architectural overview of JUnit, along with it's API. There is a short digression into the history of the framework. Then it's into putting a front-end on the tests both on the command line and embedded into IDEs.	2004-11-07

This is a good one but I would like to see more emphasis on this area with even better books. <br /> <br />The book is organized into chapters based on various roles and functions within and organization. Then within each chapter there are various ethical dilemmas which are discussed. The dilemmas is defined, then both liberal and conservative takes on the matter are described and the item is closed with an explicit stance on the issue. <br /> <br />This issues discussed are wide ranging, from storing personal files on work machines, to whether a workplace affair can be tolerated. This wide ranging discussion is one of the problems I have with the book. If the issues had been more focused on IT concerns then each item could have been covered in more depth. <br /> <br />Another problem with the book is it's layout. I found that the layout of the text and the material distracted from the contents. There was too much formatting. <br /> <br />I liked the book because I found the material compelling. If not the discussions themselves, which were too brief. It stretched my mind to think about these issues and to take input from different sides of the fence. I hope this book will be revised so that it is even more readable and valuable. In the meantime it is still worth the look for those in the IT field with ethics concerns.	2004-11-07

There is a great topic here, and there are some good ideas, but the knowledge is locked in the code. <br /> <br />If you are the type of person that learns by reading code then you will already have learned the APIs by looking at the sample code. The reason we buy technical books is to teach us how to use the APIs through a combination of well annotated example code, well organized reference material for the APIs, and illustrations that demonstrate best practice code flow. This book only has the code and a little explanation, the reference material, and effective illustrations are missing. <br /> <br />I recommend this book only if you can't find any other material on MIDP2.	2004-11-07

Though I was pleasantly surprised at the solid introduction to MySQL that the book gives. In fact it spends the first two thirds of the book on the basics, before getting into optimization and finally programming. <br /> <br />The design aspect of the book is in the third chapter, which is one of the books best. There is some good high level material on the fundamentals of schema design, and then material on relation mapping, and then into it's implementation in MySQL. <br /> <br />There is a lot to like in this book. And I like the fact that someone is finally giving some attention to MySQL, which, if it's not the most advanced database in the world, is probably the most ubiquitous. This is a fine book for anyone who works with MySQL.	2004-11-07

First the author presents a problem, then a set of solutions and a some description of how the solution works. This book has a similar format but the recipes are more small and the explanations more terse. The author expects that you know a lot about the Windows Script Host to start with and are looking for some help here and there to get through common problems. <br /> <br />The value of a recipes book is first in the areas it covers and problems it solves, and is secondarily in what you can learn from the solutions to the problems presented. Since the solutions are so small and the descriptions relatively brief, the value is really in what problems are covered. The sections I found most relevant were file management and 'inside the registry'. Your mileage may vary though, so I would look at the table of contents before making your purchase to ensure that you are getting enough value for your dollar.	2004-11-07

There is an introductory segment at the beginning which has some nice illustrations. After that the book uses a combination of Java code and screenshots to demonstrate eight example uses of web services. The most handy one, in my opinion, is the News Aggegator, which uses web services to retrieve information from sites like Amazon. Then it turns that information into RSS so that you can retrieve it with your news reader. <br /> <br />There is a lot more code than text in this book. If you learn well by looking at code then this book should work for you. This book is a little looser than the O'Reilly standard. There are more screenshots than usual, the UML graphics are not as well done as usual, and the code is not as well annotated. That being said, it's a fun and informative read that finally injects a little reality into the web services hype.	2004-11-07

This book is an excellent introduction to the core concepts and drills down into the processor level mechanics.  <br /> <br />This book is highly architectural in nature. The code is primarily pseudo code (with some C and Assembler) and there are illustrations showing logic flow and the structure of the various example processors. There is some drill down into the construction of some specific processors: StrongARM, IXP, Microegines, among others. But overall you should consider the work an architectural piece which serves as an introduction to a fast moving field. <br /> <br />Comer is known for bringing simplicity to complex topics and he does not fail here. The text is easy to read and follow and the illustrations that accompany the explanations are effective. This is an ideal introduction for those that are new to network processors.	2004-11-07

The book is not about how to improve cell phone cameras, which is what I would have expected. It's a book about the fundamentals of digital photography using cell phones as a starting point. That's an interesting idea. I'm just not sure if there are enough people interested in doing that to successfully market a book. <br /> <br />All that being said, the book is a reasonable introduction to digital photography. It starts with a section on taking the shot and composing the picture, the goes into processing and printing the shot. Then there is a cell phone only section detailing mobile blogging. The final chapter, on projects with your cell phone has some interesting ideas to spark your imagination. <br /> <br />Overall I liked the book, though I found the subject a little quirky. I personally didn't find it all that helpful since I have been into digital photography longer than cell phones have been around and there wasn't much on taking better significantly better camera phone shots. However, if you are looking for a book on digital photography for someone who is new to the whole field and whose only device is a phone, this is probably the right book for you.	2004-11-07

The author takes statistics, quotes and opinions from a variety of sources but ultimate the book is biased against outsourcing. This is a refreshing change from the prevailing pro-outsourcing wisdom of the other books on the subject. <br /> <br />The book is short and well written. The text is funny without going overboard. Charts and graphs are used to illustrate the point where appropriate. <br /> <br />I liked this book a lot. I highly recommend it for software engineers looking for an alternative opinion to the pro-outsourcing movement.	2004-11-07

It covers both legal and illegal aspects of file sharing, primarily of finding music, movies, hacked software and adult entertainment. He covers a variety of file sharing networks and applications. But the primary value of the book is in the experience he impart. The etiquette of file sharing, how to secure your files and avoid the security problems. <br /> <br />The coverage is fairly high level. You won't be getting step-by-step instructions in how to rip DVDs. The topics are covered, but the author generally leaves it to you to navigate all of the features of any particular application. <br /> <br />This book is better than the shoddy cover would imply, but the organization could have used some work. Definitely worth a look for those interested in doing a lot of file sharing.	2004-11-07

The Cuckoo's Egg was an engaging thriller that appealed to even non-technical readers. Spam Kings started out by outlining nine key players, spammers and spam fighters, in the war to control email. <br /> <br />The book does engage for the first chapters as it provides the back story for the two central characters, Shiksaa, the spam-fighter, and Davis Hawke, the spammer. Then as the author takes you through several investigations and prosecution the repetitive form becomes clear. The book ends on a low note as Shiksaa leaves spam fighting, Davis Hawke remains at large, and spam is worse than ever, making up 60% of all emails. <br /> <br />This redundant consistency is a departure away from the formula of an engaging thriller. The formula that the Cuckoo's Egg followed very successfully. This departure is not a good thing, the book is a bit of a slog to get through and resolves somewhat disappointingly. <br /> <br />In addition I often found it difficult to follow conversations between characters. The problem was two-fold in that many of the characters weren't well developed, and both spammer and anti-spammer often spoke with the same abrasive and abusive tone. <br /> <br />There is an epilogue that covers the development of the characters into the present. I would have appreciated some information on this section about new developments in spam and spam-fighting. <br /> <br />The book is reasonably well written and would likely be of interest to anyone deeply involved in spam fighting. For those looking for a good technical thriller you will want to look elsewhere.	2004-11-07

Not only is the content of the book an excellent introduction to InDesign, the book itself is also wellspring of layout ideas. It gives you some perspective on what can be done with InDesign as the book itself is laid out with the tool. <br /> <br />This is not a course book with questions at the end of each chapter. It's a introductory book that starts with the basics of creating documents, and finishes with the management of large documents, like books. Chapters include text layout, importing graphics, using transparency. The full spectrum of what's available to you in the application is described in full color with illustrative examples. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book. It gets my full recommendation for users of InDesign.	2004-11-07

It's a series book so it only works if you have read the previous books. As with the others this book is a prequel to the original books. The thrust of the series is to provide back story on the various factions in the original book; Fremen, Bene Gesserit, Guild, Mentats, Corrino, Atriedes, Harkonnen, etc. This book does not fail there. I found the Guild the most interesting, but that's just my own opinion. <br /> <br />The stories are woven into a fairly uneven story about the destruction of the machine worlds. It's divided into to parts, each with an independent climax that, in both cases, neglects some of the characters almost completely. <br /> <br />It's easy to see how this book is drawing parallels to our present situation. In particular the Bush administrations war in Iraq. That's an interesting, if simplistic, side of the book. <br /> <br />The entire series of Brian Herbert Dune books is written very different from the original Dune masterpiece. The language is less sharp, the characters less cleanly drawn and more two-dimensional.  <br /> <br />These are fun light reads though, particularly for those Dune addicts out there who can't get enough of seeing the names of their favorite houses n print.	2004-11-07

It was interesting to see how a threat could be evaluated, but I spent most of my time reading the initial threats portion at the beginning of each chapter. These were interesting enough. <br /> <br />The text is a little uneven, which is most likely from the multiple authors. The graphics are poor quality. And the organization could use some work. <br /> <br />I would have liked to have been inspired to appreciate the characterization portions of the book, but I was not moved to do so.	2004-11-07

It covers an amazing variety of XML standards. From the fundamentals of XML, through the document standards, and into transformation technologies like XSLT. Standards include; XML, XPath, XLink, XSLT, XSL-FO, XML Schema, DTDs, among others. The book also cover some standards that use XML, like SAX and DOM. <br /> <br />The book is fairly high level. It assumes that you know the basics and need a complete reference for the technologies. This is that case with all of the Nutshell books, but given the amount of technologies this books cover, the coverage is fairly terse. <br /> <br />The organization of the book is great. There are only a few illustrations and they are used effectively. A solid reference for anyone who works with XML technologies on a daily basis. Highly recommended.	2004-11-07

The heart of the book is the four hundred pages of statement reference. Each statement is described with it's syntax and options. Then the support for each database (DB2, MySQL, Oracle, PostgresSQL, and SQL Server) is described in detail. There is a similar 120 page reference on SQL functions. <br /> <br />This is classic O'Reilly. The text is well written, and the book is very dense and well organized. There is a little introductory material but the heart of the book is the statement and function reference. You will get the most out of this book if you already have a reasonable understanding of SQL. This is not a book for beginners. <br /> <br />This would make an ideal desktop reference, particularly for someone working in a cross-platform environment that goes directly to the SQL.	2004-11-07

The book is very small, cleverly designed with good use of graphics. It's well written and covers everything from the basics, to choosing headphones, to extending your iPod with jackets, external speakers, the whole bit.

It covers, very briefly, topics from the construction of the average camera, through the basic settings, and recommendation on composing pictures. <br /> <br />It's in the advice on composition and taking good pictures where I think the book really shines. He has advice on taking portraits, sports shots, scenery shots, wedding pictures and other types of pictures. <br /> <br />I can see two good reasons to buy this book. The first is to give it as a gift. The second is to tuck along on trips to remind you of how to compose good shots if you aren't a professional photographer.	2004-11-07

This is the shortest and most succinct of them all. The book is organized into chapters around the different types of SWT controls and containers. Then within each chapter the author presents a basic function (e.g. creating a toolbar), then covers how it's done using a combination of explanatory text and a small code fragment. <br /> <br />I'm appreciative of the brevity of the book. It doesn't pander to the reader by going into great detail. It acknowledges what most of us already know which is that a book like this is a starting point to get you working with the basics of SWT, and after that you will use the JavaDoc when you are working on it. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a 'getting started' work on SWT and you are already a competent Java programmer who is familiar with client side development, this is probably the SWT book you are looking for.	2004-11-07

Overall the book is well written and very well illustrated. There are some weakpoints where code samples are overused, but those are few and far between. The standout chapters, like the one fragmentation analysis are worth the price of admission for people looking to use SQL server in large performance critical deployments. <br /> <br />This book should be compared with O'Reilly's equally excellent \\"SQL Tuning\\" book (0596005733). That book is more theoretical in nature, often using equations and graph theory to demonstrate how get the fastest queries. This book is much more practical in nature, often showing screen shots and pointing out directly what is most critical. <br /> <br />It's in the understanding of the reader where this book excels. All too often authors understand the topic but do not understand how to present it. Sajal obviously understands the fine points of the technology, but also understands how to pass on that experience effectively. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone working in an environment where high performance database work is required, and where the database is SQL Server.	2004-10-22

No matter if you want to learn XSLT from scratch, or have a long-term reference for the XSLT syntax. This book is the bible for XSLT users. The original book covered the 1.0 standard. This book extends that to support both 1.0 and 2.0 in the same book. <br /> <br />There are two large pieces to the book. The first piece covers the basics of XSLT, with a tag-by-tag reference to the language, as well as XPath in the same manner. Both of these start with introductions that make it easy for novices to pick up the language. The second piece covers design patterns for templates then brings the whole work together into case study sections. <br /> <br />XSLT is an invaluable tool for anyone who works with XML. Once you understand it you will never want to be without it. This book is the best way to learn XSLT, and the best reference for those who already know XSLT. Period.	2004-10-22

The problem is that the book meanders off topic here and there. Getting deep into basic Dreamweaver features like basic editing, HTML layout, and CSS, well before getting into PHP. It's not until chapter five (page 153) that we really start to get into PHP. <br /> <br />The coverage then goes off topic again after the introduction to PHP, to get into writing Dreamweaver extensions. Which while interesting, is probably not what the reader was expecting from the title of the book. <br /> <br />It's hard to compare this book with a straight PHP web development book because the PHP coverage is from the Dreamweaver GUI perspective, where you can use the server behaviors features to drag-n-drop fields onto the page. <br /> <br />For those looking for a soup to nuts book that covers using Dreamweaver to build dynamic PHP pages, you have found your book. For those looking for coverage of the PHP specific features of Dreamweaver, this book is worth the look. If you are looking for a reference or introduction to PHP, this is not the book you want.	2004-10-22

It's clear the author knows a great deal about Plone and he knows how to convey it in a clear and concise manner. <br /> <br />I find fault in the structure of a book for covering the how of a topic almost exclusively with no time given to talking about why we should be doing something. But few tech readers hold authors to that standard, so i really can't mark the book down for that. On a specific note I would have preferred if some of the graphics had been scaled down and overall normalized across the entire book, it's not something that detracts from the value of the book as a resource. So I can't mark it down for that. <br /> <br />All of the core concepts are covered, page design, session management, security, customizations, even writing your own products.  <br /> <br />A singular resource for anyone developing on, or deploying Plone. Highly recommended.	2004-10-22

It's organized in the cookbook format popularized by O'Reilly's Perl Cookbook. This means that each chapter contains a set of recipes that start with a problem and then walk you through a set of solutions that you can pick from. <br /> <br />An example would be 12.25, \\"Retrieving an Address Book Recipient\\". The second first fleshes out the problem. Then provides the code for the solution. That is followed by a discussion session where the design behind the solution and the code that implements the solution is described in more detail. <br /> <br />This format has several advantages. First, you have a handy long-term reference for solving problems in an environment you may not use every day. Second, by reading through the problems and their solutions you can infer solutions to related problems that may not be directly covered in the book. So the book becomes a practical way to expand your knowledge of WSH by learning pragmatic best practice solutions to everyday problems. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this book to Windows Script Host users.	2004-10-22

The other was Addison Wesley's book \\"SWT: The Standard Widget Toolkit\\", which is in the Eclipse series. That was a short book that flew through the topic. This is a much more in-depth work. <br /> <br />Both books share the same introductory style. They walk through the toolkit from front-to-back and demonstrate each concept and widget by showing code and screen shots. Each book suffers from the same long term problem in that it cannot be used as reference material since neither book provides an appendix that would serve that purpose. <br /> <br />That being said, I still prefer this book because it is much more in-depth and presents a shallower longer learning curve than the Addison-Wesley book.	2004-10-22

It makes effective use of illustrations to illustrate tricky concepts like RAID striping, SCSI protocols, and the black magic of fiber-optic cables. What worked for me was that this book doesn't pander. It doesn't give a step-by-step walkthrough with screenshots. It gives you an overall view of the field and enough knowledge of terms and concepts so that you can understand vendors offerings yourself and make informed choices. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to IT professionals looking to design and build high performance storage solutions.	2004-10-22

There is a little information on installation and the basics, but after that it's a well organized reference for all of the functions, keywords, special variables and other important features of Perl. There are no illustrations and the text is terse and concise. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to any reasonably experience Perl programmer as a handy desk reference. Though I would also look at O'Reilly's excellent Perl in a Nutshell book. This is not a book for someone who is unfamiliar with Perl. For the beginner I recommend Larry Wall's Programming Perl.	2004-10-19

He covers the topic of outsourcing, as he did in Rise and Fall, but this time in a much more succinct and directed manner. This is a much shorter book, but the text is more focused and he makes his points effectively with minimal use of illustrations. <br /> <br />You may not like his conclusions, but he provides a complete and pragmatic analysis of outsourcing. There is advice for both individuals and companies in how to compete effectively in the global marketplace. <br /> <br />If software engineering is your career and your passion then you need to read this book.	2004-10-15

This book turns that around. It provides practical insight at the code level in how to improve code structure using patterns. What's more it provides these insights on existing code bases. Most of us don't start projects, we extend existing projects. This book tells us how to refactor this existing code in practical ways that will end up making the code more maintainable and reliable. <br /> <br />I can't hold the GoF responsible for the architectural bias in patterns. The original Design Patterns book was very practical in nature. Design patterns just had better penetration in the architecture world. With this book Kerievsky brings patterns back to the front line implementers. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for any software engineer. Thank you Joshua! Great job.	2004-10-13

This is fascinating book that provides an overview of all of the different hardware and software techniques in the 3D user interface world. And it does a very capable job of using a combination of images and text to describe the technologies. It's academic in two regards; first, it's written like a paper, and second that it has little in terms of practical implementation. <br /> <br />Frankly I doubt you could go far beyond the academic in an overview of a field that is this broad and this early in it's development. What this book does do is provide some real incentive to enthusiasts and developers to evaluate and combine these technologies. I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who is in the field or has an interest in it.	2004-10-13

It's contains the type of practical and pragmatic advice that gets applications off the ground, and effectively defuses the rocket that propels architecture astronauts. Like Effective C++ before it this book has a collection of practical common sense fragments of advice around the entire application development cycle. I particularly liked the material around SQL and state management, but there is a lot there to like for everyone. <br /> <br />On the downside the book is a little text heavy and it could have used more diagrams and illustrations to make it's points. But that is a minor complaint. This is a valuable book for those interested in shipping applications. If you liked Bitter Java and Bitter EJB you will love this book.	2004-10-13

I'm not usually much on the big tome books. This one is almost 1400 pages, which weighs in at 5 pounds on my bathroom scale. That being said, the text is really tight, the illustrations are cropped, not overwhelming in number, and are used effectively. And the book on the whole does not pander to the reader. The topics are also covered at a reasonable depth. <br /> <br />The book is essentially three books, one on the compact framework, one on WinForms and one on database access, all in one book, in a well integrated form. And it works. If you need a book that is an end-to-end introduction to .NET on small devices, this is a great book to try.	2004-10-13

Code samples are few and far between, and the illustrations are primarily UML. That's not a bad thing, it's just a matter of what you are looking for. Though even for an architecture work I would like to see a little more code (thus the four stars instead of five.) <br /> <br />The book starts with XML basics, then spends the largest portion of the book on SOAP and JAX-RPC, then finishes off with an excellent chapter on security issues. There is some mention of mobile, but nothing in depth. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to Java architects who want to learn more about this topic. Front line engineers will probably want to concentrate on API centric books on Java Web Services, most likely from O'Reilly.	2004-10-13

It starts with installation and goes through the windowing model, the event model, and the entire toolkit in an introductory manner, covering each topic in depth with example code an illustrations. It's not a reference book, it's a walkthrough the toolkit. <br /> <br />The book is well organized, code isn't overused and illustrations are used effectively. The lack of a reference portion is the only fault that I can find with the book. Once you have read it you are done, there is no reason to return for a quick reference. Most similar books have a reference section in the appendix. <br /> <br />If you are looking to use the SWT, or you want to evaluate it, then this is a solid introduction to the toolkit.	2004-10-13

Screenshots are kept to a minimum and used effectively. UML diagrams are used to explain object relationships. The code samples are kept reasonably small. And the content of the FAQs themselves cover relevant and important issues. For those looking to use Eclipse as a development platform, or extend Eclipse with plugins this book is definitely worth the look.	2004-10-13

It starts with the OS itself, then going into all of the standard applications. It finishes by covering some extensions that you can add to speed up your workflow. The coverage of each application is relatively light because the author expects that you are already familiar with the basics and are ready for some power user tips. <br /> <br />Illustrations are kept to a reasonable amount, usually one for every couple of pages, and they are used effectively. The text is a little too jovial for my taste. But it's not distracting and it's a matter of taste. <br /> <br />If a Macintosh is your primary work or play computer then you will probably find something in here to help you out. Whether it's worth the money or not depends on how much you find out, so I would take a look at this book in person, or at least browse the table of contents before you buy.	2004-10-13

They were the thin adjunct books that accompanied Numerical Recipes which showed the examples implemented in various languages. The books were no good on their own, you needed Numerical Recipes to understand them. This book has the same problem. It doesn't introduce the patterns from scratch, it assumes that you have read the GoF book and that you can use it as the base source material. <br /> <br />That being said the author puts together, succinctly, with both diagrams and code, C# examples for all of the GoF design patterns. Even though in some cases there is very little code because the patterns have been integrated into the structure of the .NET framework. <br /> <br />I think this book is worth a look for anyone writing C# on a daily basis and who is a patterns fan. It's something you need to evaluate before you buy because, frankly, you may already know most of what you are going to see.	2004-10-13

The book does not cover back-end features beyond the data binding. It walks through the front end, talking about the different control types in the first part of the book, and the page logic in the last half of the book. The text is very readable, but often it is overwhelmed by the graphics and code. I also wish the book spent some appendices on a reference portion that could be used after I was finished with the walkthrough style introduction. <br /> <br />This book is for professionals. It's not a step by step style walkthrough. It's apparent that the authors intended the reader to have some reasonably solid ASP.NET chops already. <br /> <br />I'm happy to see the front end of ASP.NET sites getting the respect of a whole book on the topic. It certainly deserves it.	2004-10-13

That's what I like so much about this book. It doesn't just show you the code so that you can copy and paste it to make that exact effect. It explains each step of the code so that you learn more about the Flash platform in general. You can then use that knowledge and apply it to completely different effects. <br /> <br />The book starts with a variety of different effects and then ends with some information on Flash forms, which seems somewhat out of place. The text is clear and well written, and although there are lots of illustrations, that comes with the territory. <br /> <br />Anyone making a living out of Flash will want to have a look at this to see what they can learn from it.	2004-10-13

It's primarily focused on use of the interface builder and how that maps to the back-end Objective-C objects. The text is light and easy to read, and screenshots are used effectively. There are also some diagrams to demonstrate the relationships between objects at runtime. <br /> <br />I appreciated the walkthrough, but I would have preferred a reference section that provided an overview of the Cocoa APIs. That would make it valuable after you have gone through the walkthrough.	2004-10-13

The bulk of the book is in the dictionary of terms which is organized alphabetically. Each one is described using both a text definition and a notational graphic, and often an example. There is a section on the different types of views at the front of the book.	2004-10-13

It's an interesting read that is focused on that group of folks who aren't engineers, but love to tweak their desktop with custom styles, and make use of fun features like opacity. None of these things are workflow critical, but they are fun anyway. <br /> <br />If you are someone who loves to mod then this is great starting point for you. It's well written and does a capable job walking you through each mod so that you don't break your system in the midst of your play.	2004-10-13

The topic is really great. But the book itself relies too much on screenshots and code fragments to carry the weight of the topic. That's a great way to present information, but not a great way to teach the topic. The text is adequate to hold it all together, but frankly I think the topic deserves a little more. I think this is the only book out there on the topic, and it's good enough to get you through. So if you are actively looking to build a plugin you may want to stop by your local bookstore to give this a look see.	2004-10-13

It's still unclear to me how the software product lines in this book are distinguished simply from the products themselves. There is more emphasis on reuse and this appears to be the key distinguishing characteristic. But even with the book just focusing on a singly product this is a valuable work showing the use of techniques of Object Oriented Analysis and Design using UML. The book is a solid piece of work (both physically and in content), though there is a bias towards illustrations as opposed to explanatory text. Software architects should evaluate the book in person. Front line software engineers probably won't find much they can apply to their work.	2004-10-13

It covers a lot of ground without going too deep on any one topic. As such I think it has benefit for those that want to see what's available. Fully a quarter of the book is spent in the appendices, specifically on in-depth coverage of NAnt tasks, which is one of the best parts of the book. <br /> <br />I recommend that anyone doing .NET development have a look at this book to see if they can get useful information out of it. It's well written, the code samples are of a manageable size, and graphics are used effectively.	2004-10-13

It starts with an introduction on user interface principles, then in goes into the mechanics of user interface implementation in .NET, then it veers into databases. This is where I thought I was lost, but actually it turns out that it's the anchor for the sections that follow, which show how how databases are linked to the UI and how that is done effectively. In this way I think the book is different than any other technology centric book on .NET user interfaces, which only cover the API portion of the problem. <br /> <br />On the whole I am impressed by this book. I think it takes a fresh look at the entire topic. In addition it's well written and not overly illustrated. It's a unique book, so I recommend a look before you buy, but I certainly recommend the look.	2004-10-13

It's unusual because I would expect to see this type of material for Java. It starts with a technology overview of the web and related technologies. It then goes into Object Oriented Analysis and Design. And finishes off with the implementation of these architectural concepts on the .NET platform. About a third of the book is spent in each area. <br /> <br />I found the overall content wasn't particularly tight and focused, which adds to the books size, which is large for an architectural book. That being said there are a lot of good ideas and the content is well organized. If you are an architect looking to migrate to the .NET platform you should have a look at this book.	2004-10-12

The coverage, which starts with the architecture and ends with deployment, is never comprehensive, but is always thorough enough to get you started. <br /> <br />Graphics are used extensively, which is not appropriate for a reference, but which works here because of the introductory nature of the text. The book doesn't pander though. <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone who is starting with ASP.NET, and who wants an introductory text in the step by step style. If you are experienced in other web application development technologies then you would be better served by one of the O'Reilly ASP.NET reference books.	2004-10-12

It's always been the domain of lower paid 'front end programmers'. But that doesn't mean that it isn't difficult to do it right. This book takes the time to emphasize the patterns of implementation to make a solid web front end. <br /> <br />The book covers the web application page flow of forwarding and maintaining state. It also covers tag libraries, data validation and a host of other topics. <br /> <br />The text of the book is well written, and graphics are used effectively. <br /> <br />This is a great book for front end developers. This is the type of coverage this complex topics needs. Hopefully we can get similar books for PHP and Perl web development.	2004-10-12

The idea is that you learn patterns through examples in code, as opposed to the architectural level presented in the Gang of Four book. The patterns are presented in a couple of primary case studies. One is the game of life, whose code alone takes up a significant number of pages without sufficient annotation. <br /> <br />The author has strong opinions about how to do patterns right and this is what I appreciate most about the book. Other standout features include the a very concise condensation of the GoF patterns at the end of the book. <br /> <br />I fault the book for the run-on code fragments, but these do not detract enough to take away from the books unique compelling features. For anyone who is interested in a more pragmatic face to patterns this book is well worth the look.	2004-10-12

There is lots of information for bit-twiddlers who like pushing the limits of the language syntax and templates. But there is also lots of high level information which is on the application architecture and good advice level. He is a big proponent of encapsulation over inheritance, which is something that I also advocate having been in a number of deeply and twisty code bases. <br /> <br />There are some sections that I found a little too technical, but that is a personal issue. Though it is nice to have my brain stretched now and again. Illustrations are kept to a minimum. The text is somewhat dry, but it's still a solid read. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for any advanced C++ programmer. It's well worth your time and money. It's not so clear to me that an intermediate programmer would get much out of it, and I think beginners should stick to something like Bruce Eckel's Thinking in C++.	2004-10-12

But the title is deceptive since only about a quarter of the book is actually spent on business applications. <br /> <br />The coverage of the command line and network services (in particular) are well done. The text is easy to read. Graphics are a little overused in places. <br /> <br />Anyone interested in a general end-user Linux book should evaluate this one, but also look at the competing O'Reilly books.	2004-10-12

Though many of the same principles could be applied to Windows network programming. <br /> <br />The book starts off with a small chapter on architecture. It quickly becomes chapters of annotated code with a few illustrations thrown in. The text is well written and the the book is short enough to make that format workable. <br /> <br />The last section of the book is dedicated to security. Which I appreciate since C programming is so fraught with security problems. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to those looking to write basic network protocols with C. Though I think it should be said that using a wrapper C++ library, or some higher level applications language for network protocol work will be advisable.	2004-10-12

It covers the basic use and syntax of the engine, then embedding and extending it. It's very well written and organized.  <br /> <br />On the downside I think the graphics could have been used more effectively, and I would have liked to have seen more on the basic template syntax. Overall, however, I highly recommend this book to anyone for whom the Velocity template engine is a central part of the architecture.	2004-10-12

This book provides a much wider angle view on the .NET cross platform development space. For example, the developers note book covers TK#, this book covers TK# and #WT. <br /> <br />This book is much more architectural in design than the Developers Notebook. So if code is your thing then you may want to evaluate both. I personally prefer architectural perspective because in this case it's more about choosing a direction of development as opposed to learning the structure of the TK# library, which is interesting, but can be gleaned from the online documentation. <br /> <br />This is a must have book for anyone who wants to take their .NET code beyond the confines of the Windows operating system. It's well worth the price of admission.	2004-10-12

It covers the structure of Java code files, the opcodes, and the all of the tools required to decompile classes, and to obfuscate existing code. It's an invaluable reference for anyone who has to deploy Java in a non-secure environment, or for those that want to learn how the language really works. <br /> <br />There is a lot of code to pour though, and there are no illustrations. I think the text could have used some illustrations, but that's not a big sticking point for me. <br /> <br />If you are a serious Java gearhead you should have a look at this book. And if you have a specific interest in either de-compiling some Java or obscuring your deployed Java bytecode then this is a must have.	2004-10-12

There are about fifty recipes dedicated specifically to helping you get automated access to information through IRC. Most of the examples are in Java, but there is some Perl and Python as well. <br /> <br />As Hacks books go this is a little looser than the others. I would have liked less time spent on the user interface twiddling, and I'm not sure what the artificial intelligence hack was about. But overall the book is great.  <br /> <br />For anyone who loves instant messaging and wants to allow access to their applications through IM, this is the book. If you are a hardcore IRC user you will also want to have a look at this book.	2004-10-12

Some topics, like RSS, are given short shrift, but overall the topic coverage is consistent. The text is well written and easy to read, graphics and illustrations are used sparingly and to great effect. <br /> <br />Enough time is spent on the introduction, basic concepts and the life cycle of a portlet to create a firm basis of understanding to layer the technical concepts on. That is what you want from a book like this and it delivers. This book is definitely worth a look for anyone looking to build portlets on the Java Portlet API.	2004-10-12

It starts with tips about how to modify and use your Visual Studio environment, and ends with tips on the code in a data access layer. And at a mere two hundred pages the coverage is never in-depth. It's fragments of information, presented as secrets, from all over the .NET world. <br /> <br />The book is well written, and the graphics are used effectively. What is there is done well. But you need to make sure that there is enough that will be helpful to you in there before you buy. I definitely recommend reading the index and checking it out in person before you buy.	2004-10-12

It's well written and has numerous (maybe too many) screenshots. The walkthroughs are explained in an easy-to-read and follow step by step manner. There is some C# code and SQL that describe, for example, how to integrate the reporting engine into a .NET application. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for anyone looking at developing with SQL Server Reports. It's definitely worth the look.	2004-10-12

In this way you learn about the architecture of the protocols, as well as how to use Python to implement them.  The book covers XML-RPC, IMAP, HTTP, FTP, among others. It also includes information on high performance web server python through mod_python. <br /> <br />The book is very focused on the code. There are no illustrations. And the text is mainly just a binder to walk you around through the code. <br /> <br />This book makes an excellent addition to your Python bookshelf. Additionally you may want to have a look at this book if you are interested in the protocols even if the implementation isn't in Python, since Python is very clear and easily translatable into other languages.	2004-10-12

It's as simple as that. Joel is a legend in the industry and his articles have been required reading for some time. He covers technical topics, as well as project management and professional topics. But the real value of the book is in the practical advice he presents in an entertaining manner. <br /> <br />Every once in a while a book comes along that rekindles your interest in the topic. This is one of those books. There is so much good information, and it's presented so effectively, that you will be motivated to do something with it that will help your projects and your career.	2004-10-12

The author found the time to impart a deeper understanding of the topic of networking, as opposed to just talking about the APIs. Though this dual emphasis does not detract from the books central purpose, to teach use of the .NET network API. It introduces the API starting at the raw transport level and then moving up to the protocol level, often showing example client applications. <br /> <br />This is easily the best book that I have seen on .NET network coding. I recommend this book to anyone tasked with writing network code for C#.	2004-10-12

The book covers everything from installation, through queries and SQL, through management and into security. Illustrations are used sparingly, and code fragments are not excessively long. I rated it four out of five because I think the layout could have been tightened up to reduce the page count and to organize it a bit more effectively.	2004-10-12

These include the CLI, garbage collection, threading, runtime code generation, instrumentation, cryptography and others. Some topics are covered in more depth than others, but they are all covered well. The writing is good. Illustrations are used effectively. <br /> <br />This book is worth the look for any .NET developer. You should assess whether the specific topics that are covered are of interest to you.	2004-10-12

There are illustrations to guide you through but they aren't overused. There are some step by step walkthroughs, but in general the book is about code and a little about standards. The majority of the book is about the security aspects of the standard. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for anyone doing web services in .NET. It's definitely worth the look. It's the kind of book that you can read in an afternoon and get a solid introduction to the topic.	2004-10-12

It is not intended to teach Perl as a first computer language, and it does not pander to the reader. The Perl it teaches is strong industry standard Perl that is in line with what could reasonably be considered best practice. That's something in a language that prides itself on having many ways to do one thing. <br /> <br />The book covers the entire topic of Perl from the basics of writing a script, through functions, modules, and into object oriented programming. It also covers vital community information such as the use of CPAN. <br /> <br />If you have not read Programming Perl then I believe you should start there. But if you find that book has too much of a learning curve then I would recommend this book or Learning Perl (O'Reilly.)	2004-10-12

It covers the entire WebObjects/Java application development platform. Illustrations are used effectively and kept to a minimum, code is not overused and the exposition text is easy to read and focused. The book is introductory in nature, it's not a reference work for the platform. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone looking into the platform or for those that are actively using it. I don't think it exposes enough of the architecture to provide insights into the design of WebObjects/Java as a web development platform for architectural design purposes.	2004-10-12

Dave Thomas talked about knowing your editor and your IDE. This book plows into making the best use of Visual Studio, including extending it. If you are going to be using Visual Studio for eight hours a day you will want to have a look at this book to see how to make better use of their IDE and particularly how to extend it. If you can write a macro that saves you ten minutes a day, it will save an hour a week and a week a year.	2004-10-12

Then second as a set of interesting stories about security. And it's these stories that bring security issues to life. <br /> <br />This is not a reference book. The technical content is related directly to the stories and case studies. But the technical content is still very compelling, well written and in-depth. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a book on how to secure Linux or NT, this is not your book. I think this book is written for people with a passion about security and who are serious about a career in information security. Those types of people will love this book.	2004-10-03

I tell them to start with a language like Perl or Basic, and they just shake their head because they see that the money is in C++, C# or Java. The reason that I try to push people towards languages like Perl or Basic is that those languages allow you to concentrate on the logic of the program without worrying about the nitty-gritty mechanics of computers. I liken trying to learn programming through C++ to trying to learn how to ride a bike by learning how to smelt steel for the frame before you get on to building the bike you are going to learn on. <br /> <br />But, if you want to use C++ as your first language this is a reasonable book to start with. It has it's faults. The never references the colon syntax on constructors, which is important. And never touches on templates, which are very, very, important in modern C++. I don't think an introductory book should cover how to build templates, but there should be substantial content on the mechanics of templates and the Standard Template Library. <br /> <br />If you are thinking about this book you should seriously consider Thinking in C++ by Bruce Eckel. It's an excellent introduction that may not start with the absolute basics, but does provide an complete end-to-end introduction to C++ that includes templates.	2004-10-03

These include using Notes services, WAS, LDAP, among others. It also covers overall issues like performance, caching, and application design. <br /> <br />The book is generally well written, though not as concise as the equivalent O'Reilly book. Screenshots are a little overused. The topic coverage level is fairly light. This is more of a field guide then a reference. <br /> <br />If you are a J2EE developer or architect, you are starting a project that includes Notes, and you are starting from scratch, then you should take a look at this book to give you a survey of the territory.	2004-10-03

Their is very little code, a surprising number of screenshots.  The text is uniformly architectural, ranging from somewhat in-depth (e.g. the coverage of EJBs), to very in-depth (e.g. the chapter on security). <br /> <br />If you are new to J2EE development and you are looking for an overall field guide to the topic at the architectural level, then this may be the book for you. If you are looking for in-depth coverage of specific topics, like EJBs, deployment, or performance tuning, then you should look for other books that are more in-depth.	2004-10-03

It's a quick walkthrough of the essential features of Hibernate for those that already understand the basic principles of O/R mapping layers. It starts with installation, then goes quickly into the code in a what/how format. What do I want to do. How is that done. Over and over until all of the essential features of Hibernate are covered. <br /> <br />I like the voicing of the book, which is to treat the reader with respect. I like that there are not a lot of screenshots. And I particularly like the brief but thorough writing style. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone familiar with O/R mapping layers but who needs an introduction to Hibernate.	2004-09-26

So it's important to understand what this book is and who it's for. This is not, with it's thin 170 page frame, a book that covers all of the Java language syntax. It is very specific to the features of 1.5. It covers generics, autoboxing, enums, varargs, and more. All of the new features added to make Java compete with C# are covered here in a terse and aggressive form. This book is for people who know Java well and want to learn more about 1.5. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for Java professionals and architects who understand the new features conceptually but want details on how they work directly in the code. This is not a book for someone who just wants to start with Java. For that I recommend O'Reilly's Learning Java or Java in a Nutshell.	2004-09-26

You won't find information about how to write well, or organize your document effectively. This has a manual style, loaded (but not overwhelmed) with screenshots, which covers all of the functions of the application. <br /> <br />I've read (or looked over) a lot of books on Microsoft Word. I find the book a lot more pleasing. It doesn't treat you like an idiot. It understands that the common case is that you understand the basics of the application and you are just looking for how to do one particular thing. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for anyone using Writer.	2004-09-26

Threads create a whole new level of complexity and nasty bugs called 'heisenbugs' that disappear once the debugger gets switched on. That's why having a book that gives experienced based information about how to manage the complexity is so important. It's not just about APIs. <br /> <br />The topics covered include performance issues, architectural information about where and how to use threading, and how to manage communications between threads. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for any Java engineers creating threaded architectures, or writing code on top of a multi-threaded architecture.	2004-09-26

For a book of only four hundred pages it covers a lot of ground, from system setup, to networking, printing, file system management, as well as the fundamentals of all of the standard applications and the iPhoto suite. As you can see, that is a lot to cover in 400 pages, so the coverage is necessarily shallow.<br /><br />That being said the text is easy to read and the illustrations are well used. The content is up-to-date and their and helpful tips and tricks.<br /><br />If you want an overall look at Mac OS X then you should have a look at this book. I would recommend figuring out if you are interested in the operating system itself, where I would recommend Mac OS X In a Nutshell, or interested in the iLife application suite, where I would recommend the O'Reilly Missing Manual book that corresponds to the application you are interested in.	2004-09-26

Turns out the majority of the core of .NET is cross-platform when you use Mono, but the UI portion is not. So the book mainly concentrates on the use of GTK#, spending about 80 out of 250 pages on it. Other sections include XML processing, networking, core .NET, and installation. <br /> <br />The well written, concise, and focused. This is a strength, and a weakness. The book may be too focused by design. Which leaves you in a situation where you don't have enough book to be valuable on it's own. You will still need O'Reilly's Programming C# book to start learning C#. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone looking to start with GTK#, or who is interested in porting their C# code off the Windows platform. I do not recommend this book for someone just starting out with C#.	2004-09-26

For me these included an introduction to neural networks (at the end of the book), probability theory, and finite state machines. I've read (and looked over) a number of books on game development and they, in general, seem to prattle on about the games themselves, or spend an inordinate amount of time on the graphics or the presentation. That stuff is important, but at the heart of these systems are algorithms animate the game and bring it to life. This book concentrates on those algorithms by expressly playing down the graphics elements. <br /> <br />I can safely recommend browsing this book to almost any software engineer. You may find some stuff that interests you and you can use even if you aren't a game developer.	2004-09-26

Both books have up-to-date, well written content. The Hacks books is organized more aggressively into a set form that may or may not appeal to you. This book has a more traditional topic based organization. <br /> <br />Topics include antenna coverage and construction, operating system information and coverage of the different types of Wi-Fi security that are available. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for anyone serious about building their own Wi-Fi networks. I don't recommend this book, or O'Reilly Hacks, for someone just looking for how to get their computer on a wireless network.

The exposition between the reference sections is terse and dry. <br /> <br />For those interested in a book that covers this material that has a workable learning curve I recommend O'Reilly's classic \\"Dynamic HTML\\". There is more exposition in that book, which means that you can actually learn HTML from it.

This is advanced stuff that requires a good deal of technical skill. The first chapter of the book does have some hacks that are done from the interface itself, like enabling the advanced season pass. The second chapter covers adding more disk space to your TiVo. Then beyond that you get into the advanced topics; putting your TiVo on your network, changing the software, transferring movies around, and then authoring code for the TiVo. <br /> <br />The book is very focused. The text is well written and the graphics are used effectively. The section on adding disk space is very well done and is better than anything I have read on the web for doing the same type of work. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for people who are familiar with Linux and hardware hacking and are interested in extending their TiVos. For just the average TiVo user you may want to review the table of contents to make sure that you are getting enough out of your purchase.	2004-09-24

This is really and end-to-end user level walkthrough of Linux from the shell through the operating system and into applications. It's complete, but I found the text a little terse and stiff. Illustrations are sparse and underused. <br /> <br />This book covers the shell, X windows, text editing, text manipulation, file system commands, network access, configuration and other common Linux areas of interest. It has a wide range of coverage, which means that even though the book is quite thick the time spent on any one topic is fairly light. One exception is text manipulation, which is covered in significant depth. <br /> <br />This book is definitely worth the look, but you should also consider O'Reilly's \\"Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora\\".	2004-09-24

The book concentrates on automating the Java build, deployment and test process. It covers Ant, Nant, Maven, CruiseControl and other tools. But even if your specific tool or environment isn't covered you will still gain from the experienced based insight in the book, even if you can't use the code samples directly. <br /> <br />The text of the book is fresh, easy to read, and often funny. Graphics are used sparingly and effectively. <br /> <br />I certainly recommend this book for any build master, or someone stuck with the build master role. Though I really recommend the whole series for all engineers because they, as a set, will help you round out your entire skill set.	2004-09-24

This book falls a little off that mark. The text of the book is not very focused, though it is more personable and easier to read than the other Hacks books. <br /> <br />What bothered me was that the hacks were not all particularly XP relevant. Picking a web browser and a hack on war driving seem off the mark to me. On the one hand, they could have called it 'Windows Hacks' and I would think that the book was dead on. Since they called it 'Windows XP Hacks' I expected to see more XP specific information. <br /> <br />That being said, the book has a lot going for it. There is a lot of cool and unique content in it. I particularly liked the sections on tweaking the UI and hacking the registry. I also appreciated the information on how to surf the Internet safely. <br /> <br />Before you buy you should have a look at the table of contents first to make sure that you are getting value for your dollar.	2004-09-24

The book is filled with practical, introductory level, advice for how to clean, and more importantly, organize and maintain your Macintosh. There are lots of good suggestions. Even if you think you know the Mac well you will likely find some references to applications and extensions you haven't seen before. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for anyone using the Mac full time. The content is unique and the advice is practical. Though I would certainly look the table of contents over to make sure that you will get enough out of it to justify the purchase.	2004-09-24

It's all new content in a beautifully satirical text book style. The production value is amazing. I'm very impressed with the book. I recommend this book to anyone who wants refreshingly funny view on current politics. You will not be disappointed.	2004-09-23

Jim has done a great job distilling these feature rich applications down to their essence and teaching you want you need to know to use them effectively. <br /> <br />He also provides helpful tips that apply to each topic in general and not just the application. For example, in the iPhoto section he has tips on how to compose images properly. In the iMovie section he has tips on what chapter markers to use for wedding videos (and other common scenarios). This may seem like nothing but it's the practical hints that allow you to get the most out of these applications. Not just learning about which buttons to push. <br /> <br />The included DVD is well done and augments the book with a step by step explanation that you can follow visually. <br /> <br />This book is not for intermediate or expert level readers. For those folks I would start by recommending an O'Reilly book that covers your specific topic. For example photographers should try Derrick Story's excellent iPhoto 4 book. You will get more in-depth coverage of all of the features of iPhoto in that book. <br /> <br />O'Reilly has an intermediate level book that covers all of the iLife features that was just recently published called iLife '04. I recommend this book instead for beginners.	2004-09-17

The content is not step-by-step for beginners but rather for people that understand the basics of Macintosh applications and have some experience with the applications. The text is well written and illustrations are used effectively. All of the applications, save iDVD, are covered thoroughly. But that's ok since IDVD gets short shrift in every manual. <br /> <br />For true beginners I would recommend buying the O'Reilly manual for the application that you are likely to use the most. For example, I think photographers will get a lot out of iPhoto 4: The Missing Manual. What's the difference? There is more exposition, which eases the learning curve, and there are more tips and tricks.  But if you are a Macintosh user with a reasonable amount of experience who is looking for a book that covers all of the applications at a reasonable level, then this book should appeal to you. <br /> <br />For genuine beginners I would also recommend looking at Peachpit Press' \\"The Macintosh iLife '04\\".	2004-09-17

The idea is to take a topic that is dry as a bone, like JSP, and make it fun and interesting from start to finish. That's not an easy job. I have to give the authors of this book a lot of credit for keeping up with a whacky writing style and offbeat humor for almost nine hundred pages. That is quite an accomplishment. <br /> <br />The book could have been a lot thinner. Each page is loaded with graphics and has a lot less text than you are used to. But that's the point. The idea is to coat the topic in a sugar pill of fun so that you can get through it, and maybe retain a little on exam day. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone prepping for the SCWCD, who doesn't mind a new approach to learning a dry as a bone technical topic. I also think this is a fine book for anyone who wants to learn about JSP for their job. As well as for people looking for an example of a novel approach to teaching technical topics.	2004-09-06

This one is definitely a hit. The first section on of the iMovie portion of the book teaches practical movie making technique, including a 22 shot guide to shooting a wedding. This is what I love about the quality of O'Reilly books. The understand the audience. In this case, amateur movie makers looking to make good movies that won't get them laughed out of the living room. This book has practical insights to get you there. <br /> <br />The manual portions of the book are fine. They provide a step by step walkthrough with screenshots and a menu reference in the appendices. <br /> <br />There is certainly a lot more here for iMovie than iDVD. Of the roughly 500 pages almost 350 are on iMovie. The iDVD section also contains some questionable content, like how to develop on iDVD using the developer's toolkit, which I think is overkill for your overage user. <br /> <br />Small quirks aside, this is a great book. Well worth the money for anybody looking to get the most out of iMovie particularly, and iDVD secondarily.	2004-09-04

There is no source code. No particular advocacy of any language or toolkit. This is a business book that has a positive perspective about open source, but it more about how to evaluate open source software and how it can be deployed effectively. <br /> <br />On the downside, the text and the topic are fairly dry, and the insistence on putting paragraph synopsis lines next to ever single paragraph in the entire book is annoying. The synopsis lines should summarize and entire page or set of paragraphs. <br /> <br />It's not a book for everyone. This is a book for CTOs and product managers. If you are having trouble convincing your employers or employees about the business value and quality of open source alternatives to commercial products you should have a look at this book.	2004-09-04

The first chapter and the last few chapters provide a perspective on licensing through the perspective of the open source software developer. That is invaluable. Without perspective the book is simply translations of legal mumbo jumbo. These perspective sections provide a mental framework for understanding the need for licensing and how it fits into the software development life-cycle. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to those who are confused by the morass of open source licenses. It effectively clears away the fog and provides both perspective and translation on this difficult subject.	2004-09-04

As such I found sections of the book somewhat interesting, and others totally impenetrable. Some sections had straightforward screenshot based walkthroughs, others required knowledge of calculus and circuit design. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book to anyone directly. It's a book that has to be browsed for the content you need, and then the coverage of that content evaluated in person.	2004-09-04

There are no diagrams or pictures anywhere in the book. It consists entirely of Courier type shell work with terse exposition to hold it together. <br /> <br />I can recommend this book if you are a Systems Administrator for OpenBSD and you are looking for something to guide you through the morass of commands in a step by step manner. And even then, I think you should look at the book in person first to make sure that it covers the topic you are interested in adequately.	2004-09-04

There is a lot of detail in the recipes on where the browser rendering quirks are and how to create CSS that works on all browsers. <br /> <br />That being said, this is not a book for CSS or HTML beginners. You need to understand the basic mechanics of the syntax and preferably have some experience with CSS before you pick this book up. This is a book for those that have worked with CSS and been stung either by browser incompatibilities or the inability to find the right CSS syntax for tricky jobs. Non-Javascript menus, the box model hack, three column CSS layouts, hanging list indents, it's all in here. <br /> <br />The great part about the cookbook series is that it not only shows you how to fix the problem in front of you, it also has enough discussion to get you around related issues and maybe teach you a thing or to. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to any serious CSS user.	2004-09-04

It's not trying to give theory and reference. This is a step by step book that is heavy with screen shots and embedded code samples. It covers the XML aspects of Excel 2003 exclusively, and branches off into InfoPath (Microsoft XML access product) and SharePoint (the data sharing service.) <br /> <br />I found the writing a little terse and stiff, but overall it was reasonable. The were too many screenshots for my taste, even given the 'notebook' style. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for anyone looking for a step by step guide to using the XML features of Excel 2003. If you don't know Excel all that well, or XML, or VB, then you aren't going to learn it here.	2004-09-04

It's about learning the syntax of the language. It's about having an idea about what you want your site to convey, and how you want it to look and expressing it through HTML. So a book that teaches HTML must acts as language primer and select a subset of the language to introduce. <br /> <br />This is exactly what this book does. It doesn't provide in-depth coverage of every detail of every tag. It provides an overall look at HTML, then page design, then site design. As such, this is a good book to take you from zero to beginner with HTML. To advance beyond there you will want a book like O'Reilly's \\"HTML: The Definitive Guide\\", or moving beyond that O'Reilly's massive \\"Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference\\". <br /> <br />I recommend this book for absolute beginners who know nothing about the web and who want to build sites. There is enough there to get you up the ramp of basic knowledge and to get you pointed in the right direction. Sure there are problems, some of the topics (Java, XSLT) could be stripped altogether, but in generally it's a consistently high quality book that covers the three fundamentals; HTML, Page Design and Site Design.	2004-09-04

The first two parts, generally, concentrate on getting the most out of Google searches. The last five sections cover searching for specific types of data; dictionaries, almanacs, people (alive people and dead people). Each of these sections gives helpful sites to go to and explains further search refinements. <br /> <br />I prefered the first section of the book, which covered getting the most out of Google. It was laymen focused, where O'Reilly's Google Hacks was engineer focused. There was enough exposition around the topic to give even the most unsophisticated reader a leg up when trying to refine Google searches. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book directly. I think you should look at both this book and Google Hacks, and decide which covers more content for you and which style you would prefer. In general I think you would prefer Google Hacks if you are more technical, and this book if you are non-technical.	2004-09-04

The coverage of PDFs from the client side to publication side is fantastic. He gives tips on how to tune your PDFs, both from the technical perspective and from the design perspective. Other hacks show how to migrate your content out of PDF into various forms. Still other hacks show how take data from unusual sources (like raw XML) and turn it into PDF. He even covers XSL-FO in the most concise effective form I have seen. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book. It's well written and uses graphics effectively. Almost all of the hacks (save the first introductory few) are both valuable and unique. In addition he teaches you techniques that can extend beyond the basic nature of the hack. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone using PDF to publish content. In addition I recommend the book for those looking to self-publish, or those looking for information on how to migrate their content to different content media (web, PDF, palm, etc.)	2004-09-04

Technical books either cover how things are done, or why they are done. Most often it's about the 'how', and explorer's books just spread a thinner 'how to' over lots of topics. The value of this book is in the perspective it provides, the 'why', as opposed to just a 'how to'. <br /> <br />It covers both how and why for RDF, OWL, Web Services, Agents and a number of other topics. And gives you a complete perspective for the entire field. Of course, what you don't get is a complete how-to guide on any one of these topics. Which is fine by me. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for anyone who knows nothing about these technologies, but wants a perspective on the entire field. That's not something you are going to find in reference books on each of these individual subjects. Not that I have been able to find a good book on RDF.	2004-09-04

But somehow Lawrence has turned this dry subject into something palatable for me. He runs through all of the general topics for each license (e.g. intellectual property, distribution, etc.) and then works through the commonly used licenses. It also gives a chapter on how to choose a license, which is much appreciated. <br /> <br />I can't say that this is a casual fun read to take on a vacation with you. But if you are choosing a license and you have no idea what you are doing, then this will be an informative read that will help you make that decision.	2004-08-16

The writing style is serious, but not overwhelming, and the use of graphics is appropriate and effective. The organization is what you would expect, it cuts the Kernel as if it were an onion and starts at the center, covering I/O and devices, goes through process management, file systems, IPC and networking. There are exercises at the end of every chapter. <br /> <br />This book is a genuinely impressive piece of work. It's well worth the money for anyone looking for a computer science work on operating systems construction.	2004-08-16

I usually find super huge tomes to be of inconsistent quality across the chapters, but this book has consistently high quality organization, text and use of graphics across all of the chapters.  As you would expect the book starts with installation, it then covers use of the operating system from the desktop level. After that it goes into the file system using the shell, and ends up with the with shell programming. <br /> <br />All of the code and shell stuff is hilighted for clarity. The text is not stiff, but isn't so loose as to be annoying. This isn't  a reference, it's an end to end walkthrough. If you are looking to use Linux at the end-user level this is a well balanced book that will familiarize you with all of the basics.	2004-08-16

There is a brief introduction to general security issues, then eleven chapters that cover tools and techniques. These include packet sniffing, data encryption, wireless security. An overall soup to nuts guide to practical security. <br /> <br />This book doesn't go from computer science theory and architecture, it starts with descriptions of the problems very close to the metal (often times showing packet layouts), and then covers point by point use of open source software to fix the holes. <br /> <br />The text is well written, if a little stiff, and the graphic are not overused but are not as sparse as O'Reilly. I recommend this book for Systems Administrators looking for a step by step guide to using open source security tools.	2004-08-16

There has only been one so far that has not lived up to the series potential of presenting unique and practical content in a tight form. This book follows the lead of those that preceded it. I found helpful new content for myself, like maintaining configuration on multiple machines, and those that I have learned from the best, like using 'screen'. <br /> <br />I think any BSD user, end user, engineer, or systems administrator will find something to like in this book. And the great thing about the Hacks books are how they present you with a recipe, which gets you to learn something new, which then expands into whole new areas of understanding. I recommend this book to anyone using BSD.	2004-08-10

In this case the first eight chapters cover basic Eclipse use from installation, through creating Java projects, refactorting code, and integrating with ANT. The book then turns sharply into basic Java project implementation, which is better covered in any number of Java books. This goes on from chapters eight through twelve, and only comes back to Eclipse specific in the last two chapters which cover writing plugins. <br /> <br />This is better than the other O'Reilly book, but I would have liked it to have stayed on course and to cover some of the more standard plugins that are being used in the wild. Great beginning, bad ending. I would recommend this as an introduction to Eclipse for anyone unfamiliar with IDEs, but this recommendation comes with the aforementioned reservations.	2004-08-10

Turns out the book is nothing like that. It's a ground up introduction to Linux from the end-user perspective. It starts in Windows with prepping a system for Linux installation, works through the installation (replete with lots of screenshots), then goes into the basics of window managers and Linux Office-style applications. The last few chapters go into some depth on working in the shell and shell scripting, but it's pretty light. <br /> <br />This is a solid introduction to end-user level Linux that should be suitable for anyone who is reasonably technical (no need to be a programmer). The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of the reliance on numerous screenshots, which isn't the best way to explain things, and is not the quality that I expect from O'Reilly.	2004-08-10

The first half of the book is on the Perl 6 language and is so terse that it's only readable by experienced Perl programmers. The second half of the book covers Parrot, the new Perl Virtual Machine. This is seriously hard core material, which is useful if you plan to write your own compiler to fit on top of the machine. <br /> <br />Doubtless this is some cutting edge and impressive material, but the book has no ramp for beginners. If your job depends on high-end Perl, you will want to read this book. If you are an average Perl user you can probably wait for the next version of Programming Perl.	2004-08-10

It follows a single example, in depth, through the entire book and in the later part of the book dedicates whole chapters just to explaining the code of the example. <br /> <br />The first six chapters, which cover PHP, SQL (and MySQL) and PEAR are the best in the book. The SQL chapter is particularly good. <br /> <br />Overall the book is well written and thorough. My problem is two fold. I think the organization would be better if it spent less time on the example project. And on a technical level the MySQL access is not proper or secure and is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. <br /> <br />I would recommend Advanced PHP Programming from Addison Wesley for experienced PHP users. For beginners this book is a good start, but you should not use it for example code for database access.	2004-08-10

The use of graphics is very effectively coupled with tightly written and interesting exposition. Nowhere is this more evident than in chapter four which works through an entire web transaction both on the client and the server. <br /> <br />About two thirds of the book covers JSF in-depth. The last third, in the appendices, gives an O'Reilly style reference for the components. Before the reference section the book covers the basics, like forms. Then goes into advanced topics like internationalization and finished off by covering the creation of custom components and layout systems. <br /> <br />This is a must read for anyone using or evaluating JSF. It's well written, and teaches the topic, as opposed to just translating the documentation.	2004-08-10

The Cathedral and the Bazaar was a great step away from reference, and this book is another worthy diversion from the Java section of the bookstore. This first portion of the book provides a lightheartedly written history of the art of programming and puts it into perspective in the wider realm of disciplines. The latter section of the book concentrates on technology and promotes both the author's programming language and spam filtering technologies. <br /> <br />Anyone who is passionate about creating software and programming will find things to like about this book. If programming is just a day job you probably won't be interested in what's here, which is unfortunate. Of course, being passionate about the art of programming I liked this book a lot and highly recommend it.	2004-08-10

Chapter five, on query performance tuning is worth the price of admission, and the rest of the book is good in addition. In particular the backup and replication chapters are also very good. The tone of the book is light, which makes it's scant 250 pages a quick read. Graphics are used sparingly and to good effect. <br /> <br />For systems administrators and DBAs this is a must have book. For engineers it might be worth a look. It's probably not worth the money if you are just using MySQL on an ISP and doing low volume work.	2004-08-10

It's short and focused. It strays a little on the non 802.11 chapters, but that seems to be the way with all of the O'Reilly wireless books. Here is the blow by blow: <br /> <br />Chapter one is WiFi basics, it's short and solid. Chapter two is about the hardware and it's quite in depth in terms of getting the interface card installed and configured. Chapter three is about connecting to the network it's a little short and basic, some more effort could have been spent there. Chapters five and six are about the server side of the equation. Chapter six is a bit long, it's about building the server and covers the entire setup from hardware to software configuration. Chapters seven through nine are about non 802.11 networking through bluetooth, infrared and cellular. These chapters are a little skimpy and graphics heavy, but you probably won't be getting the book for them. Chapter ten is a brief introduction to GPS. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone with issues around Linux wireless network. Linux documentation can be a morass and it's worth your time and money to plunk down a book that walks you through the process.	2004-07-29

O'Reilly publishes a lot of OS X titles, but this one is the most unique of those that I have read (and I have read most of them). The reason is the insane breadth of the book. It covers everything from how to use Quicksilver (the best application for OS X, bar none) to how to share desktops, to script iPhoto with perl. If you want to see in just how many ways you can hack your Mac you have to check this book out. It's one of a kind, and for those with the need to really see how they can tweak their Mac, this is a must have.	2004-07-29

The Hacks series, which I really like, is all about unique and novel approaches to tricky problems. This book is a nice introduction to Excel, but it doesn't provide particularly unique content. I'm sorry to see that since I haven't yet seen a Hacks book I didn't like. Oh well, there is a first time for everything. <br /> <br />If you are interested in Excel introductory material you will probably like this book. If you are an experience Excel user looking for a Hacks style book with unique and cool solutions to tough problems, you won't find them here. I gave the book three stars because, even though it's not a Hacks book per se, it's still a tight and well written book on Excel that is still far superior to some of the 1000 page screenshot collection doorstops on the market.	2004-07-29

This book is great and his other book, Digital Photography Hacks is also excellent. Of course, they are both valuable for different reasons, though this book starts by covering many of the same topics as Digital Photography Hacks by spending the first three chapters on how to take better shots. Bad photos make for a bad iPhoto library of course, so the advice is appreciated. <br /> <br />The bulk of the book is in explaining all of the features of iPhoto. Long term iPhoto users will probably not find any surprises here. It's a missing manual, so it covers the basics, and it does it well. For more advanced topics, like managing multiple iPhoto libraries, or making use of Applescript, there is some coverage at the end but not much. <br /> <br />Definitely a good buy for anyone just starting, or relatively unfamiliar with iPhoto and who is looking to use the application extensively to manage large numbers of photos. Probably also worth a look even if you are familiar with iPhoto.	2004-07-29

It's covers a broad swath of ground in generic sweeping terms. When it does touch metal it covers the development of a web application for a tablet PC, which appears as largely unchanged from what it would look like in a standard web development environment. <br />  <br /> The books first three chapters present an introduction and a business case for mobile computing. The fourth and fifth chapters provide a very high level overview of mobile devices and their variety. An example of the level of depth is on page 72 where the author writes; &quot;Most, if not all, mobile devices have flat screens.&quot;  <br />  <br /> Chapters seven, eight and nine cover, again at a very high level, application design for almost any thin client application. It could be web, or mobile, or whatever. <br />  <br /> Chapter ten covers the waterfall development model. Which I found really off tangent. I thought from here we would dig down. Instead we are building another information tower about project management and requirements gathering. <br />  <br /> Chapter eleven is a case study which is at the level of UML, data model, page flow, and use cases. Chapters twelve and thirteen are also case studies at a similar level. <br />  <br /> To get the &quot;Full Microsoft .NET code examples for cell phones, Pocket PCs, and Tablet PCs&quot; you need to go to Appendix B, which is the first sign of code in the book. <br />  <br /> Can't say I recommend this book at all. At the level this book covers mobile development it is not significantly different from web development. And for front-line coders this book provides no practical insight whatsoever. I gave it two stars because it provides some interesting facts about mobile bandwidth, and because I find the writing to be better than average. Shame that they couldn't have delved deeper into this fascinating topic. <br />	2004-07-29

For the first six chapters it looks that way as it rolls through language basics, variables, conditionals, arrays, etc. But then it veers into the practical for the rest of the book and covers topics such as database access through Pear DB and the use of XML.  <br /> <br />There is a lot to like about this book. The chapters are short, focused and practical. And I have no issues recommending the book on a technical level. Especially the database section which advocates simple safe SQL practices. In particular you should follow the advice on page 126 about using the '?' operator in your SQL queries. <br /> <br />There isn't much new for PHP 4 programmers looking to learn about PHP 5. In fact there is little or no emphasis placed on teaching you to write classes. The only information about classes is about their consumption. This is definitely not a book for the experienced PHP developer, but for a beginner this is one of the best.	2004-07-29

It covers simple remote machine management, Active Directory, IIS, and the truly annoying Windows DNS issues. Screen shots are kept to a minimum and graphics are used effectively. Concepts are explained but not rat-holed and the topics covered are practical. The only thing keeping me from giving this a perfect ranking are the often longish code samples that are not annotated and could be referenced on the site as opposed to included in the text. <br /> <br />A must have for starting Windows administrators, definitely worth the look for experienced ones, particularly because of the condensed practical nature of the text with Microsoft Press books so often lack.	2004-07-29

In addition, the reference I would have expected, which would allow me to navigate an RTF exported from Word, I did not find.  <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone who has some experience working with RTF and who wants to try to actually understand it. For those looking for an RTF decoder ring, you won't find it here.	2004-07-29

It's split into three parts with the vast majority in the first part which covers the language fundamentals; the new typing structure, the new class structures, exceptions, interfaces and the rest of the language enhancements. <br /> <br />Part two, which is only about sixty pages, is where the book touches metal on the Flash player. So be warned, this book does not cover both the language and the Flash player context. It covers the language in depth. <br /> <br />Part three covers design patterns, which personally I think is optional in this context. Though the coverage is restricted to the most commonly used design patterns; observer, singleton, model-view-controller, and delegation. And these all have their uses in the Flash client coding context. <br /> <br />The majority of the book is solid, tight introduction to the entire language of Actionscript 2.0, not just the new features. I gave the book four stars instead of five because of the limited emphasis on reference materials, and the minor diversions into the Flash Player environment, which wasn't too bad, and the patterns stuff, which while it was well done, was strictly optional.	2004-07-29

Chapters one through three are a great introduction to installing Eclipse and using it to work with Java applications. It then takes a turn away from Eclipse by covering CVS in chapter four, and then continues into a basic Java development book in all of the chapters that follow. If I wanted a book on how to develop Struts I would buy Programming Jakarta Struts. I don't need chapter ten to give me a cursory glimpse into Struts programming. Only the first hundred pages are really about Eclipse. Which is a shame because there is so much to say about the Eclipse platform. I can't recommend this book.	2004-07-29

Where Google Hacks gives Perl scripts for bending and twisting the Google API at the code level, the Missing Manual covers how to use Google from the web site to find the information, news or images you are looking for. if you don't know that the word Perl is spelled correctly, and you are having trouble finding what you are looking for on Google, this is the book for you. <br /> <br />That's not to say that there isn't some high end stuff. Part four has useful information for web professionals looking to optimize their presence on Google and even to make money from it. <br /> <br />So if all you know about Google is what you see on your browser, and you think you could be getting more out of Google, this book is worth the look. I gave this book five stars because the overall construction of the book is focused, and the content is useful and well written.	2004-07-29

The coverage is thorough, the exposition is tight and the use of graphics is restricted to just what is necessary to support the text. I particularly liked visualizations like the one on page 70 where the computer keyboard is related to a piano keyboard in a clever and effective form. Nice going on this one. The Missing Manual books can be inconsistent but this one is great and definitely worth it for the price. A must buy for GarageBand users.	2004-07-29

Engineers need not apply, but a typical Macintosh user who wants to make complete and proper use of the .Mac service will find lots to like. The presentation and organization is well thought out, but the book has more screen shots than I have seen in any O'Reilly book. And the screen shots are often used as exposition, which, from the outside, appears to be a no-no (a well appreciated no-no) in the house of O'Reilly. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this for .Mac users, but not for engineers or experienced users who won't find anything they haven't seen first hand.	2004-07-29

The book covers four applications; Word, Excel, Access and Infopath. It covers both the storage XML format for Word and Excel, as well as the use of XML within Word and Excel itself from the end-user side. The coverage of the storage format is excellent, and that, being a developer, is something I can appreciate. <br /> <br />For end-users of Word and Excel who are just looking to consume XML in your document or spreadsheet, or to mine XML using Infopath, this is a well written book that is worth your money and you can ignore the technical segments. For engineers looking to work with the new Microsoft XML storage formats you will find a lot to like here, and you may just find some cool things to do with XML to do on the forward facing end-user side of the house.	2004-07-29

The authors never rat hole, and they cover all of the topics for a Struts installation from installation and setup in the first chapters, through the view and model structures in the stand out fifth and sixth chapters, to topics such as validation, internationalization and EJB access in the later chapters. <br /> <br />Definitely a useful resource for anyone using, or evaluating, the Struts framework.	2004-07-29

But that doesn't make it a doorstop. There are screenshots, but they are, by in large, useful and relevant, and the book doesn't use them to tell a click by click story of the interface. <br /> <br />The book is organized into four parts that start at the user interface and continue to peel away levels of the system until, in chapter four, the author covers the command line unix shell at a surprising level of detail. A level of detail which rivals O'Reilly's other command line exclusive books. In fact, this book gives a fine introduction to scripting bash and tcsh. It does as good a job there as it does covering printing, or the vagaries of the new Finder in the chapters that precede it. <br /> <br />This is a quality piece of in-depth work about the unmodified Panther operating system. It's well worth the price for those who are more interested in understanding than hacking (though I admit a love for the new Mac OS X Panther Hacks book as well.)	2004-07-29

I was so disappointed by the first edition that I swore off O'Reilly for a little while. One of my major gripes, the rampant use of classes provided by the author in libraries has all but vanished. In addition the anti-patterns of bad SQL use that are so rampant in other Java books are nowhere to be found, and in their place are recipes that show sane and proper use of JDBC. <br /> <br />I heartily recommend this practical work for Java engineers. For those not familiar with the first edition this is a solid practical work that covers a wide range of Java programming challenges. For those turned off by the first edition, you should take a look at the second, the improvement is profound.	2004-07-29

It's not for the amateur looking to configure their firewall. The book starts with locking up UNIX filesystems and doesn't turn back the complexity clock as it winds through all the way to advanced topics like Honeypots and various SSH tunneling schemes. I highly recommend this book for network administrators and security professionals looking to make sure they have all of their bases covered. However, for the personal computer user looking to make sure their DSL doesn't get hacked I cannot recommend this book.	2004-07-29

In 300 pages the author takes you all the way from how to take great shots with cheap cameras, to how to store, edit, and get them printed. There is a lot of practical low-cost advice on taking quality shots through different mounting and filter techniques. There is also practical advice on how to do the standard photo editing work that most books take hundreds of pages to explain in just 50 pages or so. He also covers managing the little movies the cameras can take, and the working with the crummy photos cell phones take. A well written handy resource for any photographer.

If it's for beginners it's too terse to be a general introduction. If it's for advanced users then it spends too much time on the basics. I'd recommend this to anyone who is familiar with the basics of a word processor but unfamiliar with the specifics of Word. It's well organized and written. But I recommend an in-person look at it before purchase.	2004-07-29

The Cookbook series takes common tough problems and provides simple recipes, often with multiple alternative takes, to solve the problem. The value is not only in reference, it also shows you new techniques for using Access or VB is new ways that you may not have thought of. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for any experienced Access user, or anyone looking to become an Access expert.

The second part, on the forensic analysis is very detailed and well written.<br />The root idea is very simple, put an attractive target on the Internet, wait until it's hacked (and it will be), and then analyze the attack. The first part of the book covers the construction of these attractive 'honeypots'. The second part covers how to analyze the inevitable attack. The third part, which is the most high level, is about the culture of hacking and hackers.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone involved in securing systems on the open internet who has a good understanding of the technology behind networking and operating systems.	2004-05-30

HIs claim is that through a combination of outsourcing, project and asset management companies both on the buying and selling sides of the IT fence will spend less to get more.<br />The book is organized as you would expect. The first few chapters cover current problems in the industry with quality and project failures. Though the outlook is gloomy most chapters end with a 'survival guide' which gives some pragmatic advice to avoid the pitfalls and problems mentioned in the chapter.<br />The second part of the book lays out a set of IT spending and management paths. The path he would have you go on is the 'path to profits' which reduces and optimizes spending through outsourcing and intelligent use of local resources and assets.<br />The book is definitely in the same league as The Mythical Man Month, The Decline and Fall of the American Programmer, and the Rise and Resurrection of the American Programmer. I can't say if it's better or worse, but I'm not sure it's relevant. If you enjoyed any of these source works you will enjoy and learn from this book.	2004-05-30

It starts out with almost no introduction at all into mapping target networks with nmap and never stops for a breath. There is a reasonable amount of explanation, but the heart of the book is in demonstrating hacking techniques at the system and command line level. Graphics are used well to smooth over some of the more difficult topics, which is why I gave the book four stars.<br />The majority of the book, the first four parts, is dedicated to a command level explanation of various types of exploits, largely in the Unix environment. The last part of the book covers the social and legal aspects of hacking and the security response to hacking.<br />This is reasonably short (~300 pages) book that gets to the point quickly and doesn't spend a lot of time on exposition. I would recommend it for Unix systems administrators and security professionals looking to round out their understanding of both the threat and strategies to cope with those threats.	2004-05-30

Where architects take a very high level view of the world and don't get into fine grained implementation details. Then if you consider yourself this kind of architect, you will get a lot out of this book.<br />Though the book is fairly long (~500 pages) the depth of the content is still at the 'field guide' level. This means that the book focuses more on understanding the components of SOA at a holistic level without getting too deep into implementation details.<br />The first chapter of the book does delve into the basics of the XML core technologies (XML, XML validation, XSL, etc.). After that the book stays at the high level, describing most of the concepts with graphics that do an excellent job showing the document flow between systems.<br />I recommend this book to architects involved with XML based systems integration projects. I also recommend the book for engineers involved with these types of projects because they will benefit from the high level overview of the entire range of XML technologies.	2004-05-30

The idea behind the book is to re-introduce engineers to the entire flavor of the Java language. <br />Chapter one shows basic language elements like short-circuited if statements. Chapter two covers using the final keyword. Chapter six is an excellent introduction to using inner classes. This is one of the best chapters in the book.<br />Chapter eight is a very interesting combination of a theoretical discussion on data modeling and a hardcore technical discussion on object modeling. The chapter ends with a brief bit about JDO.<br />Chapter nine is a short but nice coverage of reflection. Chapter eleven is a great, and I mean great, introduction to weak and strong references.<br />The book finishes with an introduction to Tiget (JDK 1.5), mainly in the area of generics. It's a solid introduction, but it's short.<br />This is a great book. It's a must read for Java programmers.	2004-04-30

Not only does it have a chapter on wireless security, the entire book is a guide to how to find and exploit networks. So by reading the book you are learning how to exploit and how not to have your network exploited.<br />Chapter one is a solid introduction to wireless networking, the hardware the protocols and the software. Chapters two and three cover Windows installation and using Netstumbler. Chapters four, five and six cover installing and using Kismet stumbler software on Linux. There is no coverage for Mac OS X.<br />Chapter seven is about mapping the wireless access points in your area using GPS. Chapter eight is about the culture of WarDriving (driving around looking for Wi-Fi access points). It's the most interesting chapter in the book and exposes the true hacker nature of the piece. Chapter nine is the attack chapter of the book, where you learn how to crack into secured networks. Easily the most controversial chapter. Chapter ten is the opposite of nine, you learn how to secure your network. And the last chapter covers advanced options.<br />The book is a good buy for Wi-Fi user enthusiasts who want to WarDrive effectively. For Wi-Fi administrators it's probably worth the look since it may help you figure out how people will attempt to exploit your network. For the amateur end-user just looking to hook up at Starbucks I would recommend O'Reilly's Wireless Hacks. It's a little more end-user oriented.	2004-04-30

You won't learn the basics about sendmail, or get an introduction. This book is for folks who generally know sendmail, but are having specific issues with it.<br />The first chapter has a lot of very specific fixes for a bunch of operating system specific issues. After that the solutions become a bit more general.<br />The two standout chapters are chapter four, on relaying, and chapter six on spam filtering. Both of these have great introductions and in-depth techincal descriptions, with effective graphics, covering the topics.<br />I recommend this book for systems administrators and for people actively using with sendmail.	2004-04-30

It brings O'Reilly's quality in research and editing to digital photography books. They spent some time on it, and it shows. The example photos are excellent and clearly demonstrate the points. The book is well organized, and has lots of handy tips. Chapter nine, on touching up photos, is particularly good, going through common photo problems and then applying fixes to them digitally. <br />On the downside, the book is mainly about windows, and it spends much more time talking about digital editing and touch-up then it does in getting a good picture in the first place, which is 90% of the battle.<br />Even with the downside this book is still well worth the price for amateurs looking to get heavily into digital photography.	2004-04-30

Chapter five, on JDBC, is thorough and excellent. The JMS chapter, number eight, is very in-depth and worth the price of admission. Chapter twelve, on deployment, has fine coverage of both the theory and the execution of web application deployment. Chapters thirteen and fourteen on domain management and cluster are fantastic. Chapter seventeen on security is also great.<br />That's the good news. The book isn't perfect. Some chapters are way too brief. For example the chapter on transactions is just an overview. And the chapter on XML is completely superfluous. <br />Negatives aside, this is a great book. The chapters on JDBC, EJB, Deployment, and Clustering are worth the price alone.	2004-04-30

The scripts are indeed cool, and some are very useful. Unfortunately the code isn't hilighted, so it can be difficult to read when it's spread across multiple pages. The commenting and explanations are somewhat uneven.<br />That being said. It is a fun book and it can be useful. Just make sure you check the table of contents so that you know you are getting a few scripts you can use.	2004-04-30

I don't, so while I will try to be fair I am a little biased. <br />Lesson plans aside I would say the book is a cut above the average. It gives ample space to the philosophy and doesn't just concentrate on technique. There is value in understanding why something works and not just the key combinations.<br />There are lots of helpful hits. The examples images are great. Though some turn out a little cheezy after too much digital work. The chapters are pretty consistent throughout, no one topic stands out as either getting too much attention or too little.<br />If you want a book on basic Photoshop use from end-to-end you should seriously consider this one. There are lots of books on Photoshop out there, but this one has O'Reilly's attention to detail, fine writing and editing.	2004-04-30

RF stuff is covered in an appendix at the end. From my read it's meant primarily for end-users. Advanced folks will probably get a tip here and there, but not much more.<br />Chapter by chapter; Chapter one is basic terminology and an overview. Chapter two covers Wi-Fi hardware. It does have a nifty fix for the Wi-Fi problems on the 15&quot; TiBook. Chapter three covers base stations and antenas. Chapter four is a very brief look at Wi-Fi access from external sources, like Starbucks. The fifth, and last chapter on Wi-Fi, covers the basic protocol layer tools like SSH.<br />Chapter six covers Bluetooth, it's a good introduction but it's a little screenshot heavy. Chapter seven is on cell-phone connectivity, which is pretty cool new material. If you are serious about that you should get this book. Chapter eight is on rendevous and it's a nice, but short, introduction.<br />If you are just getting into Wi-Fi on Macintosh you should probably take a look at this book.	2004-04-30

It covers both Mac and Windows. Part one covers the basics of the iPod. Part two, the heart of the book covers iTunes and it's interaction with the iPod. The writing is high quality, but there are a lot of screenshots, and some editing errors. For example, the figure 4-20 is missing entirely. The third, and last part, of the book, covers more uses for the iPod. Ideas include using the iPod as a calendar, an address book, as an external disk, and for games.<br />I recommend this book for anyone looking to get the most out of their iPod.	2004-04-30

It's easy to read, has solid examples in code and uses graphics sparingly (for a book on graphics) and effectively. Especially when it comes to graphics that explain the technology. For example, the graphics pipeline in chapter two is really handy.<br />The first two chapters stand out as a nice introduction to the topic and to the shading language in particular. After that the book is an on-and-off introduction and reference that will bring you up to speed today and act as a reference later on.<br />If I have one complaint it's that the reference materials, particularly in Appendix B could have been formatted and cross referenced a little better. As it stands they feel more like slightly reformatted UNIX man pages.<br />For those that need this book, and you know who you are, this an invaluable reference, and it's well written to boot.	2004-04-27

The book is a repackaging of a bunch of chapters from other C# books that have been 'adapted' to work as one complete work. The topics range from syntax basics, to UI, database and web work. The tone of the book is uneven, but each of the chapters is written well and presents it's topic clearly. The paper and binding is pretty cheap, but given the price that is to be expected.<br />For the money this is a good buy. If what you want are some code fragments and explanation on all of the basic .NET and C# topics, you should consider this book. I just went to the index to find examples for XML, and found some quality ones right away. When you consider how much you would have to spend in other publisher's catalogues to get the same material, you can see with this is a bargain.	2004-04-27

The code examples are great, there are no graphics, and there are plenty of well-formatted tables for operators, methods, and the rest.<br />The second half of the book is Appendix A, which covers the Python's standard library. I think it's odd that an entire section of 200+ pages is considered an appendix, but that is only a minor flaw.<br />The reason that I give the book only four stars and not five is that Appendix A could use some more of the clever formatting applied to the first part of the book to make it more accessible. The information is all there, but it could be formatted a little better. O'Reilly does a great job with that sort of thing.<br />Overall, this is a great handy reference for Python. Far better than the online documentation. If you are an occasional Python programmer, like me, you will find this book a great resource because you can get a quick refresher whenever you need it.	2004-04-27

Not just because the content is great, but also because the other has his head held high. PHP is fine environment for doing web development and we should be proud, especially with version 5, which this book covers in depth.<br />The book starts with PHP coding patterns, then covers design patterns in the second chapter. This is wonderful because the PHP community needs to understand these principles and embrace them. With PHP 5 we now have support in the tool to build high quality well-architected web sites, and this book points the way right from the get-go.<br />Chapter four covers Smarty. It's a good, though brief introduction. It's still better than that standard documentation. If you don't know about Smarty you should really check it out. It's a great way to separate the user interface from the business logic.<br />Chapter six covers unit testing and test driven design. The coverage is concise and doesn't pander to the reader. The examples are bit abstract. But the section is valuable as an introduction to the topic and to it's implementation with PHP.<br />The book then continues on into truly advanced topics such as extending PHP using the SAPI, web services, caching, performance and profiling and a number of other topics.	2004-04-27

This provides a solid foundation for the rest of the book which shows examples of popular XML based technologies as applied to PHP. These include XSLT (Sablotron), XML-RPC, SOAP, XML in databases and other topics. Each of these discussions contains some real world examples to provide context.<br />It's a short and concise book that is well written. The use of graphics could be more effective. For example the screenshot in figure 6.8 is a single line in a vast sea of whtie browser space. The code sample could use some annotation or at the very least some bolding to hi-light the important segments.<br />The value of this book will depend on the degree to which you use XML in the PHP context. If you want a quick booster rocket to get you into SAX or DOM work within PHP this book will do the trick since it's far better than the documentation on the PHP site.	2004-04-27

C++ is one of those languages that can dish out the pain if you don't understand what it's doing (and not doing) for you. The book presents 99 gotchas, starting with procedural issues (e.g. useless comments, etc.), but quickly gets into C++ technical issues.<br />An example is gotcha #70, where you didn't define a virtual destructor in the base class. It's something that the old dogs know to do, but if you didn't know it then you can get stung badly and it will take you a lot of frustration to figure out. <br />If you liked Effective C++ and More Effective C++ you will probably like this book. Either way, if you are a professional C++ programmer this book can save you a lot of pain.	2004-04-27

It lays down a foundation of understanding, and then as you grow with the editor you go back to it to learn a little more about how you can customize your environment.<br />I particularly like the chapter 8 which covers abbreviations, keyboard mapping, and initialization files. It's well written and the effect is that I have saved a lot of time on my common workflows.<br />Upside, this book has made me a better Vim user. Downside is that the book could be even better than it is. The organization could be a bit stronger and there could be more expansive reference material. That being said. If you are a Vim user it is definitely worth the money.	2004-04-27

It works through examples step by step with lots of code and not much exposition. If you want an on-rails guided tour to the .NET database APIs with C#, this book is for you. For me I would rather go with an introductory style which gives an overview of an entire API. An example is the chapter three section on SQL, which is thirty pages long. It only veers off the rails twice, once to talk about less than, greater than, equals to, etc. and another time to talk about and, not and or. The chapter spends only half a page on insert, delete and update. If you wanted to learn SQL from scratch you couldn't do it from this chapter, and if you already knew SQL, you would skip this chapter. So I'm not sure what the purpose is.<br />Conclusion, if you like &quot;on-the-rails&quot; tutorials and you want to learn .NET database programming that way, this book is for you.	2004-04-27

The model is of a craftsman, like a woodworker (as pictured on the cover), starting as an apprentice, then on to journeyman and finally master. It recasts projects in this new light and shows advantages over the current software engineering &quot;programming by horde&quot; model. It also presents the traits of a craftsman, perpetual learning, teaching, belief in quality, embracing, but also being critical of new technologies.<br />If you really don't believe in the current &quot;anyone could do your job&quot; management view of software engineering you will find this book, and it's mindset, a refreshing change. Software is an art. Professional engineers have a lifelong passion and respect for that art.<br />There are several books that present this point of view, foremost is The Pragmatic Programmer, which is also an excellent book. If you have to decide between the two (and you really shouldn't) I would pick The Pragmatic Programmer. Spend the money, buy both, they complement each other and you won't regret either purchase.	2004-04-27

It will take a developer who understands web application flow reasonably well from knowing nothing about PHP to understanding how to build complex web sites.<br />The first 150 pages or so are on the syntax of PHP. The last 20 of those are on Object Oriented PHP (version 4), and about 10 of those are on the basics of OO programming. So I wouldn't try and learn OO PHP from this book (see Advanced PHP Programming for that.)<br />Section two, on database programming, starts with an introduction to the basics of database design, moves onto the mechanics of MySQL and it's interaction with PHP. It finishes with a very brief section on PEAR. This is the part that caused me to give the book only three stars. First, the database access uses string concatenation, which is error prone and insecure. Even worse, the section on PEAR, which supports the '?' operator in SQL statements, fails to mention that feature or it's advantages. Since most PHP programming is about putting a face on a database, teaching how to do databases the right way is extremely important. For a lesson in how to do database access in PHP right see another SAMS PHP book; Advanced PHP Programming.<br />Up to chapter twenty-four the book progresses by talking about each technology (e.g. authentication, date manipulation, regular expressions, etc.) as a sort of stove pipe. The chapters are generally short, and are well written and consistent. Graphics are used sparingly, which is appreciated.<br />With chapter twenty-four and beyond the author presents common tasks (e.g. login pages, shopping carts, etc.) with example applications. This is an effective technique as most of these problems involve bringing together several PHP technologies and understanding how to use them as a whole.<br />Overall I liked this book. I did take exception to the SQL problems in section two and I marked my review down because database access is so important to PHPweb development. WIth the caveat that the reader should look elsewhere for advice on proper PHP database development I would recommend this book to anyone with some web experience who wants to develop dynamic sites with PHP.	2004-04-27

The author intends this book to be read by engineers with some EJB experience who encounter challenges or problems with EJB. The book organizes these problems into topics by chapter (e.g. transactions, security, logging, data access, code generation, etc.), and then presents each problem within the chapter in a standard form; problem, background, recipe, discussion, see also.<br />If there is any fault to be found it is that some of the explanations are somewhat terse. It's not a structural flaw, however, since the purpose of the book is to provide brief answers to get you out of a tough jam.<br />Chapter two, on XDoclet generation is noteworthy. The authors explanation of XDoclet and it's use in generating various EJB and J2EE artifacts is dead-on easy to understand. I also appreciate that he mentions it so early on because it is such an important part of EJB development.<br />For J2EE developers, and more specifically EJB developers, this is a valuable resource for day-to-day development challenges. Well worth the money.	2004-04-27

It starts with the usual introduction to basic SQL access to PostgeSQL, then has a two chapters on data types and syntax, and then jumps straight into performance and extensions stuff. It then covers PL/pgSQL. The majority of the second section of the book is examples of writing for Postgres with various programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, etc.)<br />I liked the advanced content, but I was looking for a book on Postgres basics. So I don't think I got the right thing. My advice to you is, check out the table of contents, and make sure you are getting the content you need. If you are looking for a basic Postgres reference, this is not going to have much content for you.	2004-04-27

The first chapter, on installation, is Windows specific. But then it doesn't go Windows specific until about 3/4s of the way through the book in section three, where it talks about COM, ADO, Active Directory and a couple of other Windows-specfic technologies.<br />It's a short book, so the mid-section which is not Windows specific is a general reference for PHP. It's a brief reference though, weighing in at less than 100 pages, where other books (PHP and MySQL Web Development) spend over 150 pages on just the basics.<br />I can't recommend this book unless you have a specific need for introductory information on PHP installation for Windows, or use of Windows specific back-end technologies like COM, ADO or the Active Directory.	2004-04-27

Addison-Wesley and nVIDIA went all out on this book. Every page is color. This means all of the code samples, graphics, everything, is in color. This is not only an impressive trick, it also makes a book on computer graphics a lot easier to read. To understand what a particular algorithm is trying to do with color you needn't go to the center of the book, the graphic is right there.<br />The content of the book is somewhat mixed. It's done as a collection of papers so the writing tends to vary from verbose to terse. For example the chapter on depth-of-field covers five different techniques in 15 pages with 13 medium to large graphics. That's impressive compression, but it means that it is very terse and the chapter amounts to little more than an overview.  The very next chapter, on high-quality filtering, weighing in at 25 pages has a better balance of overview and detail.<br />Despite it's inconsistencies the book is still a wonderful resource and, frankly, a nice coffee table book to boot. It's even got some unintentionally funny parts, like the section header before page 3 that shows the most un-natural looking monster you have ever seen with the title 'Natural Effects'. Hardly. Still, a great book and a fun read. Bravo AW and nVIDIA.	2004-04-27

The book is only incidentally about XSLT 2.0, and it does a great job covering modern XSLT web development. I'm actually serious in my advice, if you just concentrate on the 2.0 portion of the book you will be disappointed. You need to assess the value of the book as a whole. And that value is great. Primarily because of chapters like the first chapter which dig into how XSLT can be used to revolutionize the generation of static and dynamic websites through XML data abstraction and the use of XSLT stylesheets.<br />A couple of years back XSLT was the great hope for replacing JSP with an abstract interface that would generate code for both HTML and WAP. That never materialized, mainly because server side technologies were too slow and client side XSLT wasn't universally supported. In hindsight it's obvious that this JSP replacement mindset was in error. This book is a complete re-assesment of XSLT in the web development context and provides a number of options and architectures to address different performance and abstraction concerns.<br />If you would consider yourself a 'web designer' I don't think this book is for you. It has too much about XML schema design and not enough about the mechanics of XSLT conversion. This book is better suited to senior developers and architects who want a novel and intelligent approach to construction of static and dynamic web sites, using XML and XSLT.<br />For XSLT advocates who feel that their favorite technology was miscast and sent out to pasture years early, this book is for you. Let's hope Addison-Wesley marketing can find that sweet spot to get this book out there. The author has some great ideas and it would be wonderful to see them popularized.	2004-04-27

The flow of the book, the examples, the code, and the use of sparing use of graphics combine to make this a high quality read that imparts information effectively.<br />The introduction is fairly brief (about 20 pages). The author doesn't spend a lot of time on background or comparing this framework to other similar technologies (one of the books few flaws). Then he gets into a simple Hangman example in chapter two which provides a good groundwork for understanding the material in the chapters that follow.<br />Chapter four, on HTML forms management, is a particularly fine chapter. Not only do the graphics augment the text well, the author adds bit of experiential non-Tapestry information. Like section 4.2.5 on enums which provides Java best-practice material in context, but which is not 100% relevant to Tapestry. I like to see that because all too often authors limit themselves too strictly to the topic and provide little valuable experiential material. This is especially true when they are discussing leading edge technology like Tapestry.<br />It's nice to see that Manning has also started picking up on some of the hallmark items of other notable publishers, like the condensed and well organized component reference in Appendix C. This type of material augments turns this introductory piece, into a long-term reference.<br />Definitely worth the buy if you are serious about using Tapestry as the basis for your Java web development.	2004-04-27

The problem comes with exposition. What I wanted was a book that not only explained what JMX was, but why I would want to use it. I found that this book had a ton of technical detail, on what is undoubtedly a complex topic, but lacked much in terms of context. More how, less why.<br />That being said, I understand that most readers are looking for the technical side of the argument and the book has that in spades. Particularly nice chapters are chapter one, which does provide a little context for the use of JMX, and provides a very nice, though brief, overview of the JMX architecture. Chapter six, on agent notification is also excellent.<br />Frankly, I would love to see a second version of this book with more emphasis on use cases. For example, chapter 7, on dynamic MBean creation, would do well to cover why you would want to use Model MBeans, and not just assume the reader understands the solution out of context with the need.<br />If you are on a project using JMX or an architect who is already looking at JMX, this book is worth the look. If you are looking for a gentle introduction to the topic, keep looking.	2004-04-26

I got what I wanted with this book, save the server configuration portion. There was some information on servers, but nothing on how to set one up or get it going. Which makes sense because each server is different, but it would have been nice to see at least one, perhaps OpenLDAP.<br />Chapters one and two stand out as an ideal introduction to the history of LDAP, it's current structure, and the basics of LDAP schema. Chapter nine, on accessing LDAP operational data, is excellent. The explanations are great, graphics are used effectively, and the code samples are concise.<br />The only two drawbacks that I can think of are the lack of a server setup and configuration chapter, and the books slight emphasis on Perl as opposed to Java. I personally like the Perl side, but I can see how some folks might prefer Java. There are a lot of Java examples, but there are more examples in Perl.	2004-04-26

The book is exactly what it says it is, a wide overview of all of the different ways for 'Programming Mac OS X'. It starts with a brief history of the operating system, then talks about the operating system basics. It then covers at a high level building applications with Java, Objective-C, Carbon, Applescript and Perl. This includes sections on the tools to use to develop in these languages, and in some basic introductions to get you started on that platform.<br />In Manning style the graphics are effective, and the code samples are not overused and are well commented. Chapters three and four, which cover Project Builder and the standard compilers, stand out as the heart of the book. Chapter seven, on Applescript, is particularly appreciated because of the lack of documentation or books on this subject.<br />The book fills a unique roll. It covers all of the different programming possibilities at a level that gives you perspective of the entire playing field. If you want to drill down into say, Java programming, you will need to buy another book. But if you are unfamiliar with OS X and you are looking to program for it, you should take a look at this book to get a feel for the possibilities.	2004-04-26

Read the the lines, &quot;Linux&quot; and &quot;Fundamentals&quot; on the cover, and that is what you need to know.<br />If you are familiar with the classic &quot;Advanced Unix Programming&quot; you will be familiar with what this book covers and appreciative of the update. In short, this book covers the fundamentals of shell programming with C; files, directories, signals, memory allocation, process control, permissions, that sort of thing. It does not cover network programming or X11 GUI programming.<br />What I liked about it was primarily that it imparted experience. For example the section on creating temporary files pointed out both good and bad ways to write the same functionality. The text was expository and informative. Where Advanced Unix Programming was a little dry and stiff in tone, this book is a little heftier, goes into more detail, and is written in a more experiential and friendly manner.<br />There is a lot to like about this book. If the subject, within it's constraints, interests you, then you should get it. If only to broaden your depth of understanding as to how Unix works and how to write programs for it. If you are looking for books on network programming, xml, multi-threading, web serving, or X11, you should look elsewhere, but you should probably still look at this book to bone up on 'Linux' 'Fundamentals'.	2004-04-26
694127:US	50389232	RN1CH2ROV42W1	078214327X	897987368	Coder to Developer: Tools and Strategies for Delivering Your Software	Books	5	26	27	N	N	Great source of ideas, techniques and technologies	Coder to Developer is one of the best technical books I have read in years. Like The Pragmatic Programmer and Software Craftsmanship before it, this book teaches how to be better engineer in the areas outside of strict coding. Yes it teaches a little about specific coding practices, but the intent of the book is to cover the breadth of skills required of a true developer. Skills like project management, architecture, engineering process, source code control, and relating to the customer. These are the types of career skills than will move you from a coder cog to an invaluable developer.<br />Mike finds the right depth in the book, not too deep into the technical details, nor so abstract as to be an architectural tome for the ages. When it comes to coding the book is primarily focused on C# on the .NET platform, but you should let that dissuade you. He covers a wide variety of techniques and technologies and the book is valuable for anyone involved in the engineering side of the software industry.<br />The book follows the rough timeline of application development, from nailing down the feature set in the first chapter to delivering the product in the last chapter. The book is fairly brief (roughly 300 pages). Chapter by chapter:<br />Chapter one covers planning out your project. It covers gathering requirements and how to decide on a development methodology for the project. It gives a decent overview of all of the popular development methodologies and pointers as to where to learn more. It also covers some software that you probably didn't know was out there but that can help you as you nailing down the feature set.<br />Chapter two covers architecture and gives a nice overview of both the UML and Patterns side of the business, and the more fast and loose XP development process.<br />Chapter three covers source code control and it's one of the best chapters in the book. When I got through chapter three I knew already that the book was worth the purchase price. Thischapter covers in a very concise manner the best practices of source code control and the products that are available on the market.<br />Chapter four is a brief introduction to sane coding practices; using tools like assertions and exceptions, and how to comment code effectively.<br />Chapter five gives a high level, but insightful, summary of the unit testing, system testing, and the technique and benefits of test driven development. This is one of the best chapters.<br />Chapter six covers the IDE and how to make the best use of it. This is a fairly Microsoft specific chapter, but you can learn some tricks that are applicable to other development environments.<br />Chapter seven covers a topic which is often ignored, the skill of digging into code at the system level and finding your way around.  This one is definitely .NET specific, and it was a little too low level for me. Your mileage may vary.<br />Chapter eight covers code generation, a topic near and dear to me. It's a very practical chapter introduction and should save .NET developers a lot of time.<br />Chapter nine is about bug tracking and fixing. As with the rest of the chapter this is a concise introduction to the topic that gives you a feeling for the benefits of bug tracking, which should be obvious, and advice about tools and process. Once again I have never seen a book that provides a good argument with the brevity of Mike's writing style. Code Complete, for example, covers this stuff, but it's thick and impenetrable. This book gets right to the core of the topic and presents it in a very accessible way.<br />Chapter ten covers logging, which can be overdone. Again pragmatic and practical advice. But this chapter is fairly .NET specific.<br />Chapter eleven is about the dynamics of small teams. He introduces Instant Messaging, Wikis, and group ware. A nice introduction, but a bit brief.<br />Chapter twelve is about both end-user and code documentation and the tools to develop it quickly.<br />Chapter thirteen covers the build process. The tools are fairly .NET specific (nant), but the process and the methodology are appropriate to any production software development shop. Another nice chapter with content you will be hard pressed to find in such a concise form anywhere else.<br />Chapter fourteen is about licensing. This is important for open source developers. It has a nice comparison of the popular open source licenses and makes sense of all of the legal gobbledygook.<br />Chapter fifteen is about installers and application delivery. It's primarily for .NET desktop application developers.<br />There is an old story about a developer that is walking out of a tech show empty-handed, he says to the security guard that he 'Stole a fortune'. The security guard, puzzled, asks, 'But you have nothing.' The developer responds that he now has new ideas! This is that kind of book. It's full of ideas for the software process, ideas about how to code, and ideas about tools you can use.<br />If you are an engineer who is passionate about his craft, this is an important book for you to read. But you probably know that already.	2004-04-24

Spidering Hacks is just that type of book. The web has a wealth of structured and semi-structured that is just waiting to be mined with automated tools. This book not only teaches you how to get the data out of these sources, but gives you idea about where to look for information and what to do with it.<br />This book demonstrates everything I like in a technical book. It not only describes how things are done. It also gives practical examples of how the technology can be useful in the real world, and presents them enthusiastically. It makes you want to go out and implement all of the ideas and to keep on going with some of your own.<br />Nitpicks I have with the book are minor. The 'Hacks' format seems imposed, for example, hack #8 is about installing CPAN. I don't think that section should be left out, but I don't think it's a hack either. But hey, I don't care that much about the structure as long as it isn't an imposing flaw and the content within the structure is great, as it is with this book.<br />Have to say, O'Reilly is on a roll with the Hacks series. They have all been fine books.	2004-03-22

The first section covers C++ fundamentals that apply to the patterns in the second section of the book. It's the second section, which implements many of the Gang of Four's design patterns in C++ using templates that is the heart of this small book. <br />The C++ templates are designed well and the code is out of the box usable. The graphics are good, but somewhat sparse. If there is anything I could fault the book for it is it's length. More expository time could be spent on the templates and the relationships between each of the templates, classes and code fragments. Templates, at least to me, are confusing at the best of times. So I would have appreciated some more time spent in explaining their function.<br />For the hard-core C++ coder this is an excellent book, particular in conjunction with the Gang of Four's Design Patterns book.	2004-03-22

It is well written and edited, it also provides a thorough description of the entirety of the standard. What it lacks is more depth in the area of recipes for commonly used image effects. It also needs more advice about how complex SVGs are organized and built for efficiency. I understand that SVG is still on the adoption curve, so perhaps we could see these improvements in a second version of the book when the standard has picked up a little more.<br />For the time being the book earns it's four stars by providing a nice learning curve and having high quality examples that demonstrates the concepts effectively.	2004-03-22

Many of the patterns, the Data Transfer Object pattern, for example, are fairly specific to the J2EE structural problem at hand. Other patterns, like the Lazy Load, are good architectural patterns on any platform. There is enough generic content to justify the purchase of the book for architects implementing on any platform (J2EE, .NET, PHP, etc.) but it does favor the two current platforms de jour; J2EE and .NET.<br />One of the nice things about the book is how the code tends to de-emphasize the application container by doing most of the work in the raw database access systems (e.g. JDBC), which makes it easy to understand what is going on but will offend the true J2EE believer. This makes the patterns in the book accessible to anyone coding in any environment, which I greatly appreciate.<br />One pet peeve is that some of the patterns are obvious shells for a single technique, such as the Transform View, which is really just XSLT. The text says as much, but shouldn't there be more than one example of a particular pattern in nature? It's just a pet peeve though, it's no reason to avoid the book.<br />Overall, the book is well written and edited and the graphics add to the exposition but are not gratuitous. It's a useful guide for anyone looking to raise the level of the enterprise application (read web application) thought up to the next level.	2004-03-22

Read slowly the book provides not only a good introduction to the syntax of the language, and in some ways the applications written with it, but also the thought process which should go into the use of the language, the actual skills of programming applications. That being said the book puts understanding the syntax first and is written and edited in such a way as to be educational.<br />I recommend the book to those looking to understand the fundamental of C++ and the core set of system libraries. For those unfamiliar with C++ you should understand that unlike VB, C# and Java the platform specifically libraries are held at arms distance in C++. So you won't find any information in here about the Microsoft Foundation Classes or any other platform specific libraries. You will need to get another book to get into those. This is not a fault with the book or the language, you just need to make sure you get both a book on C++ (probably this one) and a book on your specific platform.	2004-03-22
736820:US	50389232	R2YICX7GGOI3ZK	0201786958	567630326	Exploiting Software: How to Break Code	Books	4	7	12	N	N	Lots of how to break, not a lot of how to fix	I suppose any book about how to hack software is going to be controversial, but think about it, unless you know what the holes in software are how are you supposed to fix them. Using the right framework isn't enough because every framework is going to have security issues. You actually need to understand what is going on and this is the true value of the book.<br />The coverage is not just at the bits and bytes level. The authors cover the theory of each exploit and then dig down into what happens at the processor and virtual machine level to complete the exploit. The problem that I find with the book is that it doesn't complete the cycle by bringing the reader back through the process to identify a robust fix for the hole. <br />I'm still giving the book four stars though because it does present the vulnerabilities in a qualified way, which makes for interesting read and for cool thought puzzles in how to fix the security problem, or to extend the attack method to other vulnerable areas.<br />For anyone tasked with securing a complex application, especially one that is connected to, or serving on, the Internet, you should read this book. Both to understand the scope of the security problems and to see how you can fix the vulnerabilities in your own code.	2004-03-22
736961:US	50389232	R22FE51FVM3QAC	0130353132	215750353	Thinking in C++, Volume 2: Practical Programming	Books	5	16	17	N	N	Excellent followup to volume one	Volume Two picks up where the first left off, without skipping a beat. It starts by covering exceptions and unit tests, both of which should see more use in the real world. It then goes onto cover the standard C++ library in more depth that the first book. He then covers templates in a chapter that he calls 'Templates in Depth'. Yes, the coverage is long, about one hundred pages, but I would rename the chapter 'Templates at a practical level', which is exactly the where the coverage should be left. Templates, like macros, can be overused and have had whole books that cover the topic. Eckel chooses, and I think wisely so, to cover the topical to the extent that it would help you write practical templates yourself and to be able to use template libraries such as the Standard Template Library (STL).<br />The STL is covered, well, in the two chapters that follow the template chapter. Once again the coverage is not absolutely complete because of the grand scope of the field. There are long books on the STL, but these chapters provide a pragmatic and thorough introduction which should serve for most practical purposes. <br />The final chapters cover advanced topics. Notable are the chapters on Design Patterns which are designs for templates and classes what are considered industry 'best practice'. So instead of redesigning the wheel you use a design pattern, where appropriate. If you get into design patterns you should also read the extremely popular Design Patterns book, now in it's 25th printing.<br />In the final chapters is also a discussion on multiple inheritance and threading. Both of which are covered at a pragmatic level and have whole books dedicated to the subject.<br />This is an excellent, and needed addition to the original Thinking in C++ book. Both of the books are written in an accessible style and cover the topics at a practical level without rat-holing. For aspiring C++ programmers there is probably no better set of books to read as an introduction to C++.	2004-03-22

I had read all of the O'Reily Perl books and found myself in charge of a large Perl project writing new code. I hired on a real Perl guru and he taught me a ton, in person, about how to write Perl as Perl and do it well. What amazes me about Perl Medic is how much of what the Perl guru taught me is in this book. It's as if I had the man by my side again.<br />On it's face that makes it sound like you should pick up the book immediately. And for someone who is serious about Perl I think you should get this book. But there are still some faults. It could be a little better organized. And some of the common problems, like CGI scripts having embedded HTML, could be given more prominence and the text templating alternative given some more space. I looked in the tiny index for HTML::Template and found only two references, both of which were pretty short.<br />In what is probably both a curse and a blessing the book is not only about fixing legacy code. The majority of the book is about becoming a better Perl programmer and writing Perl as Perl. There are a few chapters and the beginning and end that are specifically about working with legacy code, but the majority of the book is practical insights into Perl coding styles using code fragments with effective exposition.<br />Small problems aside. This unique book is fun to read and is packed with valuable insights if you spend the time to look. The author obviously knows a lot about Perl and understands how to convey that knowledge to the reader effectively. If you are looking to maintain some Perl, or if you have hit a plateau in your understanding of Perl and you need a push to get to a higher level this book is for you.	2004-03-18

There are enterprise design patterns books, like Addison-Wesley's new Enterprise Patterns and MDA, which show you how to model your enterprise application. Then there is this book, which focuses on implementation patterns for enterprise class applications on the J2EE platform. <br />My criticisms are minor. The first chapter which covers J2EE basics (probably unnecessarily) could have spent a little longer on it's description of UML. The technical points on CGI are in error, and the traffic estimates are inflated well beyond where people will see scalability issues in production, especially with resource intensive application servers.<br />There are several critical Java design works, including Bitter Java and Bitter EJB. This book is at the level of those works. It even references Bitter Java in a later chapter on Anti-patterns.	2004-03-14

If you are looking for a focused guide to XQuery practical applications you aren't going to like this book. It's worth repeating, this is not a general reference or introduction to XQuery. This is a set of articles on XQuery related topics. The first 'chapter' is an introduction to XQuery which is actually quite good. After that is a chapter on the history of XQuery. Then there is a chapter on XSLT and XPath, which is a nice, but brief, introduction to those topics. There is a section on the semantics of XQuery which is so thick you could cut it with a knife. The book finishes with two chapters on relational to XML mapping.<br />If you are a serious XQuery user, are interested in a case study in standards development, or are into relational theory this book is probably worth a look.	2004-03-14

Standout chapters for me were chapters seven, on XSLT, and nine, on web services. That being said all of the non-reference chapters were evenly written, easy reads and neither rat hole nor pander to the reader. The code samples are numerous but they are hilighted with bold to emphasizes the portions that a critical to the narrative.<br />C# is the only imperative language covered in the book even though most .NET authors cover both C# and VB.NET. In the introduction the author calls C# the central language of .NET and says it's the best language for the job. I don't have big issues about that but other potential .NET readers may, especially considering the popularity of VB.NET. Personally I prefer when the author chooses one language and then leaves the other to the site or the CD. I think VB.NET example code fragments on the O'Reilly site probably would have been a safer bet.<br />It's this one language approach in the dual language .NET environment that kicks the rating from five down to four.	2004-03-14

It's separated into three sections. The first being a thorough but brief introduction to all aspects of the API. The second section is an API reference. And the third a quick reference. This third section is included on the CD that comes with the book and will integrate into Visual Studio.<br />Don't expect the first section of the book, which is an introduction to ADO.NET to give you a gentle introduction to the subject. That's not the Nutshell form. If you don't know ADO at all you will want to buy both this book and an introductory book. If you know related APIs, or you know ADO.NET and you need a refresher or have weak spots you will find some new things in the first section. For me it was the support for disconnect access and also the integration with the XML features of SQL Server 2000.<br />Although this book stays true to the Nutshell form it is a little longer in the introduction than the usual. The introductory section is seventeen chapters and is almost half of the length of the book. So if you are an intermediate or advanced engineer I think you could probably learn enough ADO directly from this book without any other introductory book.	2004-03-14

The book covers the basics. The SAX and DOM approaches. It also covers XSLT and serving XML. It also covers advanced topics like Castor, JDOM, and web services. But most of the subjects are covered at a cursory level and do not serve as a complete introduction.<br />There is a small reference at the end of the book which is not as easy to read as the APIs described in the Nutshell style.<br />I gave this book four stars because, while it does lack focus, it is a good introduction to the XML APIs for Java. In the third release they should concentrate a little harder editing in some focus and a better reference section at the end.	2004-03-14

The organization presents a nice ramp from some simple examples all the way to complex wizard style forms interfaces. You will see illustrations of the key points of the standard, but what I didn't see were examples about complex form validations or much in the way of best practices.<br />It's tempting to base the success of a book about a standard, especially one of the first few books on a standard, on the success of the standard itself. It would be wrong to do so as the book is an individual entity that has it's own unique merits. I haven't judged the book based on the success of the standard. I have judged it on it's translate the standard and to provide perspective. It certainly translates the specification into a readable text, but it fails to provide a large perspective about how to best apply the standard in the context of a complete application.	2004-03-14

This isn't an MDA reference. There is one small, but well written chapter on it.<br />But that's a minor quibble. The real value of this book, and the bulk of the book, is in the third part which gives in depth models for the common enterprise application requirements. They start with an excellent object model for a 'Party' (as in a contact database), and continue on at the same level of depth for other common entities and processes, such as orders, payments, purchase orders, business rules, monetary values.<br />These patterns are probably too in-depth for a small business application, but they serve as an excellent starting point that you can trim to create a model that has the right level of complexity for your application.  Don't let the big title of the book fool you. You can find books on how to write SQL, and generally how to model a database for a given problem domain, and other books on how query the database and make transactions. The value of this book is in giving you recipes for models for the basics of your application.	2004-03-14

It's all about having a flexible front-end and serving XML out as HTML and WML, or using it for internationalization. It's coverage of code generation is very, very minimal. There is also very little in the way of advice about increasing processing efficiency. There are also small mistakes; for example the misstatements about CGI and Servlets, which is a common error in Java articles and books.<br />That being said, the examples are well annotated and the XML is highlighted for readability. The code is loosely annotated, which is the O'Reilly style, but it still makes some of the larger code fragments had to follow.<br />As long as you know that this book is a little dated you will find reasonable material in here about XML, XSLT and how to get it into Java. It could use a second edition with more topical material.	2004-03-07

Though it is not specifically written that way.  I'm mixed about why this book was necessary. The topics are a hodge-podge. Which leads me to the 'set of articles' notion.<br />That being said, overall the writing is good and the topics are fairly well covered. Chapter three, on tools, is a standout. There are some problems, the code isn't well annotated, and some chapters, like chapter 9 on Speech, feel out of place altogether.<br />For those looking to make use of some OS X specific features with Java, you will like this book. It's pretty specific though, so for the casual reader I would recommend against it.	2004-03-07

Those would be people who buy and sell on EBay for a living, or are likely to do that in the near future. For those this book has 330 pages of in-depth material about how to buy and sell, and, at some level, about how to automate that process. This book is less like the other Hacks book in that it has more expository detail about the human side of the story, and less about writing small Perl programs to do stuff. That's fine though, since no Perl program will help you get positive reviews from your buyer's and sellers, but the tips in this book just may help you do that.	2004-03-07

If you like the C/C++ lint checker puzzles in the C/C++ User's Journal you will love this book. It's all seeing the little mistakes in other people's code, like a detective. Now, if you learn by other peoples mistakes you should buy this book immediately. If you are like the rest of us then your purchase should depend on whether you like programming detective work and puzzles. If you like that, then this is a great book.	2004-03-07

The technical depth that was a little overwhelming in the second section has been smoothed over and some parts have been moved out of the core of the book and into the appendices.<br />The unique value of the book is in it's ability to anticipate and answers the questions of Unix users who are looking to migrate to OS X, and in that it performs very well. Ever question I had in moving from Linux to OS X is answered in this well-organized work.<br />The book starts with the Terminal and how it can be tweaked or even replaced. It then covers the unique startup and directory services. Other user level services and applications are covered, but I liked the last section on third party tools the best. That chapter alone would have saved me a lot of time before I bought the book. The second section covers building applications on the unix layer and this edition adds a chapter on Perl which is excellent. The coverage of Fink, which is a critical, if poorly named, tool for OS X has been greatly improved in this edition. The fourth section, on databases, is well-written and is a nice-to-have to for readers, but it probably not exactly in line with the book as it's not significantly different with OS X.<br />If you are switching from any unix to OS X you will find this book a well written and invaluable accelerators to get out over the hump of getting the right tools and finding what and where to tweak.	2004-03-07

The first four chapters, which are an introduction to the basics about file management and shells is the best part. In particular chapter three, about the file system, is excellent. The later chapters tend to get a little too heavy a bit too quickly for my taste. But they cover their content and do it thoroughly.<br />The Fink coverage, as with OS X for Unix Geeks, is too light. This is an important utility for those that want to use OS X as a Unix machine and it deserves more coverage than it got.<br />Overall the book is a good introduction and reference, but it is light on opinion. There are lots of ways to work and to organize stuff in Unix flavored operating systems and the book gives little in the way of advice or opinion. Which is sad, but not unusual. I can't penalize the book for that though. I just wish that more technical books would state opinions from experience.	2004-03-07

The book doesn't get into applications until chapter 10 and it's coverage of the RSS applications is pretty minor. However, there are some good points. The XML examples are highlighted, which makes them very easy to read. The tough subject matter, meta data about meta data, is well covered in-depth. <br />I gave it four stars because it is merely mis-titled. The first ten chapters do a solid job, with excellent graphics, explaining RDF. So if you are looking for an general RDF book, you have probably come to the right place. If you are looking for a book to explain why your blog's RSS doesn't validate, you shouldn't buy into the practical title, or this book.	2004-03-07

Serious amazon users are most likely vendors selling on or through Amazon. For those types this book is chock full of hints and tidbits about how to use Amazon directly and how to automate their usage through Perl and the web services API. So if you knew that Amazon had a web services API and have used it, you will get a lot out of this book. Otherwise I would recommend hanging back because you probably won't get a lot out of it.	2004-03-07

For the end user the Windows side is covered well enough, but probably not at the level you would want. For the Mac end-user the coverage is only about OS 9, which is crazy for a book published in 2003. For the power user you will want Wireless Hacks from O'Reilly, which has much more in-depth coverage of the hacky side of wireless; packet scanning, hacking hardware, making your own antenna, shotgun wireless.	2004-03-07

The book has an interesting mix of coverage of the GUI and then the corresponding Unix layer. This dual coverage brings the topics covered home quite nicely. Some of the topics covered are; the Terminal, process control, file access, startup handling, printing and networking.<br />I consider this the most accessible of the recent crop of O'Reilly OS X books on Panther. If you are a reasonably skilled end-user or engineering looking to get under the covers of your Apple this is probably your best bet.	2004-03-07

It's coverage of everything from the operating system level stuff, to drivers, to cards, to hacking cards, to building your own antenna, to doing shotgun wireless is just incredible.

But at 48 chapters each one is really small. This is because the book is actually a set of articles. Some of the articles are fantastic and very helpful. Specifically between 18 and 23, which cover text handling for stuff like smart searching and internationalization. Other chapters, like 37, which is about Perl Haikus, are really for the hardcore Perl lover.<br />For the average Perl user, check it out to make sure that you are getting the content you need. For the hardcore, you were going to by this book anyway, so why are you reading reviews. ;-)	2004-03-07

It's primarily an introductory work, the first 260 pages are introduction and the final 240 are a reference that is organized as an appendix. <br />The writing is solid, and it by no means panders to the reader, so you should be prepared to read over sections multiple times to completely understand the topic. I can't penalize the book for this because the topic is fairly complex. <br />On the downside there could be more in the way of real world examples in the text as they explain so of the more complex topics. It easier for the reader to retain the information if they knew why they would be using the language feature in the real world. In addition the book needs a section on existing tools and support for XQuery. <br />Strong chapters are chapters five and six which cut to the heart for the FLWOR expression syntax. <br />Overall this is a fine introductory work that could use some expansion and some more focused explanations.	2004-03-04

This book is that has taken that same approach to data condensation and applied it to everything you need to know about ASP.NET. And extend they have at almost a thousand pages it is far heavier than the original books, but that doesn't make it any less worthwhile. <br />The first section covers all of the conceptual introductions to the topics, .NET controls, web services, configuration and security and all of the basics. The second section covers each section of the class library in a concise and consistent form that make it so much easier to grab for the book before you even press F1 to bring up the MSDN. Where necessary they include code fragments to demonstrate the point along with the explanatory text but it is never overblown or unnecessary. <br />This isn't light bedtime reading but it is an invaluable reference to sit next to the keyboard of any ASP.NET programmer.	2004-03-01

It doesn't have deep coverage of the class libraries, it focuses on the central languages features in the first two sections and then covers their application in the second and third. But it's the first section of the book, which covers each of the core language features (variables, conditionals, class use, class construction, collections and data structures, etc.) where the book shines the brightest.<br />I don't having anything particularly negative to say about the book. The code samples are brief and use sparingly. There aren't many screenshots, and I prefer it that way. The text is well written and concise. And the author sticks to the central themes of each section without delving into the minutiae. <br />This book is O'Reilly at it's best, well written and edited, built specifically with the engineer in mind, and taking the time to develop and refine a work that helps the reader as opposed to inflating the author.	2004-02-28

The book starts with an introduction to the XP methodology (which is concise and great), and then has chapters on a number of tools (Ant, JUnit, HTTPUnit, XDoclet, Tomcat, etc.). Each of these technology chapters has a number of 'recipes' which are in fact how-to segments about commonly used tasks around these technologies. Now these sections are great and I think anyone looking at these technologies should consider this book a quick and concise way to learn the fundamentals.<br />That being said the book fails somewhat, and thus the four stars, because it isn't organized in the problem/solution manner of the cookbooks. Most of the chapters are about testing but these are organized around the tool and not the problem. I would have preferred a section on web development that combined information on Tomcat and Ant, and one on web testing that talked about HTTPUnit, JUnit and Ant. In that way the book addresses problem areas without relying on the reader to understand the tool that would address his problem in addition to understanding his problem at hand.<br />My gripe is not so critical. The content in the book still remains very valuable and if you are looking for a concise how-to in these Java technologies you should have a look at this book.	2004-02-27

The text is very thorough and the author obviously knows what he is talking about. On it's face that makes this a must have book for NG users.<br />It's not without it's flaws however. The graphics are poor and there could be more done to impart how the Relax NG specifications relate to the specific XML examples they are validating. In addition the book provides little information about tools and support for NG, and also neglects to relate NG to any of the other XML validation standards (DTD, XML Schema.)<br />For a book about a tough subject it does a lot in a small space. For someone looking for information about NG who is going to apply it in the near term this is a fine work.	2004-02-27

Whether you wrap them in an O/R mapping layer or write the SQL directly you are going to get to SQL at some time. And often you will find that you need to be able to tune and optimize some of the critical queries for the best performance. But how do you get there?<br />SQL Tuning covers reading the execution plans, tweaking the queries and diagramming the plans so that you can understand what the server is doing and how to optimize it. <br />This is a unique book for O'Reilly which is a publisher most at home with works that are mainly code or API references. This book instead teaches a methodology and does it well. No quick fixes or cookbook style approaches are presented. This book teaches action through a deep understanding of the topic at hand, and if you use SQL on systems that require high performance then this is an understanding relevant to you.<br />Here are the key chapters:<br />Chapter two presents the internal of the database in a solid introductory manner.<br />Chapter three teaches you how to read execution plans.<br />Chapter four teaches you how to control those plans on Oracle, DB2 and SQL Server.<br />Chapter five teaches you a way to diagram the plans to understand the in more detail.<br />Chapter six shows you how to analyse those plans then then turn that into a new execution optimized execution plan.<br />As you can see, no quick fixes here. This is a book about a methodology and how to apply it. Bravo O'Reilly and Dan Tow for this important and unique work.	2004-02-27

The book does indeed cover a wide range of .NET topics organized from the outside starting with coverage of complete application architecture including EAI with other systems, and them moving in towards the operating system, the web server, the development architecture and SQL. All of these topics are covered at a white paper level. In fact, the whole book reads and feels like one large white paper.<br />So, on the up side it's a very good high level introduction to all of the concepts involved with .NET development of web applications. It's well written, although it could use some editing, and the concepts are explained well.<br />One the down side, the book really does feel like an extended white paper. The topics aren't covered with enough depth to satisfy engineers so this book is probably best for architects and managers who want a high-level introduction to .NET. It's pretty buzzword heavy, for example in chapter four the coverage of workarounds around limitations in the operating system is called 'best practices'. Don't expect any coverage of systems other than Microsoft or comparisons to alternative systems.<br />The interesting chapters:<br />Chapter one covers EAI, content management systems and UML, which is an interesting place to start. The coverage is brief but well done.<br />Chapter two covers the various windows services. This is a good introduction to the topic.<br />Chapter three covers windows clustering and is one of the best chapters in the book, clean, concise and well written.<br />Chapter five is the heart of the book. It's a super long chapter that covers everything about web application architecture in .NET including design patterns and coding standards. Both the design patterns and coding standards section could have been in appendices. I'm not sure the design patterns was worth covering at thedepth that it was.<br />Chapter six is about web services and it's a fine chapter that runs a bit long. Still, it's one of the best chapters in the book.<br />Chapters seven, about IIS, and eight, about SQL, would have been better a little longer and more detailed. The SQL chapter could have mentioned some use of alternative database servers.<br />Chapter nine, which covers and example application, probably should have been in the beginning with the rest of the book covering the example in greater depth.	2004-02-25

The first four chapters provide an excellent grounding in Aspected Oriented Programming (AOP) with AspectJ. In particular the first chapter, which introduces the reader to AOP, shows the quality of writing and editing that Manning is known for.<br />Chapters five through to the end apply AOP to various problems within Java application development, starting with logging (of course, the AOP perennial favorite.)<br />On the downside I would have liked to have seen more information about where AOP is being used in production today. I'm not sure what the timing of the release was, but it would have been nice, if possible, to have had material on the use of AOP in JBoss.<br />I have not read the other books on AspectJ, so I cannot provide a comparison of them. Even so, I have to say that if you are into AOP, or more importantly, looking at AspectJ, then I think you have to look at this book.<br />(Full disclosure: I am a Manning author but I in no way allow that to effect my reviews.)	2004-02-25

It's valuable for any developer, not just those on XP projects, because a lot of the failures in the XP process are actually failures in almost any large project development and management process.<br />I call this book 'tight' because it is short and concise, it uses external sources appropriately, it gets to the point, it argues well, it references itself internally, and most importantly it does the information 'boil down' for you, which is what you buy books for in the first place.<br />There is only one downside and that is the books tendency to repeat some small quotes and sections multiple times. This is mainly an artifact of the compensation the authors have to make in the structure of the book to allow for readers to read the book chapters in random order.<br />One other small nitpick is that some of the example projects in the book were just CMM level 0 projects disguised as XP projects. So it's hard to equate problems in those projects with fundamental flaws in XP. Thankfully the book does not rely on that evidence alone.<br />The chapter hilights:<br />Chapter one provides an excellent case study against XP.<br />Chapter three provides some realistic insight into XP as it stands today, warts and all.<br />Chapter four on to almost the end lovingly disassembles XP tenet by tenet. <br />The last two chapters provide some solutions for XP projects which is important because otherwise the book would have been straight rant without providing alternatives.<br />All in all an outstanding book. Well worth the money.	2004-02-25

It clocks in at 600 pages with judicious screenshots and lots of well annotated code.<br />What makes this book interesting is that it takes the same application and builds it using six different Java frameworks (JSP, Tapestry, WebWork, Interbeans, Velocity and Cocoon). What detracts is that while it provides pros and cons to each issue it fails to assert the best overall, or to provide an analysis of which would be best for a particular scenario. Chapter 11, which is about how to evaluate the frameworks actually doesn't do the evaluation. That is an exercise left to the reader. So if you like to choose between well documented options, you are in the right place. If you are looking for some Gartner style analysis and conclusions, you are in the wrong place (but there is no right place that I know of.)<br />The interesting chapters:<br />Chapter two provides an implementation in JSP and then covers the cons of that approach.<br />Chapter three provides a nice introduction to Tag Libraries as a way to increase reuse from the straight JSP model.<br />Chapter four is an excellent introduction to the Model 2 architecture.<br />Chapters five through ten cover the various frameworks. Strangely Velocity and Cocoon are covered when the author himself doesn't even consider them frameworks.<br />Chapter eleven provides a detail set of criteria to evaluate the frameworks, but does not itself evaluate them.<br />The chapters that follow are lumped into 'best practices' and cover a grab bag of technologies and issues including EJBs, performance, caching, debugging and unit testing, and axis. As if to provide a fitting end to a grab bag section the last chapters  covers everything that 'would'n't fit in the book'. This whole section could probably be dropped with little damage to the overall work.<br />The book is fairly well written and editedthough it does make some sweeping generalizations and grandiose statements that are all too often the hallmark of Java books.<br />If you are looking for a way to get information about a cross section of front end technologies for your Java application then this is a good book to look at. If you are looking for something that makes recommendations, you won't find them here. In addition, if you are looking for a book that covers the entire Java technology stack for web applications, this is probably not it. The book was probably mis-named.<br />(Full disclosure: I am a Manning author but I in no way allow that to effect my reviews.)	2004-02-25

It covers most of it's topics on a cursory level and provides a good introduction to the topic. Weighing in at ~300 pages with ten chapters you get about 4-40 pages per topic.<br />That being said, there chapter on Web Services is excellent. The explanations are great. The book is well written and edited which is something that we expect from Manning. <br />So in the final analysis, you will probably still need spot books on various key topics and a subscription to MSDN to go along with the purchase of this book. But if you are someone new to Windows development, especially for web applications, you might want to take a look at this book.<br />(Full disclosure: I am a Manning author but I in no way allow that to effect my reviews.)	2004-02-25

It's short but that doesn't stop it from covering the topic well. The authors just stay on track and cover the required material in a brief and balanced manner.<br />On the down side there could have been more context about JUnit and it's alternatives. The first chapter covers this somewhat but after that it is JUnit all the way.<br />On the upside, the book is well written and edited. It is concise and sometimes witty but not to the level of going off track.<br />The interesting chapters:<br />Chapter one introduces JUnit and shows some alternatives, mainly doing tests by hand.<br />Chapter two covers JUnit completely in detail. Which is almost a bit too much too fast and I found myself a little lost in the detail. It could stand to be broken up a little.<br />Chapter four is an excellent introduction to test driven development. This section alone is almost worth the price of the book.<br />Chapter five covers integrating JUnit into existing tools like Ant and Eclipse.<br />The second part then applies JUnit to each of a number of different types of code, including web pages, tag libraries, data access, etc. This is the heart of the matter and it's done very well. This connects the code you have to the JUnit test framework step by step. It's very well done.<br />If you are using JUnit or are interested in test driven development in Java this is a fantastic book and is well worth the money.<br />(Full disclosure: I am a Manning author but I in no way allow that to effect my reviews.)	2004-02-25

In this case it's about the integration of XML into Microsoft's Office Suite for 2003. This is an impressive peice of work and it shows through in the book, which is far superior to his XML handbook, though it does suffer from similar problems. Once again the book has aggressively short chapters and has an uneven level of detail. In addition some of the chapters feel like a lift from the handbook, which is not necessarily a bad thing give that they are from the same author. And the book also has a strange organization, for instance leaving the explanation of XML standards and syntax to the last few chapters of the book. <br />That being said the book is still far better than the XML Handbook. And I think in large part that has to do with the fascinating topic which is Microsoft's excellent work in integrating XML into their products. This is a worthy read, especially if you are a developer looking to leverage the XML capabilities of the Office suite.	2004-02-24

A book isn't one star simply because the content of the book wasn't what you intended. If you expected a book on reflection I'm not sure why you thought a book on code generation was going to do it for you. Perhaps you are thinking about runtime code generation, but I'm sure that would be in the title.<br />Back to the book. I think it's great. The only flaw I can find is that it's almost too detailed in spots. She presents an entire framework for building SQL DDL, stored procedures, an ORM layer, and user interface with both WinForms and HTML from XML descriptions. She also provides a larger perspective on code generation in the context of the development cycle as well as avoiding the common pitfalls. The jovial tone also keeps it light.<br />Anyone skilled enough to understand how code generation can revolutionize their development process should be able to handle the VB, XML, and XSLT used in the book, and either apply the principles in derivative work, or use her code directly.	2004-02-15

The first six chapters provide a very solid grounding in Qt. The standout chapters are the first chapter which provides an easy introductory ramp, the third chapter which covers modeless application development by using a spreadsheet as an example, and the sixth chapter which covers layout management. All of the chapters are worthwhile but those stand out as justifying the purchase price of the book. The writing style is clean and fairly terse so the reasonably advanced reader should get it on the first go, while the beginner may need a pass or two. <br />The shortcomings are minor. There is no reference portion to the book and while I understand that a full reference would add a significant bulk to the book a class reference with brief descriptions for each method would be appreciated. There is one large reference graphic that shows the class structure of the library. Syntax highlighting, especially on the large code fragments, would have been appreciated.<br />A quality work for anyone looking to develop on Qt, well worth the expense.	2004-01-30

This book is neither fully a reference or an introduction. On the positive side the book provides a terse and intelligent introduction to the topic. On the negative side the explanation of a complex topic like XPath not covered in as much depth as it probably should be, and there are some extraneous sections on HTML and CSS which are better covered in other works. On the whole a good book, but not a great book. If you are interested in XSL you should try Michael Kay's XSLT Programmers Reference and Sal Mangano's XSLT Cookbook.	2004-01-12

Goldfarb Definitive XML Series)	Books	3	15	17	N	N	Unique resource, with issues	The fifth edition of the XML Handbook is an interesting beast all in <BR>itself. It's huge. The size of no other 'handbook' I have ever read, <BR>weighing in at 1200 pages. My guess is that this book has grown from <BR>edition to edition and has become the beast we see now. Starting with <BR>the negative:<br />* The organization of the book needs work. The chapters are in an <BR>almost random order. For example, the chapter that describes XML at an <BR>introductory level is number 51, which is almost at the back of the <BR>book.<br />* The organization of each chapter needs to be normalized into a format <BR>that would ensure that each possesses valuable information. This book <BR>is somewhat similar to the classic Design Patterns book in that it <BR>covers a wide variety of topics. Having a chapter format that readers <BR>can follow will make it easier to use the book as a reference work.<br />* The graphics are inconsistent at best. Some are horrible in quality. <BR>Others are too large. I wouldn't have bought the book if I were <BR>flipping through it at the store. The quality of the graphics, which <BR>seem to be largely borrowed company graphics, is too inconsistent.<br />* The chapters are very short. There are 69 chapters in a 1200 page <BR>book. You do the math. The chapter on XSL:FO, for example, is six pages <BR>long. Barely enough text to introduce the topic, let alone explain it.<br />* The book is not self-referential. For example, the topic of vector <BR>versus bitmap graphics is covered twice. And the chapter on acronyms <BR>simply lists their definitions without pointing the reader back into <BR>the book for more information about where those acronyms are explained <BR>in more detail. My guess is that this is an outgrowth of the organic <BR>development of the book.<br />All that being said, I am still giving the book a good rating because I <BR>believe that it is a unique resource in the XML world. It's chapters <BR>cover a variety of topics so sweeping that it provides a high level <BR>overview of the entire map of XML development. Chapter 66, which <BR>provides an overview of all of the different MLs is very good. Other <BR>chapters, such as the RDF chapter (36) are also a very good <BR>introduction. The breadth of the coverage is what makes this book <BR>unique. All of the drill-down technology specifics are covered better <BR>in other books.<br />Is it worth buying? Tough to say. I think for someone tasked with a <BR>high-level understanding of XML it is a valuable resource because it <BR>provides an excellent tree-top perspective of the XML landscape. For <BR>someone who is thick in the implementation of XML standards, it's <BR>probably not worth it.<br />What the book really needs is a thorough development editing pass to <BR>reorganize the book, normalize the chapters, remove redundant content, <BR>and to fix the problems with the illustrations and the text.	2004-01-12

It covers everything, Javascript, HTML, DOM, Dynamic HTML, the whole lot. It does it well, which is amazing given the amount of coverage.

Far and away better than Ruby in a Nutshell, which is too terse to be useful. The introductory section provides a smooth ramp into learning Ruby, and the reference section in the back is so good that it's literally dog eared to the point of falling apart in my version. You can get this online for free, but if you are serious about learning Ruby (and you should be, because it's a great language), you should buy this book.	2003-12-14

It's a solid work, but it's one flaw is that it is neither a completely how-to book, nor is it completely architectural work, so it will probably frustrate most readers to some degree.

I was tough on Bitter Java because of it's technical editing. This book is decidedly better in that department but I can't give it all five stars because the difference in tone between the chapters and between the authors is noticeable and somewhat distracting. In addition the anecdotes about white water remain and I think they are unnecessary. That being said, if you are a J2EE programmer, this is a required book.	2003-12-14

If you are doing serious amounts of Javascript on the front end, or in some scripting environment, this is worth getting.

This is a handy reference, but if you have a limited budget you should probably go with Programming Perl and the Perl Cookbook before this one.

I wouldn't go looking to it for advice on how to solve particular problems with XML Schema. But if you are looking for a quick reference guide that covers all of the syntax with annotated examples then you have come to the right place. The graphics, which are light-weight and to the point help to illustrate the key points.<br />Two minor complaints are that the structure of the book is odd (chapters at the end of the book which are clearly appendices are structured as chapters), and the index is also a little short.<br />On the positive note, XML schema is not a particularly exciting topic and Neil's tone keeps it a light and interesting read.<br />So far this is the best book I have read on the subject.	2003-12-11

This technique is unreliable, in that it may create invalid SQL.  It is also insecure, as it allows sending arbitrary expressions to the SQL server.  It is also ineffecient, as it does not use the inline replacement syntax that most SQL servers allow for and can optimize.<br />Page 113 advocates using a numeric index based parsing methodology for handling the result set from an SQL query.  This technique is weak and easily broken.  Symbolic references, such as hash tables aligned with aliases in the SQL is a much stronger pattern that is much harder to break.<br />Page 113, 115, etc. advocate using strings for every type of data returned from the database.  If the book advocates using a strongly typed language, why weaken it to a sub-Perl standard by using strings for all data types.  I understand that this makes the JSP display code easier to write.  If that is then intention then the model code is being weakened by the requirements of the view code.<br />Page 119 is using a for loop based indexing pattern over a returned results set.  An enumeration pattern is best suited for this activity.<br />The section on caching presents a Perl based solution which is then replaced because the Perl did not cache.  However, the author points out that the cache could have fit in memory.  Most mainstream databases would have the database in memory and thus would only have the overhead of the network traffic, which in most cases is neglible.  The author then proposes a solution with a singleton based cache which limits the entire deployment to a single web server (unless you want to put the singleton in another process, which gets you back to the neglible network overhead case.)  A single server is much less scalable then multiple servers which use the database as cache.  In short, this example throws the baby out with the bathwater.<br />Page 133 discusses the dynamics of a cache without introducing the notion of a forced cache flush.  In complex caching systems a dependency mechanism for intelligent cache maintenance is a requirement.  Certainly it merits at least a mention in this overview.<br />Page 137 makes reference to Listing 5.2, but no labelled listing 5.2 is to be found.  Able readers will make the connection, but in general the listings should be numbered if they are to be refered to by number.	2002-06-26
