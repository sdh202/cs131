Detective Jane Rizzoli is caught up in this situation when she is one of the hostages taken in a hospital.  Jane is nine months pregnant and going into labor.  This is one of Gerritsen's best novels.  A fast pace and unrelenting suspense make the pages fly by.  The conclusion is a real nail-biter.	2005-09-28

Goldy is at the top of the list and must find the real killer to clear her name.  The pace moves along at a fast clip and there is a very surprising twist at the conclusion.  All the recipes are gathered at the back of the book.  I prefer the recipes to be included in the story as they have been previously.  If I wanted to read through recipes, I would go to a cookbook.  Still, except for having to flip back and forth when Goldy is making something good, this is an excellent addition to the series.	2005-09-18

Although, if you are a true dog lover, you probably have already implemented many of these suggestions.  The only one I disagree with is howling with your dog in the back yard.  That might not make your neighbors happy.  The pictures of the dogs included in this book are some of the best I've ever seen.  A fun book for dog lovers of every breed.	2005-09-05

She caters an event at an expanding shopping mall and disaster strikes, as it usually does when Goldy is present.  The worst part is, her dear young friend Jullian is arrested for murder.  Goldy sets out to solve the crime and get Jullian out of jail.  This is an especially well-plotted story that moves along at a rapid pace.  Never a dull moment.  The regular cast of characters are present and as enjoyable as ever.  A multitude of nasty suspects gives the reader plenty of opportunities to boo and hiss.  As always, many wonderful sounding recipes are included.  I made the Spice Of Life Cookies and they turned out great...soft and full of flavor like a good molasses-type cookie.  Davidson's books should come with warning labels.  Caution: May cause weight gain.	2005-09-01

Sullivan suffers a severe brain hemorrhage and finds herself totally paralyzed, but completely awake and aware.  She is given a questionable treatment by the Chief of Neurosurgery.  It is left to Steele to determine what a group of doctors in his hospital are up to.  Throw in a fanatical murderer on the loose who is killing doctors, and you have a fast paced thriller.  Clement has developed some intriguing characters for this outing.  Realistic descriptions of stem cell research add to the mix.  The skulking killer was a bit over the top, but needed, I suppose, for the suspense.  Overall, a good read with a very exciting conclusion.	2005-08-24

During the excavation for her basement, a skeleton is unearthed.  Meanwhile, women are being found to have been murdered in a way that recalls a serial murderer of twenty years ago.  Sue Henry weaves a wonderful plot in which several characters could be the perpetrator.  The reader worries Jessie will trust the wrong person while suspecting another.  As always, Henry's landscape and wildlife descriptions are so well done, it's almost like being there.  I read Sleeping Lady several years ago and I don't remember the story, but I remember the descriptions of the Alaskan wilderness. These books let the reader reside in the wilderness for a little while with all the perks and none of the hardships.	2005-08-07

He told his signing bonus story and I determined then and there to find out if he'd written a book and if so, to read it.  I'm very glad I did.  I don't think I've ever had so much fun just reading a book.  Uecker talks about his life in baseball and broadcasting.  Pictures are included.  You don't want to read this book when you are alone.

Slightly reminiscent of Harlan Coben's recent novels...a basically decent guy caught up in circumstances beyond his control, fighting to redeem himself.  There was a misspelled word and a grammatical error on the very first page, and I was worried the book would be unreadable.  But, the story took off and if there were errors, I didn't notice them.  I think a lot of people read books like this for a peek into the highlife and there is a bit of that here.  The pace moves along at a good clip.  The plot is a good one and leads to a very exciting conclusion.  At times, the story becomes a little too cute, especially where FBI agent Ellie Shurtleff is concerned.  This is a fanciful lightweight read.  Perfect for summer.	2005-07-25

She and Detective Andrew Ryan travel to Israel and begin an investigation of its origins.  Kathy Reichs has jumped on the Da Vinci Code bandwagon with dismal results.  I was surprised this story was such a jumbled mess.  Reichs' books are usually very good.  As if the convoluted plot was not bad enough, the characters go over the clues again and again.  It's as if the author thought the reader would have trouble following the story if she didn't repeat the steps in the plot at every turn.  Some serious students or archaeology or anthropology might find something of interest in this book, but they will have to wade through a lot of nonsense to get to it.	2005-07-18

His Fiance has been in a coma for four years and he is devoted to her, visiting her on a regular basis. Out of the blue, he has been chosen by a devious killer to make decisions concerning future victims...who should live, who should die and how they should die.  The premise of this story is surprisingly original (hard to find these days).  Some very unusual characters people this book and they are all very life-like (which is pretty scary when you think about it).  Dean Koontz is sometimes unpredictable as a storyteller.  I loved Odd Thomas.  I didn't care for Life Expectancy.  But, Velocity is one of those books that is very hard to put down.  I wanted to make it last, but just couldn't do it.  The pages fly by.  An excellent read.	2005-07-10

No such luck.  Disaster follows Stephanie in each new job she tries.  I think that this, the eleventh book in this series, is one of the best.  Familiar characters and situations that mirror past stories combine to make this a fast paced read.  Humor lightens even the most disastrous occasion.  A steady diet of Stephanie Plum could prove tiring, but one episode a year is a nice break from the darker entries in the available fiction.	2005-07-06

It's obvious from the beginning that the same person is responsible for both of them.  But what is not obvious is who is the killer.  Then there are more killings and Lucas Davenport feels responsible for not catching the killer in time to prevent them.  Sandford does a good job leading the reader on a wild goose chase.  The sex and violence in this one is pretty hard to take at times.  Definitely not a book for the squeamish. Some of the procedural was a little tedious, but overall, the pace moved along a very good clip, which led to a very exciting conclusion.  I especially enjoyed Lucas' list of 100 rock and roll songs for his iPod.  But, Piano man?  I would have included one or two from Robert Palmer.	2005-07-03

A homeless woman is murdered in Duluth a few weeks later.  Is there a connection?  Lucas Davenport, in his new role as head of the statewide bureau of criminal investigation, is called in to investigate.  I had some misgivings about this one when I saw the words \\"Russian\\" and \\"spy\\" in the book description.  I am not a fan of spy novels.  But Sandford, as usual, makes this about the characters and not shadowy governmental machinations.  There is humor here.  Some of it is laugh out loud.  The story is not especially suspenseful.  The reader is in on the plot from the beginning.  What makes it interesting is how Davenport and his team put it all together.  This was an enjoyable read and a very good addition to the Prey series.	2005-06-24

He is working cold cases with his former partner, Kiz Rider.  Harry is happy to be back (almost giddy for Harry).  Before he even starts his new job, he is confronted by his old nemesis, former Chief of Police, Irvin Irving and is threatened with failure if he steps out of bounds. The case that Harry and Rider are working is the seventeen-year-old murder of a young girl.  Before too long, Bosch realizes that Irving probably had a hand in derailing the original investigation.  There are plenty of twists and turn and misdirection. The pace never lets up and leads to a very satisfying conclusion.  As always, Connelly has police procedure down to a fine art.  Harry's demons are kept in check in this outing which I found refreshing.  His dark moods were getting to be a bit tedious.  I liked everything about this book.  A must read for fans of Harry Bosch.	2005-06-14

Circumstances conspire to put Max Hunter, a decent young man, in prison for four years.  Nine years after his release, he is married, expecting his first child and living in New Jersey.  In another part of the country, an aging stripper is visited by a young woman who is looking for information concerning her birth mother. Meanwhile, back in New Jersey, A woman detective agrees to help a Mother Superior discover why a recently deceased nun was found to have had breast implants.  Coben weaves these stories together for a whopping good read.  The pace never lets up.  The characters are engaging, and the plot is very well done.  I was a little disappointed with Coben's previous novel, Just One Look.  But, in my opinion, he has more than redeemed himself with this book.	2005-06-06

She breeds and trains bloodhounds and occasionally contracts with the county to use her dogs for search and rescue.  In this outing, Jo Beth tracks a mentally altered 84-year-old woman who has wandered into the swamp.  Meantime, Jimmy Joe Lane has escaped from prison again and has convinced himself that he and Jo Beth are meant for each other.  His views on courting Jo Beth are bizarre, to put it mildly.  This is a very good and comfortable read, as are all of Lanier's stories.  I was saddened to hear of Virginia Lanier's passing.  I am going to miss her stories.  It's a joy to read about the southern lifestyle...the etiquette and traditions.  But the true stars of these books are the heroic and loveable bloodhounds.  A must read for all dog lovers.	2005-05-27

Anna goes undercover as waitress at a high-class hotel to learn what she can about the missing people and she soon finds herself in deep peril.  This outing was darker than Barr's pervious novels.  The Yosemite Valley in November is dark and dreary and Barr's usual sparkling landscape descriptions reflected the dismal weather.  The mystery is a good one and the story moves along at a good clip. Although this addition to the series was a little depressing it is still a good story and the ending was a crackerjack.	2005-05-20

Now that I'm older, the old folks are gone and I've missed out hearing their stories forever.  In a way, this book is a second chance.  Lawrence Ritter has made a Herculean effort tracking down all these players and getting their stories.  Baseball fans owe him many thanks for the job he's done.  There are many interesting stories told between these pages, but one of the most surprising to me was that these players called the games themselves most of the time.  No coaches and the managers sat back and let the players play, for the most part.  I especially enjoyed the story by Rube Bressler about three players ending up on third base at the same time.  This is a must have collection for baseball fans.  I thought \\"The Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told\\" by Jeff Silverman was a little more entertaining, but this collection held my interest too and is a book worth keeping.	2005-05-12

It's different from other novels where my imagination is needed to bring the characters to life.  I've seen and come to like these characters from watching them on TV.  What is even better, in these stories the team is still working together and not split up like they are now in the TV series.  In this outing Gil Grissom arrives at a crime scene with his team to find a murder victim that looks very similar to several murders from 10 years ago that were never solved.  Is the killer back or is this a copycat?  The resolution is more procedural than suspenseful, but satisfying nevertheless.  If you enjoy the TV series CSI, you should really treat yourself to these books.  The stories are all original and not copied from the shows on TV.  Now if someone would do for ER (my other favorite TV show) what Max Collins has done for CSI, I would be a very happy camper.	2005-04-27

I am a baseball fan, but I'm not especially learned in baseball history.  These stories, all by a different author, have deepened my love for the game and engendered appreciation for the men who play the game, past and present.  I admit up front that I am a die-hard Dodger fan.  The chapter by Vin Scully on Sandy Kofax's perfect game gave me goose bumps.  I learned my love of baseball from my father, so the chapter by Doris Kearns Goodwin was especially meaningful (brought tears to my eyes).  She tells how her father taught her to keep a score book for the Brooklyn Dodger games, then relay to him, play by play the entire game when he came home from work.  She tells how, when the score was close toward the end of a game, she had to ask her mother to take notes while she left the room because the anxiety was just too much to bear.  I, too, have had to do this.  Of course, the first chapter with Abbott and Costello's \\"Who's On First\\" is a classic whether you are a baseball fan or not.  I enjoyed every page of this book and plan to pass it along to grandkids who also love the game of baseball.	2005-04-25

After just a few pages, I was reminded why she is one of my favorite authors.  Park ranger Anna Pigeon has been transferred to Fort Jefferson on Garden Key, a small island fort that was used as a prison during the Civil War.  Anna's great, great aunt Raffia was the wife of the Captain of the fort and Anna has the letters Raffia wrote home to her sister telling her about her life in the fort.  While Anna investigates a boat explosion off shore, she is also deeply into Raffia's letters and the reader gets two good stories for the price of one.  With some authors, landscape descriptions can be tedious and even annoying, but Barr is a master at this and her descriptions are so rich and real they transport the reader effortlessly to the places in the story.  From diving amongst the coral reefs to walking the parade ground of the fort during the Civil War the stories unravel.  The danger in Anna's and the danger in Raffia's world increase page by page until the suspense is almost unbearable.  This book goes to the top of my Nevada Barr favorites list.	2005-04-08

But before Josef Tock passed on, he made several predictions.  He told Jimmy's father that there would be 5 terrible days in his son's life and even gave him the dates. <br /> <br />On the first of the terrible days, Jimmy finds himself in a bank and disaster soon follows.  The dialog in this particular part of the book was so silly it almost defeated me.  I put the book down and it was several weeks before I could bring myself to resume reading.  I remember a bit of this type of silliness in Odd Thomas, but in this story, it was almost overwhelming.  However, when I did get past the bank scene, the story improved quite a bit.  There were plenty of edge of your seat, heart-pounding moments that led to a very surprising ending. <br /> <br />Of course the whole premise is highly improbable.  It did spring, after all, from the fertile imagination of Dean Koontz.  I just wish Koontz would leave the humor to authors like Janet Evanovich and stick to what he does best...good old fashion scary tales. <br />	2005-01-27

I did like the character, Archie, but the detective investigating the case, Merci Rayborn, was mostly just annoying.  Frequent references to Merci's mysterious past were intriguing at first, then tedious.  I am a big fan of T.

Brown goes right to the heart of the battle between religion and science.  I don't want to ruin it for other readers by giving away too many details, but there were a few interesting facts (?) put forward.  (I wonder how many readers pulled out a one-dollar bill to study the back after Langdon's explanation of the symbols.  I did.)  This was a fairly interesting read, but I found myself skimming pages at about the halfway point.  The scene in the Church archives was particularly tedious.  The pace picked up considerably toward the end and led to a very exciting conclusion.  If I hadn't read and enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, I doubt I would have chosen to read Angels And Demons.  I thought The Code was much better.	2004-10-04

Dr. Sara Linton is a pediatrician and part time medical examiner for the county and her ex-husband is the police chief.  They begin the investigation, then Sara's sister is viciously attacked and the suicides are starting to look suspicious.  They may be homicides.  Some of the characters that people this book are pretty strange.  I didn't realize this was a continuation in a series until I was well into the story.  Maybe I would have had more sympathy for the reoccurring characters if I had read the previous books.  I had a problem believing in Sara Linton as a doctor.  I may be unfairly comparing her character to that of Gwen Hunter's Dr. Rhea Lynch who seems to me a very competent doctor.  There are several very graphic descriptions of the crime scenes and some fairly explicit sex scenes, that might not be for everyone.  This was not a comfortable read.  But, like a particularly bad car accident, it was hard to look away.	2004-09-24

Parker does a wonderful job of introducing his characters to the reader without a lot of tedious details.  I've read many of Parker's previous novels and it's his writing style that keeps me coming back.  He tells a good story and keeps the pace moving at a good clip.  His characters stay with me long after I've finished a book of his.  I can still remember Silent Joe...one of my favorites.  Tom McMichael will stay with me too.

Reichs is very good at character development and she continues to add depth to the characters in this outing.  The plot is interesting and leads to a spectacular conclusion.  There is an irresistible hook at the end of almost every chapter, so if you are going to put this book down, you'll have to do it mid-chapter.  Some readers may find the technical forensic sections a little tedious, but I found them very enlightening.  I prefer the books in this series that take place in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Montreal seems rather dismal to me.  But this is a good addition to the series and adds a lot of depth to the character Tempe Brenan.	2004-08-22

That alone is worth the price of admission.  No matter what kind of mood I'm in when I start an Evanovich book, I soon find myself giggling at the antics of Stephanie, her friends and family.  I find myself reading passages out loud to my husband to get him laughing.  In this outing, Stephanie has lost another car to catastrophe and is reduced to driving her late uncle's '53 Buick which gets about 5 miles to the gallon.  A contract is put on Stephanie's life by a local gang.   The plot of this story is a little weak, but that's not why I read an Evanovich book.  It's the journey, not the destination that makes this series so good.  As mentioned by a few other reviewers, the ending did seem a little abrupt.  I was looking forward to Valerie's wedding (bound to be a lot of fun), but I guess I'll have to wait until the next installment for those laughs.  If you are looking for a deep, meaningful, thought provoking read, you won't find it in this book.  This one is simply good fun.	2004-08-06

The first half of this book was great with Milo and Alex tracking down clues.  Then the pace slows a bit and the plot becomes a little scattered.  At first, I thought the international angle was over the top, but by the end it made more sense.  I always enjoy the interaction between Milo and Alex and it was in good supply in this outing.  So, although the story bogged down in places and at times seemed over-complicated, it was an interesting read and the good ending left me satisfied.	2004-07-25

He is soon reconnected with Rachel Walling and on the hunt for Richard Backus (The Poet).  I read both of these previous novels (and saw the movie Blood Work) and although I would recommend reading these books because they are so good, I think this story can stand alone.  Connelly gives enough background to set the stage for this story.  And I really appreciate that he gets the reader up to speed without a lot of tedious details.  Connelly cuts to the chase and what a chase it is!  Suspense and action fill the pages from beginning to end.  Michael Connelly finds just the right mix of beautiful prose and gritty reality.  Harry Bosch is a complicated and interesting character.  I've read all of the books in the Bosch series and Harry is still a mystery to me....as it should be.  An excellent addition to the series and I look forward to the next glimpse into the fascinating world of Harry B.	2004-07-03

One of the people in the picture looks like it might be her husband.  Shortly after she shows the picture to her husband, he goes missing.  In Coben's past novels his main characters have been men who have to do battle with evildoers.  I was curious to see how he handled a woman as the hero.  In past outings, Coben's male heroes bumble around, get lucky and save the day.  Grace Lawson is considerably stronger and smarter.  This makes for a more believable tale.  Toward the end of the story, I thought the conclusion was going to be disappointing....too simple.  But there were several surprising twists that made for a very satisfying ending.  This was a fast paced and very entertaining read.	2004-06-11

One day, Jena McClaren shows up in her office with a problem.  The hospital has declared Miss McClaren to be dead.  Vicky must sort out this problem and finds this mix up is just the tip of the iceberg.  What follows are mysteries and intrigue involving drug experiments and murder.  The pace of this story drags quite a bit in places.  A little more action and less of Vicky Lucci's thought processes would have been nice.  The characters were interesting and the dialog was good, but the story itself was just mediocre.	2004-06-04

In the small rural town they find themselves in, they discover not only murder, but kidnapping and a car theft ring.  The plot seems a little scattered at first, but comes together by the end of the book.  Sandford's writing style and sparkling dialog carries the story when the plot seems to loose direction.  The second half of the book was worth waiting for.  Lots of action and surprising twists.  Overall, a very good read.	2004-05-30

It's been quite some time since I read the first Liam Campbell novel, but I had no trouble picking up the story.  The first one third of this book was very good, but then the pace became a little uneven.  Although the relationship between Liam and his girlfriend, Wy was enjoyable early on, towards the end it became tedious...interrupting the hoped for conclusion to the mysteries.  The humor with which Liam faces life and the good plot twists toward the end saved this one from being a total wash.  Maybe I have come to expect too much from Stabenow because her previous books have been so good.	2004-05-16

So, when this story didn't get off to a running start, I trusted Rule to have chosen an interesting story to tell and knew it would soon turn into a riveting tale.  I was not disappointed.  The clich, \\"you can not make this stuff up\\", applies here.  This is not a feel good story, but it's a very interesting read.	2004-05-09

But Crichton has made this more of a people story with characters who are very appealing.  Jack is a former software engineer.  He is now a stay-at-home dad with three children.  His wife, Julia, is a vice president for a company developing nanotechnology.  The reader is quickly caught up in their everyday lives, then strange things begin to happen.  This is a fast paced, action-packed story.  Towards the end, it turns sort of Stephen King-ish, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The conclusion is non-stop suspense.  An exciting and scary read.	2004-04-24

Jessie Arnold has agreed to drive a motor home from Idaho to Alaska for the contractor who is building her new cabin.  These two worlds collide on the highway and Jessie finds herself smack dab in the middle of trouble.  There is less story involving her dogs in this one, although she does have her lead dog, Tank, with her.  This story is more about the characters she meets on the road and they are an interesting bunch.  There is a lot of scenic description, which Henry always does very well.  This is a good story for readers interested in travel. Some of the chase scenes were riveting, but the mystery, itself, fell a little short.	2004-04-15

She then hears from a neighbor of hers from ten years ago who is coming back to Alaska and needs her help.  Then an arsonist strikes a local hangout.  Jessie's cabin is the next target.  Connections to her neighbor's past are revealed and Jessie is soon in fear for her life without knowing who she can trust to help her.  Jessie Arnold is one of my favorite characters.  She is strong, smart and capable.  This is a well written, fast paced mystery with a good plot and interesting characters.  My favorite parts of a Henry novel always involve Jessie's interaction with her dogs and there was plenty of that in this story...it's almost like being there in the middle of the pack!  A very good read.	2004-04-05

It turns out the senator was having an affair with her.  Sound familiar?  This story seems to be loosely based on the Gary Condit and Chandra Levy story.  The narration jumps around from one character to another, but once I got used to this style of writing, the story was easier to follow.  I'm not normally a big fan of political thrillers, but Hill made this one interesting.  The characters are complex and the dialog is especially well done.  The story moves along at a good clip and there were frequent hooks to past secrets that kept me turning pages.  There was a bit of graphic sex toward the end, which might not be for everyone.  Even if the reader is not familiar with the Condit/Levy story, I think they will find this an interesting read.	2004-03-25

He waits for a heat wave to hit, then kidnaps two girls.  He kills one and leaves her body to be found with clues on it leading to the other girl who is still alive.  The first half of this book has a few slow paced sections, but the well-drawn and appealing characters hold it together.  The second half is a race to a conclusion that is a stunner.  Even the acknowledgements at the beginning of the book are entertaining.  This is the first book by this author that I have read and it has sparked my interest in her other novels.  A very good read.	2004-03-22

Very, very clever).  Detective Jane Rizzoli and Medical Examiner Maura Isles are among the first on the scene.  At first glance, it seems obvious what happened.  One of the nuns who was attacked was young and attractive and had recently given birth.  The priest for the nuns is also young and attractive...but no.  There is more to this mystery.  Much more.  The pages of this book just fly by.  I have enjoyed Gerritsen's previous novels, but she has outdone herself with this one.  I hated to see it come to an end.  An exceptionally good read.	2004-03-14

When a mass grave is discovered, Rhea is deputized as the coroner on a temporary basis and she must adjust to dealing with dead bodies rather than healing the living.  As in the previous books, the ER scenes are riveting.  The characters are engaging, especially the newest addition, mysterious Eli Cordell.  But most of all, it's because Hunter is such a good storyteller that I enjoy her books so much. There are a few things left unresolved at the end of this story, but I'm sure they will be addressed in the next book.  I can hardly wait!	2004-03-01

The premise of this book sounded intriguing, so I accepted a copy of the book from the publisher with the promise to review it.  This was an adequately written story.  The pace was a little inconsistent at times.  I never did warm to the main character, Owen MacDara, but I'm not sure why.  There was some fairly graphic sex scenes included which didn't seem necessary to the plot.  This wasn't one of my favorites, but if you like complex political thrillers, you will probably like this one.	2004-01-28

He is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to see dead people and evil ghost shadows (bodachs).  This story is fast paced and full of great characters.  About halfway through the book, some of the dialog between Odd and his girlfriend, Stormy, struck me as a little silly which was surprising because the writing in the rest of the book was so well done.  Some of the phrasing was really exceptional.  For instance: Odd is trying to fathom why some people get caught up in Satanism...\\"Certain fourteen-year-old boys, yes, because some of them were washed half loose from reason by shifting tides of hormones\\".  It's phrasing like this that makes the journey through this story so enjoyable.  The descriptions included, especially of the bodachs, are so vivid, it's almost like watching a movie.  I do hope a movie is made from this book...it would be a glorious visual experience.  As this story neared it's conclusion it was so intense, it was difficult to resist peeking ahead to check out the resolution.  I don't know if Koontz has ever brought back any of his characters for an encore, but I would certainly be interested in any book in the future that features Odd Thomas.  This was an excellent read.	2004-01-24

He is given the choice of going to prison or going to work for his boss's competitor and providing him with valuable corporate secrets.  Adam chooses to become a spy.  The level of interest never wanes.  This is a fast-paced, action-filled story.  Adam Cassidy is a strong and likable character and carries the story well.  With books like this, as I near the end, a conflict occurs.  I want to slow down and make the book last awhile longer, but I'm eager to read faster to discover how the story resolves.  I wasn't successful at going slow.  This book is better than a hot fudge sundae and it's impossible to make it last.  Be prepared for an unusual ending.  A very good read.	2004-01-14

There is a lot of technical computer speak which many people might find interesting, but I thought was a little tedious.  There was less humor too.  I especially missed the frequent dry wit displayed by Gil Grissom in previous outings.  All in all, it was less flashy, but still an entertaining read.	2003-12-13

Swamp Morgan, a retired Secret Service agent, is brought in by the newly formed Department Of Homeland Security to determine if a fire at a Washington DC plastic surgery clinic is a firefly (not a serious threat to national security) or the first wave of a terrorist plot.  This story bogs down in places with too much detail and the numerous acronyms for government agencies were a little annoying, but the action scenes were very good.  I liked the characters, especially Swamp Morgan and Nurse Connie Wall.  This wasn't an easy read, but the conclusion was full of suspense and surprises and made it all worthwhile.	2003-11-21

Harry Bosch is no longer carrying a badge, but he is determined to get answers to a mystery he was never able to solve while on the job.  This is a tightly woven investigative novel.  At 360 pages, there is no fat and no filler.  As always, Connelly's characters spring effortlessly to life without a lot of tedious background information.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It held my interest from page one until the end.  I was afraid that City Of Bones was going to be the last of the Harry Bosch books.  I hope there are still more coming.	2003-11-08

She was a good friend of the Shaw of Iran and is a friend to Imelda Marcos...that is a big hint.  Not only is her constant name dropping annoying, but her trials and tribulations in adjusting to a new dog are tedious.  And, just a side note...what self-respecting breeder would place one of her dogs in a home she has not personally investigated?  I don't know Cindy Adams and I've never read her column.

It's one year later and another hot summer in Boston.  Detective Jane Rizzoli is on the trail of a killer who's crimes bear a similarity to the Surgeon who she helped put behind bars the previous summer.  In this outing, the attention centers more on Rizzoli. Her prickly nature is a little off-putting at first, but I grew to like and admire her as the story progressed.  I did miss Detective Thomas Moore who played a large part in the previous book.  I found myself anxious to resume reading each time I had to put this book down.  It held my interest throughout and the action was non-stop. The content is fairly grizzly and might not be for everyone.  I would strongly recommend reading The Surgeon before picking this one up.  As a sequel, it lived up to all of my expectations.  A very good read.	2003-10-04

I didn't think the level of suspense could be sustained for 450 plus pages, but it was.  There is a suspenseful hook on almost every other page.  Well-drawn characters, believable dialog, and a crisp writing style combine to make this fast paced story hard to put down.  I can't speak for the accuracy of the `facts' presented in this book, but as a mystery/thriller it works extraordinarily well.

He discovers his neighbor's dog killed with a pitchfork and decides to solve this mystery.  The view of the world through the eyes of an autistic child is very enlightening and well presented by the author.  About halfway through the book, the dog's murderer is revealed and one of the hooks for the story is lost, but it sets up the plot for the second half of the story.  Fear is the major motivation in Christopher's life and he shows a great deal of courage in overcoming his fears.  At times Christopher's ramblings were repetitive and tedious.  His emotional disconnection to the people in his life was disturbing and very depressing.  I was impressed with the idea for this book.  It is an ambitious attempt to understand the workings of the autistic mind. However, the later stages of this story were rather dark and I was relieved to have finished it and to get my mind back to my `normal' life.	2003-09-06

I haven't read any of Koontz's books for quite some time because they were beginning to seem too much alike to me.  This one, however, struck me as fresh and original.  I liked the characters, especially Ethan Truman, the ex-cop and head of security for Channing  Manheim the famous actor who is called The Face.  I thought it curious that The Face was chosen for the title because he had very little to do with the story.  I'm glad I gave Dean Koontz another chance to entertain me.  He did just that.	2003-08-30

As Ryan arrives in Charlotte to whisk Tempe away, body parts start turning up requiring Tempe's attention.  I guess that viewed from a distance, the various parts of the plot and all the coincidences make sense, but at first glance it all seems pretty far-fetched.  There are numerous characters that require the reader's close attention just to keep track of them.  However, I did enjoy this story.  I especially liked the antics of Boyd, the chow who has a newly discovered talent.  Apparently he very good at sniffing out cadavers.  I liked Reichs Fatal Voyage very much and although this outing wasn't quite as good, it still made for an enjoyable read.	2003-08-08

The conjurer is killing people, seemingly at random, but it soon becomes apparent he has a plan.  The magic and forensics makes for an unbeatable combination in this story.  I was frequently tempted to peek ahead a few pages to learn the resolution of some of the situations.  I didn't, however, care for the evidence charts included at intervals.  They were redundant and the print was too small for me to read comfortably.  I found I could skip these charts and follow the story just fine.  This was a very clever thriller with a clever plot and several clever characters.  I especially liked the addition of Kara, a young, student magician who contributes helpful information to Rhyme and Sachs' investigation.  Nothing in this story is what it seems and the ending is filled with spectacular twists and turns.  A very good read.	2003-07-27

Anton Burns, the engaging lead character, is an agent with the Wyoming Department of Criminal Investigation and an amateur rock climber.  Several murders in Laramie are starting to look similar to Burns.  Two men are on trial and facing the death penalty, but the accidental death of a woman rock climber that agent Burns is investigating seems to have evidence that points towards murder and has some clues in common with the sensational murder case being tried in court.  As Burns gathers evidence to support his theory, he has to deal with some very serious personal issues.  McKenzie weaves an ambitious plot that comes together in an action filled conclusion.  Rock climbing scenes interspersed with courtroom drama keep the reader interested throughout the story.  Anton Burns is a great character and I would welcome more stories about him.  However, my favorite character in this book is Ozo, Burns' Mastiff-type dog, who goes everywhere with him.  Ozo even `spots' Anton on his solo climbs.  Put a dog in a story, any story, and you have won me over.  This was a very good debut novel.	2003-07-15

Elvis Cole is taking care of 10 year old Ben Chenier while Ben's mother, Lucy, is out of town.  Lucy and Elvis have been together for awhile and now Elvis is getting closer to Ben.  Suddenly Ben is kidnapped from Elvis' home.  There seems to be a connection between Elvis' Vietnam War years and the motive for the kidnapping.  The flashbacks to Cole's experiences in Vietnam are absolutely riveting...a little reminiscent of Black Hawk Down, but even better.  Joe Pike is back after suffering significant injuries eight months earlier.  He is still not 100%.  Will he be able to help Cole save Ben?  The ending is tension filled with non-stop action (took me half an hour after I finished the book to get my neck muscles to relax).  An excellent addition to the Elvis Cole series.	2003-06-25

But then I read Lehane's Shutter Island and liked it very much.  I took a look at all the glowing reviews and heard that Clint Eastwood was going to make a movie of Mystic River and decided to give it a try.  Big Mistake.  I just don't understand why dark, dismal, depressing stories pass for artistic writing these days.  When one of the characters (Dave Boyle) recounts his take on how baseball fans react when their team looses, it was so far over the top I had to wonder at the author's sanity.  I struggled through to the end hoping for an uplifting resolution, but I didn't find it.  I realize I am in the minority here.  I can not think of a single reason to recommend this book.  I was not enlightened and I was not entertained.  I feel like I wasted my time.	2003-06-22

Shutter Island sits off the coast of Boston and is home to Ashcliffe Hospital for the criminally insane.  Teddy Daniels, U.S. Marshall, and his partner, Chuck Aule, arrive on the island to help in the search of a missing patient.  What actually goes on at Ashcliffe?  Unconventional psychiatric treatments?  It's difficult to review this book without giving too much away.  Several other reviewers have said they were unprepared for the shocking ending.  So I prepared myself by paying close attention to all the clues.  But it wasn't enough.  As I finished this book, sitting in a well air conditioned room, I actually broke out in a sweat.  That has never happened to me before.  What a stunner!  Some reviewers have said they thought Lehane's previous novel, Mystic River, was better.  I just can't imagine that.  So, I'll put Mystic River on my must-read list.  It's going to take me awhile to get over Shutter Island, though.	2003-06-10

This is an easy book to get into.  DeMille's writing style is smooth and witty.  But when Brenner arrives in Vietnam, the mystery is put on the back burner and the story becomes a travelogue of 1997 Vietnam.  For those with an interest in Vietnam, this book is an excellent read.  I, however, have little interest in that country so the 800 plus pages were a struggle to finish.  Paul Brenner is a very likable character, but I never did warm to the character of Susan Weber. I did learn a lot, but I felt I was mislead in my expectations of a mystery.	2003-05-31

The main character Carley DeCarlo, is a financial advice columnist and finance usually bores me to tears.  But there is much more to this story than finance.  There is research for a cancer cure, murder, theft, betrayal and stalking.  All the things that make for a good juicy tale.  It is not exactly an original plot, but MHC is such a good storyteller she makes it seem fresh.  She reveals just enough to keep the reader guessing to the end. Carley seemed a little too sweet at times, but believable for the most part. The medical aspects of the story were sometimes vague and imprecise, but that was easy to overlook because the plot was the star of this book and if some of the parts didn't ring true, all can be forgiven for dramatic effect.  One of my favorite lines was, \\"A good night's sleep means that all parts of my brain come awake at the same time\\".  MHC must have been enjoying a morning like that when she came up with the idea for this book.  My decision to read this book was a good one.  A very enjoyable read.	2003-05-24

Dr. Marc Seidman wakes up in the hospital after being shot and almost killed, to learn that his wife was killed and his six month old daughter is missing.  Coben weaves a fine tale of death, destruction and double-dealing over a period of eighteen months.  As Marc searches for his daughter, the reader is taken on a wild non-stop ride.  If you like Coben's two recent novels, Tell No One and Gone For Good, you are going to love this one.  The characters are very well drawn.  I loved the character, Verne, dearly.  The action never lets up and the ending was very satisfying.  Just one thing.  The title, No Second Chance, is misleading. There is a second chance.  Actually there are more than two and Dr. Marc Seidman handles each one with sometimes bumbling and sometimes brilliant action.  An Exceptional thriller.	2003-05-16

Grissom and Sara travel to upstate New York for a forensic conference where they stumble upon a dead body in the woods next to their mountain hotel.  And then a blizzard hits and they are cut off from the outside world. Collins handles the background information on the characters without being tedious and although this is the third book in the series, I think it can stand alone.  Both of the cases in this book are excellent but the makeshift lab they set up in Grissom's hotel room is particularly ingenious.  I have enjoyed all three of the CSI books, but I think Cold Burn was my favorite.  I look forward to more CSI stories from Max Collins.	2003-05-06

I read Sin City (the second in the series) first and wanted to wait for summer reruns to read the Double Dealer and Cold Burn.  But as I said in my review of Sin City, I just can't get enough of CSI on TV or (now) in book form.  The Las Vegas forensic team is investigating two similar murders separated by fifteen years.  A lot of evidence is processed and the mood is frequently lightened by the dry wit of the characters.  I especially enjoy Gil Grissom's puns.  Grissom and his team put in many hours of overtime on these cases.  Will they get their man?  I had my doubts.  But, well, I won't give away the ending.  It's a very good one.	2003-04-24

Gil Grissom is investigating the disappearance of a woman.  Catherine is looking into the murder of a stripper.  Collins has captured the characters as seen in the TV show perfectly and the humorous banter between the characters lightens the mood as it does in the TV series.  I was afraid this would be a story I had seen before, but it was all new.  A must read for fans of CSI.	2003-04-20

An expert from the Vatican arrives on the scene to determine its authenticity.  The reader is left to wonder what is this newly discovered artifact and how did it come to be in this place.  The story begins in the year 1096 and tells of the amazing adventures of an ordinary innkeeper during the time of the Crusades and the time after he returns to his home.  This is not a detailed historic novel.  It is a fairly interesting lightweight read.  The pace is fast and is spurred on more by the wonderful characters than by the story line.  Every once in awhile a word or phrase would pop up that seemed odd.... too modern for the times.  That was a small distraction.  There is quite a bit of violence throughout this book, but that is a reflection of the medieval times.  This story was a little reminiscent of the movie, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade.  There was violence in the movie as well, but Indy used a gun most of the time.  So much neater than all those swords, arrows and axes.	2003-04-06

I enjoyed the two previous novels in this series and I think Deadly Remedy is even better.  I continue to be amazed at the precise detail involving the many medical emergencies described by Hunter.  In this outing, Rhea gets up close and personal with faith healers and practitioners of black magic.  The action never lets up.  The characters come to life effortlessly.  The dialog absolutely sparkles.  And I love Belle and Pup, Rhea's two heroic dogs.  All these ingredients make for a fast paced page-turner.  Although there are some references to the story lines in the previous novels, I think this book can stand alone.  However, I would recommend reading Hunter's earlier books just because they are so very good.	2003-03-06

I was hesitant to invest in this one, but the premise sounded interesting.  It could have been a good story, but I found myself struggling to get through it.  I thought it was just me...maybe too many distractions just now.  But after reading some of the other customer reviews, I see that I was not alone.  There are the usual tedious descriptions of life's minutia common to Grafton's books, but what is worse, the entire story is flat and plodding without any spark.  If this was a debut novel by an unknown author, it would go straight to the discount table in the bookstore.  Only Grafton's name and past reputation are responsible for this book being a bestseller.	2003-02-21

She said, among other things, that it grabbed her from the start and she remembered the characters long after she finished the book.  Since these are qualities I look for in a book, I was anxious to read this, Mary Lawson's debut novel.  There is much to recommend in this book.  A good story, well told and characters who get into your heart and stay there.  Although part of the story is tragic, Lawson lightens the mood with well placed humor.  The antics of Kate's younger sister Bo are particularly endearing.  There is a mystery here and Lawson knows exactly how much to reveal to draw the reader along.  I enjoyed this story very much and I'm looking forward to more stories from Mary Lawson.	2003-02-03

It was apparently, someone he trusted.  With the introduction of each new character, the reader is left to wonder, is this the murderer?  Dr. Peter Pavanno enters the picture two days later to interview for a position on the team.  Questions soon arise concerning the cardiac cartel and Peter finds first his job, then his life threatened.  The first part of the book follows a familiar formula.  Then about halfway through the story it begins to get more interesting.  There is plenty of action and it is nice to be able to root for a deserving hero such as Peter Pavanno.  There are quite a few typos that were a little distracting, but they didn't slow the pace of the story.  Although this isn't a very original tale, it was an enjoyable read.	2003-01-15

The Harry Bosch novels have always been my favorites, but his other books have been good too.  This was the first book of Connelly's that I didn't like.  The main character, Henry Pierce didn't grab me and his actions just didn't seem natural.  The plot was fairly interesting, but in the end, seemed forced.  Chasing The Dime disappoints.	2003-01-09

Dr. Kevin Kincaid is an engaging central character.  He is a neurosurgeon but more importantly, he is also a brilliant research scientist who has developed a method to deliver corrective genes to the nucleus of cells of embryos in order to cure the genes causing inherited disabilities and prevent the disability from being passed on to future generations.  Kincaid soon discovers that he is being used.  Conspiracy and dirty deeds abound.  A large part of this story involves detailed, technical gene science.  This is not a lightweight read.  But for those willing to pay attention, it is a real eye opener.	2003-01-04

The story that follows is a heart warming tale with wonderfully rich characters. There are many tender and sweet moments that made my eyes fill.  Descriptions of an old, closed-off woman gradually opening up to the marvels of a small infant.  A young man discovering he is an important part of someone's life.  And the simple discoveries a baby makes every day.  Quindlen has an interesting writing style.  She doesn't describe her characters in full at the beginning, but reveals them layer by layer as the story evolves, like making a new friend in real life.  The two main characters, Charles \\"Skip\\" Cuddy and Mrs. Lydia Blessing are absolute jewels and well worth getting to know.  If you need a lift, this is the perfect book to read.  And if you know a friend who needs to feel good about something, give them this book to read.  It is a story for sharing.	2003-01-03

She takes us back 113 years to the Jack The Ripper murders and paints a very interesting picture of the people and places of that time.  Using letters, newspaper articles and police reports, she builds a case against the artist Walter Sickert.  I personally found Cornwall's conclusions believable....much more so than other theories I have heard.  Reading this account of events was like being a juror and hearing the prosecution's case.  It will be interesting to see how many defense `attorneys' will come forward to present an opposing view.  Some of the crime scene pictures included in the book are not for the faint of heart.  I would have liked to see more examples of Walter Sickert's paintings, but that might have been difficult to arrange.  They are available from other sources of course.  Cornwall has a disconcerting habit of introducing a piece of information then dropping it, only to reintroduce it later with a more complete explanation.  Although the story is not told in true chronological order, the whole picture does come together eventually.  Whether you agree or disagree with the author's findings, this book makes for a fascinating read.	2002-11-29

Psychologist Alex Delaware and Detective Milo Sturgis have paired up to solve a 20 year old murder.  Alex's girlfriend Robin is, thankfully, out of the picture for most of this one. There is just too much angst in their relationship, as far as I am concerned.  This mystery is mainly twofold.  Who was responsible for the murder 20 years ago and who sent Alex the murder book, which in effect reopens the case.  Milo Sturgis is one of my favorite characters and I was pleased to find he played a major role in this story.  The frequent and extensive Internet searches were a little tedious, but that might just be me.  I detest doing searches.  I like a nice, tidy ending, and this one filled the bill, although it did seem a little forced.  This story was more like Kellerman's earlier work and a very enjoyable read.	2002-11-20

But, after reading the customer reviews (some of them positively glowing), I decided to give it a try.  The story was sad, but it was also uplifting.  As I understand it, the author was raped when she was in college and wrote about that life staggering episode in her memoir, Lucky.  Perhaps that is the reason the description of Susie Salmon&#146;s rape and murder was so powerful.  After her murder, Susie wanders her version of heaven and keeps watch over those left behind on earth.  It is difficult to say more about the tale without giving away the plot.  There are parts of the book that drag on a little, but ultimately, it&#146;s the story and the strong characters that pull the reader along.  This is an original and thought provoking story.  I found myself wondering about loved ones I have lost.  Are they watching over me?  I sometimes think this is true and it is a comforting thought that Alice Sebold&#146;s story has reinforced.	2002-11-11

Some reviewers have focused on the intriguing relationship between Carter and President Warren G. Harding, but I found the first chapter most interesting. Unforeseen circumstances have nine year old Charles and his younger brother, James, alone and marooned in the family house for five days while an unusually harsh storm envelopes San Francisco.  It sets the scene for what follows, which is a rich and delicious tale.  In the book description, it says this story is a mix of fact and fiction.  As I said, I knew little of Charles Carter so I don't know what, in the book, is actual fact and what is fiction.  But it made for a very entertaining read and I was sorry to see it come to an end...I wanted more.  I may have to read this one again...it was that good.	2002-10-24

They have been the caretakers of a classic Buick 8 Roadmaster since 1979.  It resides in shed B at the troop barracks.  The story unfolds as told to young Ned Wilcox by the present day troopers who have seen some strange sights concerning the Buick over the years.  The narrative shifts back and forth among the characters, as it would with any group of people relating a story they all witnessed, and it lends a reality to the telling.  This story is vintage Stephen King and it has it all.... intriguing story line, strong and likable characters, and, as always, exceptionally good dialog.  I always read the author's note at the end of a SK book before I begin the story and would recommend other readers do the same for this book.  Nothing in the note gives away the plot and in learning how the story came into being makes the tale even more interesting.  I, like many of SK's readers, was devastated to learn he is going to retire from writing.  I have read all of his books and have been entertained by them from beginning to end.  This book was one of his best, in my opinion, and the ending was a hum-dinger.  Only fitting, I suppose.	2002-10-11

The killer is threatening Doctor Catherine Cordell. Is it someone she knows?  Someone she works with?  She was attacked two years ago by a doctor she worked with and the similarities to these killings are striking.  But she killed her attacker, so how could this be happening again?  Gerritsen weaves all these questions together in a spellbinding mystery.  The Characters are strong and well developed.  I especially liked detective Thomas Moore.  He isn't as dark as Harry Bosch in Michael Connelly's books, but he is just as sensitive and likeable.  The dialog is snappy and believable and moves the story along at a brisk pace.  The ending is action filled and absolutely riveting.  An excellent read.	2002-09-28

I knew where the story was going after about 60 pages.  Romance?  Not much.  Explicit, uninteresting sex?  Yes.  I read one of Sandra Brown's earlier novels and remember it only because I disliked it so much.  But with all the hype and glowing reviews surrounding this book, I thought I'd give it a try.  The beginning...the prolog of the `book within a book'...was very good.  I was intrigued and found the character description of the crusty old sailor quite appealing.  But the rest of the story was a let down.  The writing was okay and the pace moved along at a pretty good clip, but the story line was lightweight and predictable.  It wasn't a total waste of time.  It was like eating a Twinkie when what you really want is a big slice of triple chocolate cake with fudge frosting.	2002-09-16

She begins making inquiries into this new evidence and soon finds herself barred from the crash site and her reputation in question.  Anonymous threats only prompt her to seek answers.  If you are a fan of forensic thrillers and the TV show CSI, you will probably enjoy this book.  Some parts may be a little gruesome for the unprepared reader.  Reichs goes into quite a bit more detail involving forensic testing which some might find tedious.  I, however, am a forensic junkie and found it fascinating.  A major plus in this outing is the addition of Boyd, the Chow-mix dog.  I think he was my favorite character.  A very good forensic thriller.	2002-09-12

These characters are so well defined they seem plucked from real life.  I was surprised at how much I came to care about them.  I found it difficult to put this book down.  Evans keeps the interest alive throughout the whole story.  There isn't one single dull patch.  The landscape descriptions are so well written it is like looking at a picture rather than just reading about it.  The smoke jumper scenes were like being there.  My only criticism is for the first chapter, probably because it wasn't what I was expecting.  It was sad and somewhat depressing.  I think that this part of the story would have been better told in flashback fashion after the main characters had been introduced.  But this is a small thing when weighed against the rest of the story.  I loved this book.	2002-09-04

There are a series of paintings of nude women who appear to be asleep or dead on display in a gallery in Hong Kong.  Jordan Glass, a world class photo journalist, discovers the paintings and is shocked to discover that one of them looks exactly her.  The first page in this book is a little tricky.  I wonder how many readers go back and read the first two paragraphs a second time before continuing with the story.  Iles, in the tradition of the best mystery writers, doesn't come right out and tell the reader who the suspect could be, but he paints a picture and leaves it to the reader to pick up on his clues.  So much more fun that way.  There are ups and downs in this story.  It bogs down in a few places, but the pace soon picks up again.  At times, the suspense is so great, the reader is tempted to take a peek at the end.  But it's a complicated story and the reader would miss out on a lot by doing that.  A very good read.	2002-08-29

I had a hard time getting interested in this one.  I kept putting it down, then I had to force myself to pick it up again.  I almost gave up on it (I hate to give up on a book), but I stayed with it and I'm glad I did.  About half way through the story, it started to come together and the closer Lucas got to Rinker, the more exciting it became.  Good dialog, good characters and a plot line, that once it got going, was good too.	2002-08-12

He sets out to prove that there are unsafe conditions and toxic waste at the mine.  His efforts do not endear him to the people in the community where many are dependent on the mining company for their livelihood.  Okay, this is not an original premise, but Palmer soon takes this story in a different direction.  A believable and frightening direction.  Omnivax, a vaccine with 30 different components, is about to be approved for use worldwide.  One of the components was tested in Belinda 10 years ago and the adverse reactions are just beginning to show up.  This is an ambitious plot line that tends to bog down about midway through the book, but Palmer manages to bring it all together in the end.  There are likable heroic characters (the Slocumb brothers were my favorite), evildoers that were a little over the top, several good action scenes (involving motorcycle chases) and two very good field surgery scenes.  The dialog was, at times, at little hard to take.  Too sappy for my taste (does anyone say \\"pshaw\\" anymore?).  Vaccinations have certainly been a topic of controversy lately and I applaud Palmer for his efforts to stimulate the dialog on this subject.	2002-08-02

In this, the first of four installments, they are traveling up the Missouri River on a luxurious steamboat.  Most of this book is concerned with the introduction to the many characters.  Thankfully, at the front of the book, there is a list of family members, servants and other assorted people connected to the family.  Lord and Lady Berrybender have fourteen children in all, but not all of them are traveling with them.  I did think it odd that of the children listed, Brother Seven was only briefly mentioned and Sister Ten was not included in the story at all (after the first few of their children were born, Lord Berrybender decided to give his children numbers instead of names).  This is mainly a character driven story (most of the characters being extremely unlikable).  Finally, towards the end of the book, a blizzard hits and the story takes off and turns (all to briefly) interesting.  I am curious to discover what becomes of this strange and bawdy bunch of folks, so I will probably give the second installment a read.  I am hoping it will be better than this one.	2002-07-23

I couldn't help but compare them to the characters in the TV show, \\"Sex In The City\\".  The city is San Francisco and there is little or no sex going on, but the character's relationships are adolescent and the dialog between them is atrocious (\\"The margarita posse rides again\\".  Yikes!).  They set out to solve the mystery of a serial murder who is killing black cops and their relatives.  The mystery itself is a good one and kept me interested.  When it is seemingly solved, there are about 60 pages left so I realized a large red herring had been served up.  The plot saved this story from being a total washout, but these characters left a lot to be desired.  I can understand Patterson's desire to branch out into different scenarios (I was getting a little tired of Alex Cross too), but he took a wrong turn with this one.	2002-07-18

She is strong/weak, tough/vulnerable, and a little crude.  I didn't like her very much at first, but as the story evolved, I found myself liking her more and more.  Three years earlier she was on the bomb squad when a bomb unexpectedly exploded and killed her partner/secret lover and nearly killed her.  She survived with some terrible scars and is still trying to deal with it and not doing very well.  Her job is all she thinks she has left and she's barely holding it together.  Then another man on the bomb squad is killed by a bomb.  This leads Starky on a perilous trail to discover who is responsible.  Along the way, she meets Special Agent Jack Pell of the ATF and her personal life is turned upside down.  This is a wonderfully plotted mystery with many interesting characters.  The suspense is sustained to a tension filled ending.  An excellent read.	2002-07-16

Goldie's husband, Tom, is out of town on police business.  Someone shoots out the front window of the house.  Not a pleasant way to wake up.  The scene then shifts to a transplanted castle where Goldie has two scheduled catering events coming up.  Descriptions of the old English castle were a little tedious in the beginning, but later proved to be essential to the mystery, so I'm glad I paid attention.  A map would have been helpful.  This was actually a very good mystery.  Plenty of separate investigations for Goldie to pursue.  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here, that the characters do seem to be turning a little stale.  I wish Goldie would stop referring to her ex-husband as The Jerk.  It just seems rather juvenile.  The recipes, as always, sound scrumptious.  I didn't think I would be interested in recipes for the Elizabethan period, but Davidson has presented them in an updated form.  For instance, Kidney Pie has been turned into Shakespeare's Steak Pie.  I'm anxious to give that and the Plum Tart a try.  I guess this would be described as a \\"cozy mystery\\".  It was enjoyable, if not exactly riveting.  As Goldie finds comfort in food prep, I find comfort in reading about it.	2002-07-10

She is branching out in this episode to help a friend in trouble.  Others have said this is a darker story than Evanovich's previous novels.  I can't agree.  I burst out laughing after reading the first line in this book and the laughs continued through the whole story.  I keep expecting to hear that JE has branched out and is now doing stand up comedy.  The sexual tensions involving Ranger and Morelli continue.  Personally, I hope this never gets resolved...so much more fun this way.  A new character, Jeanne Ellen Burrows, was very intriguing.  It will be interesting to see if she returns in future stories.  I hope so.  I liked her.  The plot line in this story is a little weak, but that's not why I enjoy this series so much.  I like to laugh and Evanovich does it for me every time.	2002-07-03

Harry, of course, is not going to give up.  His care of one of the boy's bones, laying in a shoebox (he keeps his hand over it as he drives) broke my heart.  There is a lot of police procedural and politics in this outing, but I thought it made the story more believable.  It also made me appreciate the hard work that the real police do.  It is not all glamorous action.  The twists and turns in the mystery kept me interested.  Just about everything that can go wrong in an investigation, goes wrong in this one.  The ending really surprised me.  I hope this isn't the last we hear from Harry.  I have come to like him very much.	2002-06-26

This is a complicated mystery with many twists and turns.  Coben's subtle humor is sprinkled throughout and tends to ease the tension somewhat.  Will Klein, our hero, is very believable as a sometimes brave and sometimes clueless guy.  I found the jumping from one scene to another a little disruptive and there were a few noticeable errors.  On two different occasions, a character would sit down, then a few lines later, would sit again.  This story wasn't quite as good as Tell No One, but it was still a very good read.  If you can follow the many twists and turns, you will be rewarded with a snap-crackling good conclusion.	2002-06-22

The story is irresistible and races to a surprising conclusion.  The \\"trial\\" that finally comes to pass is a little hokey, but satisfying.  Jack is an excellent central character, but his grandfather, Mack, was my favorite.  This story is reminiscent of early John Grisham novels.  A smart young man takes on the rich and powerful.  Oh, and there is a sweet love story thrown in for good measure.  A fast and entertaining summer read.	2002-06-18

Bob Lee Swagger is shot in the chest by a sniper while out horseback riding with his wife and daughter.  The reader is drawn into the following story, eager to discover what led to this devastating outcome.  The story centers on the war in Vietnam and the peace demonstrations in Washington DC.  Then the scene shifts to Washington DC and the post-war political intrigue.  Bob Lee Swagger is looking for answers while his life is being threatened.  There are several twists and surprises in this story.  Just when the reader thinks he has it all figured out, the story takes a whole new direction.  Things aren't settled until the very last page.  A lot of edge-of-your-seat suspense and well-plotted action.  Never a dull moment.	2002-06-12

I have no experience with guns, gunfights, or gangsters, but I do know an entertaining read when I come across one and this was great entertainment.  Earl Swagger, just home from fighting in WWII, heads up a team of men reminiscent of the \\"Untouchables\\" to clean up the town of Hot Springs, Arkansas which is rife with gangsters, gambling and prostitution.  Earl is a somewhat dark character except when he is doing his job...training his team of law enforcers and taking out bad guys.  When he is in his element, he is downright jovial.  Earl's wife, June, is less well developed and the author made some errors in writing about her pregnancy and delivery (A face down presentation is normal.  A face up presentation would be a problem.  And, as any woman who has given birth could tell you, ten centimeters is the magic number for cervical dilation, not twelve to fifteen.).  But since this is, in large part, a \\"guy book\\", these errors do not distract from the major story line.  There is plenty of exciting action to keep the reader interested.  I have been a fan of Stephen Hunter's since \\"Black Light\\" and I enjoy his writing style very much.  This is a very good addition to the Swagger saga.	2002-06-05

It held my interest so I could overlook a lot of its problems.  This isn't a very well written book.  The dialog, in particular, doesn't always ring true and in fact, is a little annoying at times.  However, the premise is interesting and well presented.  The suspense is unrelenting and the characters are well developed.  Carl, who has Alzheimer's disease, is especially realistic.  This is a fast and interesting read if you can ignore the slightly awkward writing style.	2002-05-16

I kept reading because I was curious to learn the outcome of Lauren's pregnancy.  I was rewarded with a short, fast paced conclusion, but the birth of Lauren and Alan's baby was glossed over.  I have enjoyed most of Stephen White's previous novels, but this one just wasn't my cup of tea.	2002-05-15

I thought the first book, Delayed Diagnosis was especially well written and I was looking forward to Prescribed Danger.  I was not disappointed.  Dr. Rhea Lynch is a strong and likable character.  She makes a wonderful centerpiece for this tale.  The medical aspect of the story is very well done.  Microbiology is not always an easy subject to grasp, but Hunter does an excellent job in her descriptions of the \\"bugs\\" as well as the effect they have on the human body.  There are a few red herrings in this mystery, but it all comes together in a slam bang conclusion.  Some of the characters and situations from the first book are carried over into this story, so for a clear picture of the chain of events, it would probably be a good idea to read these books in chronological order.  This is a well plotted, fast paced story.	2002-04-29

An interesting way to look at the relationship between reader and writer.  The more I thought about it, the more sense it seemed to make.  And this date was definitely fun. In the opening story, \\"Autopsy Room Four\\", SK preys on what I think must be a universal fear.  It sets the pace for the following stories.  I love short story collections and this will be counted among my favorites.  Even the stories I had previously read were worth a second read.  It amazes me how much more I can get out of a SK story the second time around.  I enjoyed all 14 of these stories, but I think \\"The Little Sisters Of Eluria\\" was my favorite.  It involves Roland (the gunslinger) from the Dark Towers series.  It has made me impatient for the next installment of the Dark Towers, which SK has promised will be available soon.  I enjoy King's novels immensely, but his short stories are special and I loved this collection.	2002-04-19

I enjoyed Barr's Deep South and it was nice to return to this interesting section of the country.  Anna Pigeon is again forced to deal with the established \\"ol' boy's network\\" while she tries to solve the murder of Doyce Barnette, the brother of the local mortician.  Some of the characters in Deep South are revisited...Randy Thigpen, Barth Dinkins and Anna's love interest, Sheriff Paul Davidson.  It is a little frustrating to see Anna waffle around in her prickly self when it comes to Paul...afraid of being too needy.  I want to grab Anna's hand and make her reach out and grab Paul before he can get away.  That is just one example of how real to life Barr has managed to make these characters.  There are some of Barr's trademark descriptions of the surrounding landscape; maybe not as much as in her previous books, but what is included is quality.  She uses descriptions of smells (pine, moldy leaves, etc.) more than any author I can think of, and it sounds a little odd, I know, but that, more than anything else, brings me instantly into each scene.  I enjoy NB's sense of humor and it is sprinkled sparingly throughout this story, but I long for more.  It's difficult to avoid comparing one book to another in a series such as this.  I admit I have done so on occasion.  But I think this book stands on it's own and can and will be enjoyed by readers who are new to this author.  However, for those readers who haven't read Nevada Barr's previous books, you are in for a real treat.	2002-04-05

He delivers a short story here with plenty of punch.  All that is lacking is the campfire and marshmallows.  The setting, in front of a live audience, adds to the pleasure.  As is often the case with King stories, the tale starts off on a humorous note and then delivers the horror toward the end.  It is obvious King has spent some time observing cats and dogs.  He paints a very real picture of animal behavior in this story.  There is some rough language which may be offensive to some listeners.  It is a short story and I plan to listen to it again and again to see if I missed anything the first time around.  Knowing SK as I do, I'm sure there are hidden meanings lurking everywhere.	2002-04-04

However, after hearing so much about it, I thought I'd give it a try...read a few pages and if it didn't grab me, I'd just put it down.  Well, it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down.  This is a detailed account of not only the fighting in Mogadishu in 1993, but the history and politics that led to the event.  A true story that reads like fiction.  It is a real eye-opener.

This book would probably have made for better TV viewing.  It gives a very clear (if at times racy) picture of the life of a woman in the early 1900's.  Ellen Rimbauer's personality comes through on each page.  She is a very interesting character.  This is a fast and captivating read.	2002-02-19

It had been so long since the last installment, however, that I had almost forgotten just how much I enjoy these stories.  After reading the first page, I remembered all the reasons I love Diana Gabaldon's books.  Her writing is beautiful and pulls the reader right into these character's lives.  Her descriptions are so vivid, it is like watching a movie unfold rather than having to imagine the scene. For an example of her descriptive writing style; Brianna is a wee bit upset with Roger: \\"She drew a deep breath through her nose, like a dragon preparing to sear him into ash\\".  No imagination necessary, the scene is there for the reader to view.<br />It has been almost four years since I read Drums Of Autumn and after about 70 pages into this book, I realized I needed help (my memory is not as good as I thought it was).  So, I ordered the Outlandish Companion (rush delivery) to use as a reference to some of the characters and some of the previous pivotal incidents.  It was a big help and I would recommend it to fans of this series.  There were a few sections (most in the first half of the book) where the pace slowed considerably.  At the `Gathering', I think the author wanted to establish a sense of community, but the descriptions of all the characters here were rather tedious and ultimately not essential.  The most interesting parts of the story, for me, were Claire's use of her 20th century medical knowledge and her clever adaptations to her present situation.  The use of herbs and medical techniques was more prominent in this book than in earlier stories.  I won't make the mistake of giving this book away, as I did with the previous books.  I will keep it for reference when the next book is published.  It is a handsome book.  The pages have a semi-slick feel to them, the print is small but elegant, and at 979 pages, the hardcover edition will almost certainly improve the muscle tone in the armsof the reader.  Claire and Jamie are wonderful characters and their charm has not diminished.  Now, Brianna, Roger and  Jemmy have risen to the same cherished  level.  I was going to give this book four stars because the pace did slow significantly in a few places, but in considering the Herculean effort of the author to write a story of this magnitude (to say nothing of the entire series), I decided that should count for something.  So, five stars it is.	2002-02-11

The two murders in her book seem to be solved, but now that her book is in the hands of her editor, she is beginning to think that all is not as it appears.  The scene moves back and forth between Maire Lightfoot's book and her life as a writer.  This, the second installment in the Lightfoot series, is very well written and as enjoyable as all of Pickard's books.  Her characters are shown with all their warts and pimples.  Some are quite likeable, others are easy to dislike.  There are devious plot twists aplenty in this story and that is what makes Pickard one of my favorite authors.  A very well put together story.	2001-11-09

Adopted by Will Trona (a policeman) and his wife Mary Ann when he was five, he now works full time in the Sheriff's department in Orange County, California and part time as a sort of assistant to his father who is now a county supervisor.  There is something wrong with Joe's face and early in the story the reader is tantalized with the mystery of how this came to be.  Joe is a fearsome looking character and he is well-trained in methods of destruction and self-defense. He is also very proud of his good manners (he feels that it makes for a good balance).  As the story begins, tragedy strikes...Will Trona is murdered and Joe sets out to find answers.  In an early scene in the book, Parker gives the reader a very clear picture of Joe's character.  As Joe carries his dying father toward the doors of the emergency room:  \\"I slipped to my knees but kept him balanced because it was the only thing I could do for him and I wanted to do it well\\".  I surprised and embarrassed myself by bursting into tears at that point.  I've been a fan of T. Jefferson Parker's since his first book.  His writing is always very good but his subject matter doesn't always grab me.  He has everything working in this book and the combination is irresistible.	2001-11-03

It's been awhile since I've read a true crime novel. Most of the reading I engage in now is fiction, so Crowley's journalistic writing style took some getting used to. Early on, his writing seemed rather choppy and abrupt. Facts were bluntly stated with no follow up.  It was left up to the reader to fill in the rest of the picture.  It's not bad, just different than the narrative used in most fiction. It may have been Crowley's attempt to remain unbiased, because later in the book, when he was expressing his own opinions, the writing was smoother.  I had trouble feeling any sympathy for the victim (Gail Katz Bierenbaum).  She was portrayed, for the most part, as a self-centered, spoiled brat.  Her husband, Bob, was more complicated...a socially inept genius in the beginning and then an evil psychopath later on.  It seemed to me that Crowly was out of his depth when he was describing the psychological profiles of Gail and Bob.  Apparently Bob was diagnosed with \\"untreatable  psychopathy\\" after just one visit to a psychiatrist.  Psychopathy is a very broad  term that includes many forms of mental illness and it would be irresponsible for a doctor to determine  untreatably after one visit.  A turning point in the book occurred with the disappearance of Gail.  The author seemed to be on firmer ground when discussing actual evidence.  The courtroom scenes brought together a lot of loose ends.  Despite a shaky start, Crowley delivers an interesting story and leaves the reader with several unanswered questions to ponder.	2001-10-21

Her life has been shaped by a brutal assault and rape when she was young.  Now, at age 31, she has worked her way back to a fairly normal life.  She is strong, capable, and a little prickly, but likeable.  In this, the third book of the series, Lilly has returned to her hometown for her sister's wedding.  Along with her boyfriend, Jack (a private investigator), she is trying to piece together several recent murders in town that may or may not be related to a child abduction eight years previously. The premise for this story is a good one and it is very well plotted, but it is the characters that make it special.  I haven't read the two previous books in this series, but I didn't feel lost.  In fact, the references to past events just added a little more mystery.  I am looking forward to getting to know these characters better in the earlier and future books in this series.	2001-10-18

Unusual, but I liked it.  It reminded me of the camera effects in some films.  It gives an overview of events that even the main principles in the story are unaware of.  It gave me a feeling of \\"being in the know\\".  This is not one of SK or PS's kinder, gentler stories.  There is enough gruesome gore to give the reader nightmares for several nights.  So, this book might not be for everyone, but there is enough `normalcy' to save it from being unpalatable.  The main characters are extremely appealing.  Jack Sawyer is especially winning.  I read the Talisman many years ago and considered rereading it before starting this book, but I didn't.  I found The Black House stands on it's own.  There are enough clues and references to the former story to make the connections.  My only complaint is the use of the silly German accent (which really isn't German) of a few of the characters.  Trying to interpret what is being said slowed the flow of the story.  But that complaint is a small one and I found this story well worth the time it took to read...no small thing at 600 plus pages.	2001-10-15

The story of Ruth, the daughter, is told in the third person and the story of her mother, Lu Ling, is told in the first person. Some reviewers have been critical of this form, but I thought it brought the story together beautifully.  As soon as Tan introduces a character to the story, the image of that character stays with the reader through the whole story, so skillful is she in her descriptions.  Little things give insight to the main characters.  For instance; Ruth is trying to decide if she should buy flowers at the grocery store and if she does, what kind should she get?  She agonizes over this decision and finally decides to buy flowers that have \\"lasting value\\".  Tan obviously chooses each and every word she uses with great care.  It makes reading every sentence a true joy.  I seldom read a book more than once, but I'll keep this one and read it again.  It has lasting value.	2001-10-03

There are three intertwined mysteries that are very well plotted and plenty of action, including a breathtaking car chase. The dialog is snappy and believable.  The majority of the characters are well defined.  The \\"bad guy\\" characters are a little fuzzy, but that may have been intentional. (When the character, Dex Bartholomew was introduced into the story, an image of Ross Perot popped into my head.  I wonder if anyone else experienced that.)    The story centers around Cynthia Decker, rookie cop, daughter to Peter Decker and stepdaughter to his wife Rina.  Cindy isn't easy to like but she is interesting.  In fact, she is a gold medal brat for most of the story. Toward the end of the book, when it is obvious where the finger of blame is pointing, the question of how it will be resolved keeps the reader's interest alive.  I've read and enjoyed Faye Kellerman's earlier books, but I haven't been keeping up with the series.  I think I have three or four of her books in a stack around here somewhere.  I'll have to go and find them and do some catching up.	2001-09-24

There were plenty of side stories to keep interest alive while the main plot evolved.  When the facts surrounding the missing disc finally are revealed, the pace picks up quite a bit.  This is a fairly lightweight mystery, but the character of Sheriff Joanna Brady carries the day.	2001-09-11

I was very impressed with the seamless transition from one chapter to the next.  Some of these authors are old favorites of mine and I will definitely be looking for the books of the authors that were new to me. The diabolical twists and turns in the plot kept me reading far into the wee hours of the night.  This is a fun romp and I don't feel a bit guilty for buying the hardcover edition because part of the proceeds from the sales goes to breast cancer research.  Don't skip the introduction...it is as much fun as the rest of the book.	2001-09-07

I have read medical thrillers written by MD's that were not as believable and realistic as this story was.  In addition to the excellent medical text, the characters spring effortlessly to life under Hunter's skillful descriptions.  Dr. Rhea Lynch is a strong and resourceful character.  But it was the dog in the story that captivated me.  I just happen to have a large black dog named Belle too.  Hunter writes about this dog as only a true dog lover can.  The pace is fast and the action is non-stop.  I look forward to reading future stories about Dr. Rhea Lynch and Belle.	2001-09-05

A young girl has attempted suicide in the Delphi Caf and Tory is off in search of answers. I found a few problems with this, the sixth and most recent of the Tory Bauer Mysteries. I have always enjoyed Tory's introspective breaks in previous novels. They are often humorous and surprisingly insightful. But I think Ms. Taylor went a little overboard with this particular gambit in the first part of the story. It seemed to take too long to get to the meat of the tale. By the time Tory sits down with her friend, Neil Pascoe (they are a perfect match!), to discuss recent events, the story begins to move along at a more satisfying pace. There were several writing errors throughout the book. A few examples: In one sentence, the word make was used in place of the word may. \\"...lost on the our vast grid...\\". \\"...that it would to be up to me...\\".  There were so many of these small errors it was a distraction. The print on several pages was faint and washed out looking. For people with normal vision, this probably doesn't pose a problem, but my eyesight is less than good and I had some difficulty with it. The story is a very good one and I enjoyed catching up with the folks in Delphi. It is a Not To Be Missed addition to this excellent series. I'm sorry to be so critical here, but I am hoping that word will get back to the publisher that Taylor's books deserve better editing and more attention paid to the actual printing process.	2001-08-30

Dr. David Beck's wife was murdered 8 years ago.  He has just received an email that leads him to believe she may still be alive, but he must Tell No One.  The injustices in some parts of this story made me uncomfortable, tense, and even angry.  The police and the FBI suspect Beck of wrongdoing.  Innocent people are murdered to protect the guilty.  The descriptions Beck makes of the abuse suffered by some of his pediatric patients is also hard to take.  It's the surprisingly humorous writing style of Coben's that makes the tension bearable.  In the midst of one particularly tense scene, I actually had to stop and giggle.  The police are chasing Beck and as they begin to close in, Coben writes, \\"The cops were coming closer.  I was totally exposed.  I flattened myself closer to the wall, like that would help.  Like they might turn the corner and mistake me for a mural.\\"  Yes, this is fiction, but Coben brings David Beck and the other characters in this tale to life with style and grace and makes the adventure seem very real.  It seemed I couldn't read fast enough to reach the conclusion, but when I did, I wished I had taken it slower to better enjoy the ride.  I noticed than some of the reviews here are not complimentary.  It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I really enjoyed it.  In fact, I will go so far as to say, I think this is the best book I have read this year.	2001-08-12

Kate Shugak is employed as security to a woman who is campaigning for a Park Senate seat.  About 100 years ago, a \\"working girl\\" falls in love and marries the man who was the highest bidder when she auctioned herself to the men of Dawson.  Stabenow takes us back and forth between these two stories and it becomes clear that a connection will be made.  The pace never falters and the characters, as always, are complete in every detail.  In one part of the book, DS writes about Kate's love of books.  Reading for fun.  Preferring a book to television.  The inability to pass a bookstore without going in. This really struck a chord with me.  I'm just guessing here, but I think Stabenow has endowed Kate with her own love of books.  Maybe that is why she is able to tell such good tales.  She understands readers because she is one herself.  I truely appreciate her efforts, as one reader to another.  Oh, and what about the glove?  Where have I heard about a glove found at the scene of a crime before?  Hummmmm.	2001-08-02

Although I missed reading about the folks back in Niniltna, the introduction to the people of Bering was a true joy.  Jim Chopin has a prominent role here and the insights into his character are very reveling.  I also enjoyed a surprising revelation concerning Kate's grandmother, Ekaterina.  The descriptions of Kate's dog, Mutt (one of my favorite characters) are, as always, vivid and alive.  A word of warning: if you are a big fan of the FBI, you should know that the two FBI agents in this story are not portrayed  in a very favorable light. I have read all of Stabenow's previous Kate Shugak mysteries, so it was easy for me to pick up where the story left off last time, but this probably isn't where a reader new to the series should begin.  For a true understanding of Kate, it would be best to start at the beginning (A Cold Day For Murder). It was easy getting into this story and it held my attention throughout. The ending was spectacular.	2001-07-25

It isn't working for me. Do we really need to know Kinsey stops in the ladies room before keeping an appointment with an acquaintance of the missing man?  Or the minute details of her exercise routine?  There was, what seemed to be, a jarring inconsistency early on when Kinsey visits the home of Joel Glazer.  \\"Shafts of sunlight formed geometric patterns on the smooth tile floor\\".  The day had been described as dark and rainy before and after the visit. I realize the sun sometimes breaks through on a cloudy day, but that was not the impression that was given.  Despite the tedious details and inconsistencies, I wanted to learn what had happened to Dr. Purcell and that kept me turning the pages.  I was rewarded with more action and fewer details in the second half of the book.  Unlike a few other reviewers here, I thought the ending was neat, tidy and satisfying.  This wasn't one of Grafton's best efforts, but it was not her worst either.	2001-07-19

He is an old, shady character and although he is half-blind, going deaf and suffering from depression, he manages to elude Stephanie in one embarrassing situation after another.  Then two of Stephanie's friends go missing and Grandma Mauzer is kidnapped.  The plot gets a little scattered, but it is all brought together for a satisfying conclusion.  The thing I like most about Stephanie is that she seems so human.  She has small problems that seem enormous to her.  She solves her big problems with bakery items, luck and a little help from her friends.  Grandma Mauzer is one of my favorite characters and she has a prominent role in this installment.  The sexual tension between Stephanie, Morelli and Ranger continues.  JE is doing a wonderful balancing act in keeping these relationships alive and well.

I would have had a better understanding of the characters and their relationships.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book as much as I did the second book in the trilogy.  Although the story takes place in primitive times, the human natures of these characters are modern and it's easy to relate to them.  The Dzuggi are the honored storytellers in these books and though Ms. Harrison uses the written word to tell her stories, she should be honored as Dzuggi herself.  With her words, she places some very vivid pictures in the mind of the reader.	2001-06-25

It was clearly stated on the front of the book).  That may be why I found the numerous characters a bit confusing at first.  But there is a list of characters and the villages they come from at the back of the book and that was a big help.  I also appreciated the glossary of plants and herbs that were mentioned in the story.  Despite the fact that I was unfamiliar with these characters and their past history with each other, the story was easy to follow.  I found the details of life in primitive times, in the wilds of Alaska, mesmerizing.  The suspense of what was going to happen to these characters kept me turning pages well into the wee hours.  It isn't often that I find a book that so involves me, that the rest of the world just disappears for awhile.  This is one of those books.	2001-05-24

The premise was a good one, but the plotting and the writing dulled all hope of an interesting story.  The fact that there was not one single likable character just added to the depressing trend of the tale.

I just can't find anything good in this book to recommend it to other readers.	2001-05-15

I was afraid I wouldn't understand the rest of the story if I didn't pay attention to the physic lesson at the beginning of the book, so I struggled through that part.  But I found out, later, that a complete understanding of these details wasn't necessary to follow the plot line.  The story really gets going when the travelers arrive in the year 1357.  There is plenty of action and the characters are very likeable (or, in some cases, easy to dislike).  Crichton has a way of making the unbelievable absolutely believable and he does it again in this story.	2001-05-05

I am a dedicated SK fan and I enjoyed this book, but it isn't on my list of favorites.  I thought the most interesting aspect of this story was how SK wove his own experience with a broken hip into the tale.  I am one of those readers who prefer mental/emotional weirdness rather than physical weirdness.  The \\"weasels\\", the aliens, and the red fungus didn't impress me, but I did like the characters and their ability to communicate telepathically.  It is always King's style of writing that wins me over.  Even if the premise or the plot line falls short, the words hold up and draw me irresistibly toward the end.  As I said, I enjoyed this book but if you aren't a hardcore SK fan, this one probably isn't for you.	2001-04-21

Anna fires up her little gray cells to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together.  Following the clues in this mystery is like watching a drama behind a filmy curtain.  You think you know what is going on, but you can't be sure until the curtain is finally removed.  As always, Barr's talent for describing landscapes brings the reader right into the story's setting.  Even if you've never been in a wilderness, you are bound to feel a connection here.  A few errors in punctuation and sentence structure, mentioned by another reviewer, are troublesome at times.  But these errors are easily forgiven because the story is just so very entertaining.	2001-03-28

I enjoyed several of the characters (Jack Dolan was particularly colorful), but I just didn't find the plot line very involving.  The \\"outlaws'\\" crusades were more like adolescent pranks and failed to pull the story together.  Other than a few cute characters, there isn't much to recommend in this one.	2001-03-16

Stephanie Plum is on the trail of a family dealing guns and maybe drugs.  She is also trying to clear her friend and fellow bounty hunter, Ranger, from a suspicious situation.  Two new characters, Mooner and The Dealer add to the fun.  The sexual tension involving Stephanie's love interest, Morelli the cop, is alive and well.  Evanovich delivers an excellent read with this book and surpasses expectations for another good tale.	2001-03-06

All of the characters are very complicated and true understanding probably isn't possible with just one reading.  Harley is one of the most fascinating characters I've ever come across.  He is so human and vulnerable it's difficult to believe he is a figment of the author's imagination.  The smart humor interjected at critical points in the story saves it from being depressing.  There is a lot in this book to ponder and I don't think that I will soon forget it.	2001-02-27

But, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself.  Connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined.  We are not given large doses of non-essential information just to prolong the story, as happens with quite a few other authors these days.  We learn a little more about Harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook.  A journey well worth the effort.	2001-02-16

I was looking forward to reading Hannibal, but I was bitterly disappointed.  For some reason, the gory details in movie form don't bother me as much as reading about them.  This book is full of horrific scenes that got into my head and gave me terrible nightmares for all the days it took me to read it.  Harris' sentence structure was, at times, awkward enough to interrupt the flow of the story.  I agree with some of the other reviewers here that the ending was out of balance with the characters as we came to know them.  All in all, not worth the time.  Wait for the movie.	2001-01-29

A man in Superior Nebraska decides that the best way to gain the attention of the woman he loves is to eat an airplane that has crash landed in his cornfield.  Things get complicated when J.J. Smith from The Book Of Records comes on the scene.  The premise is undoubtedly strange, but the characters bring this story to life.  They are a sweet and likeable bunch of people.  A lightweight read, but enjoyable from beginning to end.	2001-01-20

It's a wild ride, especially toward the end. There is plenty of action and the superior dialog that is DeMille's  trademark.  The story does bog down in a few places.  The tour of the lab on Plum Island, for instance, was probably necessary to the story, but was a little tedious.  However, the clever wit and humor of DeMille's writing helps to pull the reader along.  John Corey is a great new character and I'm looking forward to reading his future adventures.	2000-12-16

In this, her fifth novel, she continues the story of the residents of Delphi, South Dakota (and a colorful bunch they are).  It is the New Year and a major blizzard has cut Delphi off from the outside world.  Three strangers, who came into town before the storm hit, are suspect in a number of robberies around town.  One of the strangers turns up dead.  It is up to intrepid waitress, Tory Bauer, to sort things out.  As in other Taylor books, there is plenty of laugh out loud humor and insight into the workings of human nature.  Another winner.	2000-11-20

They discover three of their friends brutally murdered and the fourth gone missing.  Is he dead also, or a suspect in the murders?  Hill's descriptive powers are exceptional and they put you squarely into each scene.  One of my favorites was, \\"Above the thatched roof a flock of television aerials parted the morning breeze and serenely sang their triumph over charm and Tudory\\".  Intelligence and subtle humor infuse the whole story.  The mystery spins irresistibly to the final pages and the ending leaves you with a smile.	2000-11-14

I found the individual stories interesting, but wish there had been more examples of people living with MS.  I know that many people with MS suffer with vision problems, so I was surprised that the print in this book was a little difficult to read (especially the smaller print in the preface).  Although it is artistically pleasing, I would prefer print that is easier to see.  Even though this material was rather lightweight, because Mr. Williams is donating his royalties to MS research, I think it is a good investment.	2000-11-03

Some are turning up murdered.  When nurse Adele Monsarrat gets wind of this trend, she begins to investigate and ends up right in the middle of things (as usual) and in danger herself.  Heron manages to weave irresistible humor into even the most dire of circumstances.  I love the antics of Nelson, the vegetarian Labrador Retriever.  When he meets Helen, the deaf and blind cat, for the first time, it is absolutely hysterical.  I have enjoyed several of Heron's other books and she just keeps getting better and better.  A thoroughly engrossing and delightful read.  The only question is, why isn't the publisher promoting Heron's books more vigorously?  Her books belong on all the bestseller lists.	2000-10-26

In the main story line, the killer's character was well developed and believable but Britt as a hostage just did not ring true.  Although Britt admits, at the end of the book, that her actions were foolish and irresponsible, it left me wondering how such a smart and savvy woman wouldn't have figured this out in the beginning.  The ending came as no big surprise.  This was a fairly interesting character study, but as a mystery it was sadly lacking	2000-10-09

I like movies about outer space, but books in this genre usually bore me cross-eyed.  What a nice surprise this book turned out to be. The space/medical/mystery combination works very well.  A stunning beginning leads, eventually, to a heart-stopping ending.  There were a few flat spots about halfway through, but the pace soon picked up again.  The heroics in this story had me in tears.

Although Evanovich is one of my favorite authors, I was disappointed in her previous novel, Four To Score.  All the trashy language in that one ruined the rest of the story for me.  High Five, however, is great.  An excellent plot line told with plenty of wit and humor.

Connolly hammers the reader with so much violence  and gore, that by the end of the book it is almost meaningless and the  reader is numb.  The plot line is unusual in that one mystery is solved  only to flow into another.  Although the writing is very good, I didn't  find anything else in this story to recommend to others.

I didn't read these  mysteries in chronological order, but had no difficulty picking up and  following the story lines.  Still, it might be better to read them in the  order they were written.  Funeral Food (the first) is an excellent  introduction to the wonderful characters that populate these stories.  I  think Avon Books would be wise to issue a reprint of this book.

At the time, it was assumed to be a  drowning accident.  But was it?  Twenty years later history seems to be  repeating itself and Tory Bauer wants to know the truth.

Subtle humor and intriguing examples of Elliot's  ingenuity add the finishing touches to an absolutely stunning novel.

He wins.  Fame and fortune follow.  This story has been done over and over and been done better.  The opening  court scene is a ploy to set up animosity between attorney Ben Kincaid and  the prosecutor, his former friend, and is just plain silly.  There are  attempts to bolster the main plot with side issues...Kincaid's sister  unexpectedly leaves her baby with him...his mother shows up...his  ex-brother-in-law is tracking a child molester.  The main story line, which  was mildly interesting, could have been expanded and stood on it's own.

This is a fast, engrossing read.  The mystery was fairly easy to figure out early on, but it was interesting to see the characters process the clues and find the  answers.

Scotland Yard is called in because the girl's  employer, an American, is the widow of a terrorist who killed himself in  the village church three years earlier.  There is no scarcity of murder  suspects as the girl's life is gradually exposed as well as the lives of  many of the villagers.

The courage and stamina needed for such an endeavor is brought vividly to  life by Sue Henry.  The mystery, although a good one, is almost secondary  to the wonderful descriptions of the snow covered wilds of Alaska.  It  leaves you wanting more.	2000-06-02

When I first read the synopsis of Liberty Falling, I thought, New York?  Nevada Barr?  No way.  How in the world can you compare New York City with the deep south, the western  deserts, Colorado, and the northern lakes?   Although she doesn't have the beautiful landscapes to describe, she makes  up for it with a very good plot line and characters that are so life-like,  it's hard to believe they don't exist in real life.  (I would really like  to know someone like James Hatchett Sr.)  I liked Anna Pigeon in Track Of  The Cat and I like her more with each addition in this wonderful series.	2000-05-24

I enjoy getting to know him better in each of Mosley's books.  But because Walter Mosley has such a wonderful talent for character development, I probably will never have Easy figured  out completely.  What amazes me about these books is that they read like a  serial but any one of them can stand on it's own without any long, detailed  introductions or explanations.  Black Betty does not disappoint.  Easy  juggles several situations at once and manages to bring order and justice  to his world by the end of the book.  I think the most endearing quality of  Easy's is the love and care he gives to his kids, Jesus and Feather.  The  time spent with his family gives a good balance to the darker side of his  life on the streets.  There are some big surprises in this story...some good  and some sad and good at the same time.  I bought this book a long time ago  and saved it until the next Easy Rawlings book came out so I could read  them both at the same time because when I finish a Walter Mosley book I  always want more.  I wish he could write `em as fast as I can read `em.	2000-05-18

He's been laying low in England for the past ten years, when he is rudely thrust back into his old life.  What follows is all based on one wrong assumption he makes.  I  was reminded of the time in the movie theater when the man in front of me  got so caught up in the movie, he actually shouted at the screen, \\"Hey!   You've got it all wrong.  Wake up!\\".  I was about to shout that that at  this book, but I didn't want to startle the dog sleeping at my feet.  I  found the main character appealing even though he is an assassin.  He is,  after all, taking out the bad guys.  There is lots of action and it's fun  to see how he gets out of one scrape after another.  I like the way Thomas  Perry writes.  As with his Jane Whitefield stories (she is a specialist  too.  She helps people disappear) he is clever, witty, sometimes even  humorous, and he doesn't waste my time with unnecessary dialogue or endless  descriptions.  The ending was spectacular.  You really got me with this one  Mr. Perry.	2000-05-17

If it can, then this book has it.  The descriptions of the school yard took me back, in a flash, to my elementary school in Long Beach, California years ago.  Do you remember school rooms  in bungalows?  And tetherball?  Mosley is absolutely THE master of  dialogue.  Sometimes too much of one author can get tiresome, but not in  this case.  I read BLACK BETTY just before this book and the dialogue  continues to be fresh and sparkling.  I enjoyed the dry humor sprinkled  throughout the story.  It suits Easy very well and I'd like to see more of  it in future books.  The foray into the culinary experience was another new  addition that I liked a lot.  The main story line held together well and  moved along almost effortlessly.  I finished this book yesterday and I  still don't know how I feel about the ending.  I'm sure it will stay with  me for a long while.  Walter Mosley is one of the best authors around  today, in my opinion.  I eagerly await the next installment in the saga of  Easy Rawlins.	2000-05-16

I was looking forward to a suspenseful page turner.  A book I could lose myself in.  It didn't live up to my  expectations.  A farfetched plot without Sanford's usual spark.  The  character, Clara Rinker, was a good one but not strong enough to carry the  story.  I had the impression that Sanford came up with the Rinker character  and tried to build a story around her.  It didn't work.	2000-05-01

She weaves several plot lines through this story and makes it work.  I like the main character, Jo Beth Sidden.  She is tough and prickly on the outside and mush on the inside.   She rubs a lot of people the wrong way but stands up and accepts the  consequences.  The dogs, however, are the true stars in this series and Ms.  Lanier is at her best when writing about them.  This book would have  benefited from a better proof reading.  There were quite a few errors  throughout the book, but they really didn't detract from the story.   Actually, it became rather fun looking for them.  Like a treasure hunt.  I  enjoyed reading this book very much and look forward to the next  installment in this series.	2000-04-23

A little too gritty in places.  The travels through the homeless section of town was depressing (the author's intent?).

I was in the mood for something humorous and I love to read about dogs.  So, the first few pages were promising.  But the story never  really went anywhere.

Davidson's characters, as always, spring effortlessly to life.  The plot line was interesting, if somewhat lightweight.  But sometimes that just hits the spot, whereas a deep dark mystery would be too depressing.  Some  reviewers here have expressed dismay, saying Goldy's son betrayed her.   That wasn't my take.  Arch was tricked into revealing information  concerning his mom.  I think Davidson has captured the mindset of a  fourteen year old boy perfectly.  Goldy often says that she finds comfort  in food prep.  I find comfort in reading about it.  And the recipes!  Yum.	2000-03-24

The pace of the story  seemed to lag towards the middle, but then it sped up to a satisfying,  action-packed ending.  The premise was a good one, and it raises many  questions about ethical (and unethical) scientific research.  Technically  this was a good story, but it wasn't as emotionally involving as Embryo.	1999-11-18

The main character, Frank was a likeable guy but I agree with another reviewer who said most of the characters were somewhat  annoying.  The widow, Rory, was just too pitiful to be believed.  The story  is a little plodding early on but finally takes off when the hunt for  answers begins.  An action packed ending saves this one from being  ordinary.	1999-07-31

I prefer the stories where the dogs are in the spotlight and the rescue scenes are fast paced.  The stories in this book are wide ranging and the  major theme is slow to coalesce.  Still, Ms. Lanier is one of my favorite  authors and her books always leave me with a good feeling.	1999-07-23

In the first part of this book, the mystery is, 'where in time are you?'.  McCrumb jumps back and forth over several years  time without giving any clues to the reader.  No headings direct the reader  to time, place or narrator.  I suppose this style is thought to be artsy,  but I found it annoying.  I really couldn't connect with any of the  characters until the father of Frankie Silver came on the scene and he was  only a minor character.  There was way too much uninteresting and  unnecessary filler.  By the time I reached the unremarkable end, I felt I  had wasted my time on this one.	1999-07-04

The scenes portrayed by King were so real to me I could almost believe I'd been there.  Of course it helps that I am an avid baseball fan and have watched and  admired the players, especially the pitchers, of that game for many years.  I know some of SK's fans will not enjoy this one because it lacks the far  out horror of some of his books, but I have always thought that the  scariest things come from within the brain and not walking around for  everyone to see.  A great story of strength and endurance.	1999-06-19

The likable characters are here, as well as her trademark  humor, but the story itself is unremarkable.  I have been telling my sister  what a wonderful author Janet Evanovich is and promised to send Four To  Score to her as soon as I finished it, but I'm having second thoughts.  I  think I'll recommend the first three books to her instead.	1999-06-15

Warshawski does a commendable job of pulling all the loose threads together  and solving the mystery.  I got a little tired of her sarcastic banter with  her former husband Dick, though.  Early on it was cute, but toward the end  it was just annoying.  Otherwise, a pretty good read.	1999-06-09

Until now, The Stand and The Green Mile have been my all-time favorites.  But Bag Of Bones has gone to the top of the list.  King starts out with a normal believable  story and takes the reader, willing or not, on an exciting and wild ride  into the world of ghosts,  Filled with many little pearls, (&quot;Put an  egg in your shoe and beat it&quot;... I thought my mother was the author of  that one.) and extensive insight into the mind of a writer, this is King at  his very best.

An interesting premise was made believable without a lot of technical  details.  The one thing I found unbelievable was that the police would  allow a civilian to participate in trapping one of the killers.  Still, a  fast and interesting read if you can suspend your grasp on reality for the  length of the book.	1999-05-18

I especially liked her mother, Skinny Dragon.  I had a little trouble with the writing style of Ms. Glass in the beginning.   Over long descriptive sentences plopped down in the middle of dialog  between characters was disruptive and annoying at times.  But once I made a  connection with these characters, the writing flaws became easier to  overlook.  The plot was intriguing.  The similarities to the O.J.

Joe has always been my favorite of the two, but Jim Chee's character really captivated me in this one.  Every part of  this book has something to recommend it.  The mystery is intriguing.  The  process of solving the mystery is very interesting.  And the resolution is  perfect when considered in the light of the Navaho search for harmony and  balance.  All in all, a great read.  Now, if Mr. Hillerman could just write  them as fast as I read them, all would be well.	1999-03-23

After about 50 pages the mystery finally gets started and it's a doozie.  Well worth waiting for.  A well plotted story with  plenty of action.  Nevada Barr is one of the best story tellers I've come  across, and her writing style is neat and concise.  The characters are so  well developed they seem almost real.  Anna Pigeon is a favorite character  of mine and I wasn't disappointed in this, her latest adventure.	1999-03-20

Only one character, Captain Sara Brannon, had any real spark.  Several errors throughout the book were distracting  and annoying.  For example.

Not because it was so interesting, but because it was so depressing.  Keller is very good at what he does but his life is dull.  Maybe that's Mr. Block's point.   A hit man is just another poor slob trying to get through life, doing what  he does best and trying to make sense of it all.

I particularly liked the reference to  Jamie Fraser (from the series by Diana Gabaldon).  The only thing I didn't  like about this book was the &quot;art work&quot; (?) on the chapter pages.

The plot itself was simplistic.  The  characters were fairly interesting and likable.  But the only good thing  going for this book was the action filled conclusion.  Still, not worth  wading through the main body of the story to get to the end.  This book was  wildly different from Preston's first book, The Hot Zone and a big  disappointment	1998-09-25

In the beginning of this story, Jane's heart wasn't really into helping her client disappear and my heart wasn't into reading about it.  I found myself skimming pages looking for action.  I found it hard to believe Jane would give up her exciting life as a guide to get married and settle down to a &quot;normal&quot; life.  In the book preceding this one, I had been rooting for Jane and Carey to get together.  But their romance in this story seemed flat and lackluster.

Ms. O'Connell's character development is exceptional.  The plot is intricate without being overly busy.  This book did cause me an embarrassing moment.  The scene where Mallory is reunited with her very old dog triggered uncontrollable sobs which proved to be rather disconcerting for the people around me in the dentist's waiting room.  There were a few chuckles too.  When Detective Sergent Riker meets Sheriff Tom Jessop, it's a match made in heaven.  You could probably read and enjoy this book without reading the previous books in this series, but I think you would be missing out on a lot.  All of Ms. O'connell's books to date have been very good.	1998-07-07

This is a fast, engrossing read.  The mystery was fairly easy to figure out early on, but it was interesting to see the characters process the clues and find the answers.  A very strong female main character didn't overwhelm the story but pulled it all together.  A fair amount of violence is involved, so if that bothers you, you might want to skip this one.	1998-07-01

The story moves along at a brisk pace, never lagging, as is often the case in books of this length.  At one point in this story, two of the characters are discussing a book they both read which was of considerable length.  One of the characters, wondering if the book could have been shortened, says, &quot;Each character is most carefully considered, and all the incidents chosen seem necessary to the story&quot;.  This could also be said of Ms. Gabaldon's books.  Each is a long, satisfying, wonderful read.	1998-06-01

A search and rescue using bloodhounds.  The main character is Jo Beth Sidden, a strong and sometimes prickly woman who breeds, trains, and uses bloodhounds in search and rescue.  An interesting plot held my interest throughout.  The best parts of the story involved the dogs.  It was only slow in a few places.

In this book she attempts to branch out into the world of academia and the story falters. There are two mysteries to be solved here, and I didn't find either one of them to be particularly interesting. The only time the characters come to life is when they are relating to the dogs in the story, and those times were far too few. Surely there is enough weirdness in the dog world for several more books.  I hope Ms. Conant returns there for her future stories. Still, if you are a confirmed dog person, as I am, you will want to read this one and then look forward to the next installment in the adventures of Rowdy and Kimi.	1998-04-13

I found it difficult to believe the actions of most of the characters in this story.  B.J. was the most believable.  The workings of his mind were interesting to follow, being humorous at times and insightful at other times.  The main pull of the story, for me, was to find out what is Sarah Canary and what happens to her.  I was disappointed in this regard, as this issue was never satisfactorily resolved.  It was an interesting story, but failed to answer the many questions that were raised throughout.  The book seemed to dissipate rather than end.  I would be interested to hear a discussion group's insight on this book. Maybe there is something I am missing.	1998-03-23

The story line really wasn't going anywhere when a sex scene between two women popped up and was described in minute detail.  I'm not a prude or a homophobe but I found these detailed descriptions unnecessary and offensive.  In fact, the whole book, to that point, was unnecessary.

The way of life in Scotland in the 1700's, and especially, the medical practices and use of healing herbs.  Bits and pieces of actual history lend a realistic touch.

Too much analyzing the possibilities.  I like to work out the mysteries for myself.  I'm glad Milo is back, but I would have liked a little more of Robin in this one.  Still, these are some of my favorite recurring characters and it was nice to catch up with them again.	1997-10-28

The murder mystery is not strong enough to support the rest of the story.  It's an in depth study of several characters who are linked together in the `60's and their reunion in the `90's around the murder of one of their group.  The characters are mildly interesting, but again, not enough to carry the story.  Mr. Turow's editor should have been more free with his pen.  A struggle to finish.	1997-10-07

I read a lot of fiction and can usually figure out where the story line is going early on, but not in this case.  This one had me reeling with emotions.  Surprise, anger (at injustice), satisfaction (when justice is served),  and curiosity (who did it?).  This is one of those books that you don't want to end, but at the same time you want to know the outcome.  Totally engrossing.	1997-10-06

I like the way Teri Holbrook writes, a little quirky, but it moves along well.  A young girl dies in what is at first thought to be a bicycle accident but is soon discovered to be murder.  Scotland Yard is called in because the girl's employer, an American, is the widow of a terrorist who killed himself in the village church three years earlier.  There is no scarcity of murder suspects as the girl's life is gradually exposed as well as the lives of many of the villagers.  I read Ms. Holbrook's second book, The Grass Widow, before I read this one and liked it very much.  This one, however, is even better.	1997-09-16

He wins.  Fame and fortune follow.  This story has been done over and over and been done better.  The opening court scene is a ploy to set up animosity between attorney Ben Kincaid and the prosecutor, his former friend, and is just plain silly.  There are attempts to bolster the main plot with side issues...Kincaid's sister unexpectedly leaves her baby with him...his mother shows up...his ex-brother-in-law is tracking a child molester.  The main story line, which was mildly interesting, could have been expanded and stood on it's own.  As it was, all the little side stories only detract from the main plot and weaken an otherwise good idea for a story.	1997-09-16

The beginning was especially good as Kate prepares for a long cold winter on her isolated Alaskan homestead.  She then travels to Anchorage at the request of her grandmother.

My mother always said all my taste was in my mouth and she was right...  I'm an excellent cook.  Still, I wanted to create something pleasing to the eye, and this book has helped me to do just that.  The hardest part about this project was looking for that elusive hammer to hang my beautiful art work on the wall.  You know those crocheted toilet paper covers you were planing to make as Christmas presents for friends and family?  Forget that!  Nature prints are going to be the hot ticket item this year.  Even the book alone would make a nice present for the artistically challenged.  This book will take you step by easy step through the printing process.  There are plenty of helpful tips and suggestions, and it is also beautifully illustrated.  I think this would make a good project for children too.

She works as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie who is a bail bondsman.  She doesn't have the constraints placed on her that a cop or a PI has, or if she does, she ignores them.  She's the most honest, real and true character I've come across in a long time.  All the characters in this book are wonderful.  The cop friend, Morelli is yummy.  If he was real he'd probably be high calorie.  Grandma Mazur is great.  At her age she can get away with anything, and frequently does.  She knows a lot about the world...she's seen it on TV.  Very few books have ever made me laugh out loud, but this one did.  Over and over again. I don't think Janet Evanovich is a rising star.  I think she's already there	1997-07-28

Next to DYING FOR CHOCOLATE this is my favorite.  I missed Goldy's previous helper Julian, but Macquire Perkins is a good new addition.  I liked the action in this one...more intense than in previous books.  Another new character I especially liked was Jake the dog.  His exquisite bloodhound nose was invaluable in solving this one.  The recipes, as always, are great.  I've already made the gourmet dog biscuits and now my dog's favorite author is Ms. Davidson.  The only problem with these books is that I get hungry and snack too much while reading about Goldy cooking up yummy stuff in her kitchen..	1997-07-24

If it can, then this book has it.  The descriptions of the school yard took me back, in a flash, to my elementary school in Long Beach, California years ago.  Do you remember school rooms in bungalows?  And tetherball?  Mosley is absolutely THE master of dialogue.  Sometimes too much of one author can get tiresome, but not in this case.  I read BLACK BETTY just before this book and the dialogue continues to be fresh and sparkling.  I enjoyed the dry humor sprinkled throughout the story.  It suits Easy very well and I'd like to see more of it in future books.  The foray into the culinary experience was another new addition that I liked a lot.  The main story line held together well and moved along almost effortlessly.  I finished this book yesterday and I still don't know how I feel about the ending.  I'm sure it will stay with me for a long while.  Walter Mosley is one of the best authors around today, in my opinion.  I eagerly await the next installment in the saga of Easy Rawlins	1997-07-09

Anna Pigeon is a ranger with the National Park Service.  She is currently serving as security and EMT at a fairly routine fire in the Lassen Volcanic National Park when things suddenly go to hell in a hand basket.  The firestorm scenes are absolutely riveting.  The characters are all very well developed.  Some are easy to love and some are easy to hate.  There is plenty of sophisticated, witty humor sprinkled throughout.  Some of it made me laugh out loud.  The landscape descriptions were the next best thing to being there.  And tying it all together is a whopping good murder mystery.    I probably shouldn't make comparisons but I will.  Nevada Barr has Sue Grafton beat by a mile	1997-07-04

I enjoy getting to know him better in each of Mosley's books.  But because Walter Mosley has such a wonderful talent for character development, I probably will never have Easy figured out completely.  What amazes me about these books is that they read like a serial but any one of them can stand on it's own without any long, detailed introductions or explanations.  Black Betty does not disappoint.  Easy juggles several situations at once and manages to bring order and justice to his world by the end of the book.  I think the most endearing quality of Easy's is the love and care he gives to his kids, Jesus and Feather.  The time spent with his family gives a good balance to the darker side of his life on the streets.  There are some big surprises in this story...some good and some sad and good at the same time.  I bought this book a long time ago and saved it until the next Easy Rawlings book came out so I could read them both at the same time because when I finish a Walter Mosley book I always want more.  I wish he could write `em as fast as I can read `em	1997-07-03

But I found the in's and out's of the New York art world a bit dull.  It's just not a subject that interests me, but some people might enjoy it.

Not always a good reason to buy a book, but in this case it worked out just fine.  Sometimes an author can grab you and put you right into the story at the beginning of a book.  Teri Holbrook does that with Grass Widow.  The atmosphere of the story reminds me a little of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistle Stop Caf by Fannie Flagg.  There is more than one mystery to be solved here and the characters involved in doing so are well developed and likable.

There are several mysteries going on at the same time but they are very neatly woven together  There is an execution scene that rivals the ones in King's Green Mile and Grisham's Chamber  I hate it when they make movies out of books I like but this would make a good one	1997-04-15

The female charactersare very well developed, strong and clever.  The story moves along at a brisk clip and the ending is very satisfying.  I would like to see more interaction between Jane and Carey in future books.  (I hope they have a future!)  The dialogue between the two of them is fun and sparkling.  The incident with the beeper was priceless.  I guess I'll have to break down and buy the next Jane Whitefield novel in hardback.  I can't wait!	1997-04-06

Her last one, Home Song, was a little disappointing but she is back on track with this one.  The characters are well developed and likable.  The story line isn't exactly riveting and it gets a little syrupy in places but who cares, it's a pleasurable read	1997-03-29

There is a big difference between a writer and a story teller.  Amy Tan is an excellent story teller.  She made me really care about the people in her story.  They seemed so real, at times I forgot I was reading fiction.  I won't hesitate to buy her books in the future	1997-03-10
