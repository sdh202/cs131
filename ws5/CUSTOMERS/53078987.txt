I read it from cover-to-cover in just a few hours.<br /><br />The book is a great portrayal of extended-family life and the troubles and joys of all its members. Ray does a wonderful job of depicting the behavior of all her characters, from the youngest to the oldest. I did not wnat to leave this family when I reached the last page....I want to know more about how they spent the money, how Nora handled her babies, Plummy's future success, and if Sarah ever stopped watching Willy Wonka!!!!	2005-06-02

I could not put it down.<br /><br />My interpretation is that the love story was the love between the mother and daughter. Bethie cares for Teena as though she were the mother. Poor Teena was not only raped, but she was traumatized and let down over and over again after the crime, as her life falls even farther apart. Until John Dromoor, determined to get justice for Bethie and Teena, enters the picture, that is.<br /><br />I read and re-read the ultimately satisfying ending of the story. Very few endings have been so very \\"right\\".	2005-05-31

What a despicable character....and what a writing genius Banks is, at least in this book, to make me feel this way.<br /><br />However, I like linear novels, so Banks' jumping back and forth in time is NOT my favorite device. Wouldn't the book  have been just as effective if the reader had not known at the beginning that Hannah escaped from Liberia and got back to the States? What is the point of starting the book out with her being 50- something and living in Vermont?<br /><br />For me, doing this totally eliminates any dramatic tension that this reader might experience.<br /><br />Back to the main character: I knew people like Hannah- I called them \\"convenient militants\\". She was also egotistical, self-absorbed, selfish, and overly impressed with herself and her so-called role in Liberia. For all her desire to make a better life for those who were oppressed, she was totally uninvolved and detached from daily life in her adopted country. In my opinion, ahe had no redeeming qualities....no matter what happened,it was ALL ABOUT HER.<br /><br />When Hannah went back to her mother's, I had to laugh at a comment she made about her mother being so self-centered. Talk about the apple not falling far from the tree!!!<br /><br />One thing that really bothered me----I know this is fiction, but I found the coincidence of Charles Taylor just happening to be in the same jail as Hannah's old friend to be a bit forced. And the fact of Hannah being in New Bedford just at this exact time was highly improbable. I guess that is artistic license but it rang very false to me.<br /><br />I have no idea of how accurate this novel is, but it has spurred me on to learn more about Liberia	2005-05-31

It follows Betta, a 50-something widow, along her path of grief following the death of her beloved husband. The book, however, was a bit too \\"enchanted\\" for me....even though Betta was suffering from the loss of her husband, somehow things just fell into place too easily for her.Finding the perfect house the first day in a new town, and having friends rush to her aid after not corresponding with them for 30 years --these were things that were just too good to be true!<br /><br />Many parts of the book were glimpses into the past: her college years, her courtship, parts of her marriage, her husband's dying. These glimpses helped to flesh Betta out, but she was not nearly as well-developed a character as Nan in \\"Pull of the Moon\\".<br /><br />While coincidence played a bit more of a role than I usually like, Berg's lovely writing and her understanding of grief overcame the negatives.<br /><br />I would recommend this book....with reservations.	2005-05-31

I liked this new book, just not quite as much as his other.<br /><br />\\"Lizzie's War\\" is the story of Lizzie and Michael O'Reilly and takes place in 1968-69, during the Viet Nam War. He is a Marine officer who is in VN and she is at home in VA with three children, expecting a fourth. The story alternates between her life and his, and is an interesting juxtaposition. I think that Farrington does outstanding  character development and did a great job of describing a family that truly is living on the edge.<br /><br />While I wanted to kick Michael for re-enlisting when he had family obligations, at the same time, the author made me understand his reasons. I admired Lizzie, because although sometimes she was \\"down\\" (who wouldn't be, in her situation?), she was not a whiner.<br /><br />Well worth reading.	2005-05-30

I've read all his books--- just bought his \\"Bad Haircut\\" and am looking forward to reading it now.<br />The cast of characters in \\"Little Children\\" are people that we all have known--- but we were not clever enough to write a book about them! Perrotta is a great observer of the human condition and depicted these have-it-all suburbanites and their lives perfectly in this satire. Every one is dissatisfied and is looking for a way out of their current situation.....they have all seemingly arrived at the current time in their lives by following the paths of least resistance or by accident, or both. They all seem to take the easy way out, as though they have no moral choice.<br />The characters are self-important and self-absorbed and let the reader know that they are doing the most important job in the world, bringing up children. I happen to agree that this is the most important job, but there is a right way and an obnoxious way to make this point.<br />Despite the way he skewers his characters, you can tell that Perrotta is really fond of them, and he manages to get the reader to take an unbiased look at even the one who deserves our consideration in the least. To do this requires a delicate balancing act, one that Perrotta seems to have mastered.	2004-04-12

To have such perception, such vision, such maturity, and such knowledge of the intricacies of family life is something I would expect of a writer twice that age.<br />This is also, I believe, her only novel set in the south, where Tyler was brought up. In a rare interview, she has said that she considers herself a Southerner. She certainly paints a good picture of a typical extended southern family! And this family has all the quirks and curious behaviors that have become Tyler's hallmark over the years.<br />Poor BenJoe...he is so confused, having taken the path of least resistance by going to law school in New York City, a totally foreign element to this small-town boy. He uses the slightest excuse to rush back home where he gets into everyone's business in a few short days, even though the houseful of women (mother, grandmother, five sisters, and a niece) clearly was doing just fine without him. Tyler makes us like him. She writes from his point of view and gets it letter-perfect.<br />This book is about much more than a small-town extended southern family - it is about birth and death, living and dying, and the unbreakable bonds of family.	2004-04-08

I had heard a lot of praise for this book via word-of-mouth and since I am interested in the publishing industry, I gave it a try. I should never have started reading it at 9 PM because it kept me up until the wee hours of the morning!<br />No summary needed--Amazon did that above very adequately.<br />Arthur Reid, whoever s/he might be, sure gave us an insider's look at the business of making books. When you see how random it is that a book is chosen to become a *star*, it makes you wonder how many great books are ignored.<br />I loved the clever way this book was written, starting off as a tale of a small-town, would-be writer and then escalating into a full-blown literary thriller. The twists and turns always seemed plausible, not forced, and I found myself rooting for Steven even though he had initially done something that was morally wrong. I think it takes a good writer to get the reader on the side of the &quot;bad&quot; guy!<br />I would highly recommend this book!	2004-02-08

The cover says that it is a lesson in business mis-management -- or something to that effect --and that is such a good way to put it.<br />They did everything wrong: concocting the recipes; marketing the products; having a makeshift office (furnished with Newman's pool furniture, including an umbrella); finding people to make and distribute the products. It makes for a great tale, and the best part is that they have made TONS of money from it and charities have been the sole beneficiaries of their largesse. From $1 million the first year to $140 million in a recent year, the profits keep getting spent on doing good for others.<br />Newman's pickiness about his products have made them very desirable and have helped attracted followers who are very loyal to the name.<br />I knew about the charities funded by the company, but not much about the &quot;Hole in the Wall Gang&quot; camps that now are in operation all over the U.S. and beyond.

After an initial period of awkwardness, the two women arrive at a truce and actually begin to enjoy each other's company. Lady Pamela lost her only daughter many years ago and Maeve lost her mother to emotional detachement when she was young, so they form and interesting attachment, although never as &quot;mother and daughter&quot; per se.<br />To cope with her boredom with country living, Maeve makes Lady Pamela's prematurely retired racehorse her pet project.

I read this after watching the series &quot;Restaurant&quot; and it was a good follow-up to the show. They are entirely different restaurants, but had many things in common and it was easy for me to picture the goings on at DANIEL.<br />Brenner covered both the &quot;front of the house&quot; and the area behind the kitchen doors. We met reservationists, the maitre de, Daniel, waiters and bus boys, chefs and line cooks. We learn about VIP seating, wine buying, and much about the backbreaking and stressful jobs involved in running a fine restaurant.<br />The best parts were what I would call the gossipy stuff and the food descriptions.<br />Unfortunately, this book should have been a long article.

This book was a real eye-opener for me and I hope to read more about this strife-ridden country. The themes of betrayal, forgiveness, courage, cowardice, retribution, and redemption are woven throughout the narrative.

It is that or jail. He is given a total makeover and prepped by a behavioral psychologist to cope with the demands at Trion Systems.<br />Adam then must pretend to have been a whiz kid at Wyatt after he is hired by Trion, totally based on his false credentials. He is constantly on edge, spending all of his time attempting to keep up with the demands of his new job while trying to spy for Wyatt. Complicating his life are his guilt about his dying father and the new, elaborate lifestyle which he has come to enjoy. His Porsche, his fancy apartment, and his beautiful new girlfriend are not enough to assauge his conscience, though, and he must eventually decide whether to continue the betrayal of his basic principles.<br />I did find it hard to swallow that so many of the corporate people were such bad guys and gals and also that Adam would meet his \\"keepers\\" from Wyatt in such public places. But despite a few improbable situations and an abrupt ending that left me scratching my head and wondering if I had pages missing, I enjoyed this book and would not hesitate to recommend it.

As one of the main characters said: \\"When you're famous at 18, you spend the rest of your life fading away.\\" I am sure that we all know someone who has never gotten over this early fame and it has most likely damaged their life.<br />The following description, taken from this book, could be applied to many sports in high schools across America:<br />\\"It was silly. Grown men crying after a loss. The entire town living and dying with each game. Prayer breakfasts every Friday morning, as if God cares who wins a high school football game.

The double standard-a football player cheats on a test, everybody scrambles to cover it up. A non-athlete cheats, and he gets suspended.\\"<br />The novel takes place over four days in the southern town of Messina, as former football players gather to await the death of Eddie Rake, the former coach of the Messina Spartans, who is dying from cancer. The ex-players hold their vigil in the bleachers at the high school stadium, now named Rake Field, drinking beer and reminiscing about the hard-to-love, hard-to-hate coach who has affected them all in various ways. They talk about Rake's six-year winning streak, the 13 state titles Messina won, the tragedy that ended Eddie's career, and the legendary 1987 championship game in which the coaches never came back to the field after halftime.<br />Anyone who has ever played on or cheered for a high school football team will appreciate the story told in \\"Bleachers\\" -- a story that will surely bring back forgotten memories. Each character is someone whom you knew in high school.

With some decent editing and organizing, this book could have been so good. I really wanted to love it. Instead, I found that it is a cursory set of observations and interviews, a bunch of vignettes with no depth. The development of a story was nonexistent.<br />Beginning in 1998, Lipsky spent four years at West Point: attending classes; going into barracks and the mess hall; visiting the nearby towns with cadets; and watching all of the training. He followed one class from the day they entered through their graduation. During these years, he wanted to try to find out why so many bright young Americans give up so much to study here and become Army officers. Well, if he found out, he never informed his readers.<br />In this almost totally anecdotal description of West Point, Lipsky describes a college environment unlike any \\"regular\\" college. He writes of the two conflicting value systems faced by these cadets: \\"huah\\", an all-purpose word comprising the military value system which emphasizes discipline, honor, duty, loyalty, courage, self-sacrifice, and controlled violence; versus society's value system with its emphasis on freedom, individuality, self-expression, pleasure, and monetary gain.<br />Lipsky is there when \\"The Changes\\" are instituted, altering the rules, traditions, and the deprivation that had once seemed unchangeable. \\"The Changes\\" allowed phones, TV, and music in the cadets' rooms, and brought about the end of hazing, among other things. It was implied at the end of the book that some of these privileges might be changed in the future.<br />One contradiction I noticed, which the author does not address, is that although it is widely accepted that a leader must be an independent thinker, this is not encouraged at West Point (nor at any of the military academies, for that matter). The message instead seems to be: be independent, lose your career.<br />I think that Lipsky was so enamored of West Point that he found it difficult to perform any critical analysis of the weakness of the system. Although he does disclose some of the Academy's weaknesses, he does not try to find out why they exist nor how they could be changed or improved upon. He seemed unable to stand back and look at the place with objectivity.<br />This book was full of fascinating information, but could have been much more compelling had it been better written. I also think a glossary would have been a helpful addition because of all the military terms and acronyms that were used.<br />This was worth reading because it is about a fascinating place, as are all of our military academies, each in its own way. I am sure that equally interesting books could be written about each one. I just hope that authors of any future books which might be written about our military academies make an attempt to write more deeply, develop an organized format, and make an honest assessment of the institution.analysis of the weakness of the system.

The short \\"chapters\\" and first-person narration gave the book and the story an immediacy that propelled the reader forward. Every page I turned gave me hope that Melinda would somehow find the strength she needed to at last reveal what had happened to her and release herself from the pain and anguish she is living with.<br />The book is funny, painful, and gut-wrenching at the same time. The author shows how cruel high school kids can be and are, and the heartbreak that comes from this cruelty. That part is very sad....one mis-step and someone is condemned. I cannot even begin to imagine the pain of having NO ONE to talk to.<br />I would like to think that some high school students would read this book and change their attitudes; I would like to see this book discussed in our high schools. It should be mandatory reading.	2003-06-06

This lovely book, published at the time of the 200th anniversary of the occupation of the White House, consists of a compilation of essays written by a panel of distinguished writer-historians. It contains over 100 illustrations, including the earliest photos, taken in the 1840s.<br />The introduction, entitled \\"Like No Other House\\" says it all!The White House is unique: a \\"private\\" family home,  the  hub of our government, a tourist attraction, and a place of ceremony. It has been the scene of some of history's most important events and some of history's most important figures have stayed under its roof.<br />The White House has survived: from the burning by the British only 14 years after John and Abigail Adams moved in through many periods of neglect and mismanagement.<br />The book focuses more on personalities than on politics, especially the First ladies, who are given great credit by many of the essayists.<br />Beginning with John and Abigail Adams' short residency, the first essay follows Abigail on her long journey from Massachusetts to the \\"marshlands of the Potomac\\", where she found a barely furnished house with no wood to heat it, an unfinished staircase, and plaster walls that were still damp.<br />Dolley Madison managed to combine simplicity with high style with the help of architect Benjamin Latrobe. The Madison's tenure was cut short when the British burned the Executive Mansion, as it was called, in 1814.<br />The house was rebuilt as a national symbol, but by the time the Lincolns moved in over 100 years later, it was a shabby place. The once-elegant public rooms had threadbare rugs, dirty upholstery, faded draperies, and few amenities. Mary Lincoln immediately took upon herself the transformation of the President's house, traveling to New York and Philadelphia during wartime to look for rugs, wallpaper, china, and crystal and having much of the furniture restored. Despite her efforts,  during public events, people actually cut off pieces of the wallpaper, rugs, and curtains for souvenirs.<br />Theodore Roosevelt \\"remade the presidency and reinvented the White House and his models for both have lasted a century\\" according to the essayist who wrote the section about him. He changed the name from the Executive Mansion to the White House and added the West Wing for executive offices. Unfortunately, the renovation was finished too fast and was mainly cosmetic. Only 50 years later, a massive structural rebuilding had to be undertaken.<br />I learned much more about those who have occupied the White House, but will control myself and not go into any more of that here! Believe  me, this is a book that you will learn from, even if you think you know American history fairly well.llpaper, rugs, and curtains for souvenirs.<br />Theodore Roosevelt \\"remade the presidency and reinvented the White House and his models for both have lasted a century\\" according to the essayist who wrote the section about him.

She would like to see cooking, especially baking, become pleasurable rather than a chore.<br />I liked the narrative in this book....it certainly makes the cookbook more personal and interesting. Instead of endless pages of ingredients and recipes, Lawson &quot;talks&quot; to her readers.<br />She defines comfort cooking as &quot;feeling good,  wafting along in the sweet, warm-smelling air, unwinding, no longer being just an office creature&quot;.<br />I can't wait to try the Zucchini Cake, the Sponge Drops (which she calls saucer cakes), the Pistachio Macaroons, and some of the trifles.<br />(I will be cautious, however, based on some of the comments made here. Too many people have written about &quot;bad&quot; recipes to not take their warnings into consideration.)	2003-05-12

It shows Faberge art in American collections, acquired over the past 100 years.<br />Part of the focus is on Faberge's famous Easter eggs, the majority of which belong to American collectors, but the book also presents gold, enamel, and hardstone pieces by the artist-jeweler.<br />Carl Faberge joined his father's jewelry business in St. Petersburg, Russia. During the last quarter of the 19th century,  an archaeological revival in jewelry was in fashion. Carl copied antique Greek jewelry and  exhibited it, under the patronage of Czar Alexander III. This was a great success, and afterwards he branched out from making conventional French-style jewelry to making art pieces (such as enameled gold snuffboxes and the first of his Easter eggs). He gained international fame and more honors were bestowed on him. His workshops produced an endless stream of objects of incredible beauty and workmanship.<br />A total of 56 of Faberge's eggs were made: 44 survive and two are known only from photos. Most were made for the royal family of Russia. The preparation alone to make an egg could last as long as two years.<br />Despite the fame of his Easter eggs, they were just a minute part of what Faberge produced. His 500 craftsmen designed and made over 150,000 pieces of jewelry and other art objects. Most of the jewelry was destroyed after the Revolution - only smaller objects survived this purge. The silver objects that survived were mostly functional ones - others were melted down.<br />Fantasy objects, many made of gold and &quot;hardstones&quot;, brought Faberge his greatest fame. His most zealously guarded secret was the process used to make his enamels.<br />Faberge fled Russia in 1918 and died in Switzerland two years later.<br />I learned so much from this little book...well worth reading!	2003-05-12

Many treasures have been dispersed all over the world because of being found by private persons.<br />Materials were selected for their color rather than for their &quot;refractive powers, brilliance, or rarity.&quot;<br />Next the author discussed the uses of jewelry in ancient Egypt. Jewelry was used for personal adornment of men as much as for women, and used in burials, for the shrines of the gods, and as temple furnishings. The most common use of jewelry was as amulets - to protect the wearers from harm.<br />The materials used by craftsmen to make jewelry in ancient Egypt were shells, horns, tusks, claws, stones, and gold. Some of the most popular stones were carnellian, lapis lazuli, and  turquoise (very different from the veiny turquoise we see here in the U.S).<br />A very informative book.	2003-05-11

It was intended to cover the &quot;inspirational forces&quot; for Art Nouveau and Art Deco jewelry (people, places, ideas, and events) but the way it was presented made the information not very valuable, at least to me.<br />One thing I learned---while I knew that &quot;nouveau&quot; meant new, I learned that &quot;deco&quot; meant &quot;young.<br />Section 2 had some wonderful color plates of pieces of jewelry and the third section had lists of designs,  motifs,  and materials for &quot;new art&quot; jewelry.<br />Section 4 had &quot;thumbnail sketches&quot; of jewelers, jewelry designers/makers, manufacturers and retailers.<br />The last section was an interesting glossary of jewelry terms and types. I especially enjoyed the information about hallmarks, enamel, combs, hatpins, and purses (mesh and beaded).	2003-05-11

Another high-quality, gorgeous book from Taunton Press, a company that I remember from its inception when I lived in Newtown, Connecticut!<br />This book is full of countless beautiful color photos and drawings that add immensely to the author's viewpoints and to his descriptions of the components of a distinctive home.<br />Eck discusses every aspect of a home: siting the house; the roof; the landscaping, and everything in between. He overlooks no detail that will aid homeowners in deriving a sense of satisfaction from their homes. The homes he describes are livable and comfortable.<br />I especially liked reading Eck's four elements of a &quot;pleasing&quot; house and the significance and importance he attaches to each element.	2003-04-24

It was so busy, so &quot;hyper&quot; (much like the show!) that it was almost an assault to my eyes. I am sure that this design/format was intentional, but it made the book much less enjoyable for me. All the little boxes and sidebars made it impossible to read anything straight through.<br />Other than that, it was a pleasant diversion.	2003-04-24

History should always be presented this way!<br />King gives the reader a behind-the-scenes look at all of the intrigue, power plays, artistic jealousy that went on during this era in Italy. The painting of frescoes on the Sistine Chapel's ceiling was fraught with difficulties, not the least of which were the politics of the time.<br />I especially liked reading the technical aspects of this monumental project: the mixing of the pigments and the logistics of how Michelangelo actually accomplished the painting.<br />This topic has fascinated me ever since reading National Geographic's wonderful account of the restoration of the frescoes. King's book gave me all the background and particulars that I had wondered about.<br />A most worthwhile book for anyone interested in learning the history of one of art's masterpieces.	2003-04-14

The celebrity names and jewels did not really interest me nearly as much as the stories about the jewelry designers who were featured.<br />As another reviewer said, the book had some fascinating pieces of information about jewelry design and designers. I especially liked reading about the Art Deco &quot;artists&quot;, as that is a style I have always admired, whether it be furnishings, art, or jewelry.<br />As lovely as this book is, it left me yearning for more detailed information, which I shall try to find elsewhere.....But it sure was pretty to look at!	2003-04-14

My only criticism is that it gave little insight into the man at the center of all of these women's lives since he is seen only through their eyes. Maybe that was the intent of the author, but if so, it left me with several questions about his past and what could have caused him to turn out the way he did.<br />I thought that the novel was presented in an interesting and unique way, with each Mrs. Kimble's story being told in sequence over a period of 30 years. The way the author tied up the story at the end was neither contrived nor forced (as it easily could have been) ---it was very well done.<br />These three vulnerable women were all taken in by the elusive Ken Kimble, who changed his persona to fit the circumstances, like a chameleon. His basic cold and conniving personality, however, remained the same through his lifetime. He was a con man and a grifter who managed to insinuate himself into these women's lives through lies and manipulation.As soon as he &quot;got&quot; them, his normal selfish ways re-emerged.<br />I think that Haigh's  particular gift is that she was able to render these three very different women so realistically, to get into their hearts and souls, despite their very unique circumstances.<br />I have one little nit-picky question and that is about the cover...were those three dresses supposed to represent the three Mrs. Kimbles? If so......where is the one for Joan? None of these were the kind she would wear.<br />I would recommend this book for its unique presentation and for its insight into the wives. I think it would provide great book club discussion too.	2003-04-14

Not only that, but some of them were autographed -- my children attended a school near where he lives and he visited their school several times. They were always entranced by him and by his books.<br />Lo and behold, walking through a store the other day, \\"Stargirl\\" called out to me. The cover was the hook and after reading the jacket copy, I decided that it was a book I had to have. I talked to my niece that night and she told me it was a very special book and she was glad that I and bought it!<br />So am I! What a totally delightful story of someone who is different...and not afraid to be that way. What a role model Stargirl can be for so many kids today. This book sends a really good message about being your own person and true to yourself....yet it does not gloss over the hurt that may result from being this kind of person.<br />I thought the characters in this story were finely wrought and the story itself spun out in an almost magical way. I also liked that the author wrote an unpredictable ending.<br />I would recommend this for young adults---of all ages!	2003-04-10

Maybe she felt she could let go for the YA audience more so than for adults. Well, I am one adult who will tell you that I am glad to have read this. I intend to pass it along to my 12 year old niece and then discuss it with her.<br />I actually read this book twice: the first time, I raced through it, and the second time, I took my time, reveling in the beautiful prose and making notes.<br />There were certain phrases I wanted to remember...like the people at the \\"forgetting shack\\" who did not know how to face the darkness of their lives. This made me think of the parallels in our world. Many of the characters in the book were \\"trapped in the foggy ground between forgetting and living\\". Or this: \\"She was so busy forgetting, she couldn't take a single step into the future.\\"<br />This is a story so full of meaning and symbolism, so simple yet so complex, that I am sure one could get something new out of it each time it is read.	2003-04-10

The quirky baggage-laiden characters and difficult situations reminded me of Anne Tyler's writing, which I love. The book  was not overly detailed nor overwritten; the dialogue was realistic; and the characters were very appealing. The warm and honestly rendered story was full of hope and everyday spirituality, written in such lovely language.<br />Michael and Rebecca, as well as her daughter Mary Martha, are delightful, real, and engaging characters - and so are the &quot;minor&quot; characters. Farrington's portrayal of their day-to-day life struggles will endear these folks to all who read the book.	2003-03-27

The beautiful format and layout, as well as the photos, makes this a cookbook to be treasured. Many of the recipes are simple, basic ones that many of us already have, which is why I gave this four stars instead of five.<br />As usual, every recipe I have tried has been a success (Turkey Lasagna, Banana Sour Cream Pancakes, Shrimp Scampi, Rice Pudding, Mustard Vinagrette). I especially love the simple ingredients and the non-fussy style of the cooking. The recipes please my family and myself and keep my time in the kitchen at a minimum, which makes me very happy.<br />Although I did not garner as many new recipes from this cookbook as I did her other two, I would not hesitate to give this as a wedding shower gift to a novice cook.<br />Looking forward to Ina's next cookbook.	2003-03-27

I had thought that perhaps this book would be like the dozen or so similar books which I have abandoned, unfinished; books that were an attempt to write humorously about the single life, boy-meets-girl in a big city. Same old, same old.<br />To my surprise, &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot; was different and I actually finished it! Not only that, but I finished it in record time!<br />Perhaps it was the format that I liked best, with the entire book comprised of e-mails. Since I love epistolary novels, this appealed to me, and the e-mails gave just enough information, without too much detail but with fairly distinct characterization. The story was also helped along by the touch of mystery and the bit of well-intentioned deceit. While it was not great literature, it was an entertaining read.<br />I liked this book with its slightly wacky, fast-moving and ever-changing plot and found it a good diversion. It was cleverly done in a way that roped the reader in and made it hard to put the book down. I could not wait to open the next e-mail and see the direction which the story would take.	2003-03-19

As I read along, I was forced, however, to suspend belief because the action in this book just did not compute with my sense of reality and there were so many things that just did not make sense to me.<br />For one thing, Scott has just too many super-powers for a boy of his age and background. This was detrimental to the story because I found myself saying &quot;yeah, right, sure&quot; so many times.<br />I also found several major errors of fact and this was most distracting. I would have expected better research. Like another reader, I think Gilstrap's best book was &quot;Nathan's Run&quot;...it was so well-done.<br />I gave this book a &quot;4&quot; because it kept me involved and the story moved quickly. I would give it a &quot;3&quot; for content, however.	2003-03-19

What an unexpected treat when I found it!<br />This collection of related stories with alternating narrators was wonderful and forced me to use my imagination to figure out what went on between the stories and think about the details that Hoffman had left out. I would have loved to have read more about this family, but perhaps the author intended to leave us wondering.<br />The strong women in this book overshadow the weak men in every way. Gretel's father, her brother, and Sonny offer no support to the women in the book. Gretel endures and triumphs, mostly on her own....a perfect example of that saying \\"what does not kill you will make you strong\\"..<br />Like all of Hoffman's books, this was an emotionally moving story but with a few touches (fewer than usual) of her magical realism. And, as usual, the language is PURE  magic!	2003-03-09

From the very first chapter, James Siegel takes the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotion, fear, and anticipation. His presentation of the action as a story-within-a-story was a very interesting and clever approach.<br />One action in a man's life snowballs into total disaster as Charlie Schine gives in to the temptation of a sexy and alluring stranger on the commuter train.<br />I kept wondering how much worse Charlie's life could get after the initial brutal scene in a hotel. Well, the answer is, much worse! In his attempt to pay blackmail, protect his family, get his blackmailer, and stay alive, he runs into one wall after another, seemingly with no way out. Going to the police is not an option and he is ill-equipped to handle this situation on his own.<br />I hated to go to bed because I could not wait to see how this ended. About halfway through the book, I began to have certain suspicions, but time after time, I doubted myself because of the way the story was written.<br />I would have given the book 4 stars except for the weakness of one thread of the story. I thought that the police case was very weak and based on no real and compelling evidence. Nonetheless, I have no reservations about recommending this book.	2003-03-09

So you might wonder why I am doing a review at all!<br />Well, to be honest, I have not read any of Grisham's more recent books. I have tried, but put them aside after 50 or so pages because they were of no interest to me. This book, however, grabbed me from the beginning, much as his older books did.<br />The characters of the basically unlikable Clay Carter and the mysterious Max Pace were wonderfully drawn and kept me reading to find out how Clay would eventually &quot;get his&quot;. From his beginning as a D.C. Public Defender to his millionaire status, the reader just KNEW that Clay had to fall. In this respect, the book was predictable but I still kept reading because of all the twists and turns. I never really liked Clay, but I wanted to know what happened to him.<br />Unlike many of his older books, I did have to suspend belief several times in this book when something was not adequately described or when all the rules of logic were violated.<br />A quick read that kept me near the edge of my seat.	2003-03-09

The reader knows that a connection will be made but not exactly how.<br />I was glad to revisit the women of Bad Girl Creek and catch up on their lives. Poor Phoebe is dealing (and not very well) with a personal disaster while Beryl has moved to Alaska with Earl.<br />Mapson must have great relationships with some really great girlfriends because she has wonderful insight into women's friendships and how women provide unquestioned support for each other.<br />I love reading and getting lost in this author's stories. As one reviewer said, &quot;you don't just read her books, you take up residence in them.&quot; This is so true....... I always feel like I am there, participating in the lives of the well-developed characters, feeling their joy and their pain.<br />A great read that I hated to finish!	2003-03-09

Right away, trying to cross the border into Mongolia was an issue for her and something that I thought she should have found out about beforehand. She also made some serious safety mistakes, as when she was accosted by the two young men on horseback in Mongolia. She could have easily lost her life.<br />Her writing beautifully captures the natural beauty of the lands through which she traveled and also the basic goodness of the people whom she encountered during her journey.<br />A good reading experience.	2003-02-21

Every single recipe contained the same paragraphs telling the reader how to thaw the chicken and trim it of fat, etc.<br />Many recipes repeated the directions for how to cook the chicken (for recipes requiring cooked chicken) and that was also very tiresome. I think that the author must have needed to make the book longer and that is why she repeated all of these directions.<br />Sometimes there were 4-5 paragraphs following the list of ingredients and only one was not &quot;boilerplate&quot;. Even the most novice of cooks does not need to have this information repeated over and over.	2003-02-21

While it had interesting characters (especially the &quot;calendar&quot; sisters)and I learned a lot about beekeeping,it also was based on a very far-fetched premise, one that I could not manage to get a handle on.<br />The premise that a black woman, sprung from jail by a 13 year old white girl, would run away with that child and take refuge someplace with no questions asked.....yikes, just plain unrealistic!<br />I thought this author also tried to deal with too many &quot;issues&quot; : racism, romance, child neglect, feminism, religion, mysticism, and so on. It was just too much for one book and in places the book really dragged for me.<br />These negatives were a shame because I think that the author has a beautiful grasp of language and the character development was very good. Like another reviewer, I would have liked to know more about the sisters and their pasts.	2003-02-07

I feel like the author was probably laughing at all the rave reviews, because he wrote such a looooong bit of nothingness, so self-important, such a boring stream of consciousness---- surely it was a joke. As another reviewer said, it was much ado about nothing, aspiring to be called \\"literary\\" by its boring descriptions and endless details.<br />The entire story, even the ludicrous and contrived ending, just does not work. And I could find little of the \\"beautiful language\\" which so many people raved about.<br />The characters were not only uninteresting, but also poorly developed. They took the \\"stage\\" for such brief periods -- how was one to get to know them? Therefore, this reader never really cared about any of them.<br />The only reason I finished this book was because I was trying to find out what all the hullabaloo was about. That was the only thing that kept me going.<br />I wish there was something good that I could say about \\"Atonement\\"....I had expected so much from this book.	2003-01-06

I was not disappointed (which often happens with raved-about books!).<br />Set in Scotland, this is an intelligent book which asks that we suspend belief to accommodate Eva's \\"companions\\", a young girl and a woman who accompany her through her life, appearing randomly, and able to be seen only by Eva. Although we sense that they are there to protect her, they also change the course of her life (but not its eventual outcome). Livesey deftly blurs the real and that which is fantasy, making all of these appearances by the companions, and their actions, seem natural.<br />Where do people go when they die? Are there spirits out there, watching over us? Is the bond between mother and daughter unbreakable and eternal? These are some of the things to be pondered while reading this book.<br />Livesey's telling of Eva's story, her coming-of-age, is unique and lovely. She makes the reader feel that it is perfectly logical that these companions should appear to Eva yet be kept a secret by her, even as a young child.<br />Realistic yet magical, this is a poignant and moving story with much food for thought.	2003-01-06

I always find this such an interesting perspective, seeing how an artist's vision changes and evolves. And I also liked the way that the relationship between Hockney's life and his art is explored.<br />The illustrations were grand too!<br />A worthwhile book and a good study of Hockney, his life, and his works.	2002-12-20

This was a book that I was unable to \\"get into\\" when it was first published and I put it aside to read at some other time. Well, I finally got to it and am glad that I gave it another try.<br />I was originally put off by the flashback device, not a favorite of mine, but I was able to overcome my dislike of that and get through the book. I always feel like an author is trying to \\"hook\\" readers by using this device....like dangling a carrot and then pulling it away out of sight!<br />I thought this was a good story and a very thorough exploration of certain thorny moral, ethical, and legal issues. I knew that, no matter what the outcome, the lives of Sibyl and her family would never be the same.<br />Bohjalian did a really wonderful job of conveying the feelings and emotions of all the characters. His character development was first-rate, as I think it always is in his books.	2002-12-14

I agree with several other reviewers who found this book much too long and overwritten. Some of the rambling thoughts, often very deep for the types of characters thinking such thoughts, were really overdone. Sometimes the language was hauntingly beautiful and sometimes it was so smothered in wordiness as to not be comprehensible.<br />That said, I think the bones of a good story were there, just too well-padded to always be evident. The author took an interesting approach and the story was somewhat different than other post-Civil War tales. This was the only thing that kept me reading.....but I must admit that I often scanned long passages that seemed to take detours away from the heart of the plot.<br />I look forward to watching this author's progress.	2002-12-14

It was amazing to her that Beth actually had a better support system than she did in her so-called \\"normal\\" life.<br />Interspered in the monthly entries are vignettes about the past shared by these two sisters and their siblings. Their total abandonment by their mother when she decided to marry an abusive convict was heart-wrenching. But this book was never whiny- rather, it showed the resilience of this family.<br />I learned a lot about the social services, within a community, that are provided to disabled people like Beth. Her \\"team\\" seemed very caring and involved with her life.<br />I felt Rachel's frustration as she tried to convince Beth to eat better, take better medical and dental care of herself, and to get some kind of a job. Beth's stubbornmess and willfulness were also a challenge to her sister, as was her demanding attitude.<br />This book is perceptive, enlightening, painfully honest....and memorable. I am so glad that I read it and that Rachel Simon allowed me into her world.	2002-12-06

I love handling them and looking for hidden clues in the drawings.<br />That said, I feel that I don't know Isabella and Matthew as well as I knew Griffin and Sabine. G and S were much less mysterious and I was able to make more sense of what was going on. I also felt that Bantock wrote each of his original trilogy without resorting to cliffhangers,  a device which I find a bit off-putting, and which he used in &quot;The Gryphon&quot; and  again in &quot;Alexandria&quot;.<br />However, none of these complaints will stop me from buying anything Nick Bantock writes!	2002-12-04

On the one hand, as I was reading it, I kept thinking &quot;romance&quot;, which is a genre I never read. But as I finished it, I thought &quot;not REALLY a romance&quot;.<br />What sets this novel apart from a romance (girl has tragedy in her life, meets a guy, falls in love, tries not to succumb, gives in, lives happily ever after) is the writing, both its quality and style. The author writes lovingly of her characters and never resorted to sappiness, even though the plot was very predictable.<br />I also felt that this book gave a fairly accurate depiction of life in eastern Texas...the remote ranch/farm life and its daily grind as well as life in a very small town in the same area. Moyer wrote of these places as though she had been there, done that.<br />The author also gave a good picture of life at the heart of a kind and loving (sometime smothering) family who surrounded Lucy and allowed her to grieve as she needed to do and supported her in her time of greatest need with unconditional love.<br />I look forward to another novel by this author.	2002-12-02

But it does give a concise background of Middle East civilization and culture.<br />Due to my abyssmal understanding of that part of the world, this book was slow reading for me, and I even had to take notes at some points. But I believe that I got a good overview of how the Middle East cultures have dealt with being left behind by Western technology, education, etc.<br />For centuries, Islam had represented the \\"greatest military power on earth, was the foremost economic power in the world, and had achieved the highest level of arts and science in civilization.\\" Christian Europe had once been considered barbaric and uncultured and then everything changed when it began winning battles and making advances in all areas of commerce and culture. The Renaissance, the Reformation, and the technological revolution all passed unnoticed in Islamic lands.<br />Lewis points out the huge disparity between the Western and Middle Eastern cultures in the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. He compares Christianity and Islam, music and other arts, treatment of women, religion vs. secularism, and the economics of the two cultures.<br />Even if this book does not answer ALL questions (and really, what book can?), it was certainly worth reading.	2002-11-25

It was a struggle to finish it and I forgot it within hours.<br />The author parodies the residents of a small southern town - which might be okay if it had not been done a thousand times before (and better, too, I think). It just did not sit well with me....no matter what his/her flaws, all the characters were good underneath. I think Dunn may have been trying to make these characters as quirky as those in his first book, but it just did not work here.<br />This may have succeeded  as a novella or a short story, but as a 300+ page novel, it went on for far too long.	2002-11-25

I forgot everything I had ever learned. Once I re-learned how to cast on, I found this to be a good reference book for the rest of the basics.<br />Abbey begins with all kinds of needles, regular and &quot;special needs&quot;, then proceeds to the extra equipment like counters, stitich holders, ring markers, etc.<br />The next chapter covers all types of yarns, man-made and wools that include vicuna, cashmere, and alpaca. Also included is a description of how yarns are made and the history of yarn.<br />A really valuable section was the part on abbreviations since every pattern uses them extensively.<br />All basic techniques are covered: casting on, yarn over, increasing and decreasing, casting off, cross-overs, measuring, assembling and finishing.<br />The illustrations are good if no-nonsense, but I am glad I have a friendly knitting/yarn store nearby to demonstrate for me!<br />I was fascinated with the large section about knitting with ribbons, but I have a long way to go before I am proficient enough to do this gorgeous technique.<br />The final section was devoted to a huge variety of pattern stitches which I may someday be able to do--with lots of practice.	2002-11-21

I have given away so many copies already.<br />This lovely and insightful story is one that readers can turn to in times of confusion, sorrow, or fear....any time that they need comfort, courage, and inspiration or when one is searching for answers in life's turmoil. It is about what can happen if we just persevere and be the best that we can possibly be; about balance in our lives; about what is important and what is not.<br />This is a book for all ages because the messages in it can be interpreted at all levels of understanding. I am not usually one who is fond of a lot of symbolism in books, but in this one, the symbolism worked for me.	2002-11-16

I have been a fan of David Hockney's for many many years and was delighted to find this book. He writes in an understated, easy way about his art and about modern art in general.<br />Two of the sections were particularly interesting: &quot;Art versus the Art World&quot; and &quot;The Power of Art&quot;.<br />In the book, Hockney explained how places and his personal experiences have influenced his art over the years. He talks about how he is incorporating photography into his work and feels that it is an artist's responsibility to be open to new forms of expression. He says he is an &quot;artist who is always working&quot;. I think he is always experimenting too, with different methods of expressing his artistic vision.<br />He said he asssumes that if he is interested in painting something, others will be interested as well.

Birds are described by song, breeding habits, nesting, behavior, migration, population, flight pattern, conservation, as well as by the more obvious characteristics used for identification such as size, head, plummage, tail, markings, trill, and behavior.<br />Each page is laid out so nicely and with great clarity, and has space for notes on where and when the bird was sighted.<br />The silhouettes of the birds in flight was an interesting addition to the identification process.<br />The author(s) also included the variations within each species (variations due to sex, juvenile status, seasonal characteristics, and genetic differences).<br />One section contained the anatomy of a bird and another the orthinological terms, illustrated. Both were most interesting and added to making birds easier to identify.	2002-11-07

Even though it picked up at the end with several plot twists,  this  did not make up for the boring middle, which was way too wordy and over-written. It was a struggle to endure to the end of the book, to be honest. Even the ending was not much to my liking as it seemed rushed and not very realistic.<br />No need to go into the story-that has been done by a couple of hundred reviewers before me. \\"Good in Bed\\" had the bones of a good story but, like Cannie, it was too fleshed-out and tried to deal with one too many issues, several of which were talked to death!<br />I also did not much like Cannie. I thought she was incredibly whiny and self-absorbed -I wondered what all her friends got out of their one-way friendship with her. She was not at all giving or caring throughout most of the book and was totally unappreciative of what others were doing for her. And I hated the smart-mouthiness-which seems to be a requisite for so-called witty books about young women.<br />There were little things that bothered me, like Cannie fitting into Maxi's clothes! As if !!!! Also, there was a serious error toward the end of the book. Cannie had flown into Newark International Airport, a good hour and a half from Philadelphia, when she had her \\"accident\\". Yet family and friends were said to be dropping in at the hospital -something they would not have been doing if she was in a hospital that far from Philly. Then, when she is released from the hospital she walks to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to see the baby. I think Weiner and her editor forgot that Cannie did not fly into Philadelphia Airport and that she would have been taken to the closest hospital to Newark!	2002-10-30

This time she, like Ella Brady in the novel, tells a story of a generation through the history of a legendary Dublin restaurant, Quentins. (The sign-painter left out the apostrophe and so the name remained!).<br />This is a story about normal folks, their lives, dreams, joys, and sorrows - everything that has made them the people they are today, all told in the context of the restaurant. Binchey has such a gift for characterization and for exploring the reasons why people do the things they do. And she makes her readers care about these characters, too.<br />Binchey also brings back some favorite characters from her recent novels: characters from &quot;Scarlet Feather&quot;, the Signora from &quot;Evening Class&quot;, Ria from &quot;Tara Road&quot;, and others.<br />Ella Brady wants to make a documentary film about Quentins, presided over by Patrick and Brendan Brennan, and owned by the absent Quentin Barry, who established the restaurant after receiving an unexpected gift. As she delves into the past and the present of the restaurant, she finds that she must also confront and examine some of the choices she has made in her life.<br />Binchey deftly weaves together many threads in this book as she writes about Quentins' clientele, its employees, and the Brennan family. There are a hundred stories: about people, about how the restaurant struggled to survive, about how the Brennans dealt with their childlessness. These all come together in the end, although I must say that I wondered how Ella's relationship with Don Richardson would end up. That whole part of the book was a bit odd and seemed out of place -- and is the reason I only gave the book four stars.	2002-10-29

It is a fairly complete guide to Arts and Crafts creations (defined as useful and simple designs) made from wood, stone, glass, and copper across the country.<br />The book is well-arranged by state and contains outstanding photos. Most entries include a description of the piece or building, details of its history, and visiting information.<br />The Arts and Crafts movement started in the late 1880s and ended in the late 1920s, although its designs remain popular today. The movement wanted to unite social reform, art, architecture, and the decorative arts. Proponents believed that architecture should be simple and functional, based on historical forms and constructed of local materials.<br />Notable examples of Arts and Crafts design were Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture and interiors (called the Prairie School); Stickley's Craftsman furniture; and Louis Tiffany's glass designs.<br />I would have liked it if this book had had more photos of interiors and objects, but it never promised that, so the disappointment was of my own making.	2002-10-29

I think that the Internet auction information should have been organized in a section of its own.<br />For example, the section on \\"Choosing an Auction House\\" discusses catalogs, commissions, marketing, etc. The Internet information included in this same section included selling basics, attracting a clientele, feedback, opening bids, and fraud disputes. These topics just do not fit into a chapter with live auction information.<br />Another thing--the Internet topics are not even listed in the Table of Contents, giving me more reason to suspect that they were afterthought!<br />One reviewer listed all the chapters and their contents, so I will not duplicate that.<br />I did learn a lot about appraisals, estimates, \\"as is\\", and the top ten auction bargains including silver flatware, chandeliers, old books, and monogrammed objects.	2002-10-26

I first read &quot;My Only Story&quot; and then managed to find &quot;The Secret Language&quot;. In between I read her newest book, &quot;Ernie's Ark&quot;.<br />I loved all three books even though they were quite different. All are about families and how they shape us. Part of this theme is that families may be those whom we assemble around us rather than those related by blood.<br />In &quot;The Secret Language&quot;, both Connie and Faith have suffered damage and serious neglect at the hands of their parents, Billy and Delle, traveling actors who were semi-famous but never achieved the fame they sought. These were people who really loved only themselves and the idea of who they were, and their two pretty little girls were part of this image.<br />The strong coping mechanisms that the sisters developed as children helped them then and continued to help them in adulthood. Unfortunately, the way that Faith coped was to try to avoid feeling too deeply. Despite having married into an outgoing family, the Dohertys, Faith has been walled off for so long that she is unable to connect and always feels like an outsider....they seem overwhelming to her. She seems incapable of allowing Joe to love her, and feels as if she is frozen and incapable of being any other way. Her sister Connie also fears love, but in a different way.<br />When Isadora appears and wants to be let into their lives, to be an instant sister, she does not realize she will never really be on the inside because there are no shared experiences. She will never see their father, Billy, for the narcissist whom he was, caring only about himself and the image he projected. Like Billy, Isadora is also self-absorbed and a user who will do almost anything to get her way. To say that she is manipulative is an understatement.<br />I really appreciate the way Wood develops her characters. As a reader, I feel that I know these people: feel their pain, their joy, their sorrow. What a gift!pain, their joy, their sorrow. What a gift!	2002-10-25

Bowden gives a good overview of what preceded and led up to D-Day. He describes Operation Overlord and the German defenses on the French coast, as well as the air and land assault plans.<br />Especially interesting are the authentic photos and artifacts from the collection of the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, founded by the late Stephen Ambrose. These artifacts include a soldiers' diary, the front page of the New York Times, a letter from Roosevelt, and an inspirational message from Eisenhower. All are able to be pulled out and looked at by the reader.<br />One of the artifacts, \\"A Pocket Guide to France\\" was given to the military and is included in this book as a pull out. It was simple and patriotic as it explained the military mission in France, the history of the conflict, and told the soldiers how to behave while in France.<br />Bowden also writes of the possible pitfalls in the plan, including dropping soldiers at night and the unpredictability of the weather. He concisely relates the events of D-Day, the airborne efforts, the invasion of Utah Beach, and the action of the armada, all interspersed with the words of those who were there.<br />Following this is a section about the Allied advance through France and into Germany...and less than a year later, the Reich was in ruins and Hitler was dead.<br />I liked this book most of all for its simplicity and authenticity.	2002-10-25

I *discovered* this writer when I read \\"My Only Story\\" which I absolutely loved. I then followed up with \\"The Secret Language\\", an entirely different but equally rewarding read. So when I heard about \\"Ernie's Ark\\" there was no doubt that I would read it! And it was a joy.<br />I always enjoy reading books of connected stories and this was one of the best. Wood created a foundation with the first story and proceeded to build on it until she finished constructing a marvelously detailed structure. I loved how each story started anew but then incorporated some character or event from a previous story, creating one of those \\"a-ha\\" moments.<br />Abbott Falls, Maine could have been Anytown, USA and showed Wood's familiarity with this kind of environment and with the effect that a mill, a union, and striking workers can have on the town. The wonderfully developed characters are people we have met before in our lives. Perhaps we did not know all their secrets, but we have known them, I am sure.<br />This is a book of life, death, love, hate, fear, anger, joy, and most of all, about redemption. I cannot wait for her next!	2002-10-16

Maybe because it was short, or the way it was divided into topics, or the author's engaging style...whatever it was, the book was enjoyable and humorous.<br />Holm surprises even herself with how much she cares about all the frippery associated with modern weddings and writes about it with honesty, poking fun at herself in the process!<br />The author also had some thoughtful reflections on commitment, family, and marriage that really seemed to hit the mark.<br />Complicating the wedding planning was the fact that this was a second marriage for both the bride and groom, and the author has a 15-year-old daughter. But all turns out well, even with a few glitches.	2002-10-01

They presented the sometimes-stormy history of Mormonism, often in the midst of controversy, in a straighforward and non-judgmental way.<br />There has been some dispute as to whether Mormons are Christians. Critics say that the LDS doctrine of God does not conform to traditional Christian creed. Joseph Smith said he communicated directly with God; this is unlike reformers such as Calvin and Luther who used reason to interpret the Bible in new ways.<br />The authors presented a thorough background of Joseph Smith, from his fist vision at age 14 and his translation of the gold tablets into the Book of Molrmon. They then followed the Mormons as they headed West and founded settlements in Missouri, Ohio, and Illinois, among other places, on their way to Utah.<br />Plural marriage and its repercussions were thoroughly explained. By 1844, this and other pronouncements by Joseph Smith carried Mormonism beyond the bounds of conventional Christian belief. Smith was jailed after ordering the press of a dissenting newspaper in Nauvoo, Illinois destroyed and he was then killed by an angry mob while he was in jail.<br />By September 1846 14,000 &quot;Saints&quot; had fled west from Nauvoo and undertook a brutal trek toward the Rocky Mountains. Over the next 22 years, 300 wagon trains with over 10,000 wagons would travel to Utah.  In Utah, Brigham Young, Joseph Smith's successor, designed the Salt Lake Valley according to Smith's plan for New Jerusalem.<br />In 1896, Wilford Woodruff, the LDS President, declared an end to polygamy, the price paid for Utah to become a state. This practice had raised national opposition to Mormonism.<br />Mormonism became more mainstream, no longer practiced in isolation. The Church Welfare Plan, which continues today, seems to be a model to promote self-sufficiency and co-operation.<br />The last section of the book dealt with Mormonism today: the church structure (local and national), tithing, missions, and religious education.Mormonism today: the church structure (local and national), tithing, missions, and religious education.	2002-10-01

We see that often, not all is as it appears, that those who seem to have it made really don't. Binchey allows us to see  the daily struggles that occur in each person's life. The storylines criss-cross throughout the book and present a fairly complete picture of the years during which the stories occur and of the characters.<br />While not as sweet as some of Binchey's other books, I still felt that I got to know and care about the well-developed characters.	2002-10-01

The book about Scotland was a masterpiece of cohesion and interesting writing. Unfortunately, the only thing the two books have in common are the great illustrations.<br />The illustrations in this book about Irish history are the ONLY interesting thing, in my opinion, and the writing never lives up to that quality. It is just one dry fact after another--- so unappealing. Where is the humanity--the people, the cultures, the societies? History should be written in the same vital way in which it occurred.<br />What a shame--this could have been such a good book if the writing had had any life to it.	2002-09-30

This book has it all-- organized and effective writing, a genealogy of Scottish kings in the front of the book (instead of hidden at the back as it is in many books), a detailed reference map of Scotland, and wonderful and unusual illustrations, many of them what I call \\"primary\\". These illustrations show Scotland's historic figures, its bloody battles, and the politics and religion. We also see examples of Scotland's creative and intellectual efforts throughout the centuries.<br />Some of the topics covered are the advent of Christianity, the Norsemen and the Normans, the alliance with France, William Wallace (wasn't he played by Mel Gibson?), the Renaissance, Mary Queen of Scots, the Campbell Clan, Cromwell, the Restoration, William and Mary, the Industrial Revolution, the arts in Scotland, and many more topics of great interest.<br />The author has laid out the complex and sometimes convoluted history of Scotland in a most readable fashion. I cannot emphasize how much the 200+ illustrations add to this book and to one's understanding.	2002-09-30
1393169:US	53078987	R2QE9U5U764FWE	0195148533	945338549	Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Slave Narrative	This genre, the slave narrative, created by fugitive slaves, is one that I knew nothing about, but was one that fascinated audiences and often made celebrities out of their authors. Narratives written by escaped slaves were very popular in the mid 1800s as they recounted stories of abuse, cruelty, escape, and their lives as free people in the north.<br />None of these slave narratives was as curious and compelling as that of Henry \\"Box\\" Brown, who actually boxed himself up and shipped himself to freedom in 1849, from Virginia to an abolitionist in Philadelphia. Risking death and/or suffocation to be free showed the desperation of the slaves even in a state like Virginia, where cruelty was purported to be less than in other parts of the south. Brown's story showed this not to be true. His escape was motivated by the sale of his wife and children, sent to parts unknown and never seen again.<br />His book was originally written by a Charles Stearns, described as a radical, argumentative ideologue and was written in an overwrought style.<br />Brown fled to England in 1850 when the Fugitive Slave Act was passed. He was a controversial figure, criticized for revealing how he escaped (and profiting from this) rather than sharing it with other slaves who might have used the same method.<br />When Brown got to England, his book was re-written in a more honest and simple style, and the edition that I am reviewing is the American version of that book. The difference is that this book is said to be written in Brown's voice and the lack of turgid prose makes it 20+ pages shorter.<br />I have my doubts if this was Brown's voice...it seems to be the voice of a well-spoken, educated person with a large vocabulary, capable of complex sentence structure and high levels of organization. For example, he writes:  \\"I might perhaps have dragged my chains of quietude to the grave, and have found a tomb in a slavery-polluted land; but thanks be to God I heard the glorious sound and felt its inspiring influence on my heart, and having satisfied myself of the value of freedom, I resolved to purchase it whatever should be the price.\\"<br />Despite this, the book was an incredibly interesting account of Brown's early life, his life as an adult slave, his escape.ts inspiring influence on my heart, and having satisfied myself of the value of freedom, I resolved to purchase it whatever should be the price.\\"<br />Despite this, the book was an incredibly interesting account of Brown's early life, his life as an adult slave, his escape.	2002-09-30

I thought her Salon essays and \\"Traveling Mercies\\" were brilliant and found much of their material incorporated in this novel. The book is about the \\"mystery of family and the possibility of love\\" and contains Lamott's own particular brand of philosophizing. When I finished, I felt like I had been talking with a friend about all the family concerns facing women in today's world.<br />Lamott makes the reader see the world in a different way and feel more at peace with where we happen to be. She expands and expounds, with humor, tenderness, and love, on the smallest incidents and finds new meaning in them. She finds lessons everywhere and deals with life with bold honesty and down-to-earth spirituality. For example: \\"When God is going to do something wonderful, it starts with something hard, and when God is going to do something exquisite, She starts with an impossibility.\\"<br />\\"Blue Shoe\\" gives us several years in 37-year-old Mattie Ryder's disorderly life, a life that is typical of those about whom Lamott writes.  Once again, the setting is on the coast of Marin County, where the author herself lives. Mattie is newly divorced at the beginning, coping with all the traumas associated with still wanting her unfaithful ex-husband, moving back to her childhood home, and trying to keep body and soul together. During these years, Mattie finds new loves, deals with her mother's increasing confusion, and raises her young son and daughter with love and laughter. All the oddball characters, also typical of Lamott, somehow  gracefully fit into this story and help Mattie cope, along with a strong reliance on God.<br />The little blue shoe is the catalyst which leads Mattie and her brother to find out more than they really want to know about their family, whose past has been glossed over by their mother. The tangled skeins of their parents marriage are slowly revealed. Mattie carries the blue shoe as a kind of good- luck charm, which gives her comfort as some difficult truths come to light.<br />Mattie seems to float along rather than confronting her problems head on, yet somehow, for her, this approach works and keeps her from sinking into depression as she accepts life as it is rather than fighting it. Mattie says \\"It was not facing what life dealt that made you crazy, but rather trying to set life straight where it was unstraightenable.\\" This is a re-phrasing of the AA prayer with which the author is very familiar, I am sure. She has never hidden her addictions nor her continuing recovery. I think that this is a lesson that would allow many of us to be less stressed - trying to change what cannot be changed is a sure way to create stress in one's life!<br />Lamott's writing shines and her spiritual reflection is given full rein when she writes about Mattie's everyday worries: caring for an aging mother; attempting to get a young daughter to stop biting her nails; getting rid of the rats in the walls of her house; dealing with her son's temper.<br />This lovely book moves slowly through Mattie's post-divorce years and follows her gradual emotional recovery, impeded somewhat by her search for the truth about her family. During this time, many people inhabit her life, and Lamott shows us that family does not just consist of those with whom we have a blood relation, but also includes those whom we love and need on a daily basis.s of their parents marriage are slowly revealed.

Within days, women from all over the state arrived with provisions to make sandwiches, and with cakes, cookies, magazines, playing cards, coffee, fruit and cigarettes. The first night the volunteers provided these things to the soldiers was Christmas night, 1941--I can only imagine how surprised these soldiers must have been to be greeted, in the middle of nowhere, by women with fruit, coffee, and sandwiches!<br />In a time of restriction, shortages, and rationing, this incredible volunteer effort continued every single day, from dawn until midnight, for four years. Most days, they gave out twenty bushel baskets of sandwiches a day....sometimes egg salad, sometimes pheasant!<br />Word was passed as a train approached North Platte and the GIs were ready to debark as soon as the train pulled in, looking forward to the hospitality of the citizenry. Soldiers would often play on a piano that was in the train station and those inside sang along.<br />The story of the coffee cups was interesting (there were no paper cups in those days)--the soldiers took the cups with them to the next station where they were collected and returned to North Platte on the next train back.<br />Greene uses the words of many of those who were involved with the canteen and those who were on the trains -- and shows us the roots of American generosity and patriotism, small kindnesses that, when multiplied, become a nation's pride. This heartwarming book is sure to delight.<br />In the same vein, I just read of a new book about the people of Gander, Newfoundland, who opened their hearts and homes to 6,000 people whose planes were grounded there on September 11.

He also discovers the nurture of which he is capable--and what the tribulations of fatherhood can be. This baby gives Skip's life a structure and purpose that it never had before. Lydia discovers that perhaps doing what is expected is not always the \\"good\\" thing to do....and questions what the \\"right\\" thing to do really is. She has lived in the past for so long, thinking about her family's many secrets, but this baby brings her into the present with a welcome jolt.<br />Despite trying to keep Faith's presence a secret, Lydia finds out that Skip has taken on the role of \\"father\\" to this baby, and the three of them become an unlikely sort of family. Quindlen shows us how a family is not necessarily comprised of those related by blood, but can be a unit made up of people who need, support, and care for each other. Together, Skip and Lydia find unexpected joy in Faith and find resources within themselves of which they were unaware. These two characters, of such different backgrounds and ages, also allow the author to tell the same story in two very different ways.<br />Quindlen has written a richly descriptive and moving novel, one of redemption and personal growth, and about doing the right thing. Her observational skills, so evident in the columns she has written over the years, make us understand and care about these characters, their pasts, and how their lives affect others.<br />I loved the double meaning of the title,\\"Blessings\\"...for not only was it the name of a house, but blessings were what these characters bestowed on each other.<br />A wonderful reading experience that this reader will remember with great pleasure.was it the name of a house, but blessings were what these characters bestowed on each other.<br />A wonderful reading experience that this reader will remember with great pleasure.	2002-09-17

He plans to reinvent himself as a winner and exact revenge on all of those who trod on him when he was the loser named Alex.<br />This new person will not have to be nice, will always win, and will be able to get even. As Alexander pursues his goal, I wondered just how rotten he would become before his inate nice-guyness came into play and rescued him from himself.<br />I would say that I enjoyed about two-thirds of this book. The beginning was achingly amusing, the middle was entertaining, but in the last third, when Alexander became indiscriminate in his sexual encounters, sometimes sleeping with two women within hours of each other, I became dismayed and a bit shocked....and I am no prude! I suddenly realized, thankfully, how little one reads about this kind of behavior in contemporary fiction. And for good reason, with the threat of AIDS....something that never seemed to occur to Alexander. It's a shame the novel took this unfortunate turn, because until that point it had been so sharp and amusing.	2002-09-17

This was definitely a light beach read --- a romance shrouded in a bit of mystery.  I read it in just a few hours,  enjoyed it while reading it, and found it quite a page-turner. But at the end I wondered why it appealed to me and why I even read it.<br />Thinking about this, I realized that the book was appealing because Hilderbrand pushed a lot of *hot* buttons: interracial relationships, extramarital sex, murder, women's friendship, female bonding, etc. She targeted an audience and reached it - the hallmark of a good marketing plan.<br />Almost every single situation bordered on preposterous....from Antoinette's \\"disappearance\\", to the ridiculous way the police acted, to the affair between an 18 and a 40 year old, to Kayla's behavior -- but I sped through it, so what does that say about me?<br />Guess I just needed something light to read at that particular time and this story reeled me in!	2002-09-17

It is part of a series called The Way People Live, which focuses on \\"cultural pockets\\" which share the distinction of having \\"been viewed before but not completely understood\\". The author believes that removing stereotypes, both positive or negative, is the only way to really understand any culture.<br />The emphasis in this Lucent series is on the personal aspects of life in the culture that is being examined and \\"seeing humans as victims, heroes, and onlookers\\". To do this, the book uses a large number and wide variety of primary quotations and illustrations.<br />Everyday Southern life is examined in this book, along with the effects of the Civil War on daily life. Plantation life is described and the roles of the men, the women, and the slaves on them are explained.<br />The author then brings his focus to the vast majority of those in the South during the Civil War -- the poor and the middle class. The men and boys of these classes comprised most of the Confederate Army, not the wealthy.<br />A good resource for those wishing to delve into the culture of the Civil War South.	2002-09-14

It is obvious that it was a labor of love for its author. In less than 150 pages, Lenore Skomal manages to convey the spirit of Ida lewis and the times in which she lived. Despite the scarcity of primary sources such as  journals, personal letters, or any other correspondence, the book is well- documented by the author. She has painstakingly put together this book, complete with some wonderful vintage photos.<br />Ida Lewis was born in Newport, Rhode Island in 1842. Her father, Captain Hosea Lewis, was a coastal pilot who in 1853 became the first keeper of Lime Rock Lighthouse on a tiny island in Newport Harbor. After years of back-and-forth travel, a house was finally built on Lime Rock for Lewis and his family, but they had lived in the house for just a few months when a stroke disabled him.<br />Ida, 16, already having assumed a heavy burden of  household duties, now began to take care of the light--she filled the lamp with oil at sundown and again at midnight, trimmed the wick, polished the carbon off the reflectors, and put out the light at dawn.<br />Ida and her mother tended the Lime Rock Light from 1857 until 1872, when her father died. Her mother was appointed lighthouse keeper and remained in this position until she died in 1879, even though Ida continued to do the work.<br />In 1879, Ida was officially  appointed to the keeper's job with  a salary of $750 a year and she remained in this job until her death.<br />During her 39 years on Lime Rock, Ida saved 18 lives, although some reports say this number may have been 25. In 1858 Ida performed the first of her many rescues and saved the lives of four young men whose boat had capsized.<br />Ida's fame spread quickly after a daring 1869 rescue in a snowstorm, and articles appeared in the New York Tribune, Harper's Weekly, Leslie's magazine, and other major newspapers. On Independence Day in 1869, Ida was honored by the town, but this shy. retiring woman was distressed by all the attention.<br />She was briefly married to Captain William Wilson in 1870, but they separated after two years.<br />Although never awarded the Carnegie Medal, as was rumored, Andrew Carnegie did give her a pension in her later years.<br />On the night she died in 1911, the bells on all the ships anchored in Newport Harbor tolled in her memory and flags were flown at half-staff throughout Newport.<br /><br />In 1924 the Rhode Island legislature officially changed the name of Lime Rock to Ida Lewis Rock with the lighthouse named after her --the only such honor ever paid to a keeper. In 1995, a new class of Coast Guard buoy tenders was named for Ida Lewis.<br />The buildings at Lime Rock were sold in 1928 for $7,200 and became the Ida Lewis Yacht Club. The Yacht Club remains in operation today, with many additions surrounding the original buildings. A causeway now connects the rock to the mainland.<br />A well-done effort about an interesting but little-known part of our coastal history.s shy. retiring woman was distressed by all the attention.<br />She was briefly married to Captain William Wilson in 1870, but they separated after two years.<br />Although never awarded the Carnegie Medal, as was rumored, Andrew Carnegie did give her a pension in her later years.<br />On the night she died in 1911, the bells on all the ships anchored in Newport Harbor tolled in her memory and flags were flown at half-staff throughout Newport. <BR> <BR>In 1924 the Rhode Island legislature officially changed the name of Lime Rock to Ida Lewis Rock with the lighthouse named after her --the only such honor ever paid to a keeper.

She decides to write, in a journalistic form, about her experiences with the mothers of the boys and men whom she has loved. The journal is directed to her newly married son and provides the insight that one not only marries a man but the woman who raised him. I am not sure that I agree with this premise, but I accepted it since the entire book seems to be based on it.<br />Lulu has always tried to figure out how her various (and distinctly different) mothers-in-law have insinuated themselves so deeply into her life and had so much influence/impact on her. In her journal, she has time to explore these questions and to consider how to think about mothers-in-law..<br />I think Dawson has done a good job of character development. Each woman in this &quot;gallery&quot; is distinctive, real, and complex, which made it easy to picture them and how they &quot;operated&quot;. The author used the structure of multiple marriages to explore the female-to-female connection.<br />A funny and bittersweet look at love, marriage, and mothers-in-law.	2002-09-11

Thie book is an excellent resource for someone who wants an overview of the history of this kind of structure. I was surprised that it is a YA book--I think it is good for all ages...and if, in fact, it was intended for children, the black and white drawings and photos were not very exciting.<br />The author delves into the following topics in five chapters: how ancient forts and siege inspired medieval builders, the development of medieval castles, planning and building the outer defenses of the castles, a castle's inner living spaces, and castles under siege and in ruins.<br />The book begins with a two-page timeline containing the important dates in the building of medieval castles, covering a period of thousands of years.<br />I especially enjoyed the section about life in a castle and how the residents lived and worked there....very interesting.	2002-09-09

Eight year old Charlie is endearing, but very precocious, and very mouthy. It is easy to understand why his mother, Annie, would linger at a drive-through restaurant with her coffee rather than go home and relieve the sitter in the middle of her son's bedtime ritual. She admits that she does not have the patience to be with him all day long, which I found refreshing....she is not afraid to admit that she is not SuperMom! Yet the reader is quickly aware that she loves her son more than life itself.<br />I also found it wonderful that an author finally gave her female protagonist some real friends. So many contemporary female authors feel that their main character needs to be isolated and friendless in order to advance the plot. To me this is so phony and McNeil's depiction of Annie's support system of friends and relatives is much more realistic.<br />I laughed out loud, I cried, I smiled...and was sad to leave these characters behind when I reached the end.	2002-09-09

Written by Jamie Weisman, a physician-patient with a rare, hard-to-diagnose illness, the reader sees all facets of a medical mystery. What was really frightening to me was the length of time it took to diagnose Weisman's condition, despite the fact that her father, a doctor, was always there, questioning, observing, yet unable to help.<br />She endured years of frustration, pain, anguish, and physical deformity before being diagnosed with a congenital immune deficiency.It is controlled through monthly treatments with gamma globulin and by self-injections every few days with interferon. There is, however, no cure.<br />Her illness inspired Weisman to go to medical school, and she is now a physician at Emory in Atlanta. She writes eloquently about how she practices medicine while dealing with her illness. Her harrowing story makes for tough but compelling reading.<br />I could have done without the last sections, &quot;Begotten&quot; and &quot;Begetting&quot;, or at least a shorter account of her attempts to have a child.<br />Otherwise this book read like a medical thriller.	2002-09-09

I started with \\"Chocolate\\", which I loved, and read them in order as they were published. I have become more disappointed with each successive book, and \\"Coastliners\\" was the worst.<br />This time, Harris did not use food as a theme, but rather used the imagery of the unpredictable nature of the sea and its effect on a fragile coast. I thought that with this change, and my own love of the sea, perhaps this book would be better than her last two, but it wasn't. Instead, I found a novel cluttered with characters who are wooden, cliched, and undeveloped --and too numerous to keep track of, as well as a rambling, formulaic, and ridiculous story.<br />These characters include Mado, the beautiful returning exile; Cappuchine, a tart with a heart of gold; Brismand, rich and evil;  Flynn, the mysterious, enigmatic drifter; and GrosJean, Mado's reclusive father with a tragic past. By page 50, I had resorted to writing down the names of the characters and descriptions so I could keep all of them straight in my mind!<br />Mado Prasteau returns to her tiny Breton island home of LeDevin from Paris after the death of her mother. She has been gone for ten years and the two villages on this island are still feuding. La Houssiniere is prosperous due to its beach and businesses, including tourism. At the other end of the island, where Mado's father lives, the impoverished and dying village of Les Salantes has an eroding coast and a bunch of dilapidated fishermen's shacks. The populace apparently has given up and is totally apathetic.<br />This is the fourth time Harris has had an outsider appear in a backwater area ready to stir things up and/or improve conditions in the area. Personally, this plot device has gotten really old, as is her theme of \\"good versus evil\\".  The heavy writing is bad enough, but the predictable and cloying romantic storyline is worse.<br />Something that I found incredibly annoying was the author's constant insertion of French words. It made the flow, what there was of it, even more awkward than it already was.<br />I really wish I could find something positive to say, and wonder why I am even giving this 2 stars. I kept hoping to find something redeeming that I could say in this review....well, it does have lovely cover art.<br />I am sure Joanne Harris fans will read the book no matter what I or any other reviewer says - she has a huge fan base and I understand the film rights have already been sold.<br />The most relevant comment I have seen about this book was : \\"Coastliners\\" feels like \\"Chocolat\\" without the chocolate ...which is just about nothing.

The author writes about the theology, the scripture, the rules, the sacred ceremonies, and the lifestyles of Mormons today. It is obvious that the authors did a tremendous amount of research and tried to present an unbiased account.<br />I found myself seeing a church that changes with the prevailing winds and discourages its members from looking too hard at its origins, as needed to control (maybe that is too strong a word) its membership. I also saw a religion that promotes wonderful family and social values, one that takes care of its own.<br />I am not sure about the high moral ground that the authors claim for most Mormons. I think that Mormons are just like anyone else in business or personal dealings. In fact, I know this to be true.<br />This book also raised many questions in my mind about some of the Mormon practices, like eternal marriage and the secret wedding ceremony. I do not think there is another religion that has so many secretive things going on, hidden from the outside world. Yet the LDS church seems to want to preserve its cultish secrecy, as if that makes it more appealing.<br />I also wonder how the Mormon faithful, many of whom are intelligent and well-educated, accept all that they are asked to accept, seemingly without question....especially since so many of the founding beliefs and precepts have been changed as needed. I also was left wondering about the very odd beginnings of this religion. I guess this is what is meant by \\"faith\\", but to me,it seems like blind faith.<br />My doubts aside, I think that the author has done a marvelous job of allowing the reader to draw his/her own conclusions by presenting the information contained in the book in a fair way.he book in a fair way.	2002-09-06

In chronological order, we visit Athens, Rome, Istanbul, Jerusalem, Florence, Barcelona, Prague, Amsterdam, Mexico City, Paris, London, Washington D.C., Sydney, Moscow, Tokyo, San Francisco, Hong Kong and New York.<br />The author first gives a short  description and history of each  city, just before the overlay which depicts the past and shows architectural sites that no longer exist. The next page is the city as it is today. I found myself constantly flipping back and forth as I read the accompanying pages of text.<br />Each city's description is unique as the author gives us little tidbits about each in addition to the full background of development and changes.<br /> For example, unique to Prague are the sections about The Royal Way and the Prague Defenestrations (throwing people out of windows when they made the citizens angry). Unique to Sydney is the article about the city's first architect.  The history of the &quot;squares&quot; in London is explained and in the section about Paris, the significance of Versailles is explained (it had a huge influence on city design and planning all over the world).<br />A totally enjoyable and beautiful book.	2002-09-05

Sometimes this book moved from quirky to ...just plain silly and not really all that funny. If it had been a sit com, it would have needed a laugh track.<br />I think there needs to be some indication that, to truly &quot;get&quot; this book, the reader should read the author's previous ones.<br />The problem with a book like this, the eighth in a series, is that the author often forgets that the reader does not necessarily know the characters and that they need to be fleshed-out and developed for the new reader. Another thing I found is that the plot was very disorganized. There was just too much other stuff  thrown in.<br />I felt like I was lost in a time warp, a reality-fantasy continuum and had no idea of what was happening. I think it was a clever book...but I am not really sure.  One book critic said that &quot;Kraft is such a skilled writer that the reader never feels left behind&quot;---well, this reader did!<br />However,  I did enjoy all two aspects: the stories of Peter's mother's failed entrepreneurial schemes (and his attempts to save her) and his questioning of his paternity and the reasons why.	2002-09-01

I had great hopes for this thriller because anything about the art world intrigues me. But I had a tough time getting through this. There was just too much murder and mayhem and too many red herrings,. Then, when the murderer was finally caught, it was a character who had been so peripheral to the story and not well-enough developed by the author to even matter to the reader. I actually scolded myself at the end for wasting my time finishing this book.<br />I guess I have watched too much \\"Law and Order\\" and read too many real-life crime investigations because much of the investigation and the tactics did not ring true. The stilted dialogue did not help either, and I have a real \\"thing\\" about name-brand writing when it is not integral to the story. Even the way Kate deciphered some of the cryptic clues in the notes sent to her prior to the murders was a stretch of vast proportions.<br />The best parts were the author's inside view of the art world and the character of Kate McKinnon Rothstein-- but that was just not enough to sustain my interest.<br />Like another reviewer said, I see \\"MOVIE\\" written all over this!	2002-08-28

In my opinion, Cooperstein did terrific research on the life of Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, the wife of Van Gogh's brother, Theo, and on the life and times of Vincent Van Gogh at the turn of the century. The details in the book lent great authenticity to this novel.  The author reveals what happened to Van Gogh's works after his death, and the effect he had on those whom he left behind.<br />Many of Van Gogh's works and much of his correspondence were preserved or rescued by Johanna, who was determined to make sure that Vincent's lifework was appreciated and valued in an art world which considered it worthless. She was quite a woman and realized, early-on, the magnitude of what was at stake.<br />Although this book is fiction, I loved the portrait the author presented of this dynamic, independent woman. Without her determined efforts, the world  might have lost much of Van Gogh's work as well as his letters and journals. What a loss that would have been.	2002-08-24

But I thought the author drowned us in details and wrote in a very repetitous manner. I think an editor should have guided him better so that the book progressed in a more orderly fashion and did not go off onto so many tangents that gave us useless information.<br />I also think that the characters should have been better developed so that the reader cared about them. As it was, there was more about Victorian values than about the people who died.<br />It's a shame, because a lot of really really interesting information was buried in trivia. I ended up wishing that I had read an abridged version. I felt like this would have been a magazine-length article had the author not padded it with cultural information about the early 1900s.<br />I agree with the reviewer who said that the author should have given us more background information on what was happening along the seacoast and in the ocean during that period, rather than writing about what was happening in Philadelphia.<br />A disappointment because it could have been so good!	2002-08-24

It dragged on and on and I felt myself skimming just to get to the end of the book.<br />I really dislike it when an author starts off a book by having a main character say \\"I should have known\\" and also the device of dropping fake clues. This is different from a story that develops in a way that leaves the reader in the air - a finely honed skill, in my opinion. Fake clues, to me, are the mark of someone who just filled in the blanks trying to write a suspenseful story. While surprising, I also found the ending to be not very believable and did not like all the contrivances.<br />I do think that Fielding's character development methods were good.  Terry Painter, a lonely, friendless nurse of 40, and Alison Simms, whom we know right from the beginning is not who she says she is, were fleshed out and each creepy in her own way. It is no wonder we (and Terry) are suspicious of Alison (the tenant in Terry's backyard cottage) when she is found snooping in Terry's house, when Terry overhears her odd conversations, and when she is sometimes caught in seemingly sinister situations. But then I started to wonder why Terry, who has been independent for so long, did not do something about her suspicions.<br />The book kept me wondering, for sure, but I did not have enough interest to read every word. I just wanted to get to the end and find out whodunit!	2002-08-17

As an editor, I was amazed that this book was published in such a loose and disorganized form. The repetition alone made my fingers itch for a red pen. I found that there were huge gaps in the story, references that were unsupported, and so on.<br />While I found the writing style to be lyrical, and the book interesting in the way the author wove Irish legends into the story, the flow was stilted I just did not care at all about the characters. I did not feel that their \\"voices\\" allowed me to get to really know them, although the way of telling the story (three women, Cliona, Grace, and Grainne - mother, daughter, and granddaughter-- spoke in alternating chapters) was interesting. And the meaningless sex was just tawdry and unnecessary.<br />The things I liked best were the theme of forgiveness, of ourselves and of others---and the setting of the extra place at the table. I also loved the beautiful cover!<br />This is not a spoiler, as it is on the book jacket.....One particularly disconcerting thing was that although Grace dies very early in the book, she still speaks (in complete chapters!) throughout the book. This was incredibly awkward.<br />I do think that this young author may have a *voice*. I just hope that she can also manage to find a decent editor the next time around.<br />I find it very difficult to separate the mechanics of a book-- the writing-- from the story that is being told. I think that both the writing and the story must work together to give the reader a sense of satisfaction. Neither Carey's writing nor her story satisfied me.	2002-08-16

Wish I had read it sooner!<br />In \\"A Civil Action\\", the parents of several leukemia victims accused two major corporations of polluting wells in their Woburn, Mass. neighborhood with industrial chemical waste. Their lawyer then tries to prove that these companies are responsible for the cancer cluster that occurred.<br />This book reads like fiction and I often had to remind myself that it wasn't!<br />The author, Jonathan Harr, was given full access to the case and to the lives of lead attorney Jan Schlichtmann and his staff. This insider's look at the case allows the reader to witness the maneuvering involved in a suit of this magnitude. We also see how the legal details and infighting can occlude the quest for justice, and how a seemingly biased judge can make a fair trial almost impossible. The judge in this case set questions for the jurors to answer in order to determine liability - questions that were essentially impossible to answer, especially by a jury that was confused with all of the highly technical testimony.<br />One ruling by the judge stated that the Plaintiffs could not present any evidence about the physical effects of the contaminated water UNTIL they proved that the companies had contaminated the water. Thus, the victims' stories and medical case histories could not be presented to show what the polluted water had done to them.<br />I found that the tactics employed by the defense attorney to be a legal smoke screen that hid the true facts from the jury. The reader must question a judicial system that allows such rhetoric to prevail. Harr makes it clear how convoluted legalese can determine a jury's interpretation of evidence.<br />Jan Schlictmann was an unlikely hero: young, flamboyant, Porsche-driving, with a gambler's instinct - hoping to win millions from the two corporations he was suing. Instead, he ended up going bankrupt and almost losing his sanity and his career. His expenses alone, to prepare this case, were $2.6 million. He admitted that he was motivated as much by greed as by a quest for justice; that he got into a black hole and could not get out.<br />A lawsuit is probably the worst way to prove liability in such a case where scientific evidence is complex and where cause-and-effect is not clear. Jan Schlichtmann's latest environmental case is in Tom's River, New Jersey. It is interesting to note that he is taking an out-ot-court approach known as \\"alternate dispute resolution\\", rather than acting as an \\"attack dog\\"-his words.g.

It hooked me from the first page and I could not put it down. This was very fast and interesting reading, except for one totally unnecessary scene which those of you who have read it will undoubtedly remember.<br />&quot;Into the Forest&quot; is what has been called &quot;speculative fiction&quot; and is set in the near-future, focusing on two teenage orphaned sisters. The girls try to survive the collapse, for no apparent reason, of their world and society as they knew it. All of a sudden, tankers do not arrive at gas stations, electricity disappears, law and order become a thing of the past, and there is no communication.<br />Living in the forest in Northern California, Nell and Eva struggle to survive in an often -alien environment as they try to adjust to isolation. Once they deplete the pantry in their house, feeding themselves is a daily challenge, as is their need to conquer overwhelming feelings of despair.<br />The author gradually builds the story to the point where the reader realizes that every single action these young girls perform is related to their continued survival. I think that this book provided food for thought, making me cringe at how dependent we all are on today's technology. I appreciated Hegland's knowledge of the uses of forest plants and berries, and of food preservation.<br />Like Paul Watkins' &quot;Archangel&quot; and Stephen King's &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;, the forest is a major character in the story.<br />I fear that I would not be a survivor.	2002-08-16

The mother's and daughter's stories are told in the context of the lives of other people in the community. The two women come to terms with complex changes and events that jeopardize their relationship and threaten to alter it forever.<br />Strout did a great job of revealing the inner lives of the main characters and allowing the reader to feel empathy for them. Amy was plainly revealed early in the book but it took a while longer to get to *know* Isabelle. I felt that the character portrayal was very realistic and complete, with the exception of Mr. Robertson--I felt that he could have used more development to reveal his motivation.<br />I thought Strout did an especially good job with Avery---he was so unkind and unfeeling, so uncaring about the effect of forgetting he was supposed to go to Isabelle's. My heart just ached as she got the house ready and waited and waited.<br />Sometimes Isabelle's pain, about the way her life has evolved, was almost too much to bear. What a sad and empty life she led with no confidantes and her daughter as her only interest.<br />There were a few loose ends that could certainly have been eliminated, and probably would have made the book flow a little better. Overall, though, it was a good reading experience.	2002-08-16

La Cucina is a novel full of sensuous experiences, the pleasures of both love and food.<br />Prior has written a love story set in Sicily, a land of intense passions, in which she celebrates all of life's pleasures. The novel is full of eccentric characters who create situations bursting with emotion.<br />Rosa Fiore grows up in a rural Sicilian house where the kitchen (la cucina) is the center of life, its heart and soul. Rosa is the only daughter in a large family where cooking is a labor of love. She is an accomplished and legendary cook by the time she is a teenager.<br />Rosa leads a self-imposed, solitary life as a librarian in Palermo after fleeing her country home when her lover is murdered. Twenty-five years later, a mysterious  Englishman enters her life, captivates her, and together they have a summer of intense physical and culinary passion.<br />This is a rollicking story of love and life as feasts to be enjoyed to the fullest.	2002-08-13

No great literary value here-- in fact, the story had a lot of holes in it, so I was forced to use my imagination.<br />In Bangor, Maine, on the night of her high school graduation in 1986, Jennifer Pelletier, Kathryn Campbell's best (she thought) friend, just disappeared from the face of the earth. She walked away from a bonfire and was never seen again.<br />Ten years later, a few weeks before their class reunion, Kathryn, recently divorced, returns to her mother's home in Bangor. She is still haunted by Jennifer's disappearance with its lack of closure and begins to write an article for the local paper, resurrecting the case in the eyes of the town and those who knew the missing girl.<br />I DID learn one thing from this book: the meaning of \\"desire lines\\". This means the trail through woods or brush, often barely discernible, showing that someone else has walked there before. It is a term used in orienteering and hiking.	2002-07-31

An American B-17 plane crash-lands and the crew is spirited off to nearby safe houses by members of the Belgian Resistance. The story focuses on Claire, a local woman in an unhappy marriage, and Ted Brice, the pilot.<br />Shreve depicts the seemingly hopeless situation, tempered by hope, in the face of wartime hardships and the risks that the Resistance members took on a daily basis.<br />I found the ending a bit contrived and rushed, with some questionable aspects.<br />This is a story that encompasses only a little more than a month in the thousands of days of war, but it is a story of great emotional intensity. I cannot remember when I read a book this quickly.	2002-07-31

There is not much more to say that has not already been said in the 200+ reviews already posted here!<br />One is easily able to identify with many of the issues these women discuss. It is full of laughter and tears, joys and sorrows, questions and answers.	2002-07-31

The first time I did not really like  it, then I let myself be talked into finishing it. And I still did not much like it.<br />Actually, the first and third parts were okay. The middle, the part set in New York, was dreadful. It was way too long, too slow, and could have used a lot of editing. And for all the over-writing, the characters were not very well developed nor defined (except for Mike). I was so sick of Carrie by the time the section ended that I could have cared less what happened to her.<br />While I understood why Carrie  felt claustrophobic in Madison and why she had to leave the untenable situation there, I could not understand her fleeing to someone she barely knew. But even worse was the fact that she did not tell her mother or her best friend that she was going, nor did she call them for a long time afterwards. For all they knew, she could have been dead. This was very unrealistic, in  my opinion.<br />I could not stand the way Carrie just drifted while she was in New York, doing nothing-well, sometimes she whined! She even had to be \\"led\\" to the fashion design classes. Kilroy was a most unlikeable character and the silly sex scenes with he and Carrie  were so badly written that I cringed.<br />One newspaper review said that Carrie did not walk away, but moved forward. Well, I think she stayed stagnant. She was no more mature at the end of the book than she was at the beginning. And she had no personality whatsoever.<br />Not a terrible book, but not equal to all the hoopla either. A good premise/plot poorly executed. I really had to force myself to finish it.	2002-07-28

While it relies heavily on coincidence, it is still a page-turner and kept me guessing most of the way through.<br />Dr. Dooley McSweeney is faced with a terrible decision: should he try to find his adoptive son's real parents and risk having to give him back to them? This thought haunts him day and night and he is consumed by fear and anxiety, moving through his days on auto-pilot.<br />Keeping his wife, Claudia, in the dark, he begins doing research on his own. He then hires investigators and heads to Russia in an attempt to put his demons to rest. When he gets there he meets an undercover FBI team and a CNN investigator whose cameraman was murdered. The plot begins to thicken at this point.<br />The visits to Russian orphanages described by D'Amato are so painful and horrible that they defy belief, yet I suspect that this is the way many of them are.<br />In plots that involve a CNN investigation, several murders, kidnappings, a baby-selling cartel, and the FBI, the author puts together a fast-paced medical thriller.	2002-07-28

It is rare that an author \\"hooks\\" me with three novels in a row, but that is just what Fields has done with \\"The Middle Ages\\", \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry\\", and \\"Lily Beach\\".<br />Jane Larsen is \\"Everywoman\\": middle-aged and, in her opinion, dumpy. She is raising twin teenaged daughters alone, but with the help of her very cooperative ex-husband.  Jane has worked as an architect for a New York City firm for 18 years, where she designs mostly everything except what she wants to design: homes.<br />Suddenly her work life changes in a way she might have chosen had she had the energy and gumption to do so. Off on her own, Jane is hired to design a house, but her client seems to have romance in mind as well. She has little interest - her life just has not included thoughts of having a man in it.<br />Then Jane decides to contact her first love, Jack Cashin, the man who inspired her to become an architect, and whom she has not seen for 30 years. An e-mail correspondence ensues and Jane's life changes even more.<br />The book has no \\"pat\\" ending but leaves the reader hopeful....and wondering. Fields conveys a good, positive message about taking charge of one's life and making the most of opportunities that arise.<br />A delight to read.	2002-07-23

Five years ago, Linda Greenlaw gave up her 17-year career as a swordboat captain and returned home to her tiny island off the coast of Maine to fish for lobsters. Quite a change from her previous life on the high seas! She now &quot;captains&quot; a small boat with her only crew member being her father, a far cry from the excitement of swordfish fishing.<br />Greenlaw's unadorned, reportorial descriptions of the trials, tribulations, and sometimes- joys of the life she has chosen made for good reading. She gives us the technical and nautical details in ways that seem almost uncomplicated. I had no idea what lobster fishing involved and think she presented it in a great way. Her love of and respect for the ocean is apparent throughout the book.<br />I especially liked the vignettes of some of the islanders. Most entertaining. The book is really a lovely commentary on life, rather than a &quot;how to&quot; book on lobster fishing.	2002-07-17

What a treat to find a Tyler book that I had not read.<br />As usual, Tyler pulls us into the world of her characters and makes us part of their lives. How she does this, time after time, astounds me. The characters who populate her books are eccentric but nevertheless are endearing--and are always original.<br />Here we have Macon Leary (which could have been spelled leery) a travel writer who really hates to leave home. He writes books for people who are just like him, who really just want all the comforts of their familiar home no matter where they are. They have no interest in exploring or seeing the sights of a new place.<br />Macon is a man who is uncomfortable with his life, his surroundings, his work, his associates, and even his dog, Edward. Social interaction is not his forte, nor his family's, most of whom are as socially inept as he is. He dislikes any kind of change, is compulsive, and is stodgily set in his ways. The systems he devises to make life easier are hilarious, such as agitating his clothes underfoot while he takes a shower!<br />But his usually sedate life takes many twists and turns in the course of this novel, during the year or two after his son's brutal murder. He is forced to examine his marriage and his relationship with the eccentric Muriel, the likes of whom he has never encountered--she is impulsive, messy, pushy, and talks his ear off.<br />Muriel presents Macon with a very different way of living and he needs to decide if he can handle this. Tyler presents his struggle in the most charming way and makes these characters so real to the reader.<br />Another Tyler gem!	2002-07-17

Her humor helped to put across her ideas.<br />Bennett urges women to learn proper terminology and vocabulary for different parts of the house, especially when hiring home repairpersons, and to thoroughly inspect such jobs when done.<br />She explains how to outfit a toolbox and a tool shelf with the essentials needed for home repairs, and also gives the uses for each item. (I went out and bought a few things after reading this.)<br />Some basic electrical repairs are covered (fixing a doorbell, dimmer switch installation, and replacing a ceiling fixture). Dealing with plumbing emergencies is another section, along with minor repairs. She explains heating and cooling systems and preventative maintenance.<br />Bennett provides information and handy hints for both interior and exterior painting (prepping, caulking, buying the right paint and brushes) which I found very useful.<br />Her final section, a suggested seasonal maintenance program, was most helpful and is something I will use, for sure.	2002-07-10

This book contains hints and tips gleaned from his 25 years in this position. The column is a forum for finishing tips from both pros and amateurs.<br />I formerly lived in Newtown, Connecticut and remember the Taunton Press when it first started. I have delighted in watching their success and their fine products over the years, and this book is no exception.<br />The tips in this book cover many topics including how to choose a finish and which finishes are toxic. Tools of the trade are covered somewhat but I could have used much more information. Coloring wood was extensively explained and I learned a lot about the different types of stains and methods of using them. Many of the hints concerned how to repair damaged furniture and the mistakes made in refinishing.<br />I was glad to see how many of these wood finishers used WATCO oil, a favorite finishing method of mine, passed down from my mother.<br />I appreciated the several hints about how to keep paint out of the lip of the can and for preventing &quot;skin&quot; from forming on the surface of stored paint. I also plan to try a suggested method of getting a &quot;dent&quot; out of a piece of furniture (caused by careless movers) and to try using Vaseline to remove a white water ring.<br />I found it helpful to read the section on using gloss finish and why specks sometimes appear on the furniture surface. The contributor who wrote this tip explained how to thin the finish, clean the brushes and re-clean them when dry, and how to apply the finish.<br />A most helpful book.	2002-07-10

Her courage and persistence in seeking justice for herself was admirable because one can only imagine how difficult this was for her. She never gave up during her long journey from fear to hope.<br />Sebold spared no details in this honest portrayal, but she never resorted to whining  about it or self-pity. I admire her greatly for this attitude...she is a braver woman that I could ever be. She pushed on, basically alone, showing her inner strength as she battled her demons and the inability of her friends to deal with her rape. I thought that her passage through the legal system was especially well told and revealing.<br />I thought the part entitled \\"Aftermath\\" was a bit out of place --it was just sort of tacked on and I really did not need to read about the author's drug use and sex life after college. I would have liked to read about how she dealt with the aftermath of the rape as it affected her relationships with men, her parents, her friends, and her career decisions.	2002-07-10

Conservation methods for wood, leather, and metal are covered as well as how archaeologists put ancient broken items back together.<br />The authors explain how archaeologists put together their evidence and research to come to logical conclusions.<br />As usual with all Usborne books for this age group, the wonderfully simple drawings fully illustrate the concepts presented.	2002-07-10

She and the author showed that even in the worst of circumstances, there can be light and hope. Every word in this book is polished and perfect, and every character is fully developed. As a reader, these are things that I really appreciate.<br />Each character in this book deals differently with Susie's murder and each one's pain is different. Susie tells her story in a matter-of-fact voice as she watches each person handle his or her grief in their own way and in their own time, sometimes unraveling in the process. She comes to believe that if she watches hard enough, she might be able to change the lives of her loved ones. Her voice is full of such inner peacefulness that you know she has risen above her horrible death and the loss of her innocence. Her descriptions of \\"my heaven\\" are wonderful and her term \\"the Inbetween\\" makes one pause to think......<br />Is death really the end of life, or is there more? Sebold gives her readers a lot of food for thought concerning this question. Personally, I find that it is comforting to think that my deceased loved ones are *out there* watching what is now going on. I am not a religious or spiritual person, so this is difficult for me to imagine, but this book certainly made me wonder.	2002-07-10

The photography left a lot to be desired...in some photos, one could not even get a sense of the structure of the building. Also, being a Wright afficionado, I wanted more from the text.<br />What could be learned from this book, by someone not familiar with Wright, were the stages of his career (Early Homes, Prairie Houses, Houses of the 20s and 30s, and Usonian Houses).<br />The Early Houses were of many different styles, usually dictated by the owner, since Wright did not yet have enough of a reputation to insist on HIS style.<br />Prairie Houses (1901 and later) were characterized by art glass, roofs providing shade, bands of windows, open interiors, a ground-hugging form, prominent hearths, and custom (often built-in) furniture.<br />In Wright's homes of the 1920s and 30s, he found new ways of using old materials, often making concrete into textured blocks. His most famous residential design, Fallingwater, was built during this time.<br />His Usonian Houses were simpler homes, built more economically, with combined living and dining rooms separate from the bedroom zone. These houses were private on the street side with windows in the back and were usually one-story with a low roof.<br />No matter what the period of his design, Wright thought that decorations should be limited to one fine item and no bric-a- brac. He thought draperies were unsanitary and believed in &quot;going to nature&quot; for colors used on the inside and outside of his houses. His walls were either punctuated by windows or alcoves or some built-in feature, making it very difficult to hang art. I suppose that Wright felt that his house was all the art an owner needed!<br />Not a bad book, but just not very complete.	2002-07-02

The book itself is so gorgeous, focusing not just on the houses but also on the furnishings, which can be breathtaking! The photos were excellent and conveyed the feeling of really being there.<br />I read three books about this architect this weekend, and this one was the most complete of them all. It gave me a peek into so many of his uniquely designed buildings and the furnishings and decorative arts that he created for them.<br />Something I had never seen before: at the end of the book there is a catalog of items that can be purchased from different vendors. These are FLW reproductions, items inspired by FLW, and those &quot;in the style of FLW&quot;. These items range from furniture to rugs to lamps to fabrics and decorative items.<br />On my &quot;tour&quot; of over 40 houses (designed by both Wright and his followers), I saw that all of the designs were simple ones, with natural colors and finishes, the buildings seeming to spring out of the earth. I saw the open flowing floor plans that are sheltered by overhanging, gently sloping roofs. Many of the places I &quot;visited&quot; had built-in furniture and fixtures.<br />It was interesting to view all of the things that Wright designed for his homes....besides the items mentioned above, he also designed the windows (art glass), light fixtures, skylights, wall murals, and even the landscaping!<br />Wright changed American architecture forever, resulting in open floor plans, multi-purpose rooms, naturally-lit spaces--- and showed us a different way of living.	2002-07-02

Its only saving feature was that it contained a fair amount of interesting information about the judicial system as it applies to Family Court. I think \\"Judging Amy\\" does it better, though.<br />Thayer throws in all the necessities for what men love to call a \\"woman's book\\": a mysterious meeting between two people who are incredibly and instantly attracted to each other, the decision of these two people to remain anonymous, an illegitimate birth and an adopted child, a wife/mother with some serious mental problems that she is covering up....the list goes on.<br />Books like this depend far too much on coincidence and contrivance for my taste. I probably should not have bothered finishing it, but I wanted to see where Thayer  would go with the obvious Obsessive Compulsive Disorder which affected Anne Madison. The author ended up not really confronting this issue and this lack was very disappointing to me.<br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that there was too much foreshadowing. This literary device is so overused and I really dislike it.	2002-06-29

This was the most important development in Irish dance history. In the late 1700s dance masters traveled around Ireland teaching complex steps. The Gaelic League was formed in 1893 to promote Irish culture. The first ceili (dance event) was held in London in 1897.<br />The second part of the book was about Riverdance (the show)-- the original story is based on the life of a river: small and quiet at its source, then feeding and nourishing the lands it passes, and finally rushing out to sea at the estuary. The show was planned to have a soft choral opening and a big finale. It was designed as a seven-minute interval during a Eurovision song contest and got a standing ovation from a roaring audience. Thus, Riverdance &quot;the phenomenon&quot; was born in a Dublin theater in 1994.<br />From there on, it was expanded and developed into the stage show as we know it today, complete with a premier Spanish flamenco dancer,  a six-person troupe from the Moscow Folk Ballet, African American tap dancers, and a choir from Atlanta, Georgia. It also made stars of its first two principal dancers, Michael Flatly and the beautiful Jean Butler, both Americans. Flatly, in fact, was the first American to win the World Irish Dancing Championships.<br />A &quot;great swell&quot; of national pride resulted from Riverdance's exploration of the internal and outward journeys of the Irish people. Riverdance rescued Irish dancing, reinforcing its sensitivity with simple costumes while utilizing generations of skills and traditions.<br />A lovely and beautiful book.	2002-06-29

I think that 100 pages could easily have been cut from the final draft. I read it all, but I think this kind of detail would not appeal to most people wanting to read a book about shark attacks.<br />I learned a lot from the book, about the times and about sharks. I was astounded that a shark made its way 17 miles inland, up the Mattawan Creek, where it killed two people. It was also interesting to read about what the people and scientists of the times knew (or did not know) about sharks.	2002-06-29

This one, however, seemed a little convoluted and definitely too drawn out. Also, the book had just too much coincidence and too many contrived situations for my liking.<br />The story wasn't bad and I really did not figure it out until close to the end...mainly because the 'bad guy\\" was someone who had really not been a part of the book.<br />There were a lot of characters, about six suspects, as well as plots and sub-plots in \\"Critical Conditions\\". Some characters I would have liked to have known better - White needed to do better character development on some of them, I thought.<br />The mystery itself - who murdered the CEO of a managed care program? - was secondary to the human dramas being played out in two hospitals by two sisters. Money was the root of all the evil in this book: the money a managed care company refused to shell out for an experimental procedure. I think the author had a bone to pick with managed care and used this book as his vehicle. It would have been better if he had not beaten the idea to death, over and over and over.<br />Still, \\"Critical Conditions\\" was a good read and with a little judicious editing, could have been very good.	2002-06-29

I was and am used to Tyler writing about quirky characters in improbable situations but I thought that this was a bit too much.<br />Re-reading the book just a few weeks ago, I have to say that my opinion has not changed much and I see that many reviewers here agree with me.<br />I could understand Delia's desire to get away from the family that took advantage of her, but her method/implementation was just too off-the-wall for me, even for a Tyler character. I just cannot imagine a mother deserting her children like Delia did. Husband - yes, kids - no. I could not help comparing her to Nan in &quot;Pull of the Moon&quot; by Elizabeth Berg. Nan also left home with no warning, but her actions certainly were more judicious, reasonable, and understandable.<br />I also found the &quot;affair&quot; with the young man whom Delia met in the grocery store to be really out of place. It seemed as though it was pasted on after the book was written.<br />I did feel sympathy for Delia at the beginning. She went from being a daughter to being a wife at age 17 and never left her father's home--her husband just moved in. It seemed as though everyone walked all over her and she had no idea of how to stop this trend, so her solution was to just quit. She was defeated and had no idea of how to change her life.<br />The ending was disappointing. I had hoped for some kind of epiphany or revelation....maybe even some passion. But the story just sort of dribbled off into the distance with no discernably definitive resolution.<br />It really pains me to give only 3 stars to an Anne Tyler book because I think all her others have been 5 stars for me. She is one of my favorite authors.	2002-06-28

This book was so badly written and disorganized, the characters were so poorly developed....I do not know why I finished it.<br />What little was revealed about these mostly spoiled and unlikeable characters made me want to give most of them a swift kick. The situations were farfetched and unrealistic --almost laughable. The plot, if one can call it that, jumped all over the place and never returned to where it left off. Contrivances and coincidences abounded. It was so obvious how it would end.<br />This book sorely needed some strong editorial input to get it re-organized and clean it up.<br />I had looked forward to this book since I really liked one of this author's other books, &quot;Grace and Favor&quot;. It is a  shame Ms. Upcher did not take more care with &quot;Down by the Water&quot;.	2002-06-24

So it was natural for me to pick up this beautiful  and informative book which focuses on his watercolor career. In addition, the author gives us Homer's earlier background as an oil painter and illustrator. She is certainly well-qualified to write about Homer---she holds the position of Curator of American Paintings and Sculpture at the Yale University Art Gallery.<br />The color plates in this book are gorgeous and the text gives good information about Homer, his life, times, and techniques. It was a delight for my eyes!<br />In 1873, at the age of 37, Homer began serious work with watercolor while in Gloucester, Massachusetts. These paintings were characterized by broad brushstrokes and extensive use of light and color.<br />The Gloucester watercolors began Homer's lifelong pattern: he would focus for a certain amount of time on a singular theme inspired by a particular location.  Some of these themes included rural life, especially childhood, and seascapes/marine scenes. He lived for periods of time in Gloucester; Cullercoats, England; Prout's Neck, Maine; the Bahamas and Cuba;, the Adirondacks; Quebec; Bermuda; and Florida. His need for privacy led him to live in somewhat remote locations, and during these years he was constantly experimenting with new techniques. Prout's Neck was his home base for his last 30 years although he often spent time in other places during that period. It was in Cullercoats (1881-82) that he developed his mature watercolor technique and his love of sea themes which he painted for the rest of his life.<br />Homer's late works are very thought provoking, often showing heroic subjects or themes; they show nature's beauty and its power and humans' mortality.<br />Homer lived a very solitary life, never truly realizing how really famous he was. He died at the age of 75, his last five years spent even more withdrawn from society and battling many illnesses.rom society and battling many illnesses.	2002-06-23

Tyler's influence is subtle but apparent.<br />When they meet, the main characters, John Reed and Rita Rosario, are both recovering from sad situations: she is divorced and \\"lost\\" a baby when she and her ex were scammed by an adoption attorney; John is still reeling from the horror, five years earlier, of his brother's suicide after he killed his wife in a drug-induced rage. Both of them have floundered emotionally in the years prior to their meeting and attempt to help each other heal. Rita is compassionate, funny, loving, and clairvoyant (she reads Tarot cards) but needs a family to complete herself. John is sad, insecure, and in need of direction to help him figure out how to reconnect with his niece, his only relative.<br />How each of them relate their \\"only story\\" and help each other find their way is a story you will not want to end.<br />Wood is a wonderfully evocative and original writer - the language is so beautiful and memorable. This story of the selflessness of love and the obligations of family will touch your heart.	2002-06-19

However, upon finishing this book, I decided that I would rather watch him perform than read his comedy. Perhaps I would have liked this better as an audio book.	2002-06-18

The author does a good job of relating the history of aromatherapy too.<br />The book explains how the various essential oils work and how the average person can use them (baths, massages, skin care, and room fragrances). Walji also talks about various ailments/illnesses and the use of these oils for treating them naturally.<br />Aromatherapy is called an alternative therapy and uses natural plant scents to heal, relax, or energize the body. Oils are extracted from many parts of a plant: the leaves, flowers, roots, seeds, and from the rinds of fruit.<br />The author includes a complete appendix that explains which oils should be used for which condition, including depression, addiction, acne, athlete's foot, and warts.<br />This book is a good reference to use in addition to conventional health care. I am still not sure I am a believer but I do love my scented aromatherapy candles!	2002-06-18

I myself learned a lot from this book.<br />It also explains hieroglyphics and the construction of the famous pyramids. Detailed drawings of every new concept makes learning painless --these illustrations show the amount and quality of the research that is done by the Usborne writers.	2002-06-17

To say that I have overdosed on Martha is an understatement.<br />My voyeuristic look into her life and business dealings ending up making me feel very uncomfortable - I was overwhelmed with all the excess and with what is prioritized in her life. I like beautiful furnishings in my homes, tasteful  decorating and good cooking -- but to elevate these to the level of sacraments the way Martha has is pretty pitiful. She is, however, a brilliant businesswoman to have achieved such success.<br />I know more than I ever wanted to know about this domestic diva. And even if only 10 % of what both authors wrote is true, I am glad I am not Martha's neighbor/sister/friend. Of course, It appears that she has no real friends, just people who serve and tolerate her.<br />There is not a lot I can add to the wonderful review written by Nancy Kay Owens - she wrote so well about all of the things that bother me about the superficiality of Martha Stewart and her empire.<br />I am glad I read this book. I still like looking at Martha's magazines (in the library - I do not add to her wealth)because once in a great while there is something practical I can use. But I am no admirer. And I have tried several recipes that were total failures!<br />I think Jerry Oppenheimer did a fairly good job of researching and depicting the life of this woman who has become a cultural icon.	2002-06-17

It was a fun read, a low-key comedy of manners, with many permutations on the words \\"couple\\" and \\"domesticity\\". The various parenting scenes were right on the mark no matter who the parent was.<br />While dealing with serious subjects like gay parenting, the author never preached. He let his characters do the talking and they did it so well!<br />I especially loved the banter between Eve and her fiancee. Those two characters had some of the best scenes in the book.<br />A light but clever look at all kinds of people who make up today's families.	2002-06-11

Surely their leaders must know this and figure it is the price they must pay.<br />That said, I am astounded that any church ever allowed any man to have 19 wives. That is just inexplicable but the patriarchal Mormon religion did allow this horror to exist.  &quot;Red Water&quot; allows us to look inside a Mormon marriage with eight &quot;present wives&quot; and see what their lives were like. I am fairly sure that this is historically accurate. This community of females are the main core of the book and we come to know three of them very well. John Lee is seen only through their eyes and in most instances he is portrayed as a selfish and controlling man. This has nothing to do with the massacre, but with him as a human being.<br />(The massacre, in fact, occupies few pages of &quot;Red Water&quot; since it occurred prior to the beginning of the book.)<br />I thought that Freeman did terrific research and found it interesting the way she told the women's stories. Emma's story was very personal and done in the first person. Ann's story was shorter and told in the third person. Rachel's story was the shortest and was related via diary entries. Because her story was longer and more detailed, I felt that I got to know Emma the best.<br />The struggles and hardships endured by these early settlers of the West were incredibly difficult and often life-threatening. Lack of food, education,medical care, and the basics of life became the norm that was part of their daily travail. The harsh landscape, which is often their worst enemy, becomes almost another character.<br />While it is historically true that John Lee was the scapegoat for all who did the killing at the Mountain Meadow Massacre, I wonder what part Brigham Young had in this--did he really betray Lee? Was Lee so blinded by his faith that he remained silent after being arrested, rather than implicate other Mormons?<br />I plan to try to find some more answers. This book gave me a lot of food for thought.wonder what part Brigham Young had in this--did he really betray Lee?

This book corrected that impression as it featured lighthouses throughout the United States in places such as Michigan, Ohio, and the Hudson River area.<br />The authors/photographers showed endangered lighthouses, ruined ones, and some that have been restored. Time, tide, and erosion have wreaked terrible damage upon these buildings.<br />I found the concise history of each of the featured lighthouses to be very interesting and informative. The photos were wonderful, especially the ones of the moving of the Hatteras Light in North Carolina.<br />This book provides a good reminder of how important these structures were to the American way of life, and for this reason, why they should be preserved or rescued.	2002-06-09

But her last few have gotten progressively more contrived...examples : the word \\"Father\\" was first interpreted wrong, then there was the contrivance of the way the little boy pronounces a name wrong (and the names being so similar), and then the remarkable coincidence of the transplant and how it affected the DNA. GROAN !!!!!<br />Ridiculous scenes, inconsistencies, and mistakes in these books make me wonder if any editor was ever involved in them. Her writing and her plots have become so formulaic...she just plugs in new characters and voila! A new book, albeit one with little originality.<br />In \\"Perfect Match\\" she once agains brings characters into a courtroom. It is my humble opinion that non-lawyers should either not write about the law and courtrooms or should have a really good consultant who will re-write these scenes or else give worthwhile advice. It is also my opinion that authors should not grind out a new novel every year.<br />The character of Quentin Jones was so underdeveloped.....we hardly knew this character who played such a big role. And for someone who has children of her own, I find Picoult's depiction of children/mothering to be very off the mark.<br />I have been reading this author for many, many years and hope that someday she will realize that a well-developed and original novel is not one that can be churned out so quickly. It makes me sad that a writer with so much talent is turning into a Danielle Steele.	2002-06-08

Someone loaned me this one so I decided to give Scottoline a try. Well, I am not sure that I will read another one of her books unless she finds someone to do a better editing job. I have heard that many novels today are self-edited (by their authors) and it seems apparent that this may be the case with &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;.<br />I found this book way too long and drawn out, with a lot of forced plotting that had me wondering why I continued reading. Right at the beginning of the book, the main character jumped to a ridiculous, in my opinion, conclusion. Then again, if he had not done so, there would have been no book! But the situation was a total farce as far as I was concerned, a total improbability, as was much of the book.<br />The convoluted, contrived ending really was a stretch.

I eagerly look forward to Shreve's novels, but this one and her last have let me down.<br />While exhibiting some of Shreve's usual beautiful writing, especially the descriptions of the beach area, I felt that this book never jelled. It just felt disjointed, perhaps because of the constant changes in narrators - a device I really disliked because I think it kept the story from flowing smoothly.<br />I did not really care about many of the characters, most of whom were flat and undefined.....there were too many characters and not enough development of any of them. I found that I had absolutely no emotional investment in this book.<br />I think a story just about Honora and Sexton's lives, maybe with Vivian as another major character, could have been a book in itself and an interesting depiction of life during the Depression.<br />Writing this review truly saddens me because so many of Anita Shreve's books have given me such pleasure.	2002-06-01

I found &quot;Julie and Romeo&quot; so delightful and hoped she would follow it with another winner. I was not disappointed.<br />In &quot;Step Ball Change&quot;, Ray portrays a family that seems to be constantly in the throes of change. Caroline and John, long- married, seem to always be facing complicated situations that keep them from the comfortable and event-free life they had envisioned in their later years.<br />Their Raleigh home, despite its collapsing foundation and a contractor who seems to have taken up residence, is a haven for their children and others.<br />The book opens with the latest twin complications. Their daughter has become engaged to the most prominent/richest bachelor in town (although she maybe involved with someone else) and is planning a wedding for 1,000. In addition, Caroline's sister Taffy calls to announce that she is on her way to them, having run away from her philandering husband, the richest man in Atlanta.<br />Ray writes in a way that makes the reader feel that s/he KNOWS these people and is glad to have their acquaintance - and misses them when the book is closed. They are wonderful folks without being sappy and I enjoyed every minute I spent with them.	2002-05-09

Blunt writes knowledgeably about how ranch wives are expected to be submissive and about the incredibly grueling workload that they carry, day in and day out. Yet the author never whines about it or asks the reader to feel sorry for her....she just presents these as facts of life. I found myself anxiously awaiting the winters because, although bitter and harsh, they gave the women somewhat of a respite from their duties.<br />While Blunt writes beautifully descriptive prose, sometimes she lost this reader in too much detail. One part I am thinking of was the fire, another the big blizzard, plus some of the events that took place in the school. She just went on and on about these episodes for too long. The wordiness just kind of beat me down. Some of her most wonderful descriptions were of the calf she delivered and of her vegetable garden and root cellar.<br />I did feel a bit cheated. Blunt writes of her childhood and teen years for well over half of the book, then seems to hurry through the years as a ranch wife (she was 18, he was 30 when they married after being engaged for over two years). The book abruptly ends after about six years of marriage. In the forward, she has stated that she left after being married for 12 years. I felt that those missing six years at the end of her marriage should have been included in the book.<br />All in all, though, this was an amazing look inside a life that many readers know nothing about.	2002-05-09

Although divorced, Gunther also writes with great love about his ex-wife and her part in caring for their son.<br />This was a grueling reading experience as John Gunther takes the reader through his son's life from the time of diagnosis until his death a year and a half later. I cannot believe I had never read this book before. I am sure that many readers would not find this book to be comfortable reading, but it does deal honestly with sickness, death, and the emotions surrounding the ending of a young life.<br />I found the book to be both dated (in relation to how medicine is practiced) and eternal (in relation to the grief at the loss of a child).<br />For me, the most moving part was Johnny's graduation week at Deerfield with all of the activities and ceremonies that went on. The strength of character that it took for him to participate in all of these, just a month before his death, was extraordinary, as was the compassion shown by the school and his classmates.	2002-05-09

Susan Sloan has written another book that had me reading the last two pages over and over again to be sure that I had read it correctly. She is the master of surprise twists, that is for sure. &quot;Guilt by Association&quot; remains my favorite of hers, the ultimate suspenseful thriller.<br />From the very first page, I was pulled into this story and the intensity never let up. I hated to put the book down to attend to the necessary chores of daily living! And when I finished, I was sorry that I no longer had this book to look forward to.<br />No need here to go into another synopsis, because other reviewers have ably done so before me.<br />Sloan's characters are fully fleshed out, as is her plot. She never got preachy about the abortion issue but presented a balanced view. At times I found the politics/policies a little confusing as each &quot;side&quot; tries to present its case in the best light.<br />If you get this book, be sure to put aside a good chunk of time to read it, because you will not be able to put it down!	2002-05-04

It is amazing, for example, that Martha was initially hired to promote K-Mart---Byron shows how K-Mart ended up promoting Martha! She is one savvy businessperson, but like many others, she has done a lot of damage on her way to the top. In that way, she does not differ from men. But I wonder if she would be of so much interest were she not a woman?<br />Since Byron is an admirer, I think that I viewed what he wrote about Martha's character and personality as fairly valid. The source notes in the appendix at the end seemed very thorough. Not much was really a surprise to me, because in the past I had read so many items with reports of her strange and sometimes bizarre behavior. He also explains one of the ways Martha manages to do so much---her \\"maintainers freed her from the chore of actually being the person she claimed to be\\". According to Byron, \\"her personal behavior became the elephant in the room that no one wanted to discuss\\".<br />I think that the dichotomy Byron was trying to get across is the difference between the Martha persona we see in her publications and on television compared to the real Martha, who is rude, foul-mouthed, manipulative, and very uncaring. I had sensed phoniness when I watched her shows when she had younger people on--her nieces,etc. She just seemed so ill-at-ease with them.<br />Everyone has had bad neighbors in their life....but the neighbors of Martha's in Westport sure got the prize. She flouted the zoning laws as though they were made for everyone BUT her.<br />Some of the stories, well-documented, are just awful: during her divorce, she went to her husband's office several times, screaming and causing a ruckus; the airplane incident when she threw a fit when someone would not change seats and a flight attendant had to move her; the way she managed to get an offsetting charitable deduction for herself for an event that was billed as a benefit for a Paul Newman charity - and she refused to give an accounting; her public humiliation of her husband during the course of their marriage...it goes on and on.<br />I thought that Byron's historical references throughout the book were awkward and unnecessary (as when he talks about the protests in Poland led by Lech Walesa in the context of Martha preparing a catered event for 1500 people). I also think that the book could have been more sequential...there seemed to be a lot of back-and-forth repetition of facts.<br />All in all, though, this was an enjoyable page-turner of a book!uction for herself for an event that was billed as a benefit for a Paul Newman charity - and she refused to give an accounting; her public humiliation of her husband during the course of their marriage...it goes on and on.<br />I thought that Byron's historical references throughout the book were awkward and unnecessary (as when he talks about the protests in Poland led by Lech Walesa in the context of Martha preparing a catered event for 1500 people).

I just re-read this book and found it every bit as good as before. Shreve's talent is to write in such a way as to make the reader care so much about her characters and the outcome of the story.<br />Set in the 1970s when abuse was rarely discussed, and if it was, only in private in hushed voices. It was as though the women being abused had done something shameful. This is why Maureen/Mary flees her abusive husband, with her baby, and seeks refuge by hiding in a small Maine coastal town. Yet she still lives in fear --the fear of being discovered.<br />Shreve's description of the place remained with me for the years between my readings of this book. The bleakness of the landscape, the cold......all were so very real.<br />This powerful novel was written from the viewpoints of a newspaper reporter who wrote about Maureen/Mary, the people of the town, and Maureen/Mary's own letters. Through their voices, Shreve reveals the story and allows the reader to interpret it and decide what, if anything, is the &quot;real truth&quot;.	2002-04-09

I was so glad to find one of her books that I had not read. I also enjoyed reading this early Tyler book to be able to see her growth as a writer in the last 25 or more years.<br />The characters in &quot;Searching for Caleb&quot; are typical Tyler: quirky, odd, flawed, and appealingly annoying. Most of them are what someone would describe as a &quot;character&quot;, someone unusual.<br />Justine, Duncan, and Daniel Peck are so finely and realistically drawn by this talented author that one wonders where they have gone when the book is finished. Tyler makes them so real...I found myself wanting to kick Justine and Duncan in the seat and telling them to get their acts together and end their fly-by-night life for the sake of their daughter.<br />I think it is the mark of a great author when s/he gets a reader to feel this involved in a book, even if the feelings are ones of frustration, or even of anger, at the characters' actions.	2002-04-04

It is just not believable and colors my opinion of the rest of the book. There is no way that Elizabeth Kim could have recalled the early events of her life in such great detail...not just her mother's death, but all the tiny details of her life prior to that and even in the Korean orphanage.<br />That said, I did find the book very compelling, even if not very well-written. Kim's life as an adopted Asian child in a white community was very tough, and her adoptive parents' treatment of her was appalling. They did not adopt a child, they got a servant!<br />Just when I thought Elizabeth's life could not get any worse, she married that sadistic animal. I only hope that everyone in the town now knows who he is!<br />I thought the book really got bogged down toward the end - very repetitive and I thought it would never end. I was also very disappointed in her near-braggadocio about her affairs with married men, and the fact that she showed no remorse nor any concern for those whom she was hurting.	2002-04-04

I have had a hard time finding new fiction which interests me lately, so I went back to some old favorites.<br />This story takes place in the late 50s in a community on Long Island, a former potato field where all the houses look so much alike that sometimes women wander around for hours trying to find their houses. Into this cookie-cutter community of stay-at-home mothers with perfect homes arrives Nora Silk, divorced from her magician husband, with two small boys. The house she moves into is reputed to be haunted and is slowly disintegrating.<br />Nora is not welcomed by the other mothers, as they have never known anyone who is divorced and they are suspicious of her (and afraid of what their husbands will do). One look at Nora in her stretch pants and spike heels and you know what the husbands thought! Her son Billy is shunned at school--it does not help that he can read others' thoughts. All Nora wants is to be accepted, grow flowers, and have some friends.<br />But to her credit, she never succumbs to artifice in this quest. Instead of acceptance, Nora is labelled as a witch and Billy fails every subject except penmanship.  As for the rest of her life, she &quot;crossed her fingers and waited, she thought good thoughts and experimented with casseroles that contained olive loaf and hoped that would be enough.&quot;<br />There is some of Hoffman's magical realiam woven into the story, but so adroitly that the reader hardly realizes it and must go back and re-read the passage. Hoffman's character descriptions are subtle and spare, but draw a complete picture of this neighborhood.<br />Another great book by this author!	2002-03-06

Soon she is further scandalizing the town by becoming pregnant (was it a coincidence that Keady named this character &quot;Mary&quot;?) without the benefit of marriage.<br />Much of the rest of the book involves the efforts of the townsfolk to discover who is the father. There are several suspects and Keady made me fel like I knew each of them very well, but not well enough to figure out who the father was!<br />To the author's credit, although he raises many questions about the Catholic faith and its doctrines, he never makes fun of it. Nor does he make caricatures of its practitioners or its priests.<br />Glad I read this book....in addition to being Mary's story, it was a charming depiction of Irish village life 50 years ago.	2002-03-06

I have been looking at the everyday things and happenings a bit differently since reading that.<br />I loved &quot;Martin's Letter to Nan&quot;.

The book consists of Nan's letters to Martin and her journal entries. The letter referred to in the short story title lets us in on Martin's thinking during the time when Nan was gone. Berg says that she wrote the story because when she meets readers, she is always asked &quot;What was Martin's response?&quot;<br />Another story that I thought was wonderfully done was &quot;One Time at Christmas, in My Sister's Bathroom&quot; which was about a woman who must come to terms with a difficult father.

It was so exquisitely rendered -- powerful yet tender at the same time...a wonderful story of love.<br />The rest of the book follows Mary and O'Neil through the their separate and together lives and those of some family members. Each story/chapter both illuminates, and revolves around, a defining moment of their lives. Death, illness, birth are all explored and written of with such lovely prose, each word seemingly polished to perfection.<br />Without using a lot of description, Cronin somehow manages to thoroughly familiarize the reader with his characters and their lives.<br />A book to remember.	2002-02-23

The author never dwelled on anything, and never wrote in a preachy fashion as he examined many issues of parenthood that occur on a daily basis in our society. Through some beautifully written thoughts he managed to convey the agony, indecision, and confusion of all the characters.<br />The ending was not at all contrived, as it easily could have been. Instead, I came away from this book hoping that someone else I know will read it so we can talk about it. Definitely a lot of food for thought and discussion.	2002-02-01

These were not woven into the fabric of the novel in any way.<br />One poorly written passage sticks in my mind -- on page 221 Vreeland writes, about Artemisia's daughter Palmira: \\"Palmira watched the soup for me hanging in a pot over the fire.\\" Poor child, hanging over the fire in a pot! This kind of writing is inexcusable, in my opinion.<br />My suggestion would be that some serious editing be done before the next edition or the paperback are printed.	2002-02-01

While I enjoyed this sequel to &quot;Sister of My Heart&quot;, I found that it paled in comparison. It was not as vivid, not as energetic, not as descriptive, yet it sometimes was overdone. I really wish that the author had left this story in India and think that she was more comfortable with a novel that was set there.<br />This book continues the story of Sudha and Anju, cousins raised like sisters in Calcutta. Both have married but Anju and her husband Sunil have emigrated to the United States while Sudha struggles, in vain, to keep her marriage together in India.<br />While Divakaruni's beautiful prose is still front and center, and held my attention most of the time, I found that the story of Sudha's arrival and life in America was just too dragged out. Anju should have known better than to insist that Sudha (and her baby girl) come to live with she and her husband Sunil in their cramped apartment in California. After all, she knew of her husband's attraction to her cousin.<br />At times I felt like yelling at these young women to JUST DO IT. Neither of them were at all decisive and merely let things happen to them. And Sunil was not much better. He seemed more concerned with OJ Simpson than with what was happening under his own roof. There was little communication between the cousins, nor between Sunil and Anju.<br />It was interesting to read about how the young women viewed and tried to adapt to the new culture in which they were living. And I really enjoyed the section of the book when Sudha goes off on her own to nurse an elderly Indian man. This is a lovely and touching section, successfully weaving the immigrant Indian culture with that of the old country.	2002-01-21

Pym's (38 page) introduction alone was a wonderful overview of this most-intereting religion/way of life. I found that the explanation and description of the Meeting for Worship answered so many questions that I had about this aspect of Quakerism.<br />I liked reading the &quot;Advice and Queries&quot; and learning about Pym's journey towards becoming a Quaker. I would recommend this book to anyone who might want to incorporate some Quaker beliefs into his/her life.	2002-01-21

It all seemed to have started when Romans wore perfume-soaked garments and shoes while Egyptians placed perfumed unguents in their hair to produce a slowly diffused scent that surrounded them.<br />From Catherine de Medici in the 16th century to Coty to Coco Chanel, there has been a connection between fashion and fragrance. During this time, the perfume bottle has evolved from a simple container to sculpture, often giving identity to a scent.<br />I learned that to be called \\"perfume\\", there must be an oil concentration of 22% or more. Eau de parfum has a 15-22% oil concentration while eau de toilette has 8-15% concentration of oil. Cologne has less than 5%.<br />The average fragrance has 60-100 ingredients and complex ones can have 300. Estee Lauder's \\"Beautiful\\" has 700 ingredients, which is a record.....and its formula is 12 pages long!<br />The perfumer must have a vast knowledge of raw materials and also of chemistry. There are only about 400 perfumers in the world and their training can take 10-15 years.<br />One reason why perfume can be so expensive is the amount of an ingredient needed to yield what the perfumers use. For example, two tons of rose petals are needed to yield just one pound of rose oil! Petals must also be quickly picked as the amount of oil that they yield diminishes as the day goes on.<br />I found the explanation of \\"headspace technology\\" very interesting. There are machines that vacuum up the molecules of a scent and then run them through machines that separate the fragrance into chemical components and identify them. This is particularly valuable when collecting the scent of a rare plant or when it is desirable to leave the plant in its natural environment.<br />A very informative and beautiful book. The accompanying photos are lovely and give the reader an added level of understanding.	2002-01-21

I too wish that more home designers put some thought into the aesthetics of what they are creating.<br />The problem with this book, and with her previous one, is that the &quot;look&quot; and &quot;feel&quot; she espouses are so far beyond the realm of financial possibility for most people. I wish that her next book would be more realistic and address the issues of how to achieve such aesthetics without spending a fortune. That kind of book would be a BIG help to most home buyers.<br />I liked that this book traversed the United States and that many architects were represented in it.<br />I have been lucky enough to have built four custom-designed homes over the past 25 years. This kind of home is incredibly pricey to build. I incorporated some of Ms. Susanka's ideas from her first book in the last house which I built and they were great ideas - but very expensive to achieve.<br />One previous reviewer mention McMansions and their cookie-cutter designs....Perhaps this book will give some buyers- who have the wherewithall to build such houses -the confidence to spend some of their money on a better design.	2002-01-02

Although this is a darling book with charming illustrations, it is much more than that. It also contains the most wonderful and on-target thoughts about beach living.<br />For example: &quot;We want to elongate the days, distill the memories, make them last. At the same time we know that the beauty is in the evanesence....Every wave comes in, then retreats. Every day promises, then turns its back and slips away. Every joy has a little tease in it, a give and take, and leaves a wake of longing.&quot;<br />&quot;Simplicity is a process. It's a kind of surrender. It's a forgetting of the rules we never liked much anyway, of the values that have no real value, of the goals that never made much sense anyway.&quot;<br />The last page says it all: &quot;And that slow, crooked, seeminly aimless path of our lives at the beach may just be getting us closer and closer to our best selves.&quot;<br />I got this as a Christmas gift and have read it over and over. It is a lovely gift for anyone you know who loves the beach. I plan to buy several copies for just this purpose.	2002-01-02

I have been a fan of Cussler's books since first reading &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; in the 60s, but this one was painful to listen to.<br /><br />Some books are not meant to be on audio, and this was one of them. If I had to head about &quot;sapphire blue eyes&quot; or &quot;cornsilk hair&quot; one more time I thought I would scream...and the descriptions of women's clothing were ridiculous.<br />The episodes in this book seemed to exist in isolation and have little to do with each other beyond the most tenuous connection. The editing was poor and the story itself was contrived and formulaic. The ending was pitiful.<br />Cussler's books always have some kernel of reality in them, something that MIGHT happen if scientific research were to allow it. But the things in this book that were happening were just plain silly.....the oil filling (via some weird transference) an otherwise-empty briefcase once every few hours! AS IF !!!!<br /><br />I think it is time for Dirk Pitt to retire and try to keep some of his former dignity.	2002-01-02

I did, however, find it a little more technical than I really wanted, and have decided that I will just buy an orchid plant 2-3 times a year and enjoy it rather than worry about its cultivation, growing needs, and propagation.<br />The book's introduction told me that the orchid is the most highly evolved of all plant families, with 25,000 species in the wild and over 100,000 cultivated species. Orchids are found on trees, on rock faces, and in soil. They are monocotyledons --their flower parts are arranged in groups of three or multiples of three. Something I never knew was that the flower exists solely to attract and manipulate a pollinator, and then the flower dies.<br />In the section on orchid history, I learned that there were exotic orchids in England at the end of the 18th century, mostly in botanical gardens. When private owners acquired them, at first the flowers were put into &quot;stove houses&quot; (greenhouses) but these had too little air and too much heat. This was the time of &quot;plant hunters' who went on expeditions to find exotic flowers. By early Victorian times, orchids were status symbols for the wealthy, which led to over-collection. Today, the destruction of the rain forests threatens many orchid species.<br /><br />The prices of orchids plummeted in 1922 when Professor Knudsen at Cornell University germinated and grew orchids in a sterile medium.<br />In the section entitled &quot;Some Basics&quot;, I found out that orchids are not grown in soil but in an inert medium. They need some shade--filtered light like that under a tree canopy in the forest--and circulating air. The temperature differential must be significant or the orchids will not flower. They need a 50% + level of humidity to thrive and blasts of dry hot air are bad for them.<br />In the rest of the book, James talks about the growing environment, growing media, containers, feeding, watering, pests, diseases, potting, and propagation. Interesting material, but like I said, I think I will continue to buy mine one at a time and enjoy them for as long as they manage to live in my environment.ing media, containers, feeding, watering, pests, diseases, potting, and propagation.

The authors begin with a short history of collage and how to make or find materials to make your own. Later in the book, they even explain how to make your own paper for collage and making collage &quot;supports&quot; or backgrounds using mediums, papers, and natural or found materials.<br />In an early part of the book, the authors delve into the collage process and give the reader eight projects (of varying difficulty)to try on their own. The directions and illustrations are VERY complete.<br />The next section deals with collage design, both planning and creating, along with nine projects that are, once again, carefully explained.<br />The section on mixed-media collage was very good but more for a person who has both artistic AND design ability. NOT ME!!!<br />Even though many of these projects were beyond my limited capability, I still enjoyed reading about them and looking at the beautiful illustrations. I got lots of ideas from this lovely book.	2002-01-02

After years of fruitless hints to my family, I realized that I would have to get it myself, so I sought out a good, easily-understood reference book.<br />In addition to good information, the photos in this book are lovely and gave me some good ideas of what to look for.<br />The most helpful chapter to me was the first one, &quot;Bonsai for Beginners&quot;. The different bonsai styles are the straight trunk, the slanting trunk, the twin trunk, the triple trunk, the sinuous root, the raft, the twisted trunk,cascading, patterned, and rock-grown. I had no idea that there were so many styles!<br />As with most plants, sunlight, soil, and water are the most important elements for bonsai. The author suggests watering at night by sprinkling the foliage so as not to wash away the topsoil, which is minimal for these plants. Bonsai are grown in very small pots which hold little soil.<br />Diseases are briefly mentioned, as well as insecticides to use and how to check the tree for pests and diseases.<br />The merits of porcelain, china, and earthenware pots are discussed as well as shape, color, and size. I learned that one never plants a bonsai in the middle of a pot but the formula was confusing to me....so I am glad I will be buying one that is already potted!<br />The chapter on repotting was informative since bonsai outgrow their containers more quickly than other plants. The author tells of the signs to watch for that will indicate that a bonsai needs to be repotted. The process of repotting seems a bit tricky so I would probably elect to return my tree to the nursery where I bought it (to have it repotted).<br />The chapter on fertilizers - the types to use and how to apply them--was very helpful.<br />At the end, the author discusses decorating with bonsai and talks about the importance of the stand on which the tree is placed - its size and the height at which the tree should be placed in a room. I had not even thought that far ahead and am glad he mentioned it.that far ahead and am glad he mentioned it.	2001-12-23

The method that Talbot has devised is ingenious and makes so much sense.<br />I liked the way he organized the book...first he did an overview of the process and then went into great detail about each step in this process. For a beginner like me, his careful explanations of how to do this and of the tools involved was marvelous and much appreciated.<br />In addition to exlplaining his technique of adhering materials without using liquid adhesives, Talbot touches on the history of collage, some collage artists to look for, why to varnish, the kinds of papers to use as a substrate, how to prepare a surface for adhesion, and how to present the finished collage.<br />As another reviewer mentioned, the appendix is a great resource, especially the appendix that explains all of the materials and tools used. I also liked the appendix that gave web sites of interest to collage artists.	2001-12-23

However, this book is so much more...and it is lovely.<br />The book begins with an introduction by Leonard Marcus, the children's book reviewer for Parenting Magazine and a well-known book critic and historian.<br />Following this is an autobiography with many personal photos. I found the story of Carle's early years interesting: how he was born in the United States but then his parents returned to Germany when he was six. His father was drafted into the German army during World War II and Carle never saw him again for 8 years, when he emerged from a Russian POW camp weighing 80 pounds. Carle was a lackluster student, mainly because his creativity was stifled, but he did have some empathetic art teachers in Germany. In his early 20s he returned to the U.S. where he was promptly drafted into the army!<br />The next section of this book was by Ann Beneduce, the first editor to publish Carle's work. She first commissioned him to illustrate a cookbook. After that, she decided to publish his first book &quot;1,2,3 to the Zoo&quot; but could find no one in the United States who could satisfactorily produce it, so she had it done in Japan.<br />Next, Viktor Christen, a German editor, wrote about Carle's vision and what it means to children.<br />Takeshi Matsumoto, the director of an art museum for picture books in Japan, wrote an essay about Carle's use of color.<br />The text of a speech, entitled &quot;Where Do Ideas Come From?&quot;, given by Carle at the Library of Congress was the next section of this book. He gave this speech to librarians and educators in 1990 at the International Children's Book Day Celebration.<br />Next was a photo essay on his technique of paper coloring and collaging, which also explained why he colors white tissue paper rather than buying pre-colored papers (they fade with age).<br />Lastly was a section of illustrations from his books, in chronological order. I found it interesting to see how his art had changed and become much more detailed in 30 years.teresting to see how his art had changed and become much more detailed in 30 years.	2001-12-21

I learned a lot about herbs from this little book: how they are used in cooking, for diet, for rituals, and for healing. There was also a section on herbs around the world which was most informative.<br />Each section was written by a different, obviously well-qualified person  (biographies were at the end of the book).<br />Herbs of the Mediterranean were carried off by soldiers of the Roman Empire, who took them to Europe and then they were taken on to the New World.<br />Half of this book is an encyclopedia of herbs...illustrations, descriptions, growing tips, recipes, and preservation of herbs. I found this most informative and interesting.<br />I learned that some plants are both an herb and a spice, and that herbs and spices contain flavor, which is made up of both taste AND aroma. Salt, for example, is only a taste, so it is neither and herb nor a spice. Coriander is the herb CILANTRO while the plant's dried seeds are the spice CORIANDER.<br />I enjoyed the section on herb garden designs, even though I would never have one. Traditionally, this kind of garden uses a four-square or four-quarter design<br />I especially liked the section on container gardens since that is what I would be most likely to do. The authors recommended herbs that can be grown together in one large pot so as to be eye-appealing.<br />A good resource book.	2001-12-21

What a talented and clever author!<br />Colapinto has written a thriller with a heart, and even some humor. This fast-paced book takes Cal from one disaster to another in rapid succession.<br />The reader enters the tawdry life of Cal Cunningham and wonders how this loser will ever make it. He says he is an author but he never writes. And when a windfall lands in his lap, he takes full and dishonest advantage of it, never anticipating the downward spiral into which he has now entered. He manages to fully justify what he has done and never foresees the possible consequences of his deception. And just when you think things cannot possibly get worse....they do!<br />This book was impossible to put down...I read it into the wee hours of the morning. I really admire Colapinto's clever approach to this story and the &quot;slant&quot; that he used.	2001-12-06

White fully fleshes out his characters and the community in which they live.<br />While the book begins with a murder, and while its investigation runs throughout the book, one would never call this a mystery. It is a well-done character study and an exploration of the feelings and motivations of these characters.	2001-12-06

I have found that Martha Stewart books are to be viewed rather than used as a basis for trying to make anything because her instructions and recipes are often convoluted and/or incorrect.  I just do not understand why, with her vast resources, Martha does not hire better and more thorough editors and testers.<br />So now I just look at her books for the visual pleasure they bring me! That way I avoid any frustration associated with implementation. And this one gave me lots of beautiful things to look at: the fruit wreath, the silvery pine cones, the beautifully done petits fours, the handmade ornaments, the gorgeous cookies.<br />Even if the directions were perfectly clear, I know I still would not make many of these things...but a gal can dream, can't she?	2001-11-30

Yes, it is a coming-of-age story--but it is so much more. It is sad, hopeful, and ultimately very satisfying.<br />I thought I was so &quot;cutting-edge&quot; to be reading this, only to find over 100 reviewers have already written about it!<br />I adored Charlie, the narrator of the story--he is so good, kind, loving, and loyal. He relates his thoughts and feeling so beautifully in letters to an unknown person. I feel that he is a fairly typical teenager, full of doubts and worries, but compounded, in his case, by depression brought on by his (falsely) blaming himself for the death of a beloved aunt.<br />The book is so realistic and down-to-earth -- Chobsky manages to portray all of the insecurities of these early teen years without ever resorting to angst. We follow Charlie's first year of high school, with all its tribulations, lovingly rendered by this gifted author. We see the influence one caring teacher can have on a student. We hear about Charlie's depression in his own words and take an emotional journey through his life.<br />Chobsky beautifully handles many touchy subjects that teens must deal with: suicide, pregnancy, depression, drugs, drinking, and romance. I would recommend this book to mature teens and to the parents of any teen.	2001-11-30

I have already passed my copy of this book on to three people, all of whom enjoyed it every bit as much as I did. What a treat....a real Christmas gift from John Grisham. And if his name was not on the cover, I never would have guessed that he wrote this wonderful little gem.<br />Every year I buy a family Christmas book for us all to read...some years it is a pop-up book and other years it is something more serious. This year's book is &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; and I think it will produce a lot of food for thought and some good discussion.<br />Although this book was full of humor and irony, I still felt the palpable tension as Christmas got closer, the feeling of being overwhelmed that many of us feel as the holidays approach. Even though the Kranks had decided not to celebrate Christmas, they still were under a lot of peer pressure from their neighbors, which created a lot of tension in their lives and gave Grisham an opportunity to show his humorous side (for example when the Kranks were hiding inside their house to avoid the carolers, the rooftop scene, and especially when Luther was &quot;borrowing&quot; his neighbor's Christmas tree).<br />In the end, we see what the real meaning of Christmas is and why all of the trappings of the holidays are not what makes it worthwhile. Anyone who has ever been a parent will understand the decisions the Kranks made.<br />Well worth reading every year, I believe, to remind us of what is and is not important in life.	2001-11-27

The author tells many gossipy tales, but at the same time, gives the reader a great deal of historical background about the early settlers of the area; those who became wealthy via the real estate of the Hamptons; and the mega-wealthy newcomers who seem to delight in flaunting their wealth even as they try to remain anonymous...or perhaps the right word would be \\"mysterious\\".<br />I think Gaines, an insider who lives in the Hamptons, has done his research and perfectly relates the superficial life led by many of the residents there.<br />This book read like fiction and I finished it very quickly. Many of the  characters who populated the book were very odd people, ones that a reader would expect to meet in a novel.<br />I found the story of Gardiner's Island fascinating. It was first settled by Lion Gardiner in 1639, and was the first permanent English settlement in New York. Lion bought this from the Indians and it has been owned by his descendents ever since. They allow no trespassing.<br />I also enjoyed the story of The Creeks, one of the largest estates in the Hamptons. It was created in incredible splendor by Arthur and Adele Herter and recently rebuilt by Ron Perelman. In the intervening years, The Creeks belonged to the artist Alfonso Ossorio and his lover Ted Dragon, an interesting couple.

The plot took many twists and turns, from wondering who REALLY was the bad guy to wondering how the good guys were ever going to solve the mystery and get out alive. The ending was a bit predictable-which makes me think that I have read too many books like this.<br />Alex Bishop, a CIA agent operating on his own, wants to settle a personal score with Claude Malloche, an international terrorist/murderer who is a master of disguise but who also has an inoperable brain tumor. Dr.Jessie Copeland is in the final stages of perfecting the use of a miniscule robot that will change brain surgery forever and allow formerly inoperable tumors to be excised.<br />To ensure Jessie's co-operation and to force her to use the untested robot to remove his tumor, Malloche literally holds all of Boston hostage, threatening patients in the hospital and the entire city with the release of a deadly toxin into the air.<br />Of course, in light of what happened here on September 11th, the threats in this book, seemed mild in comparison. Nevertheless, physician-writer Palmer manages to imbue his stories with enough legitimate medical lore to make them fairly believable.	2001-11-22

It was a fable, a parable, a lovely story of what language means to us and what happens when it gradually disappears.<br />Written entirely in the form of letters, this book became more complex as letters disappeared from the Nollopians' vocabulary.<br />After the letters begin to fall off the statue dedicated to Nevin Nollop, who thought up the pangram \\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\\", the island of Nollop, located off the coast of South Carolina, is never to be the same. As each letter falls, the Council, sure that it is a sign from the beyond, decrees that that letter may no longer be used in speech or writing. The first major catastrophe as a result of this ruling is that the libraries must close since all books contain all 26 letters, including the forbidden one.<br />Initially, the inhabitants are not unduly alarmed, even though they pride themselves on their love and use of language. Indeed, the high-level vocabulary in this book sent me to the dictionary many times. However, the citizens soon become suspicious of each other and begin turning each other in to be punished for using a banned letter.<br />The cleverness of this author is most apparent when he improvises words for those that contain a forbidden letter..... as when he re-names the days of the week when the letter D falls. The word God can no longer be used so instead, God becomes \\"our omnipresence\\". Yesterday becomes \\"yesters\\". Later, the man behind the fish counter is referred to as a \\"piscimonger\\", a knight is a \\"horseman-gallant\\", and a university is a \\"university\\".<br />Here is an incredibly clever paragraph, written after many letters have fallen and thus been forbidden for use: \\"This is to inphorm ewe opf statoot 28-63 past this mornig with implormet phrom high elter R.Lyttle. Hensephorth, sitisens may, in graphy only, espress themselphs threw yoose oph proxy letters, yet only as hear-twins.\\"<br />This was an amusing and appealing book, fun to read and to think about afterward.<br />By the way, Ella Minnow Pea (LMNOP) is the name of one of the main characters....and LMNOP are also the last five letters left when Ella saves the day!un to read and to think about afterward. <br />By the way, Ella Minnow Pea (LMNOP) is the name of one of the main characters....and LMNOP are also the last five letters left when Ella saves the day!	2001-11-22

Her husband died, quite young and very quickly, of cancer. She then adopted another child, the story of which was very moving. She then re-married and adopted yet again. In addition to writing a weekly column, she has also written several best-selling novels.<br />I think her columns are very well done and usually strike a note that is familiar to my life or the life of someone I know. I actually like them more than her fiction. The columns are alternately nostalgic, funny, wry, sad, bittersweet. She is a very clever observer of family life and the things in our world which affect families.<br />Here are the titles of some of her columns/articles in this book:<br />*Loneliness of the Long-Distance Talker<br />*Dare to say &quot;Underwear&quot; - about ordering from Victoria's Secret catalog when a male order-taker answers the phone<br />*My Son the Warrior<br />*When You're Out with the In Crowd<br />*The Mother of My Child<br />*Tragedy in a Bottle<br />*My Best Buds, the Brontes<br />*The Citadel:Disgrace Under Pressure<br />*Home Cooking in the Drive-thru Lane<br />*Tupperware is Life<br />*The Great Green Garage Sale<br />I think almost anyone would enjoy reading these columns and highly recommend it.	2001-11-16

I found her approach to be balanced in her attempt to show the varying ways women are treated in different Islamic countries. She NEVER presents herself as an Islamic scholar but merely as an observer of the various countries which she covered during her years in the Middle East.<br />One thing that really shocked me was how the Koran seems to be interpreted by different groups for different reasons. It seems that anyone can rationalize behaviors by finding an interpretation of the Koran to support such actions. And each one believes that he is correct!<br />To have a religion based on these varying interpretations is one thing, but to have entire cultures and political movements based on them is very frightening. Cultural practices seem to be intricately tied up with religious interpretation and vice versa.<br />I find ANY religious extremism to be anathema, whether it is Islam or some other religion. When one refuses to believe that there are alternate ways to live a good life or to attain eternal happiness, this is very dangerous and leads to violence and wars, as can be seen in the history of civilization. I also am of the opinion that wherever (in the West or the Middle East or anywhere) any kind of religious fundamentalism exists, women suffer.<br />I also realize that this is a Western look at women in Islamic countries and that there are many women living happy and contented lives in Muslim societies. The author never says otherwise despite what is written in some reviews.<br />I could not understand those who said that Brooks was totally wrong in her reporting and that Muslim women are protected and treasured (and educated) -- when fully documented atrocities toward women are committed in Muslim countries and when women in Afghanistan are not permitted to go to school past the age of 12.<br />While I do not think this book should be the only source that one should use to try to understand the Islamic countries and their cultures, it certainly provides a thorough background and basic explanations based on Brook's experience while living in these countries. I read this just after seeing the incredible documentary, &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot; and thus concluded that Brook's reporting was  accurate. It certainly opened my eyes and made me want to learn more.that one should use to try to understand the Islamic countries and their cultures, it certainly provides a thorough background and basic explanations based on Brook's experience while living in these countries.

This was the fourth book in the Lynley-Havers series that I have read (I have read them in order) and am sure it is my  last. I am just not a fan of this kind of writing but I think I gave it a fair chance - trying to understand why so many readers seem to adore this author.<br />I find George's books to be so incredibly overwritten and overwrought that my fingers itch for a red pen when reading them! It is as though she is being paid by the word - and why say something in 10 words if she can say it in 20? This book could easily have been half the length it ended up being.<br />&quot;A Suitable Vengeance&quot; gives the early background of the characters who populate the later (in time) books. Even after reading this, I still find it hard to believe that men like Simon St. James and Thomas Lynley were so involved with a teen-ager (Deborah) when they were in their late 20s (even before this book took place)!  This just seems preposterous to me and George never addresses this issue. In four books I have never really found Deborah to be all that interesting - yet she has had these two very intelligent and attractive men fall head-over-heels for her!<br />In this book, the main action in Cornwall starts with the murder of a man whom the readers have not yet met and who somehow never seemed very important to me. It seems to be thrown into the book - a clumsy plot device that never really gets the reader involved. I will admit that the &quot;bad guy&quot; was a surprise to me, but not enough to warrant all the pages that it took to find out about him.<br />I hate to say nothing good about a book, especially one that I finished, as it must have had some redeeming qualities. I would say that the best parts of this book, for me, were the descriptions of the Cornwall coast. George's grim depiction of drug users was probably fairly accurate as well.	2001-11-10

I never really felt engaged by any of the characters as they were not very well fleshed out. I found parts of the story to be implausible, such as the fire and its aftermath. The scene on the boat seemed very forced, a clumsy plot device to tie into later actions by Tullis and others.<br />The most intreesting parts of the book were the descriptions of the locale for this book...the Eastern shore of Maryland. I liked reading about the flora and fauna of this region, as well as the Tullis family's landowning history.	2001-11-10

This telling of their story is sweet, gentle, loving, spiritual, and insightful.<br />From the first page, the reader is swept into this wonderful memoir. Martha is quite a woman....she never whines, no matter what she goes through. And she goes through a lot. Her pregnancy and morning sickness alone were enough to test any woman to the limit. She also had to fight the so-called intellegensia's attitude toward motherhood, especially being the mother of a special-needs child.<br />Through all her trials and tribulations, Beck's positive attitude, beliefs, and humor allow her to handle more than most people will ever have to deal with. Thank you, Martha, for writing this book.	2001-11-09

The art, as usual, is exquisitely detailed and lovingly rendered. Every time I look at a drawing or collage again, I see something new, something I had missed before.<br />I did not realize how much I had missed this kind of book from Bantock - has it really been 8 years? -- until I had &quot;The Gryphon&quot; in my hands. I read it quickly, then again, more slowly, after which I went back and re-read the Griffin and Sabine trilogy.  I am as confused as ever, but that is all right with me!<br />I had just finished reading &quot;The Artful Dodger&quot; and that really added to my enjoyment of this newest book. I truly admire  the way Bantock combines art and text in his books - it is a gift.<br />In &quot;The Gryphon&quot;, Griffin Moss and Sabine Strohem draw two more people, Matthew and Isabella, into their lives and the story unfolds as the reader becomes privy to their correspondence. It is almost voyeuristic, the way we are able to enter their private world through these letters and postcards. Just the act of pulling a letter out of its envelope makes the reader more involved and vested in the story and its outcome.<br />I think I have most of the books this author has ever had published, even some of his pop-up books, and I never tire of  re-reading them or giving them as gifts. The next two books in this trilogy cannot be written soon enough for me!	2001-11-05

I seem to have read several books of this type in the past year, with the theme of women's friendships and their bonds with each other.<br />&quot;Grand Avenue&quot; was not the best of this sub-genre, nor was it the worst. If available, I would give it 3.5 stars.<br />While the story was compelling and kept me reading all day, there were some flaws too. First of all, I really do not like the foreshadowing device used by Fielding (and many others). In this book, the reader is told in the introduction that by the end, two of the four &quot;grand dames&quot; will be dead (one in a particularly terrible way) and one will betray another. Another flaw, to me, was that the end of the book seemed awkward, as if the author did not quite know how to bring it to a conclusion.<br />On the other hand, the characters were interesting and very different from each other, and their lives kept me interested in knowing about them. I think Fielding did a decent job of character development of the women and of their daughters, although Tracey's motivation for what she did was vague at best.<br />A good book for a few hours of reading pleasure.	2001-11-03

That is why I bought this book - to get some hints and tips for making life easier. Even if one has household help, there is so much to be done on a daily basis and this book was a great help. It is not a book that is meant to be read and adhered to from cover to cover, but rather to be kept as a reference book. One has the option of using as much or as little of the information as s/he wants. It was not meant to be a bible.<br />I have used the sections on safe food storage; cleaning hardwood floors, tile, jewelry; fabric information and cleaning tips; odor removal; the care of metals; countertop care; and the household cleaners section. I found this last section to be incredibly informative.<br />I liked the way this book is organized--it is very easy to use and the index is exceptionally well-done.<br />I have given &quot;Home Comforts&quot; to several new brides and they seem to have appreciated it. I would heartily recommend this as a wedding shower gift.	2001-10-25

I was looking for a very elementary, how-to collage book for myself and this is a good one.<br />Because Carle wrote and stocked this book for children, it is very basic, but that was what I needed to get me over my fear of trying a collage of my own. His explanation of the format and process was very simple but very thorough. There are enough colors and designs of tissue papers to get anyone off to a good start in creating several different collages.<br />I think this would be a great gift for children and even for an adult who yearns to find the artist within!	2001-10-25

I was right!<br />Brommer covers almost every facet of collage art, beginning with its history/background, progressing to the various collage techniques, and also elaborating on the materials used to create collages. These materials include painted papers, Japanese papers, found objects, photographs, etc.<br />Rather than a how-to book, this is a book that presents many finished pieces in all their beauty, and explains how they were done by these very accomplished artists. It is a terrific resource and a lovely addition to any art library.	2001-10-25

In my effort to give Elizabeth George a fair chance, I read this book, the third in the series of the Lynley/Havers books. Reading the book's description, it sounded like an interesting story.<br />I knew right away, though, that coincidence was going to play a large part when Deborah, St. James' wife, was the one who discovered Matthew's body in the churchyard while she was traveling around the countryside taking photos. The story would have worked just as well, and not seemed so contrived, had the body been found by someone who was not associated with Lynley or the other main characters.<br />As the book progressed, I found myself wanting to slap some sense in Deborah. Her &quot;poor me&quot; attitude and attempts to hide her problem from her husband by withdrawing seemed so immature.<br />Then I started doing some math and figured out that she was about 12 years younger than her husband. I also deduced that when she had her affair with Lynley, she had been 18 and he was 29! I find that hard to envision in the kind of world that George has set these characters into.<br />I thought the goings on, especially the hazing, in the school were a bit overdone. Maybe this does go on, and, if so, it certainly does not bode well for the reputation of British boarding schools.<br />I am going to read the next book just to satisfy my curiosity about the early years of these characters.	2001-10-25

Unfortunately, there were so many secondary characters that it was hard to keep them straight. It was obvious that these characters were there to act as &quot;red herrings&quot;.<br />I also thought that the coincidence of Lady Helen being on the scene of a murder, and intimately involved, was a bit of a stretch, but was able to accept it with just a grain of salt.<br />George did a fairly good job of giving us more insight into the main characters (Lynley, Havers, Helen, and Deborah) and fleshed out their backgrounds quite well.<br />I thought that the last third of the book was far too dragged out...I found myself skimming a lot.	2001-10-25

I honestly cannot see what all the fuss is about. This book's mystery was fairly transparent and I had figured out the basics of the case by about page 150. I am not a fan of mysteries but for some reason like them when I am listening to audiobooks in my car!<br />I think that George's books border on romance (I have now read 3 others so as to give her a fair chance!) and also that she could benefit from an editor who is of the &quot;less is more&quot; school of writing. This book was just much too wordy. The length could easily have been halved.<br />I thought that some of the characters were contived, almost caricatures, and poorly fleshed out.<br />One good thing about this audio..the performer was superb.	2001-10-25

I liked the way collage artists showed, step by step, how they created their collages. The photgraphy of the pieces was excellent, making it a very visually appealing book.<br />My only disappointment was that the book did not cover what materials to use, what glue to paste with, what different kinds of papers are available, and preservation of the finished work.

The section on sororities and their importance in the scheme of life in the south was an interesting one too.<br />I chuckled at the first chapter's title &quot;Who Are Your People?&quot; because although I have lived my life barely straddling the Mason-Dixon line, this is still an often-asked question!<br />While some may put down these kinds of traditions, I found many of them to be touching.

This book was just plain ordinary. Forgettable. My mind cannot even hold onto the title and I keep calling it &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;!<br />This was a most unsatisfying read: it was not particularly well-written, there were no great insights, the characters were not well- developed, and there was a good amount of contrivance, a device that really annoys me. It is a very commercial book, in my opinion. To wit: Diamant combined Judaism, Catholocism, miracles, cancer, love affairs, drug running, and the death of a child. Some of these topics were just thrown in, as if they were afterthoughts rather than woven into the body of the story.<br />The best parts were the descriptions of the beach area and how the beach comforts one's soul. This rang very true to me.<br />My recommendation: buy JoAnn Mapson's &quot;Bad Girl Creek&quot; if you want to read a very good depiction of women's friendships, how women help each other through the bad times, and how they celebrate the good times.	2001-10-11

I respect him because he has not flooded the market with his books like so many other best-selling authors.<br />This is the story of the Meecham family: Bull, the father, a Marine jet-fighter pilot who refers to himself as &quot;the great Santini&quot;-- as in &quot;The great Santini has spoken&quot;--he is the *law* in the family; Lillian, the mother, a Southern belle who tries to soften her husband's pronouncements and shield her four children from his sometimes-violent wrath; Ben, their son, who is a senior in high school and has a love/hate relationship with Bull; Mary Anne, one year younger than Ben, smart-mouthed and unattractive; and the youngest children, Matt and Karen.<br />I thought the characters were well-drawn and fully fleshed-out. By the end of this book, I felt that I really *knew* them well. The exploration of the father/son, father/children relationship was masterfully done.<br />The locale was not as important to this novel as it was in his other books, especially &quot;Beach Music&quot; and &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;. In this respect, the book could have taken place any where...whereas in the aforementioned books, the locales were almost characters in themselves.<br />All in all, an outstanding book, one that made me sad and happy, made me laugh and cry.	2001-10-05

Their love for the way of life overshadows everything else. It was so interesting to read about how they conquered the myriad obstacles along the way (lack of water, cooking for a full house with no electricity one night, growing flowers and shrubs in an area with little rain, finding a house at a reasonable price on a resort island).<br />I also liked learning some of the history and government of this island and how it arrived at its present status.<br />A lovely trip!	2001-09-24

Her medical knowledge is apparent but she has also mastered the art of writing a thriller.<br />Other reviewers have already told enough of the story so that I need not repeat it here. Suffice to say that I am a fairly demanding reader of thrillers and look with a critical eye at some of the ones that have just too much coincidence/manipulation (used by some authors to facilitate the story whether it makes sense or bears any relationship to reality). The twists and turns that this story takes really could happen!<br />You do not find any manipulation in this book. It is written in such a realistic manner that you are immediately drawn into the lives of the characters and the horror that has been unleashed in Boston. And there are so many possibilities to consider as to who is committing these gruesome murders.<br />Gerritson's portrayal of Dr. Catherine Cordell's almost- paralyzing fear was outstanding and is sure to cause readers to wonder about their own safety in today's world.<br />My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that I could not put this book down-- so my reading enjoyment was confined to only one night!	2001-09-24

The action goes back and forth in time and place, tracing Charlotte's ancestors, Mei-Ling and Perfect Harmony, her grandmother who started the company when she arrived from Singapore as a 16 year old.<br />Wood peels back the layers of the stories in a way that kept me involved even though I usually am not too fond of flashbacks.<br />There were,however, a few improbable scenes and I thought the book could have been less dramatic in places.<br />Wood's books are always good reading, and it is evident that she does an amazing amount of research. Many of her books have a medical theme, usually non-conventional medicine. My favorite of her books was &quot;Green City in the Sun&quot;, which was about Kenya - a wonderful story that gave me a lot of insight into this country. Another excellent one was &quot;Virgins of Paradise&quot;, about Egyptian women and the family structure there. I even listened to the audio after reading the book. Both were packed full of interesting information that gave insight into how people in these places live.	2001-09-09

I found that this abridgment was awkward and poorly done. It was choppy and many loose ends were never tied up (like Stahl's husband's bout with depression). I particularly disliked the way it did not segue gracefully from one topic to another but abruptly changed topics.<br />I did like hearing about the minutae of her reporter's life and a lot of insider information about the presidents. I was fairly horrified to hear of Reagan's apparent mental decline during his years in office. Very scary.I also liked Stahl's honest opinions about many of the CBS brass. I am sure not all of them appreciated it.<br />Looking forward to reading the book!	2001-09-07

I just have so few vivid memories of my younger years that I found it hard to relate to the story line of this new book. But that is my issue and has nothing to do with the book itself.<br />I found the beginning chapters to be very confusing. References were made to people who had not yet been introduced and I often had no idea whom the author was talking about. I found this most disconcerting and was constantly re-reading to see if I had missed something. I hadn't missed anything, but someone had!<br />And where WAS Cullen, the town where the women in the book grew up? I was never able to figure that out. Was it north, south, east???<br />Also, I found the constant flashbacking confusing and awkward. Often it would occur with no warning, no spacing, just abruptly segue into another era from one paragraph to the next. Sometimes there were spaces but most often there were not. On some pages italics were used. I think it was very confusing to not have a standard device as an indicator of a flashback.<br />There were a lot of mistakes in this book that slipped past an editor. This just should not happen.<br />Something I ABSOLUTELY ADORED - and have passed along to several friends with children the ages of those in the book - was the rule that a complaint requires that person doing the complaining must express a corresponding &quot;gratitude&quot;...and I loved the idea of reinforcing this rule with a mere hand signal.	2001-09-07
1855632:US	53078987	RJRFTR4VBMYTM	0688172334	548755582	A Quaker Book of Wisdom: Life Lessons In Simplicity, Service, And Common Sense	Books	4	51	52	N	N	A Lovely Contemplative Book	I have been reading this book for a long time. Not because it is so long, but because I wanted to think about what it said.<br />I have long been fascinated by the Quakers, even before my association with a Friends school. Their belief that all people in the world are members of an extended family of equals appeals to me, as does their silent worship, which they call &quot;the search for the truth within&quot;. They present &quot;queries&quot; at their meetings for worship and this author calls the queries &quot;burrs under the saddle of the soul. &quot;<br />Quakers believe that one's life should speak for oneself, that goodness is the most important part of that life. They have no written creed, no ministers, but there is a strong belief system. It is as much a movement as it is a religion, I guess.<br />One thing that I particularly like is the way the Quaker &quot;service projects&quot; are done. They go to places, often to foreign countries that are in need, and do not attempt to make any converts. They are there to work, much as those in the Peace Corps are. I learned that the Society of Friends was the first organization to win a Nobel Peace Prize.<br />Some quotes from the book:<br />&quot;The silence allows the opening of minds and listening to our best inner selves.&quot;<br />&quot;So many of our young people are told that they must be good at something (math, music, sports) that they forget to pay attention to the primary command of the spirit: to be good at life.&quot;<br />&quot;Simplicity is the cornerstone of Quaker faith and defines daily life. Simplicity has little to do with how much you own and everything to do with not letting your possessions own you.&quot;<br />While I would have liked to have learned a bit more about the Quaker religion, that was not really the intent of this author, and there are many other places to go for that information.	2001-08-31

It was entertaining and amusing, not requiring a lot of deep thought. I thought Fforde did a fairly good job of character development even if the plot was a tad predictable<br />I liked the way the family was presented with all of its faults: the disagreements, the messiness, the lack of planned meals. This was very realistic. I also liked the way Althea met her financial problems head-on and made the best of things.<br />The only false note was the way Althea treated Patrick....there were too many times when she decided to let him go and pushed him out of her life.<br />But overall, this was an enjoyable way to spend a day of reading.	2001-08-30

To the outside world, Manning should have been able to *cope* with whatever life handed her. After all, she was a therapist herself, with a great marriage, a lovely daughter, and a supportive family. That she succumbed to this illness just points out the random nature of depression. As she said &quot;There's no getting away from the wave that's got your name on it. The tide will come in whether you want it to or not.&quot; If Manning did nothing else than show what a difference treatment can make for those who are depressed, then she achieved a lot. I think she did much more, however, by showing the many faces of depression and how a person can be totally crippled by it. It was heartbreaking to read about Manning's daughter, Keara, coming to visit at the hospital wearing some of her mother's clothes so as to have &quot;some piece of me to ....wear.&quot;<br />Manning's humor was apparent when she commented on the handsomeness of her doctor, saying that it was reassuring to know that she could still be so &quot;profoundly shallow&quot;! Mental illness, unfortunately, is still in the closet. One can only hope that books like this will make a difference in how the public perceives it.	2001-08-25

I had been looking forward to it for so long, but unfortunately, it bears no comparison to her first, &quot;Traveling Light&quot;, which was outstanding. &quot;Two Truths and a Lie&quot; never seemed to find its genre. Was it meant to be a mystery, a romance, a psychological study, or what? The book is weird and contrived. One thing I really disliked about it....the main characters were named Dair and Peyton (married couple). Isn't that just toooo cutesy? Besides which, I could never keep straight which one was which. And several times Peyton was spelled Payton! I never felt engaged by these mostly unlikable, angst-ridden, self-absorbed, unsympathetic, tiresome characters. None were ever fully developed, in my opinion. They were not people I cared about, in whom I could invest myself. The mystery part of the book was very weak, I thought. It was too much &quot;ado&quot; and not enough reality. The animal part was just too much. The only good thing about the animals' involvement was that they finally brought this story to an end. I still think that Kittle is very talented, and hope this book was not indicative of what we can expect in the future.	2001-08-25

It is difficult to find anything to say about this book that has not already been said before, here and elsewhere, many times over. I had been saving this book for a long time and now I know what everyone was raving about. Tyler's books often have a theme of abandonment --- caused by death, disappearance, desertion, or just general malaise. No matter what the cause, the characters must go on, often propelled by the grief caused by this abandonment. The author always finds a way for her characters to get through and keep on going. In this book, the strange disappearance of the father, Beck Tull, is never mentioned by his wife and children..... it is as if he never existed. The family goes on, powered by Pearl's sometimes abusive strength and her unspoken grief at being abandoned. Pearl is so enmeshed in her own problems, so inflexible, negative, and narrow-minded that the family never really becomes a cohesive unit. Jenny says that they all grew up and \\"the three of us turned out fine\\", but did they really? I think, as Cody says, that they all were \\"in particles, torn apart, torn all over the place\\". Ezra, on the other hand, despite his seemingly low self-esteem, is the most optimistic character in the book. He is constantly trying to make the Tulls into a family, as demonstrated by his oft-failed attempts to have a completed family dinner. Even though someone always storms out before the dinner is finished, Ezra keeps on trying, over and over again.<br />Ezra is obsessed with food because he has a strong need to nurture, and food is his choice of how to do this. Unlike Cody and Jenny, he wants to believe that his family is normal and can have an amicable time together. Pearl is just the opposite of Ezra - her meals, if you can call them that, are tasteless, dull, and rare. She is abusive and mean, unlike Ezra, who has a sweet nature and seems determined not to be like his parents. Over and over again, Tyler has written novels about ordinary folks.....they are classless and unable to be pigeonholed. The families are \\"different\\" (just as Tyler's was) which sometimes translates into \\"dysfunctional\\". Her writing is as plain and unadorned as the people who populate her books (perhaps a throwback to her Quaker upbringing). Thanks, Anne Tyler, for many hours of wonderful reading.ess and unable to be pigeonholed. The families are \\"different\\" (just as Tyler's was) which sometimes translates into \\"dysfunctional\\".

It is the first novel I have read by Greg Iles and I intend to read all of them. Iles portrays the Jennings family as resourceful, smart, determined and quick-thinking. They are the perfect foils for the organized and psycopathic kidnapper, Joe Hickey, who has completed five successful child-kidnappings and looks forward to another, that of Abby Jennings. A parallel story of a family whose child had previously been kidnapped by Hickey keeps the reader guessing as to what will happen, since this family has gone to the FBI on the anniversary of their son's kidnapping and the day of Abby's. Iles builds the heart-pounding suspense, one layer at a time. His character development is very good--you feel that you KNOW these people by the end of the book. My only complaint is that I did think that Iles was a little tough on the FBI-- it seemed that some personal animosity exists.	2001-08-25

The authors never complained, but they made me realize what a tough business they are in. Hope I can visit Cafe Beaujolais sometime.	2001-08-24

Written as a series of diary entries and letters to and from Tig (Antigone) as she walks cross-country taking an environmental survey. Her letters are to and from her husband, Marz; her two daughters, Justice and Solidarity; her grandson, and her granddaughter.<br />I really enjoy epistolary novels, and was in awe of the way Joanne Greenberg was able to find such an authentic and distinctive *voice* and writing style for each character. Tig's wisdom and her ability to smooth things over/negotiate/arbitrate/give advice was apparent in her letters, although she was not a totally sympathetic character. She has always been an activist and sometimes, as a younger woman, put her causes before her commitment to her daughters and her marriage.<br />Through these letters, we see family interaction in a unique way. It is not always a good picture, but I think it is honest and explores many issues faced (or not faced) by families today.<br />Tough going in places, this book is not one I will forget.	2001-08-23

He added an extra and special element to my enjoyment.<br />The book is part memoir, part writing suggestions, partly about how he writes. King never says &quot;you must do it THIS/MY way&quot;, but he makes a good case for many writing techniques (including the use of adverbs--he calls them &quot;dandelions in the garden of writing&quot;---and the passive voice). He covered all aspects of the writing craft from his own personal point of view. I found it fascinating and would like to hear how he went about writing every single one of his books!<br />I am not an avid fan of King's but do admire his craft, more so now that I have heard him tell of his early efforts, from his early teens and the early years of his marriage when they did not have even enough money to buy the &quot;pink stuff&quot; (liquid amoxicillin) for their daughter when she had an ear infection. Hearing him talk about his addictive behavior was enlightening in many ways, and heartbreaking as well.<br />His relating of the story of the day he got his first advance brought tears to my eyes. You could still hear the joy in his voice these many years later. And I admired the way he so easily talks about his love for and devotion to his wife, whom he calls Tabby. She is truly his source of strength and a respected and equal partner.<br />A really worthwhile read that should appeal to fans and non-fans alike.	2001-08-23

Kelly in about 3 hours. The author lives in Greensboro, NC, where this book takes place. In a nutshell, this is a novel about women's friendships....plain writing that  evoked many feelings and memories of the time when my children were younger and friendships with other women were of the utmost importance. Not that such friendships are not important now, but when my children were pre-school, friends were life savers. The mothers' network (my term) kept our bodies and souls together, and our sanity somewhat intact.<br />Some memories this book stirred:<br />* finding a stray Christmas present in March because I had hidden it so well!<br />* the pre-dawn line in the church parking lot for pre-school registration - first come, first served<br />* playing &quot;Beauty Shop&quot; with my daughter - she &quot;fixed me up&quot;-- hair, makeup, nails, etc.! What a hoot that was!<br />* meeting new neighbors and taking them on &quot;orientation&quot; trips around the community<br />* the desperate search for daytime babysitters so one could go to the dentist<br />Here is something from the book that really made an impact:<br />&quot;Details.<br />Psychiatrists and theorists and essayists, and yes, feminists, dissect and analyze and assign universal themes and theories to explain what binds women: the desire to nurture, the experience of childbirth, the constant striving to succeed in a male-dominated world. And surely these are our common causes.<br />But what truly, more accurately, binds women is the incremental collective trivia of hilarities and heartbreaks, humiliation and hum-drum amassed over telephones and fences, over laundry baskets and garden beds, on back stoops and park benches, in driveways and dry cleaners, in checkout lanes and carpool lines.<br />It's the parallel details of their existence which bind and entwine women with one another: the minutae of children and husbands and homes. Bound by the perpetual presence of smudges on windows from children's hands and lips; by fending off dinnertime solicitations; by dust balls the size of mice beneath beds; by sick days and snow days; by the availability of babysitters; by short-lived forays into extra-curricular activities and self-improvement; by periods of sheer maintenance with no forward progression, waiting only for time to pass.&quot;<br />Pril and Ruth have been next-door neighbors and best friends for ten years, as have their children. The women are closer than sisters. One day, Ruth leaves to vacation in Colorado with her children, and never returns. She does not call or write to explain why she has left. This book explores the basis of the friendship and some difficult choices Pril must make when Ruth's husband sues for custody of their children.<br />This is a powerful book that will stay with me for a long while.udges on windows from children's hands and lips; by fending off dinnertime solicitations; by dust balls the size of mice beneath beds; by sick days and snow days; by the availability of babysitters; by short-lived forays into extra-curricular activities and self-improvement; by periods of sheer maintenance with no forward progression, waiting only for time to pass.&quot;<br />Pril and Ruth have been next-door neighbors and best friends for ten years, as have their children.

It moves along at a fast pace and is alternately touching and funny.<br />The members of the MMW (Mostly Methodist Women) club of Minnesota, the majority of them approaching retirement age (except for two) decide that they need to make some money. So they form an investment club and, after seeking professional advice, decide that they can figure out where to invest their money themselves.

I can only compare this to Steve Martin's novella, &quot;Shopgirl&quot;, which contained fully developed characters and a complete storyline within about the same number of pages.<br />Anyone expecting a full-scale Ed McBain story will be disappointed in this little novella. I was initially interested in the story but found it to be deficient in character development. The reader never really knew much about the characters....I felt that the man who found the purse , a very minor character, was described more fully than any of the main characters.<br />Not every author can write this kind of book, but I do know that it is possible to have fully fleshed-out characters in even a short story---it just did not happen here. That makes it very difficult to really care about what happens to anyone in &quot;Driving Lessons&quot;.	2001-07-26

In somewhat of a departure from her more mystical and whimsical books, Hoffman has written a novel of love, courage, and the nature of allegiance. We are left to ponder the question of how well we really know the people whom we love; how well we really know anyone. The author causes the reader to explore the origin, nature, quality, and depth of forgiveness and to question what really constitutes, morally and ethically, a &quot;good life&quot;.<br />The book opens on a scene from the good and perfect life of the Fords, Ethan and Jorie. We know it is just too good to last. The make-believe life, the fairy tale, is about to end. Happily-ever-after does not really exist.<br />When the unthinkable happens and Jorie's husband Ethan is arrested for a long-ago and vicious crime, Jorie must face not only her own fears, but those of their son, Collie. She goes through all the stages associated usually associated with a death: grief, denial, despair, and then hope. For she has experienced a death: the death of all her dreams.<br />Jorie endures the pity of the townspeople and then the transference of her husband's guilt to her. Never one to question herself, she now questions everything. Despite the allegiance and love of her friends, especially Charlotte, recently diagnosed with breast cancer, Jorie must ultimately face her husband's betrayal on her own. For &quot;night after night, she has slept with a shadow, an imposter formed out of ashes....&quot;<br />Ethan has lived for years with a terrible secret, but he now knows that &quot;The past stays with a man, sticking to his heels like glue, invisible and heartbreaking and unavoidable, threaded to the future just as surely as day is sewn to night.&quot; For he can never escape this past, and no matter how much he has changed, no matter how different he now is, he cannot avoid the consequences of his long-ago actions nor be forgiven for them. Sometimes repentance is just not enough, and having lived a good life does not make atonement for the evil that one has perpetuated in the past.<br />&quot;Blue&quot; is a word sprinkled throughout the book to describe many things, but the blue diary of the title is an unfinished journal left behind by a murdered girl. Hoffman describes it like this: &quot;The diary is a book of hope that has never been finished, a list of dreams left undone.&quot;<br />This book is lovingly crafted and polished to a fine patina.

You really feel as though you are there, smelling the scents, seeing the buildings, experiencing the life.<br />The relationship between Anju and Sudha, who are cousins but are also &quot;sisters of the heart&quot;, is lovingly and wistfully portrayed. Divakaruni is able to hone in exactly on why women's friendships, and their bonds, are so long-lasting and so important. Not only the relationship of the cousins, but that of their three mothers as well.<br />I was a little put off by the awkwardness of the present tense changing to the past tense in dialogue, but put that aside to enjoy the story. I wish the ending had been less hurried, and that the voices of Anju and Sudha had been more distinct.<br />All in all, a good experience and a book from which I learned a great deal.	2001-07-24

What makes it really special are the wonderful drawings Sugarman did during this time.<br />This book gave me insights into the feelings of someone fighting a war--it could be Everyman and Everywar, a soldier far from home making difficult decisions every minute of every day. Those feelings are probably universal. The book was not so much about the specifics of a war, but what it was like for one particular soldier.<br />I was also reminded of the feeling of duty and honor and dedication to one's country that is not often expressed any more.<br />This book would be a good addition to any history class in any school.	2001-07-23

The author made a considered and deliberate decision, at a very young age (while still in college) to lead a simpler life, close to the earth. I really admire his adherence to his principles and his problem -solving skills in a time when we all just call someone else to do things.<br />I loved reading about the methods he used for farming, building, and general survival with none of what we consider the amenities of life. I found myself feeling very calm as I read this book....a sure sign that the conveniences of modern life bring stress with them!	2001-07-19

Opal is 20 and is running away from her controlling family and the father of her five-year old son when she rents a house next door to Rose's. How these two women *rescue* each other, emotionally and otherwise, is the topic of this novel.<br />Rose has been consumed by grief for five years because of her imagined guilt. Opal is trying to keep custody of her child. The bond of motherhood brings these women together and allows them to help each other in ways that neither would have imagined.<br />Anyone who has experienced the joys and sorrows of parenthood will be able to relate to these sentences :&quot;Watching him, she feels a familiar jolt in her stomach, the sharp, sweet terror of motherhood.&quot;  &quot;Having a child is like having your heart walk around outside of your body, bumping into things.&quot;<br />Rose tries to write what she feels, keeping this a secret from her husband, Ned, who cannot manage, despite his best efforts, to penetrate her grief. Le Claire writes: &quot;She wrote all about Todd and how she missed him and how one minute a person could be in your life, laughing and smiling and driving you crazy with their foolishness, and then the next, with no warning, they were gone and all the words you never got a chance to say would be locked up inside you, and what ever happened to words locked inside, where did they go?&quot; Food for thought.	2001-07-19

I faithfully read her weekly column and think it is wonderfully done.<br />The premise and story in this book were interesting and emotional. As I read the first 100 or so pages, I was immediately drawn into the terrible grief these families were suffering. I felt my heart pounding and breathlessness that comes when one is overwhelmed by life's tragedies.<br />I really and truly wish that I could say that I loved this book and that it was masterfully done.<br />However, the quality of the writing in this book was a major disappointment. There were many grammatical errors, the writing was disjointed and thus confusing, characters were undeveloped, and so on. References were made to things that never were revealed to the reader. I often found myself having to re-read sections of the book to see what the author was trying to say. I had to force myself to finish it----it became a chore to try to find the story and emotion in the morass of confusing verbiage that surrounded it. I ended the book wondering what the editor had done.	2001-07-07

A good blend of text, photos, and charts make this book interesting to the non-financial reader.<br />The author divided the book into decades and each chapter outlined the changes that occurred over those years.<br />At the beginning of the last century, Wall Street was known for its lack of financial regulation regarding trades. Scandals and outright swindles abounded. Four years after the Crash of 1929, FDR's administration passed nationwide banking and securities laws to make sure that this kind of disaster did not happen again.<br />Unfortunately, the real and distasteful inner workings of Wall Street were revealed in the Senate hearings. An SEC commissioner called investment bankers \\"financial termites\\". This knowledge scared investors away for the next 20 years.<br />In the early 50s, investing became popular with middle class investors for the first time in a generation, and mutual funds were developed after being gone for 30 years.<br />The 60s brought the birth of the modern mergers and acquisitions business in the U.S, and the days of small brokerage firms were coming to an end.<br />The 70s brought extensive reforms concerning commissions while the 80s were the years of junk bonds, insider trading scandals, and the savings and loan crisis.<br />The author called the 80s the decade of greed and the 90s the decade of boom. The Internet has brought about a totally new way of trading stocks and has made up-to-the-minute financial news available to everyone.<br />The changes in the last 100 years on Wall Street have been phenomenal, mirroring the technological changes in our society.	2001-07-06

There was some of that in the book (such as having a list of alternate flights with you when you go to the airport, as well as the phone numbers of the airlines; if you are traveling with someone on a plane, pack half of your stuff in each other's suitcase. That way, if one suitcase gets lost, you are not without anything at all).<br />I also learned that most fire ladders only go up seven stories (from the street), so if I am in a hotel, I will request a street-side room below the 7th floor. I also found out how to escape from a rip tide, emergency braking for a car, and how to avoid a common scam at an airport X-Ray machine.<br />I did not really need information about jumping from one rooftop to another, removing a leech, crossing a piranha-infested river, surviving a trip over a waterfall, escaping from a tsunami, or catching fish without a rod.<br />This information that I did not need was, nevertheless, interesting to read. Almost as good was reading about the various experts whom the author consulted in order to write these scenarios.	2001-07-05

I would not finish a book if it were not somewhat compelling -- I have too many other hundreds of books that I want to read. The word on &quot;Kissing Manhattan&quot; was that it was a *hot* property and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I must admit to having been curious and perhaps that is why I read to the last page. I was trying to *find* the book that all the reviews were talking about.<br />My opinion is that the hype was much ado about not too much. The marginally interconnected stories are a strange, surreal look at a group of people whose only link is residence in an old apartment building, The Preemption, a &quot;tower of darkness&quot;.<br />I kept getting the uneasy feeling that this author was trying to be too cool, too hip, too with-it.<br />While I found some of the characters and stories interesting, most were people I really could not warm up to or like. They needed more fleshing out and more experiences with which the reader could identify. Many had no redeeming qualities but epitomized the image of hard-edged spoiled urbanites on an endless quest for something more, be it money, pleasure, romance,or power.<br />When I went back and read the publisher's description: &quot;Hilarious, sexy, and deeply tender&quot;, I wondered if we had read the same book. I saw no humor, let alone hilarity, and only two  stories had any remnant of tenderness.	2001-06-25

I started off loving it...it began wonderfully with such lovely language. I think the problem is that it was just too drawn out and lengthy. It felt like the author was getting paid by the word!<br />I think the framework of the story was good but it was too enmeshed in all the verbiage. I found myself skimming large sections in the second half.<br />The resolution/climax did not seem to warrant the weight and length of all that came before it. The hints of what was to come made me feel that the denouement would be more spectacular than it was.<br />Like another reviewer, I experienced some confusion, such as the several times two characters were doing the same thing, separated by 50 years. I found it unclear as to who was doing what and when.<br />I was inspired by the album that Framboise's mother kept over the years and have reolved to do something similar. What a great idea!	2001-06-24

I will say that I loved the story of Ave Maria. Having just read stories of strong, independent women in Elizabeth Berg's &quot;Never Change&quot; and JoAnn Mapson's &quot;Bad Girl Creek&quot;, this fit right in with them.<br />I had no interest in reading this as a book, but bought the abridged audio for a car trip and was entranced by the story. Maybe the book would have been too long. This seemed just right, and it was a good audio too. By this, I mean that here were no gaps in the story as sometimes happens with abridged audios and Trigiani did a masterful job of narrating.<br />I was delighted to meet all of the characters who lived and worked in Big Stone Gap!	2001-06-19

A 3 is a bit harsh for such  a well-meaning book.<br />Chiaverini relates a story of small-town life, a quilter's guild, and a romance stretching back to the 1940s. It is a story of family and of the need to sometimes mend fences. The characters are sweet, on the whole, but with little emotional complexity or passion. I forgot most of them the minute I finished the book.<br />I loved this line &quot;quilting as a metaphor for how we stitched our lives together&quot;.<br />I look forward to meeting the characters again in the two sequels, but hopefully the author will &quot;design&quot; them with more fire and emotion.	2001-06-19

My heart ached for this woman, to have never known the joy of having a buddy whom she could talk to, be with, confide in. Myra had never been asked on a date, never asked to go shopping with the girls or to a movie or a dance. People liked her and talked to her--they just did not become her friends. Yet she did not ask for pity. Her best friend is her dog, Frank, but Myra seems very satisfied with her life, her patients, her house, her routine, and her Porsche Carrera 911.<br />Myra's patients provide us with a cast of characters who are similar to those in an Anne Tyler book--odd, quirky, and likable despite their flaws. They have become Myra's &quot;family&quot; and friends. She said that she became a nurse because &quot;I knew it would be a good way for people to love me. And for me to love them too.&quot;<br />Into Myra's life comes Chip Reardon, her high school love (unbeknownst to him) and every girl's dream boy, who has returned  home to his parents' house in their small home town, ill with an end-stage brain tumor. She is assigned as the nurse to his case and says something so sad: &quot;You know something bad about me? I thought only one thing. I thought, Good. Now I can have him.&quot; How she and Chip arrive at a different kind of loving relationship is a wonderful story as only Elizabeth Berg can tell it.<br />The writing in this book is graceful and lyrical. The author is a former nurse herself and although she did not practice nursing very long, she is obviously an astute observer of people as she seems to get them just right. Myra's dealings with her patients  is just right too--she coddles those who need it and forces others into making choices and decisions. This is a serious book about a serious subject, but as presented by Berg, it is not too heavy-handed.<br />The title of the book is an oft-written sentiment in high school yearbooks. Berg writes &quot;...never change. As though it were a choice. As though one of our greatest lessons isn't that change is the only constant. The seasons tell us, everything in organic life tells us, that there is no holding on; still, we try to do just that. Sometimes, though, we learn the kind of wisdom that celebrates the open hand. Then we know that letting go of everything is the only way to keep the things that matter most.&quot;title of the book is an oft-written sentiment in high school yearbooks.

This book can easily be added to a list of good books dealing with the elderly (\\"Roommates\\" by Max Apple and \\"To Dance With the White Dog\\" by Terry Kay were two of my favorites). Tyler's characterization of the older people is right on the mark. An entire book could be based on some of them! That might be the basis of my one complaint about the book -- I would have liked to have gotten to know some of these characters better.<br />I liked the way the title was explained: One of Barnaby's clients, Mrs. Alford, has spent years making a quilt of &quot;our planet&quot; -- &quot;makeshift and haphazard, clumsily cobbled together, overlapping and crowded and likely to fall to pieces at any moment,&quot; a symbol of all our lives.<br />Barnaby was considered a loser in his family, but I thought he was the best of the bunch-- the only one with a heart and compassion as he took loving care of his elderly clients and tried to be a good father to Opal. His mother made me cringe and his oh-so-perfect brother was a jerk.<br />Tyler's subtle humor was apparent throughout. I especially liked the way she described how Barnaby's sister-in-law *planned* and *prepared* Thanksgiving dinner!<br />All in all, a wonderful book.	2001-06-07

It certainly shows his softer side-- definitely is not a horror story--almost spiritual in its rendering.<br />I have not read any of King's books in the last 10 years, but this sounded different, and it certainly was! I had to restrain myself, over and over again, from reading the ending early (something I never do). It was such a gripping story....I felt every bump and bruise and pain that nine-year-old Trisha McFarland, lost in the northeast woods, felt as she tried to find her way back to civilization.<br />King's rendering of the thoughts of this child, her terror, her spirit, and her resourcefulness were right on target. I felt myself growing increasingly anxious as Trisha wandered in the woods, trying desperately not only to survive but to stay sane. Good writing...no dialogue and essentially only one character, which must be a difficult kind of book to write; but despite this, the story never lagged. It was fast and easy reading.<br />Like Paul Watkins' \\"Archangel\\" and Jean Hegland's \\"Into the Forest\\",  the forest was a character in the novel as much as was any human.	2001-06-07

It is the study of a family - and we all know these people: the doctor-father who pushes his children to perfection, the mother who does not like to challenge her husband's edicts, the kids who love/hate their father and love/pity their mother. I think this author has done a good job of portraying family dynamics, with fairly good writing.<br />I was not surprised to see that Elizabeth Berg wrote a blurb for the cover of this books. In some ways, the writing is reminiscent of Berg's, but for a younger audience.<br />While a good story, it seemed a mite shallow for the subject. But maybe that is not all bad if it makes people aware of the problem. I am conflicted over the rating to give this and wish that 3.5 stars were available.	2001-06-07

She spoke with great calm and dignity, and with very little anger or rancor towards those who were responsible for the loss of twenty years of her life. She says that having spent most of her life as an onlooker, there is a &quot;sheet of glass&quot; between herself and the outside world.&quot; I think this explains her calm demeanor.<br />Malika was a happy-go-lucky 19 year old party girl in Morocco, having lived in the palace as the &quot;adopted&quot; companion of the king's daughter. Suddenly she, her mother, a cousin, a former nurse, and her five younger brothers and sisters were imprisoned because of her father's actions. Their once-elegant world shrank ---the next 20 years were spent in several prison sites in southern Morocco where they were basically forgotten. They were the &quot;disappeared&quot;.<br />General Oufkir, the power-hungry head of Morocco's notorious security forces, had operated with King Hassan's knowledge for many years. When he finally turned on the king, he was caught and executed. His family members were considered &quot;criminals by descent&quot; and found themselves at the mercy of their jailers, of disease and vermin, and of hunger.<br />Even after they managed to escape and appealed to the media (after 15 years of imprisonment), the Oufkirs were held under house arrest for four more years, then denied passports for another five years.<br />This is a story that should be read widely and discussed at length. How these people survived (some more intact than others) is a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit. How they got through each day, how Malika taught the younger children, how they bargained for survival.....the trials they endured were and are unconscionable in the civilized world.<br />Although her book is poignant and heart-rending, it is never hysterical or melodramatic. It should embarrass the Moroccan government, but that is not why Malika wrote it. She says that &quot;vengeance would be meaningless in our case.

People die, crops are lost, indebtedness multiplies, farms fail, and hardships abound. Although the setting is contemporary, the characters live in an almost peasant culture. Places have names like All Night Creek, the Freezeouts, and Dirty Water. Some of the characters are Tick Corn, Hondo Gunsch, Pake Bitts, Dirt Sheets, Dig Yant, Car Scrope, John Wrench, Hulse Birch, Como Bewd, and Wauneta Hipsag.<br />The writing is rough and harsh in many cases. I could not read more than one story at a time....I needed a break from their bleakness and the damaged, lonely, out-of luck characters. So why read them? Because they portray a gritty but realistic lifestyle, man fighting against the fates and rarely succeeding....and after the first two stories, you are hooked.<br />In the beginning of &quot;The Mud Below,&quot; at a rodeo, Diamond Felts is on a bull (jokingly called Kisses) which is as &quot;big as a boxcar of coal.&quot;  You read because you want to know if Diamond's long-term string of rodeo losses will end. You find yourself always hoping.<br />The most memorable (to me) story was &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. Ennis and Jack, two high school dropouts with no future to speak of, find themselves physically attracted to each other while tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain. Knowing that in Wyoming guys are often beaten for this sort of behavior, they marry women and have children, and allow themselves to see each other only once a year on their &quot;fishing trips&quot;.<br />Proulx's spare writing echoes the setting of her stories and draws the reader right into them. Her research must have been extensive to allow her to write so knowledgeably. Not a book for the faint of heart, but one which you will be glad you read. I am especially glad that I was able to get one of the illustrated hardcover books.	2001-05-26

The bare bones are there--it is a page-turner, for sure-- but it seemed as though I were on an out-of-control train.<br />The writing is formulaic, the plot is a tired one, the book skitters from one topic to another, and the ending is both rushed and predictable. It seems as though Picoult could not decide whether to write a police procedural, a trial book, or a romance. Consequently, all three are intertwined and leave the reader wanting more of something.<br />The courtroom scenes were not at all believable. I think that it is a rare writer who can write courtroom scenes that are both realistic and interesting because trials can be very boring and tedious.<br />To her credit, Jodi did give the reader a true sense of how lies and connivance can ruin someone's life...and how eager the public is to believe anything bad that they hear.	2001-05-23

To say that I enjoyed this moving book is an understatement---I hated to have it end!<br />When Phoebe DeThomas is left a flower farm by her Aunt Sadie, it seems a difficult mission for her to make it succeed because she has been in a wheelchair since childhood. She also has to deal with her brother James (he yearns to be wealthy) who would like to see the farm sold to developers. She recruits three other women and their pets via a clever ruse that allows her to carefully choose her new house/workmates. Each arrives at the farm willing to work hard and make it support them.<br />As one reviewer said, there is not a woman on earth who would not like to live with the four women on the flower farm near Bad Girl Creek on California's central coast. All have come to the farm with disparate problems, varied pasts, and different needs. But they all are determined to work hard, make the place a success, and achieve some harmony in their personal lives. They become a family in the truest sense of the word, even if not related by blood, and begin to learn to trust each other and to see purpose in their lives.<br />This is a quiet, charming book with characters who tug at your heart and leave the reader wanting to know them and know more about them. These are &quot;women in transition&quot; whose journey I was delighted to share. I do not think enough female authors write of  women and their friends and the power of friendships. Too often, women in contemporary literature seem to live in isolation (unlike any women that I know).<br />As with her other books, in &quot;Bad Girl Creek&quot; Mapson writes about suffering  and how to overcome it, but never resorts to writing tear-jerkers. Her strong female characters face their problems - or are encouraged by their friends to do so - and do something about them. The wonderful people  in this book will stay with the reader for a long time because of Mapson's ability to make them so real and endearing to us.ause of Mapson's ability to make them so real and endearing to us.	2001-05-23

The book details many of the obstacles they had to overcome and how they dealt with them.<br />It is such an interesting story of ingenuity, especially how they managed to get water (having a well pounded, not drilled); survived without any electricity (except for a generator that was only sufficient for running the mini sewage-treatment facility); used a 60-year old gas-powered refrigerator; and painted the 796 windowpanes in the inn and lighthouse.<br />The vignettes about the guests and some of the local characters were both amusing and insightful.<br />Each of the 21 chapters ends with one of the inn's recipes and the book is illustrated with delightful engravings by a Maine artist.  I really enjoyed this book and have bought it several times to give as a gift.	2001-05-22

For all of you who read and loved \\"Where the Heart Is\\" (or even if you did not read it)----this book is even better. And it was even better the second time around......I loved it!!!<br />The characters are memorable, and what a cast: Caney Paxton, the cafe owner and a Vietnam vet who is wheelchair-bound because he fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam; MollyO, a waitress and Caney's surrogate mother; Bui, a Vietnamese refugee who sneaks into the local AME church to sleep and finds employment at the Honk and Holler; and Vena Takes Horses, a wanderer who just sort of lands at the cafe. Letts brings all of these characters, and others, to life and makes the reader care about them.<br />Set in a cafe in a small Oklahoma town, we are introduced to small-town life with all its foibles, its peculiar characters, and its conflicts.<br />I did not want this book to end. It made me laugh and it made me cry. It is a book about family and its importance, even though the family at the Honk and Holler was not related by blood but connected by a different bond.<br />By the way, \\"Honk and Holler\\" was published in August of 1999, long BEFORE Letts was anointed by Oprah in December of 1999. In fact, I remember being disappointed that this book was not the one Oprah chose.<br />I would heartily recommend this book and look forward to Letts' next one.	2001-05-13

I usually enjoy her books more, although this was a somewhat touching story (but gritty, with quite a bit of sex). Here is what the author says about that:<br />Mapson never hesitates to explore the intimate details of the characters' sexual relationships. &quot;Writing about love and sex to me is great fun and a challenge,&quot; she said.  &quot;The sex in my novels isn't all that racy, but one of my mother's friends recently said I write dirty books.  I find that amusing since she is absolutely addicted to those bodice-ripper romances with Fabio on the cover.&quot;<br />Mapson explores the complexities of a love triangle in this book. Hank and Chloe are sort of a star-crossed Romeo and Juliet. Hank is tender, loving, sentimental, committed, well-educated. Chloe is wary of commitment, street smart, and uncertain of her feelings.<br />I find that the author really touched me when she wrote about the illness of Hank's mother; the birth of Hank and Chloe's baby and Chloe's immediate and intense maternal feelings; and the plight of the native American children and their less-than-adequate school.<br />However, I wish that Mapson had gone in another direction and left Hank and Chloe where they were in the first book. Sequels can be dangerous for an author to attempt, and this sequel fell far short of the original.<br />I am now reading her newest book, &quot;Bad Girl Creek&quot; and am happy to say that the author is back in her usual fine form!	2001-05-13

Anita Shreve constantly surprises and her topics cannot be pigeon-holed or even classified. Every novel of hers is totally different from her others.<br />&quot;Fortune's Rocks&quot;, a variation on &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, is written in the style of the day---1900--and reflects the author's meticulous research and her total grasp of the spoken language of that era.<br />In 1899, Olympia Biddeford, the daughter of an influential and wealthy Boston family, embarks on a brief but torrid affair with Dr. John Haskell, 41 and married with children.<br />The affair is brief because the lovers are discovered, in a most public and humiliating way, during Olympia's 16th birthday celebration. The scandal that follows tears families apart and exiles the former lovers.<br />The book is gracefully written and well-constructed in the style of the day, fairly formal and very descriptive.

How does Anne Tyler, over and over again, write novels about ordinary, albeit quirky, people who are quietly appealing and make the reader feel their physical and social awkwardness?<br />I was hooked from the first sentence: &quot;Once upon a time, there was a woman who discovered she had turned into the wrong person.&quot; One MUST continue reading to find out why...and when Tyler introduces, in the next few pages, characters named MinFoo, NoNo, Poppy, Jeep, and Patch, I settled down to a long evening of reading.<br />Where has Rebecca Davitch's life gone? This is what she wants to know. She is 53, widowed for 27 years, and has brought up three step-daughters and one daughter whom she had with Joe Davitch. Joe's first wife had left him to become a singer and when he died, they continued to live with Rebecca. She was also left with &quot;The Open Arms&quot;, a once-elegant but aging city house that the family rents out for parties and where they also live.<br />We meet Rebecca when she is wondering how she became what she now is: arbiter of family disputes, handyman, &quot;cruise director&quot; at &quot;The Open Arms&quot;, caretaker for her elderly uncle-in-law, and a person of &quot;unrelenting jollity&quot; (a state she has had to struggle to attain). Is this her life, she wonders, or someone else's? What happened to the dignified, serene young woman she was at 19 when she married the 33-year-old Joe Davitch? She proceeds to awkwardly explore what might have happened had she married Will her hometown/college sweetheart and not lost her identity when she became immersed and enmeshed in the Davitch clan.<br />Rebecca asks herself &quot;Wasn't it strange how certain moments, now and then - certain turning points in a life, contained the curled and waiting seeds of everything that would follow?&quot;<br />It is obvious, as Tyler said in an interview, that her heroes are those who manage to endure and she wants everyone to understand what she is getting at. As one reviewer said &quot;She never blinds us with her prose....instead, the quiet accretion of her insights hit one in the chest.&quot;<br />I would highly recommend this book.viewer said &quot;She never blinds us with her prose....instead, the quiet accretion of her insights hit one in the chest.&quot;<br />I would highly recommend this book.	2001-05-01

But this is not a real &quot;4&quot; but more like a 3+.<br />Warner Lutz is living a life of &quot;quiet desperation&quot;. In his early 30s, he has had a career in non-profit fund raising and now sees no way to achieve the six-figure income that he thinks he needs in order to live a better life. He, his wife Megan, and their two  very young children live in a too-small  townhouse in Charlotte, have one old car, and worry about money all the time.<br />This book is populated with almost-dull characters who are fairly close to real: the frazzled wife/mother, the husband who wants it all and now, the interfering mother-in-law, and the whiny kids. Leebron expertly depicts the tensions within the Lutz household - normal tensions, I might add, usually brought on by exhaustion and the demands of parenthood.<br />Warner incessantly wonders about his future and his wife wonders why she ever married him (she calls him the most negative person she had ever known). I wondered the same thing. The inertia of these characters made me want to give them a swift kick.<br />When something terrible happens halfway through the book, the future of this family is threatened and the characters are forced to look inward even more to examine their motivations and their needs. Oddly, the Lutz's do not have one friend to turn to, to confide in. This was extremely unrealistic and a real flaw in the book. Another flaw was Warner himself--he was way too uninteresting to be the main character of a book.<br />Not a ringing endorsement, but a quick and interesting read.	2001-04-22

In her early teens, Augusta became rebellious beyond the norm and acted out by drinking, drugging, and disappearing for days on end - both physically and emotionally.<br />Dudman writes of what she went through - guilt, questioning her parenting, wondering why this had happened to her, punishment, being a &quot;jailer&quot; - in a way that draws the reader in and makes you feel her despair at ever being able to make things &quot;right&quot; again. She had tried so conscientiously to be a good parent and when her relationship with Augusta changed to that of constant confrontation and anger, she was in agony.<br />When Dudman tried to figure out what went wrong, she said &quot;You don't know if it's because her mother works too much, or because your daughter's too smart for her classes, or because she has maybe a learning disability you never caught, or because her teacher has a learning disability or isn't smart enough to teach your daughter. Or maybe . . . she is becoming a teenager and this is how they act.&quot;<br />She also talks about looking for answers in parenting books. This section just grabbed my guts: &quot;They only talked about little problems. When your child begins to show different patterns -- changes in eating patterns, changes in sleeping patterns, depression, mood swings, schoolwork slipping -- choose one. . . . How about when the whole child collapses? How about when everything is wrong all the time and she is screaming at you and threatening you with a knife and you are crying and she is crying and it feels like the end of your life? Where's the book for that?&quot;<br />The ultimate decision, made with the help of an educational counselor, was to send Augusta away--first to a wilderness program out west (they lived in Maine) and then to a boarding school for troubled youth.<br />I really admire this author for being so honest and sharing so much of her life in this book. This is a topic that is usually not talked about, except in whispers or in the privacy of one's home. Hopefully, it will help other parents to realize that they are not alone.ally admire this author for being so honest and sharing so much of her life in this book.

What a shame the writing did not live up to this interesting premise. The first half wasn't too bad--the excitement and novelty clouded the holes in the story and the awkward writing.<br />But once Bill Kelly became Pope and moved to Rome, the story became incredibly heavy and the writing got even worse. There were so many editorial errors that one wonders if it was ever proofread. The depiction of the Pope's children was terrible, not age-appropriate at all. It is as if the writers knew nothing about kids!<br />The dialogue was the worst - it was almost embarrassing to read it, it was so stilted.

More of a sociological and cultural study than a &quot;true crime&quot; book, the author, Bernard Lefkowitz details the story of a young retarded woman (&quot;Leslie&quot;) who was raped by &quot;the Jocks&quot; in the town of Glen Ridge, NJ. Many of these young men had been trouble since middle school years, but they were the golden boys, the star athletes, in a town that revered athleticism and competition. The behavior of one of the defendants was so disgusting and bizarre, for many years, but he was never held responsible. As Lefkowitz said, you walked into the high school and saw a huge trophy cabinet containing trophies, game balls, and all the other accoutrements of winning sporst teams. But where was the honor roll list?<br />These boys had been raised to feel empowered, that they could get away with things that other *mortals* could not. They treated most women and girls with disrespect. They had very little contact with girls or women in a situation where the girls could be their *equals*, since all of their activities involved sports teams. None of them did volunteer work, were on the school paper, or in activities where they worked on an equal footing with females. What was especially alarming and dismaying was that the girls, the Jockettes or Little Mothers, as Lefkowitz calls them---put up with the vile behavior of these boys and defended them!!!! I kept thinking of bits from \\"Reviving Ophelia\\" when I read about these girls. They must have felt that they had no identity apart from these boys.<br />Lefkowitz writes of the boys who raped Leslie: &quot;'These Glen Ridge kids, they were pure gold, every mother's dream, every father's pride. They were not only Glen Ridge's finest, but in their perfection they belonged to all of us. They were Our Guys.&quot;<br />This next quote is from the book, and refers to Laurino, who was the prosecutor in the case: &quot;But there was something else about this case, something that seemed to provoke him more than it provoked his fellow prosecutors: the values of the defendants. He discerned in their relatively brief lives a pattern of abuse of power, a corruption of decent intent, for which these young men andmany of those who had guided them shared responsibility.\\"<br />It was beyond his reach, but if he could have done so, Laurino would have convicted the values of Glen Ridge. &quot;They believed themselves to be invincible....that problems that  would arise would be taken care of out of the deep pockets of their parents or the compassion of a small-town police department or the compassion of a small-town school system or the compassion of small-town residents who knew each other and wanted to handle things among themselves. They've been getting free rides all their life.&quot;<br />I would highly recommend this book, especially for parents, coaches, and teachers. This lionization of student athletes by these people ultimately does no one any good and can destroy lives.

I had read a review that billed it as a &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer for the new century&quot;. However, I never got as involved with the characters in this book as I did with the Kramers, I think because the characters were so one-dimensional and wooden. I did make myself finish the book, and am not totally sorry that I did. I just wish that I had more feelings for the people whom I met.<br />The book does show the effect that one mistake can have on a marriage when Harry Silver has a one-night stand with a co-worker. The author tries to make the reader feel the pain Harry feels when his wife leaves him and when she threatens to seek custody of their little boy. But Parsons' efforts fall short of truly involving the reader in the emotional life of the story and its characters.<br />I found that the most touching parts were the scenes with Harry and his father.....these were very well done.	2001-04-13

The story is not told in a totally chronological way, and there is some foreshadowing (which I usually don't like, but it *fit* here). Rather, Haruf tells the story via a series of well-crafted vignettes spanning almost an entire century, narrated mostly by Roscoe Sanders, a neighbor of Edith and Lyman Goodnough. These scenes are so detailed that one is easily able to &quot;fill in&quot; the intervening years.<br />This is a spare, harsh novel about &quot;the tie that binds&quot; - which in this book is family. But in this case, the tie does not just bind, but almost strangles Edith, the central character. She is tied by obligation and a sort of love that never allow her to put her desires or needs above those of her father and brother.<br />Like \\"Plainsong\\", this book takes place in Holt, Colorado. Unlike \\"Plainsong\\", Haruf used quotation marks!<br />The characters are incredibly well-drawn and so very real. Although I was able to feel the despair of Edith's life, I never felt sorry for her, mainly because Haruf never had her express or show any self-pity. She just did what had to be done, day after day, year after year. Haruf certainly has a gift for causing the reader to have intense feelings about those who populate his books and for evoking the starkness of the Colorado plains.	2001-04-13

It read like a thriller, even though I already knew the outcome. The author is from Scotland and the book was naturally sympathetic to Mary.<br />The book begins in 1561 when the 18 year-old Queen Mary returns to Scotland for the first time in 13 years, as the widow of the king of France and its former Queen, albeit briefly. The story follows the plotting of her half-brother James who wants the throne for himself; her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England who sees Mary as a personal threat; and the brilliant leadership of Lethington, her Secretary of State, whose only agenda is to place a Stewart on England's throne. Although Mary and her ambitions were portrayed in a favorable light, I found that she also seemed to be a woman who was manipulated by the men who advised her, men who were out for their own personal gain (with the exception of Lethington and a few others).<br />The author has managed to make this story into a romantic thriller, in the best sense of the term. She brought these characters and the history of the time to to vivid life.<br />I was fortunate to have visited the palace (Holyroodhouse) and castle (Edinburgh Castle) where much of the action of the story took place, which greatly added to my interest.	2001-04-13

This well-researched, movingly-detailed story is difficult to put down, but not for the same reason as his other novels. Instead, it closely resembles the author's first book,&quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, an intense courtroom novel examining the politics of Mississippi justice.<br />The chamber in the title is the death chamber, where Sam Cayhall, a nine-year resident of death row, is slated to be killed with cyanide gas in a few weeks. Cayhall, a frail and elderly man, was a Ku Klux Klan bomber convicted in 1981 of bombing the office of a Jewish civil-rights lawyer in Mississippi in 1967. This explosion killed the lawyer's two young sons and badly maimed their father. Cayhall was freed after mistrials in 1967 and 1968; for the next 12 years, Sam led a normal life until an aggressive new district attorney reopened the case.<br />The novel's main action begins a month before Cayhall's scheduled execution. Adam Hall, a first-year lawyer in a large, prestigious Chicago firm which formerly represented Cayhall on a pro-bono basis, asks to represent Sam in an effort to get a stay of execution. Adam's secret weapon in the effort to have Sam agree to his representation is that he is Cayhall's long-lost grandson.  Although Adam wants to help his grandfather, he must deal with his guilt for wanting to help someone whose beliefs he detests.<br />When Sam agrees to Adam's representation, a race against the clock begins. Grisham presents a picture of the controlled but frantic coordination necessary during the appeals process. It is literally a legal juggling act requiring split-second timing.<br />This book reads like non-fiction, with details about how the gas chamber actually works and what happens when it doesn't work perfectly. While it was not Grisham's intent to have &quot;The Chamber&quot; alter anyone's opinion of the death penalty, it will certainly cause many readers to re-examine their position.lter anyone's opinion of the death penalty, it will certainly cause many readers to re-examine their position.	2001-04-10

The nuns pray, work, study--day after day. Each nun has a specialty, a job that she does best: candlemaker, wine maker, cook, arts teacher, seamstress, gardener, etc.<br />The book begins as the lovely, elegant, 17-year-old  Mariette enters the convent to begin her probationary/postulant period. She lived nearby with her widowed father, a doctor, and we later learn that her much-older sister is the prioress, Mother Celine. Mariette's father is very much opposed to her becoming a nun. In fact, he has written a letter stating all of the reasons that she is not suitable for convent life.<br />It seems that Mariette is adapting well to life in the convent until she begins falling into trances and emerges with bleeding wounds (stigmata) on various parts of her body, wounds that cannot be logically explained. The community of nuns becomes divided in their opinion of whether these are signs from God or self-inflicted by Mariette.<br />In this book, Hansen paints a complete picture of life in the convent and the doubts that assail all people of faith. His characterizations were very well done, in the sparsest of prose, yet in great detail. The book was beautifully and lovingly written and read almost like poetry rather than prose.<br />&quot;Mariette in Ecstasy&quot; provides an examination of faith and miraculous/divine happenings. Hansen also looks at the way these happenings impact those who are &quot;blessed&quot; by them, as well as how the communities around them are affected. Hansen draws no conclusions, makes no judgments, and attains no closure. This is left up to the reader after closing the book.<br />It is hard to believe that this is the same author who wrote &quot;Atticus&quot;. Both books are excellent, but they are so very different.<br />I would highly recommend this book.	2001-03-28

It was both written and narrated by a Quaker pastor, and I would like to meet either of these men!<br />I have long been interested in the Quaker faith, although in the east, Quakers are much less organized than in the Midwest as depicted by Gulley - I have never heard of a Quaker pastor.<br />Gulley has such a wonderful way of writing about the inhabitants of Harmony - the reader certainy gets to know them well. Each chapter was a different story and all were equally enjoyable. I especially liked the ones about his anniversary gift to his wife, installing the new toilet, and the trip to the Choctaw reservation.<br />Here is one of the passages that really appealed to me. Pastor Gardner is talking about the divided food trays that are used in school cafeterias:<br />&quot;The trays were a disservice, leading us to believe the rest of life would be orderly, though it never was. They'd have been better off stirring our food together and telling us that was how the world was--mixed up and out of kilter. Instead, they had us walk in lines and didn't let our food run together. They taught us harmony and sent us forth into chaos.&quot;<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that gives them good laughs and a nice warm feeling.	2001-03-28

Nowhere in the book was Al-Anon mentioned. Even if she had chosen not to use this group, I have never read a novel about alcoholism where this is not discussed as an option for those affected by the alcoholic.<br />&quot;Hangover Soup&quot; was painful reading, especially its portrayal of Faith's ambiguity about her marriage and about Jay after the accident, the way she wavered, back and forth, and questioned herself. It is easy for a bystander to say &quot;throw the bum out&quot; but not so easy for those who are intimately involved in the situation. Faith was an addict too--she was addicted to Jay.<br />Unfortunately, I did not feel that Faith had grown very much by the end of the book...she seemed to be in the same place where she was at the beginning of the story, despite the horrible things that happened.	2001-03-23

It is also the story of the Hmong culture and the<br />difficulties encountered when its members try to navigate the medical<br />system with a seriously ill child. This is a tragedy without anyone to<br />blame--a story of ordinary people trying to do the right thing, about<br />cross-cultural misunderstanding resulting in disaster.<br />The title of<br />the book comes from the words the Hmong use to describe epilepsy--they<br />believe that a spirit grabs someone causing the person to fall<br />down. Needless to say, the medical personnel trying to deal with this<br />kind of belief system, frequently without interpreters, were often at<br />a loss as to what to do.<br />Reading this book, I realized the<br />monumental task involved in teaching Hmong refugees, who hold many<br />animistic beliefs, about our culture and technology. These were people<br />with only an average of 1.6 years of education in their native<br />country. (Vietnamese refugees had an average of 12.4 years of<br />education before coming to the U.S.). Compared to other Merced County<br />residents, 18% of whom were receiving public assistance, 79% of the<br />Hmong were on assistance when this book was written, putting<br />tremendous strain on the county resources.<br />The Hmong had to be<br />taught some of the most basic things, such as do not use the toilet<br />water to wash food; the refrigerator door needs to be closed; fires<br />cannot be built in the middle of a floor; ask before taking a<br />neighbor's fruits, flowers, or vegetables.<br />Fadiman said that, 17<br />years later, the Hmong used American appliances but still spoke only<br />Hmong, celebrated only Hmong holidays, and knew far more about current<br />events in Laos and Thailand than they did about what was going on in<br />the United States. Unlike European immigrants who had come here to be<br />assimilated, the Hmong had come here because they were resisting<br />assimilation at home--they actually came here to preserve their Hmong<br />ethnicity.<br />In the case of Lia Lee, cultural interpreters, not just<br />translators, were needed in order to have both the Americans and the<br />Hmong understand each others' cultures. Lacking this service, the<br />medical personnel in Merced, were unable to work within the Hmong<br />belief system. Our western medicine focuses on life, while the Hmong<br />believe that the sould is of equal- or more -importance. The mind-body<br />dichotomy does not exist in their culture. They see natural and<br />supernatural healing as &quot;complimentary rather than<br />contradictory&quot;.<br />I learned so much from reading this book, and<br />would heartily recommend it to others. I did not give it five stars<br />because it got a little bogged down and repetitive, at times, in<br />giving the Hmong background.ere resisting assimilation at home--they actually came here to preserve their Hmong ethnicity.<br />In the case of Lia Lee, cultural interpreters, not just translators, were needed in order to have both the Americans and the Hmong understand each others' cultures.

I would have given it a 3.5 if that rating was available.<br />I loved the theme of forgiveness of the prodigal son, but the mystery part of the story left me wanting. I wish this talented author had used a vehicle other than a murder mystery to explore the limits of forgiveness and unconditional love for a child by a parent. I feel that using this &quot;vehicle&quot; diluted the impact that the book could have had.<br />I sometimes had a hard time with the way characters were introduced and often had to page back through the book to find out what was going on.<br />Regarding Scott's mental illness: no reference was made to whether or not he got any help after the car accident. If he didn't get help, was that accident the cause of his mental problems? No mention is made of any mental illness before that incident. Another thing that was hard to understand: Without the rifle, there would be no story. Yet why would Frank give someone like Scott a rifle?<br />Hansen's description of Scott's thoughts while he was high were breathtaking. I felt as though I were in his body/mind. Very scary. A pitiful life.<br />Atticus' feelings toward his wayward, prodigal son were very close to the mark, especially in the last paragraph. How love for a person and total disappointment in that same person can co-exist is not something easily understood by a lot of people. Or how you can keep on giving someone like Scott one chance after another.<br />I found that some of the plotting was very thin and there were strings of unconnected events that had no relation to the story. Meanderings.<br />I liked the way the issues of responsibility were raised and written about by Hansen.  The reason I am glad I read this book, despite what I perceive as its flaws, is that it gave me food for thought. I think that we all need to occassionally examine our feelings about forgiveness and &quot;getting even&quot;. About how love can be healthy and/or unhealthy. About responsiblity and blame.. About responsiblity and blame.	2001-03-09

I thought it was a marvelous book, and the characters have stayed with me for months now, a sure sign that a writer has done a good job.<br />Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather have finally realized their long-time dream of starting a catering business in Dublin. They have some initial success but several setbacks, while discovering  that their business is about much more than food! It is also about publicity, placating customers, dealing with vendors, being in the right place at the right time, and knowing the right people. The reader feels for them when their agonizingly hard work does not bring about a proportional reward, and when their personal lives seem to be unravelling.<br />Binchey gives us a wonderful picture of the problems of starting up a small business and all of its attendant details. She must have done a great deal of research. She sure does know how to tell an appealing story, one that leaves the reader wanting more even after 500+ pages. All of her characters and their situations seem so real.<br />Character development is one of Binchey's strongest points. I found myself getting angered at the neglectful, self-important attitude of Neil, Cathy's lawyer-husband; feeling so sorry for the beautiful Marcella, that her life's dreams were so shallow and precluded love; and absolutely loving poor, neglected  little Maud and Simon. These children steal the show in many scenes and the things they say are absolutely wonderful. I wish I had taken notes.<br />The secondary characters are also very sharply drawn and realistic: Cathy's working-class parents with their hearts of gold and Neil's upper-class parents -his mother is such a pill!<br />Binchey has given us a wonderful and enteraining story about regular people in everyday situations, but makes it seem like so much more. She weaves their lives, loves, highs, lows, joys, sorrows, problems, and triumphs into a compete story that will captivate readers from the first page.l captivate readers from the first page.	2001-03-09

I also think he did a great job in creating the atmosphere of the monastery, its silences and its routine.<br />I read an interview with Salzman which was incredibly interesting (can I say that it was at SALON?) about how he researched this book. He developed a friendship with a prioress in New Mexico after literally stumbling upon the monastery and knocking on the door, unannounced. He said he was surprised to find her very easy to talk to and a lot of fun as well. What was particularly intruiging was finding out that Salzman is an agnostic.<br />I loved the details he included.... For example, when Sister John thinks about why there is no body on the crucifix in her cell....that this is so because she should be thinking of HER body on the cross. &quot;It had no corpus because, in spirit, she belonged there, taking Christ's place and helping relieve his burden&quot; is how he put it.<br />Now my opinion about what I consider the weak points of this book: Although this book is primarily about the internal life of Sister John, Salzman peeks at her external life but never really goes into it in any detail. I think he should have done one or the other. For example, the flagellation. It just is seemingly thrown in and never explained, so it appears bizarre - just what many outsiders would think of cloistered orders. Also, I found the other characters to be pretty one-dimensional....but maybe this was a device of the author's to focus our attention only on Sister John and her inner turmoil.<br />This book provides a lot of food for thought and discussion.	2001-03-09

The book read like fiction and was carefully detailed.  All of the medical terminology was easily understood and thoroughly explained. The authors stated that the theme of the book is &quot;the emotionally-charged intersection of SIDS and infanticide.&quot;<br />Almost all of what we have known of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) for the last 20 years was based on work done by Dr. Alfred Steinschneider in upstate New York. His findings were based primarily on two children (Molly and Noah Hoyt) who died while under his care in the early 1970s, following the deaths of three of their siblings in previous years. Steinschneider thus &quot;determined/concluded&quot; that SIDS was familial and caused by apnea (pauses in breathing while sleeping). To combat these deaths, he pushed the use of home monitors for babies who were considered &quot;at risk&quot;. His landmark paper in 1972 in The Journal of Pediatrics shaped medical thinking for the next 20 years. Yet he had used only a tiny sample and had no control group. This article and subsequent ones cleared peer review committees despite obvious flaws. He arranged facts to fit his theory over the next years. His fundamental deception/fabrication was that apnea episodes were documented in the hospital for the two children who died --but there was NO documentation!! In fact, Steinschneider had repeatedly ignored concerns of the pediatric nursing staff about the mother, Waneta Hoyt.<br />I found it incredible that a hypothesis was presented and accepted by the medical community based on only 5 cases and 2 deaths! I think this shows how desperate people were for a quick way to predict and prevent SIDS. Because of the prevalence and acceptance of this theory, Munchausen Syndrome by Prozy (when a parent, usually a mother, harms or kills a child, usually to get attention) was rarely considered when a very young child died.<br />In the next 20 years, the monitor business became a multi-million dollar business and many people got rich from it. Steinschneider himself never owned stock in any monitor company, but his research was underwritten by one of them, Healthdyne, whose fortunes then became dependent on the doctor's continuing research findings about apnea. A vicious circle! Also, leading SIDS researchers conducted seminars, which were funded by Healthdyne grants, then gave out information on monitors to the participants.<br />What particularly disturbed me was the fact that Dr. David Southall, from England, had refuted Steinschneider's theories and proven them to be false with very extensive research of his own But until the 1986 Apnea Consensus Conference, no one appeared to listen to him. This conference was the first time that Steinschneider's theory was formally investigated or questioned by an official group of his peers.<br />In the early 90s, a coincidental series of events led a district attorney in upstate NY to begin investigating the deaths of the Hoyt children. This led to the 1994 arrest and conviction of Waneta Hoyt for the murder of all five of her children. The authors make it clear that not only was the mother on trial for murder, but that Steinschneider's theory was also on trial.<br />The trial's outcome demonstrated that the entire premise for SIDS for the last 20 years was false. In the words of several prominent pediatric forensic specialists: if there is one infant death in a family, it is probably SIDS. Two deaths should be considered suspicious. Three deaths are homicide.<br />What was especially shocking to me was the information in this book about Massachusetts General Hospital's SIDS program. Mass General had positioned itselfas &quot;the&quot; place to bring babies thought to be &quot;at risk&quot; for SIDS. Yet the program, run by Drs. Kelly and Shannon, disciples of Steinschneider, was governed by a false, 20- year-old theory. The pediatric department had had a long history of ignoring suggestions of child abuse, some of it fatal, when a young doctor named Tom Truman arrived for a research fellowship in pediatric critical care. Truman secretly investigated all of the deaths of children who were &quot;at risk&quot; and found that in 155 deaths which occurred after multiple &quot;events&quot; (instances of unconsciousness, etc.), Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy was never considered, even in one family when the &quot;events&quot; stopped after the children were placed in foster care.<br />The authors said: &quot;In the Shannon-Kelly team, some [abusive] mothers found the allies they needed. In their babies, the doctors found the data they needed. Locked in this symbiosis, Mass General appears to have become a Munchausen haven, while contaminating the research of SIDS with highly dubious data.&quot;<br />I would highly recommend this book not only for its interesting subject matter but because it was so well done.

This novel is a love story in an old-fashioned sense and is also imbued with magical realism and religious mysticism that seems not at all out of place. The characters hear voices, see spirits, and the scents of roses and eucapyptus suddenly spread across an entire island! There are visions, especially of droves of butteflies and flocks of doves. One of the main characters sees laughter flying out of someone's mouth in white ribbons. The natural and the supernatural exist side by side. But this all works, and I swear, I could hear the lilting Irish voices as I read the book.<br />All of the characters are exquisitely described, even the most minor ones. We first encounter William and Isabel when they are about 12 years old, living on opposite ends of Ireland,  when both have a life-shattering event occur in their lives. We follow them for the next 10 years, waiting for their lives to intersect, knowing that it will happen.

Not only did the novelist list McCullough's book as a source, but it was recommended to me by a friend who reads a lot of American history.  This author does an outstanding job in writing the history of the worst flood in a non-coastal area of the U.S.--this book is a real page-turner!<br />McCullough relates the history of the South Fork property on which the dam and lake were located, including the purchase of this property by rich men from Pittsburgh, among them Carnegie, Frick, Mellon, and Horne. They formed the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, a mountain resort, and built a clubhouse for use by members. Sixteen members also built large &quot;cottages&quot; around the 350-acre lake that had been formed by the earthen dam which was first built between 1840 and 1850. When these men bought the property in 1879, the dam had been totally neglected so &quot;repairs&quot; were made. Unfortunately, no engineer had anything to do with these repairs, which consisted mostly of throwing junk, branches, rocks, and hay against the dam. During this time, the outlet pipes at the bottom of the dam were removed and sold as scrap. Other ingredients in  this recipe for disaster were the pipes that were put in near the dam to prevent fish from leaving the lake. These would also, it was found later, allow debris to build up and cause water to spill over the dam more easily.<br />The inevitable occurred in 1889, on Memorial Day, when a huge storm caused the lake to rise above the dam. With no outlet pipes to lower the level of the water, the water poured over the top, at the center. The dam soon gave way, allowing the contents of the huge lake to rush 15 miles down the mountain, destroying everything in its path, including the town of Johnstown.<br />When McCullough describes this wall of water descending the mountain and the destruction that occurred, the picture he painted was beyond belief. The torrent of water brought with it livestock, houses, trains, tracks, machinery, barbed wire and everything else that was in its path.<br />In the face of such complete chaos and horror, level heads prevailed. The day after the flood, townspeople held a meeting at which it was decided that a &quot;dictator&quot; was needed. Arthur Moxham was subsequently chosen and he immediately set up several committees to take care of removing dead animals and wreckage, setting up morgues and temporary hospitals, deputizing a police force (which cut out tin stars from cans found in the debris), handling finances, and obtaining supplies.<br />At 4 PM this same day (Saturday), emergency supplies, 80 volunteers, and 30 police left Pittsburgh on a 20-car train after wagons had been sent out throughout the city to collect supplies for Johnstown.<br />The next day, burials started. One out of three bodies was never identified--over 600 unknowns.<br />During this time, more trains arrived--one 11-car train from Pittsburgh contained nothing but coffins and 50 undertakers; another from the governor of Ohio was filled with tents. There were 27,000 people in the valley who had absolutely nothing, and providing for their physical needs was of paramount importance. Contributions, not including goods, eventually totaled $3.7 million, with only about $70,000 donated by the rich industrialits who owned the resort.<br />The National Guard was called in to try and keep order since thousands of people had come to help, and also to gawk. On Wednesday, Clara Barton arrived with her newly formed American Red Cross and 50 doctors and nurses. She was 67 and a bundle of energy and organization. Within days, she had organized hospital tents, hotels with hot and cold running water, and kitchens. She rarely slept and never left for five months!<br />Over 2200 people died in the Johnstown Flood and no responsibility was ever assumed by the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, and none of the lawsuits against the club was ever won in the courts.<br />This was an incredible account of a horrific event in our nation's history.sibility was ever assumed by the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, and none of the lawsuits against the club was ever won in the courts.<br />This was an incredible account of a horrific event in our nation's history.	2001-03-06

His study has been financed by a mysterious foundation. He is soon recruited by Pankratov and a gallery owner to forge paintings so that the Germans will confiscate the forgeries rather than priceless originals.  The characters in this novel are well drawn and completely believable. Watkins ably conveys their innermost thought, fears, dreams, and aspirations.<br />However, this book really dragged in places, with very uneven pacing, epecially the time leading up to when David was recruited to do the forgeries. I thought he would never get started!<br />Another complaint is that I had expected to read much more about painting--the works, how the forgeries were done, and so on. There was some information about these aspects, but not nearly enough. In my opinion, too much time was spent leading up to this part of the book.<br />I did learn a bit from this book, especially about some little-known activities World War II France.

I am so glad I did. Although I have been cooking for many years, this delightful little book gave me lots of hints and tips, as well as often making me laugh out loud. I regard it more as a book of kitchen essays than as a cookbook, although I think any cook could benefit from the recipes, variations, hints, tips, and reminders it contains. Many of Childs' original recipes have been simplified for this book, but this does not appear to have compromised them.<br />One of the nicest things about &quot;Julia's Kitchen Wisdom&quot; is the attractive layout and its wonderful index. Someone above mentioned this also. I am very appreciative of a good index in any book - and this one sure made the book easy to use.<br />I also loved Julia's pithy quotes at the beginning of each chaper--I could just hear her saying them, breathlessly. Her wording in some of the recipes is droll---when describing how to make an omelet, she instructs the reader to &quot;jerk the pan towards you&quot;, &quot;bang on the handle with your fist&quot;, and &quot;spear a lump of butter with a fork&quot;. No formal language here! She really endeared herself to me when she said that she uses an aluminum Wearever pan for her omelets.<br />The great photos, taken over many years, brought back good memories of Julia Child's weekly shows.	2001-02-22

I think that it was fine as an abridged audio but might have been tedious if it were any more wordy. As it was, there was enough of the narrative and description to tell a very complete story.<br />This story -- of Walter McCloud, his family, and his close friends -- was an intimate view into how the tragic death of a young person can have long-lasting and far-reaching effects on everyone who knew him. Yet the book does not become overly focused on the death or the dying in itself, but rather on the feelings of those who lived through it and on how they dealt (or did not deal) with it.<br />The story moves back and forth from Walter's teenage years in the 70s to his life in the 90s at age 38 when he takes a job as a teacher in a tiny Wisconsin town. His time there allows him to  reflect on his teen years when his brother was dying, when he was studying ballet hoping to be a star, and when he found his first love, Mitch.<br />I thought the book had very strong characterization, and even in this abridged form I felt a connection to the characters and their motivations.	2001-02-20

I highly recommend it.<br />This story takes place in Verity , Florida, where more divorced women live than in any other town in Florida. Verity itself is one of the characters, it seems: hot, sultry, sweat-soaked. Hoffman's descriptions make you feel the unrelenting heat, see the ripples of heated air, and hear the insects buzzing lazily in the humid air.<br />There are many wounded souls in Verity, among them Bethany Lee, on the run, with her baby girl, from a custody battle; Lucy Rosen and her 12-year-old son Keith (referred to throughout the book as the meanest boy in Verity), who seems to hate everyone and everything; Julian Cash, the unusual police officer who has become a self-styled expert at finding/tracking people with the aid of his two dogs; and the Angel, Julian's cousin, a ghost who lives near a tree in front of the Burger King.<br />I love Hoffman's unique vision and her descriptions. One should not read her books looking for solid reality/realism. Nor should her books be read by those looking for a hyped-up story.  She lets her characters' actions speak for them in a way that allows the reader to feel their pain and anguish---and their hope. We see the light within each character.<br />As always, Hoffman mixes realism with fantasy &quot;...he cried so hard that when he finished there was a pile of tiny pebbles at his feet&quot;. Or &quot;The air all around the town limits is so thick that sometimes a soul cannot rise and instead attaches itself to a stranger, landing right between the shoulder blades with a thud that carries no more weight than a hummingbird.&quot;<br />I loved this---Lucy's thoughts regarding her son: &quot;There is, after all, strong brown soap for poison ivy, iodine for cuts and bruises, mud for bee stings, honey for sore throats, chalky white casts for broken bones. But where is the cure for meanness of spirit?&quot;<br />A memorable book!	2001-02-18

Although this was a good story with excellent narration by Lynn Redgrave, this abridged audio tape was ultimately unsatisfying to me. It was hardly the bare bones of the story. So much was cut out that it was difficult for me  to understand the motivations for many of the characters' actions. And I really never knew what most of them were feeling.<br />I think that the Airds and Balestrinos probably were really interesting and multi-dimensional people in the book, and I am sorry I did not meet them there!<br />&quot;September&quot; is a story of love, love lost, and love found.

Yet seemingly, to the outside world, it is a perfect life. Job, money, fiancee....all are Celeste's but she still must drink to get through each day.<br />When Celeste meets Alex, a real smoothie, she thinks that she has at last found someone to take care of her, to keep her on a straight path. Afraid to end up alone with no financial resources, she precipitously enters into a relationship with him.<br />She finally (after many pages of angst) realizes that she has mistaken order for control---and Alex is also abusive. Looking to find someone to bring some order to her life, she has &quot;settled&quot; for the controlling Alex, and finds that she does not really know who he is after all. Nor does she know who she is.<br />This was a &quot;so so&quot; book. I get annoyed when characters continue downward spirals for as long as Celeste did. I was mentally screaming &quot;enough already!&quot;. I also found parts of it to be incredibly repetitive.	2001-02-10

If anyone had ever told me that I would read a book like this and sympathize with the mistress, I would have laughed. But this is just what happened, and I was totally surprised at my reaction. I guess this is the mark of a good writer--one who ccauses you to see something from a new and different perspective.<br />From the minute Judge Guy Stockwell makes his stunning announcement that he is leaving Laura, his wife of 40 years to marry his long-time mistress, emotions run rampant in the Stockwell family, but not necessarily in the ways you would expect. His revelation is like a large rock dropped into a small puddle-- the ripples are huge.<br />I think that Trolloppe is a master of character development--the characters were so well drawn and so fleshed-out. These people came to inhabit my home for several days and I came to know them quite well.<br />I am glad I finally got around to reading this talented author.	2001-02-10

This was the second novel of Trollope's that I read, and I thought that the characters in &quot;The Spanish Lover&quot; were not as fleshed-out nor as believable as those in &quot;Marrying the Mistress.&quot;<br />Or perhaps I just should not have read two of Trollope's books in a row. Maybe I expected too much of this book.<br />The author uses the device of grownup twin sisters to compare and contrast their lives. The two women, Frances and Lizzie, are very different. When Frances takes a married Spanish lover, the book becomes not just the story of her romance, but the story of how Lizzie deals with it, and what happens to her life as a result of her twin's affair.<br />The ending was a bit too pat and predictable, but all in all, the novel was fairly enjoyable and quickly read.	2001-02-10

She is so good at this! (the only disconcerting thing I found with the tape was the random bursts of overly dramatic music. They seemed so out of place--inserted with no apparent thought given to what was occurring in the narration).<br />That said, I thought this story was lovely, typical Pilcher fare. One can be pretty sure that all the loose ends will be tied up, that the lost will be found and the bad dealt with in a most genteel manner.<br />I always appreciate the period details in Pilcher's writing and this was no different. The reader always learns something when reading her books. She manages to entwine historical facts in with a family story in a seamless fashion.<br />This is the story of Judith Dunbar and in a secondary way, that of Loveday Carey-Lewis, including all of both families (dysfunctional, functional, and in-between!). Covering the years of 1935 (when both girls were 13) through the end of the Second World War, this book was large in scope and in its portrayal of its many interesting characters.<br />Pilcher does a great job of character development - the reader is quite easily able to identify with the characters who populate this book. The genteel British lifestyle, despite the looming war, is lovingly portrayed.<br />I agree with the reviewer who thought a sequel would be interesting.	2001-02-09

The Mulvaneys - parents Mike and Corinne, children Mikey Jr., Patrick, Marianne, and Judd - to all outward appearances led an almost-charmed life on their farm near a small town in upstate New York. Mike owned a successful and well-established roofing company and Corinne managed the sometimes-raucous household with love,humor, and determination.<br />It took a while to get into this book, since the revelation of the background of this complex family went on for so long before any real action occurred. Although hinting of impending disaster, Oates, in a departure from her usual style, also wrote many descriptions of the normalcy and happiness of the Mulveneys, giving us a  glowing view, seen through rose-colored glasses. Marianne was the *perfect* child, Mike Jr. was the hero, Patrick the brilliant one, and Judd was the baby.<br />After more than 100 pages, the real story begins when a terrible event in 1976 shatters their 'happy' lives. This event is the catalyst that tears apart Corinne's fantasy family and negatively impacts each member in a different way. Her husband, overwhelmed by anger and pain, lets his business slide, drowns his sorrows in alcohol, and alienates his friends while  the children follow varying paths to cope (or not cope) with their grief and rage.<br />Spanning many years and following the roundabout route that brings the characters to their present plight, the book examines many ideas of the 50s through the 90s and looks closely at the changing American dream through these years. Oates writes with deep feeling on many themes, especially forgiveness. As a reader, I became intensely involved with the characters, their tragedy, and Oates' excellent writing.<br />While exposing the fragility and temporary nature of life as we know it, this challenging novel makes you care about the Mulveney family and get involved in the complexities of their lives.the complexities of their lives.	2001-02-01

In a panic, she signs on to a cancer message board and then e-mails Susan with her many questions and fears.<br />The book traces the correspondence between these two very different women whose common problem allows them to find strength in and through each other. Lara's search for a definitive diagnosis is a revealing look at the frightening and startling scenarios that face women with this disease.<br />This is an uplifting story of friendship in the face of adversity, offering insight into the turmoil of a cancer diagnosis. The author, a breast cancer survivor herself, has written a book that every woman should read. She includes a good list of breast cancer resources at the end of the book.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about this terrible cancer and read a story of a great friendship and caring.	2001-01-27

After a night of heavy rains, the South Fork Dam had  broken, sending 20 million tons of water crashing down the narrow valley into Johnstown. Carrying huge chunks of debris, the wall of flood water was as high as 60 feet, moving  downhill at 40 miles per hour, destroying everything in its path.<br />In this mostly character-driven novel, the author manages to intimately acquaint us with many of the residents of the area and those who were visitors. In fact, she has managed to produce somewhat of a social history of that time and place. It is obvious that Cambor has done extensive research because, as the reader, I felt that the great attention to detail really put me into Johnstown in1889 as she set the stage for the disaster that was to come.<br />The South Fork dam which burst was below the site of a &quot;gentlemen's club&quot;, The South Fork Hunting and Fishing Club, started by many of the wealthy industrialists of that time who lived in Pittsburgh (Frick, Carnegie, Mellon) and used by them as a mostly summer getaway.<br />Fourteen miles up the Little Conemaugh River, on whose banks Johnstown was built, a three-mile long lake was precariously held on the side of a mountain - 450 feet higher than Johnstown - by the old South Fork Dam. The dam had been neglected and poorly maintained, and every spring there was fear that the dam might not hold. But it always had, and the supposed threat became something of a standing joke around town.<br />Many residents of Johnstown knew of the terrible condition of the dam, as did some of the visitors, but their attempts to draw attention to the problems and the potential for disaster were in vain. It appears that the people who lived in the area just assumed that those of privilege and wealth took good care of the property, very much an assumption of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; which never really happened.<br />The author makes it clear that those of wealth, the patrons of the club, were the &quot;bad guys&quot; who had no interest in the people who lived below the dam....they were only concerned with the little world they had created in the mountains. They had bought the abandoned reservoir, minimally repaired the old dam, dangerously raised the lake level, and built cottages and a clubhouse in their secretive retreat. There was no question about the shoddy condition of the dam, but no successful lawsuits were ever brought against club members for its failure and the resulting deaths.<br />Cambor manages to bring these people and the fictional town residents to life by relating their personal histories like one would peel back the layers of an onion...slowly and cautiously, revealing parts of their pasts in succeeding chapters. As a reader, one comes to really care about these people and what happens to them-- Frank Fallon, a Civil War veteran, and his family; James Talbot, an attorney for the club, who visits yearly with his wife and daughter; Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon, leading industrialists of the era; and many other residents of this doomed area.<br />She also manages to make the dam itself one of the characters in this book, describing it as a &quot;great, organic giant....fed by mountain springs and streams that coursed through layers of the earth like arteries through limbs.&quot;<br />The words of the title come from haunting and foreboding lines in a Maeterlinck play &quot;I have been watching you: you were there, unconcerned perhaps, but with the strange distraught air of someone forever expecting a great misfortune, in sunlight, in a beautiful garden.&quot;<br />All in all, despite knowing the outcome, I would recommend this book for its wonderful writing and style, and its glimpse into history.assumption of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; which never really happened.<br />The author makes it clear that those of wealth, the patrons of the club, were the &quot;bad guys&quot; who had no interest in the people who lived below the dam....they were only concerned with the little world they had created in the mountains.

I do remember thinking how lightweight and sterotypical the characters were and how much I disliked Lily, the &quot;Accidental Bride&quot;. She was a total wimp!<br />There were no shades of gray in this book, just stark black and white contrasts between the inhabitants and lives of those in (barely disguised) Cleveland and those in New York City. The author's antipathy for Cleveland and its (in her words) provincialism made reading this book very difficult--- and I have no love for that city.<br />The best part of this book was the short parody that Lily wrote called &quot;Martha Stewart Dead&quot;.<br />All in all, forgettable.	2001-01-09

Despite his exasperation with his sister's behavior, Ashmol does his best to find her invisible friends and to help her recover from her mysterious but desperate illness.<br />Although small in size, this book gives the reader a great deal of information about Australia and about opal mining, using authentic vocabulary and the artless, wry, and down-to-earth  voice of the young Ashmol. This young man is wise beyond his years in the way of life lived in the opal-mining area of Lightning Ridge.

I bought a copy for myself and one for my daughter, then went to sit on a bench overlooking the ocean to read it.<br />This tiny gem of a book contains many thoughts that are just common sense until you see them written down. Then they become points to ponder, to think about and mull over in your mind and heart. Which is exactly what I did after finishing...I sat and looked out at the sea, thinking about what I had just read.<br />Much of the text of this book was part of a commencement address that Quindlen was to give at Villanova. She released the speech after she cancelled and I have been told that it was so well-received that she was asked to put it into book form.<br />This is a book to savor and to read over and over again and to give as a gift to a loved one. I plan to return to the bookstore  to buy several more copies.<br />Some of the thoughts in the book:<br />On life: &quot;there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living. But you will be the only person alive who has sole custody of your life. Your particular life. Your entire life. Not just your life at a desk, or your life on a bus, or in a car, or at the computer. Not just the life of your mind, but the life of your heart. Not just your bank account, but your soul.&quot;<br />On being a mother, a wife, and a friend: &quot;I show up. I listen. I try to laugh.&quot;<br />On being charitable and good to others: &quot;if you do not do good... then doing well will never be enough.&quot;<br />And on living for today: &quot;I learned to love the journey, not the destination. I learned that it is not a dress rehearsal, and that today is the only guarantee you get.&quot;<br />Quindlen talks about leading a balanced life and not making work one's entire focus--she says &quot;you cannot be really first-rate at your work if your work is all you are.&quot; and &quot;Don't ever confuse the two, your life and your work.&quot;<br />Her thoughts on mortality, which Donald talked about in his review, are powerful-- and applicable to all of our lives.<br />I certainly think Quindlen herself is a first-rate writer and thinker, and thank her for the valuable lessons in this book.r />Her thoughts on mortality, which Donald talked about in his review, are powerful-- and applicable to all of our lives.<br />I certainly think Quindlen herself is a first-rate writer and thinker, and thank her for the valuable lessons in this book.	2000-11-04

How fortunate these students were to have been able to read and discuss this with others! I have had a long interest in Van Gogh and found this book to be fascinating, an almost voyeuristic look into his short life. I am glad to see that it is available * *  and would hope that people now seeing the traveling Van Gogh portraiture exhibit might read it.<br />De Leeuw has compiled letters covering over 25 years of Van Gogh's life, letters that offer the reader an intimate look into the artist's thoughts and emotions. He writes about his friendships, his family, his attempts at love affairs, his religious beliefs and questions, and most importantly, about his art. These  letters reveal him as anything but the anti-social person often portrayed in the past, with the ones about  his relationship with his brother Theo being particularly touching.<br />Van Gogh was a prolific correspondent and an absolutely wonderful writer. His prose is remarkable--he could have been a writer as well as an artist. These letters shed light on the inner thoughts and the inspiration for his art and show him as a person of great passion and compassion.	2000-11-02

She knew of my interest in art and thought I might enjoy the book, and I certainly did!<br />Beck opened up new vistas to me, of which I had little knowledge. He writes of the art and the politics of restoring great works of art, and of the options which should be considered before restoration is done. His opinion is that, many times, the restoration destroys the original painting, for all intents and purposes.<br />An example he gives is what happens to the halos in paintings. We have all seen paintings with halos over certain figures. In the old original paintings, these halos are seen as airy and light, almost ray-like. When restored, Beck compares them to heavy golden plates sitting atop the heads of the figures in the painting.<br />Upon finishing this book, I realized that it left me with as many questions as it answered regarding the need for and methods of restoring great works of art. I also realized that there are as many differing opinions on this topic as there are museums. It seems that the best course in some instances might be no restoration at all. Although I now feel almost more confused about the topic than when I started the book, I will always have an interest in reading about it.<br />I find it interesting to visit the Art Watch International home page (which Beck founded) to be brought up to date on current restoration proposals.

What a guy! Within the first three pages, I felt Mirabelle's desolation and loneliness. Just the title: Shopgirl. So old fashioned --no &quot;sales associate&quot; or other fancy title.<br />The reader immediately got a sense of the hand-to-mouth existence Mirabelle was leading due to this almost dead-end, low-paying job at Nieman Marcus. I was touched by the sentence about the one thing she really wanted: &quot;someone to talk to&quot;. Later in the book, Martin made her paralyzing depression so very real to me that I could feel her desperation and clearly imagine her hitting bottom, emotionally.<br />Here's a *Martinism* I loved...he calls Beverly Boulevard a &quot;chameleon street&quot;. Very clever choice of words. Here's another: &quot;One man stands in the kitchen of a two-million dollar house that overlooks the city, and the other in a one-room garage apartment that the city overlooked.&quot;<br />Mirabelle's relationship with the elusive and wealthy Ray Porter is played out in this short but ultimately satisfying novel, proving that a good author can tell a complete story in only 130 pages. Mirabelle and Ray dance around each other, both misinterpreting the nuances of the relationship. While I felt sorry for Mirabelle and her less-than-ideal life, I also felt sorry for Ray. He was the real proof of the cliche that &quot;money cannot buy happiness.&quot;<br />I would highly recommend this book. If you have any chance to read or listen to any of Martin's interviews, they will enhance your enjoyment.	2000-10-27

The book takes place in the tiny, isolated village of Quediro, New Mexico, where embroidery is a religion, especially to those who are called &quot;inheritance embroiderers&quot; with their patterns passed down through the generations, whose work can sell for as much as $20,000.<br />Rose Devonic has lived in Quediro all of her 29 years, but she is an outcast, essentially homeless, and has never been accepted by the townspeople. She refuses to abide by the unwritten rules, doesn't go to church, and will not cater to the tourist trade . She learned embroidery later than most because she had spent her early years helping her uncle with his Indian carvings. For the last 13 years, since her family was killed, she has lived in a motel in the winters, helping out the owner, Birdie, in exchange for having him teach her embroidery. Despite her desire to be independent, we sense in Rose a yearning for acceptance by those in the town.<br />Every one of the book's characters are fully fleshed out-and developed---I felt that if I met them on the street I would recognize them! The relationships that exist in Quediro are written in a believable manner and the tapestry of the community is portrayed in a way that allows the reader to see all of its complexities and differences.<br />Hendrie has written a moving, lovely, and complete novel. I cannot wait to read her next.	2000-10-20

He writes sci-fi to make money, and is depressed at the thought that he might never again write something to equal his first book.<br />On an impulse, Jay leaves his girlfriend and London and purchases, sight-unseen, an old house in a rural French village where he thinks he can change his life and conquer his writer's block.<br />After reading &quot;Chocolat&quot;, I had high expectations for Joanne Harris' next book. Perhaps that is why I was so disappointed by &quot;Blackberry Wine&quot;.<br />As charming as her first book was, this one was just plain tedious with a lot of dark undercurrents that I did not like. It is a shame that the author did not just somehow stick to the stories of Jay, Joe Cox, and the village of Lansquenet and forget about the magical wine. I thought that if I read about those silly bottles clanking together and *speaking* to Jay one more time I would scream!<br />The book could have been so appealing to me had it been organized differently. I really loved reading about Joe's magic with the herbs and seeds that he saved for many years. I felt that the magic realism was very clumsy and almost seemed like it was tacked onto the book--and the love story was pretty awkward too.<br />As much as the magic realism worked for me in &quot;Chocolat&quot;, it did not spin its same spell in this book.	2000-10-20

Fielding adeptly takes the reader into their heads and hearts as each of them struggles with the knowledge of what is ahead and how they will handle it.<br />This author is able to give the reader a good interior view of all the characters and what motivates them to act the way they do, especially their childhoods. The secondary characters are not as well fleshed out, in my opinion-- Mattie's mother and Honey Novak, in particular.<br />Somehow this book did not have the flow that her previous works have had, but it was still a good read. Having had a friend who died from ALS, I would say that her research on this awful disease was fairly good.<br />One thing that bothered me was the use of expensive brand names (this is a particular sore spot for me).Do we really need to know that Mattie's sofa was Ultrasuede or that she drank Evian water?<br />On the whole, however, this was a fairly good read, but not nearly as affirming a book about a disease as was &quot;Traveling Light&quot; by Katrina Kittle.	2000-10-16

Cathy Crimmins has taught us all a lesson in this book.....that life isn't always as we had thought it would be and that we must be proactive in order to change it.<br />When her husband, Alan, a successful bank attorney in Philadelphia, suffers a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in an accident, his life and his family's lives change forever. Crimmins takes us through the extensive rehab process which she handles with both tears and laughter. As a reader, I found myself experiencing feelings of anger, hope, sadness, and joy at the smallest improvement in her husband's condition and at the smallest victory over the system.<br />I could not believe how much I learned from this book. It should be &quot;must reading&quot; for everyone who works with brain-injured patients and also for all of those insurance company &quot;voices on the phone&quot; who make life and death decisions based on very little information, and with very little empathy. I learned about something called &quot;perseveration&quot; which is when a brain-injured person repeats an action or phrase over and over and over again. I also learned that with brain injuries such as this, inhibitions disappear, which means that socially inappropriate behaviors are often displayed. Crimmins also made the reader understand why these patients and their families become so frustrated. I could fill pages with what I learned.......<br />I read this book in one day and a friend who was visiting me read it the next. I then passed it on to my daughter who also read it in one day and then recommended it to her neurobiology professor who thought it was outstanding.

Nervous and suspicious after the arrival of a beautiful newcomer, Batsheva, in their midst, the women of the community react in various ways.<br />Batsheva is from New York, a convert to Orthodoxy when she married Benjamin, a member of Memphis' Jewish community . After he was killed in a car accident, she decided to move to Memphis with their daughter, Ayala, so the young girl could be brought up in the same community as her father was.<br />At first the community is intruiged by Batsheeva and her different ways. She is hired to teach art at the girls' high school and befriends many of her students. But when the girls become just a bit too independent and Batsheva is seen with the Rabbi's son Yosef, the suspicious women begin to blame many of the community's problems on her.<br />With their fear of the outside world and of non-conformity, the Ladies turn against Batsheva, the stranger in their midst. What follows is a latter-day witch hunt.<br />This book was narrated in the first person plural, which was very interesting and effective, as if the narrator spoke for the entire community of women. Mirvis did a fine job of explaining the rituals and customs of an Orthodox community and making the reader see both sides of this story. Especially interesting was that, although the men held the positions of authority, it was the &quot;steel magnolias&quot; of the Ladies Auxiliary who really ran the community. The men were rarely mentioned in the book and even Yosef, the rabbi's son, was hardly a well-developed character even though he played a major role in the book. I am sure that Mirvis did this deliberately, to show the great influence of the women.<br />The author has created an excellent depiction of the conflicts between this community and one of its members who wishes to remain an individual.	2000-10-08

She has been sunk in the depths of misery following her husband's desertion, and doesn't even open her mail. Colonel Behrani, formerly an officer in the Shah's army, buys Kathy's house at auction, for a fraction of its actual value, but a price that takes all of his savings. He sees the house as a way out of his job as a &quot;garbage general&quot;---spearing trash on the side of highways--and an entree into a world of real estate investing and respect within the Iranian community.<br />Kathy is forcibly moved out of her house and becomes involved with the sheriff's deputy, Lester, who served her eviction papers. All Kathy wants is her old life and her house back and all of her actions from this point on are directed toward that goal.<br />The stories of the Colonel and Kathy converge, with Dubus presenting both sides of this dilemma in a way that leaves the reader feeling that both parties are in the right in their desire for a decent life and a decent place to live. Unfortunately, both cannot win in the situation as it exists , and the plot moves toward disaster.<br />I found this book to be very well written--Dubus carefully reveals the characters' flaws as well as the flaws in the system without ever making a judgment. I found myself having very strong feelings about these characters, always a sign of good writing.<br />I would highly recommend this book, probably one of the most powerful novels I have ever read.	2000-10-01

As one reviewer said...\\"the family you are born with and the family you make\\". With well-developed characters, the book explored some larger-than-life ideas.<br />Summer is a former ballerina, injured and no longer able to dance, who is called home to Ohio to help care for her brother, stricken with AIDS. The story begins as he enters the final months of his life. He, his life partner, Summer, and a young nursing student who lives with them become a family in every sense of the word.<br />Kittle's depiction of the course of the disease and its aftermath are so authentic that the reader soon realizes that the author  must have had some personal experience with a fatal disease.<br />This is a most worthwhile book.	2000-10-01

I looked his other books up at Amazon and he certainly writes on a wide variety of topics--and does a tremendous amount of research.<br />&quot;Archangel&quot; was one of those books that made you feel as if &quot;you were there&quot;. It was a page turner in the best sense of the word, a story of eco-terrorism and so much more! An excellent book, thought-provoking and one that taught me quite a bit.<br />In a tiny town in the northernmost part of Maine, a logging company owner is racing to cut as much forest as possible before more restrictive laws go into effect. An environmental terrorist named Gabriel (the &quot;archangel&quot; of the title) appears to try and thwart this effort, and then a &quot;gun for hire&quot; is brought in to try to stop the terrorism. There are quite a few grisly scenes, including the one that opens the book, but the scenes *fit* the story---they are not merely gratuitous.<br />The forest was not the only victim in this story, and Watkins has an uncanny ability to make the reader feel for every character, even the bad guys.<br />The unfolding of events, which all began with a cover-up of a safety problem, spirals into tragedy for many people.<br />I am looking forward to Watkins' next novel, &quot;The Forger&quot;, due out shortly.	2000-10-01

I felt that it lacked the immediacy of Perrotta's  earlier books, and I really did not care as much about the characters. Perhaps this is because I did not think that they were as fleshed-out as the characters in his other books.<br />Despite this, &quot;Joe College&quot; was a worthwhile book to read. Danny's inner monologues are very well done, as is the contrast of his life at Yale with his parents' and Cindy's blue collar lives in New Jersey. The details of college life are very accurate and authentic, pulling the reader right into Danny's on-campus and home life.	2000-09-29

American author Carrie Brown has done a masterful job of portraying life and love in a small English village far removed from the hustle and bustle of London.<br />Brown has populated her novel, set in 1969, with a cast of endearing, lovely, yet &quot;odd&quot; characters. Norris Lamb, 55, the village postmaster, falls in love with Vida Stephen, the 41-year-old caretaker for Manford Perry, a young man who is both mute and retarded. Vida has cared for Manford for 20 years in the absence of his wealthy American father, who travels most of the time.<br />How Norris falls suddenly in love with someone he has known all his life is told in loving detail by the author. This is a slow, engaging, delightful book without the silly conflicts or sickeningly sweet narrative of modern romances.<br />The way in which Vida cares for Manford, and her fears, compassion, and aspirations for him, are portrayed in a totally captivating manner. When Norris becomes a part of their lives, you will be touched by his actions toward both Vida and Manford. Norris' bumbling attempts at love are so endearing. As he said to himself:&quot;I have a gift for being in love, but there are technical difficulties&quot;.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2000-09-29

After 44 years of marriage to the late Wesley Lloyd Springer, a pillar of the church and of his community of Abbotsford, North Carolina, his wife Julia receives a shock when his long-time mistress, Hazel Marie Puckett, appears on her doorstep. Hazel is off to beauty school and intends to leave  her son, Little Lloyd, in the care of Miss Julia, after explaining that the young boy is Wesley Lloyd's son. Not that Julia doubts her--the boy could be Wesley's twin minus 60 years!<br />After her husband's death, Julia had found that she was his sole beneficiary, much to her surprise since he had such a low opinion of her abilities, financial and otherwise. What was even more surprising was the size of the estate. Now a rich woman, Julia was looking forward to enjoying her life in style when the presence of Little Lloyd turns that life upside down.<br />Faced with a whole new set of problems, Julia, with the help of two female and two male friends, struggles through and becomes stronger and more assured. She is the Southern Steel Magnolia personified. After finding that most of the town knew of her husband's affair, she not only takes the boy into her home, but acknowledges him as her late husband's child.<br />Julia runs into problems with her minister, who wants her to give the church a large chunk of the estate or he will have her declared incompetent, and with a relative of Hazel's who sees the boy as a source of money, even if it means kidnapping him. With the help of her friends, she attempts to defeat these connivers.<br />Ann Ross has a good eye for the details of small-town southern life and the social rules that exist and govern that life and her *voice* is very authentic. She lambastes all the pillars of society: the government, the ministry, marriage,and the legal system. The book is enjoyable and fast-paced, a comedy of manners and mistakes with a cast of off-center characters.	2000-09-22

It is a lovely story , beautifully written and composed, with a touch of mysticism. Vianne Rocher has seemingly magical powers when creating chocolates in her shop, and also when she affects the lives of the people in the small French village into which she has settled with her young daughter.<br />I bought this book last year during Lent, which plays such a large part in the book. It is when Vianne goes head-to-head with Father Reynaud and the power of the Catholic church as he administers it. I especially liked the way Vianne quietly defused Reynaud by just being her gentle self.<br />The author competently tackles the issues of spousal abuse, prejudice (social rather than racial), religious intolerance, and the problems of the aged, both mental and physical. Yet the book is never preachy.<br />The life in this village was so old fashioned and quaint that I was jarred back to the present day when things like computers and laser-eye surgery were mentioned. It was seemingly taking place in another time.	2000-09-22

Even though she is uneasy, Julie, a divorcee trying to keep her own florist business afloat, accepts.<br />Both Julie and Romeo have grown children, totally immersed in this family feud and dedicated to seeing that the growing relationship between their respective parents ends. Sparks really fly when Julie's  ex-husband and Romeo's 90-year old mother start meddling, along with other family members.<br />Delighted by this chance for happiness, Julie and Romeo try to neutralize the opposition within their families, not an easy task. Their relationship just adds to the already fiery family vendetta.<br />Ms. Ray portrays her characters with understanding, poignancy, and humor, showing that love and passion are not exclusively for the young . Ray's work is full of sharp understated wisdom.<br />The novel gets funnier with each chapter and each situation that occurs. The scene in the CVS store where the couple has their awkward first &quot;date&quot; so as not to arouse suspicion, is hilarious, as is the scene in the cold-storage locker at Romeo's store.

Jim the Boy is a coming-of-age story -- a year in the life of a young boy living in  Depression-era rural North Carolina. He is being lovingly but firmly raised  by his widowed mother and his three bachelor uncles. This book is  remarkable in many ways, among them for what it does NOT have: abuse,  dysfunction, and angst are totally missing from this book.<br />Earley, a  professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, has been published in  several magazines and is also the author of a book of stories, &quot;Here  We are in Paradise&quot;.<br />Although the story is told in the voice of a  child, it is never cute, just straightforward, honest, and plain. There are  no convoluted sentences, no literary \\"tricks\\". Instead, the author has  written a universal story, a children's book for adults that tells a  complex story in simple language and style.<br />Jim Glass is having his tenth  birthday as the book opens. He lives in the small town of Aliceville with  his mother, and nearby live his three unmarried uncles whom Jim considers  to be his three fathers, his young father having dropped dead in a field  the week before Jim was born. These five individuals are a contented family  unit, close and committed to each other, with the uncles sharing the  paternal responsibilities. The adults do a fine job of guiding Jim and  giving him worldly experience in the small doses that he is able to handle.  Jim knows that he is a fortunate young man who lives a fairly carefree  life, and he never dwells on what could have been.<br />  Jim's tenth year is  a year of firsts: his first trip to the ocean, his first best friend, his  first baseball glove, his first encounter with a bully, and his mother's  first suitor. He also has to deal with the anxiety of starting at a new  school and the threat of polio. Looming just over the horizon, up on a  nearby mountain, is Jim's moonshiner grandfather who will have nothing to  do with him-- he became estranged from Jim's father when he left the  mountain to marry Jim's mother.<br />Several parts of this book will stay with  the reader long after the last page is turned: the letter that opens the  book, the description of the trip to the ocean, and the story of how the  town was named, among others.<br />This will not be the last that we hear  about Jim Glass.

This moving book, about the  disintegration of a marriage and its aftermath, will touch all who read it.<br />Sam deals with the end of her marriage in a scattershot way: looking for  reasons, spending lots of money, trying to figure out what to do, and  generally flailing about, emotionally. But the reader comes to understand  why, thanks to Berg's wonderful writing. This was the reaction of a woman  has no idea what will happen next, when all the things she has thought  would come to pass suddenly are no longer a part of her future.<br />The  reader observes Sam as she takes in boarders to help pay the mortgage, has  a succession of temp jobs, and begins dating again. At the same time, Sam  is going through the grief process, trying  to heal herself emotionally in  order to get herself to a better place.<br />I found Berg's humor much more  apparent in this book than in any of her others. I laughed out loud when  Sam sat down at her sewing machine and sewed up the fly on every one of her  husband's boxer shorts! Her characterizations -- of her son, her mother,  and the boarders -- were excellent.<br />Had I not read any other Berg books,  I probably would have given this a &quot;5&quot; but I don't think it was  quite as good, nor as moving, as &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; or  &quot;Pull of the Moon&quot;.	2000-08-31
