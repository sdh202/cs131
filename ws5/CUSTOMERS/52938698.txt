But books on the immigrant experience in America are popular nowadays, and Bodies in Motion is a welcome addition to the bookshelves. For the most part, however, the themes are not new. Characters protest against arranged marriage, women yearn for more freedom and education, husbands want old-fashioned and docile mates, American culture seduces with insincerity, etc. <br />A good book with some exquisite writing, but Mohanraj might do well to have spent a little longer trying to dig deeper, past the familiar and already been there, done that. <br />	2005-07-12

I was blessed with a first child that was born to nurse and taught me everything I needed to know about breastfeeding. He was single-mindedly determined to nurse for 20 out of every 24 hours. Everyone thought I was crazy, but it was the only thing that truly kept him happy. He nursed while I slept, nursed while I went grocery shopping, nursed while I brushed my teeth, nursed while I ate dinner - and didn't mind when I dropped spaghetti on his bald head. If he was nursing, he was content, and so was I. <br />Lu Hanessian's book is a thought-provoking confirmation and affirmation for those of us who bucked lots of resistance in various areas of child-rearing, taking our cues from our babies, trying what seemed to make sense, and sticking with what worked, no matter what flack it caused among those peripheral to the immediate family. Babies don't manipulate their parents; they don't even know the word for such a concept. But babies know what they need. It's too bad they have to waste so much energy trying to convince some of us to just slow down and listen to them. <br />	2005-07-12

The widow and the artist begin an affair, and the daughter and one son begin a...well, something!

They only make it to Ishawooa, Wyoming, where Jean grew up and married Griffin, Griff's dad, who died in a car accident before Griff was born.  <br />Einar, Griffin's angry old father (angry cuz he blames Jean for the death of his only son), reluctantly takes them in, and Jean begins working at the local restaurant. <br />Griff falls in love with the ranch, the old man, his Vietnam War buddy Mitch who's been nearly killed by a grizzly, and with the sense of permanence that she's been lacking all her life - and she's determined not to leave. <br />Good story-telling, good writing, good characters, good book. <br />	2005-01-27

This is a MUST READ book	A Midnight Clear is a stunning, poignant, passionate paean to the futility and tragedy of war. The setup is 6 very young, very bright US soldiers sent on a reconnaissance mission to a chateau deep within the Ardennes Forest in France in December 1944. Use of symbolism deepens the book's meaning: the men (read \\"boys\\") play chess and bridge (without cards) with deadly passion, one is called Mother because of his mother-hen neatnik qualities, another is called Father because he's a devout Catholic who left seminary cuz he didn't think he was good enough. Their leader is Wont (his name is William Knott, AKA Will Knot, AKA `will not,' thus: won't, usually shortened to Wont), a kid recently promoted to sergeant who hasn't had time to sew his stripes on yet. <br />So they're in this abandoned chateau in the middle of this isolated forest, burning furniture to try to keep warm, and the dialogue and situations are hilarious and horrible, but mostly hilarious...but this is a book about war, so you know bad stuff is going to happen. Reading the first  of the book, you feel kinda guilty laughing, cuz in the back of your mind, you're wondering which and how many of these kids are going to die. <br />Then they realize there are 6-8 Germans nearby, and their fear is palpable - until it becomes clear that the Germans are just as young and scared as they are, just as sick of war, and even more importantly, the Germans know they're about to lose the war, and they want to surrender. <br />The denouement, when it comes, occupies no more than perhaps one single page, maybe just a couple of paragraphs, and the rest of the book becomes a weird, tragic, very believable mythic, religious, mystery play/metaphor sort of thing with the kind of events and writing that keep you riveted to the last sentence. <br />Highest possible recommendation. I swear it'll eventually become a classic. <br />	2005-01-27

Leonard downplays the grisly, horrific details of this, but we can tell it has changed Terry in some fundamental way. When his uncle dies, he sort of assumes the priest alb and carries on in his stead for something like 5 yrs, hearing confessions, giving penance, and occasionally even saying Mass. <br />He comes back to the states, still playing the priest, and meets up with Debbie Dewey, the usual lovely you'll find in Leonard's books, only this one just got out of jail for assaulting her ex with a Ford Escort and wants to be a stand-up comic focusing on prison humor. Hello? I mean, you can't make this stuff up! But Elmore Leonard does. <br />They team up to pull of a scam, and things of course go awry - and that's all I'm going to tell you. <br />Read it.

A friend whose opinion I respect recommended this book to me, and I simply couldn't put it down.  <br />At first, I couldn't see the connections between the various \\"pieces,\\" and I thought perhaps I was reading a collection of loosely woven together short stories. But no. The Feast of Love is a novel, all right, and a spectacular one. Essentially, the characters are connected by their relationships within a small coffee shop, and we get to know them thru their interactions with each other in small but very poignant vignettes. And we inevitably grow to care deeply about them. <br />Baxter's book explores many facets of love: passion, infatuation, loss, idealism, old age, parent/child love, etc. Much of it is touching and intense, but must is also very, very funny - I mean, laugh out loud hard enough to waken a sleeping spouse kind of funny. <br />This is a masterful piece of fiction; don't miss it. <br />	2005-01-24

Her book is ostensibly set within a single year, but that's only the framework for the series of essays that form a beautiful chronicle of the seasons of one's life, the seasons of nature, the seasons of tame and wild animals, and the seasons of living on a farm. <br />Her inquiring mind constantly asks \\"Why?\\" questions, and the essays are her attempts to answer them. She's a former librarian, so she's articulate, academic, intellectual - but also quietly hilarious, such as her description of trying to think like a chicken in order to coax her hens to sleep inside the coop instead of perched on the trees. <br />Buy a copy for yourself, and buy one for your best woman friend who is heading into her middle years and may also be Living the Questions. <br />	2005-01-22

Harriet Doerr cheated herself and her readers by not devoting herself to the craft of writing much earlier in her life. She's best known for Stones for Ibarra, but I think Tiger in the Grass is her real masterpiece, and Consider This, Senora comes in second. However, all 3 of her books are excellent and demonstrate a respect for the craft of writing the perfect sentence that readers will appreciate and writers can all learn from. <br />Consider This, Senora is a collection of chapters focused around a small town in central Mexico where several expatriates come to live on a mesa above the dirt-poor town. It's written so carefully that each chapter can actually stand alone as a complete tale, but taken together they form a history of 6 years of life in both the village and on the mesa. We grow to care about them all: the padre, the mayor, the beggars, the income tax cheat, the man-chaser, the widow, the pianist, the beautiful 14yo serving girl, all of them. <br />Luminous and insightful, filled with beautiful language and the perfect turn of each phrase, Consider This, Senora, is a masterpiece. <br />	2004-10-08

I've probably read this book 3 times, listened to it on audio tape once, and read it aloud while on a car trip. What can you say about such a powerful and classic book, a book that has come to be symbolic of the Jazz Age with all of its excess and smarmy decadence? The enigmatic and subtly evil Jay Gatsby, self-made man and millionaire, and his passion for Daisy, the wife of the man who lives across the bay from him, are at the center of this novel, which is told from the point of view of Nick, an occasional guest and neighbor on East Egg, who is able to tell the story, eventually, with some degree of detachment and cynicism. There is the inevitability of a Greek drama to the cadences and pacing of The Great Gatsby, a tragedy lying in wait for all involved.<br /><br />Exquisite and spare prose, tight plot, and wonderful characters. It's as good as a novel gets.	2004-08-02

She just gets better and better, and she started out being very good indeed. For me, The Blind Assassin is her most accomplished book. Most of her books have a bit of mystery at their core, and this is no exception. The Blind Assassin is a spellbinding family saga set against the backdrop of WWI, the Depression, and Communist witch-hunt persecution, but those over-arching themes are played out within the tragedy of one family, the Chases. <br /> The matriarch of the pathetically shriveled family is Iris, and she's dying from a heart ailment. Much of the book is told as her recollections back to the wartime suicide of her enigmatic sister, Laura. There's a parallel story interspersed through the main story, and it is the posthumous publication of Laura's novel, &quot;The Blind Assassin.&quot; <br /> There is weirdly sci-fi back-story woven throughout, a plot concocted between a couple between their bouts of lovemaking, and it becomes apparent that the young man is in hiding for political reasons. But even with plentiful clues strewn throughout, it takes a while (maybe halfway into the book) to begin to figure out all the many layers of this complex and mesmerizing literary work. There are flashbacks, flashbacks within flashbacks, distorted memories, flights of fancy - and only a writer of Atwood's consummate skill could keep a handle on all this stuff and have it make perfect sense by the end. <br /> Fantastic! <br />	2004-07-30

Amy Tan's multi-layered family tale is set against the backdrop of her mother's progressive Alzheimer's and the confusion of past with present that is a recurring and ever-worsening problem for both the mother, Lu Ling, and her daughter, Ruth. Much of the tale is told through a series of journals Lu Ling kept when she was a young woman in China, and the comparison between her situation then and now is poitnant. <br />Not quite The Joy Luck Club, but very, very good. <br />	2004-07-30

Their purpose is to patch things up. Vivi was far from a perfect mother, but when the Ya-Yas (the girlfriends) bring a scrapbook chronicling 7 decades of friendship and family history, Sidalee begins to see the bigger picture. <br />There's a huge cast of characters (most of them females and all of them Southern), but author Rebecca Wells manages to make each come alive as distinct, individual, and wholly memorable. <br />A real tour de force.

She is 37, unmarried, and filled with a quiet caustic rage that overflows occasionally into determined action. She is also an expert, thanks to her Inuit mother, on the properties of snow and the significance of tracks left in snow. <br />Smilla is befriended by a pitiful child, Isiah, and the novel begins with the discovery of his body on the ground below a 7-story building, from the roof of which he apparently fell. But Smilla isn't so sure. For one thing, he was afraid of heights. For another, it appears that a needle biopsy of his leg muscle was taken after his death. But most of all, there are his tracks, only his, in the snow, but Smilla can see his panic, his running, his fear in the properties of those tracks. <br />Smilla is nothing if not determined, and she embarks on a quest to discover the truth behind the child's death, a quest that nearly costs her her own life. <br />Excellent, nail-biting suspense and powerful, literary-quality writing.

Diagnosed at 9 years of age with Ewing's sarcoma, a potentially fatal cancer that attacked her lower jaw, she underwent disfiguring surgery and horrific chemo and radiation that further distorted her appearance. She used, in this memoir, her experience as a springboard from which to soar into passionate examinations of the meaning of truth, beauty, genius, love - all those biggies - and she did it with stunning success. Her background as a poet shines through each paragraph of this seminal book. <br />But. <br />Then she died, and although her death was ruled accidental, it's clear she had been on a steady downward spiral through the last couple of years of her life. Ann Patchett's stunning and conflicted story of her 20-year friendship with Grealy (Truth and Beauty) uncovers the raw underbelly of Lucy Grealy's personality, her unending quest to be special, first, best, and most of all, lovable.  <br />To get a fuller picture, one that I feel still isn't quite complete, of this quixotic individual, it's imperative that readers of Grealy's book also read Patchett's.  <br />	2004-07-28

I perceived Lucy Grealy as brilliant and probably charismatic, but also I perceived her as needy, whiny, manipulative, demanding, self-destructive, and manic. What I couldn't understand was why so many talented and brilliant people seemed to be captivated by (or in captive to) her. So it was with the anticipation of being enlightened that I gobbled up Ann Patchett's book, Truth and Beauty. Patchett and Grealy were roommates and best friends from their post-graduate years at the Iowa Writer's Workshop, and Patchett probably knew her troubled friend better than anyone else.    But rats. Now that I've finished the book, I still don't get it. I just plain do not get it. Why did Patchett allow herself to be used, abused, and confused by Lucy Grealy?? Is Patchett someone who needs to be needed? Maybe, but that doesn't explain the hundred other people in Grealy's life who jumped when she said Jump. I mean, she called Patchett at 5 AM from her hospital room and demanded apricot nectar. I know what I'd do if a 'friend' called me with that request. But what did Patchett do? She got out of bed, shopped all over New York till she found some apricot nectar, took it to Grealy, watched her drink it down, then held her head as she threw it all up. And this was not an isolated example; there were a thousand others of equal outrageousness.    Go figure.    Truth and Beauty is a beautifully written book - but it sure doesn't answer the central question of Why.	2004-07-28

They are caught in a particularly nasty storm off the coast of Alaska - they bail, and their boat sinks, along with the fish they've caught. Those fish were part of the reason for their dilemma: the boat was too heavy, rode too low in the water, and wasn't as maneuverable as it would otherwise have been.<BR>There's a dramatic Coast Guard mission of rescue (those guys are either truly crazy or lifetime adrenaline freaks), there's lots of past history involving women (Well, duh!

I'm a writer myself, and when I read, I look for energetic dialogue that moves the story forward, fast pacing, evidence of good editing, the ability to tell a story without losing one's audience, and, in a book such as The Last Run, the earmarks of true creative nonfiction: telling a nonfiction story using the techniques of fiction to enhance the reading experience. Todd Lewan does it all. <BR>Kudos.	2004-07-17

Circumstances force them into even closer proximity, however, when, through a series of events, they end up sharing housing in Dina's small apartment. <BR>A Fine Balance, a finalist for the Booker Prize, tries to explain that happiness can be achieved, at least temporarily, through striking a fine balance between hope and despair.

Winner of 6 Canadian literary awards, author Anne Michaels constructs the story, set in post-Holocaust Poland, of a 7yo boy's journey to healing and redemption via the age-old power of love - but not conventional love, this time. No, it's love for an old man and for ancient botanical history.<BR>The story begins during the war when Jakob, the protagonist who has recently seen his family murdered by Nazis, is discovered by a Greek geologist who spirits him off to Greece and hides him till the end of the war. There Athos, the Greek, helps Jakob recover from his psychic wounds by teaching him about the flora and fauna of ancient eras.<BR>A stunningly beautiful story that leaves a powerful afterglow.	2004-07-16

The deterioration of the city is paralleled by the physical condition of an elderly professor with Parkinson's disease. Set against the horrors of overcrowding, family secrets, tensions between the various family members, Mistry fully explores the tightrope walk that constitutes just getting through life for most people in the world - yet he does so with humor, tenderness, and a haunting feeling of love.	2004-07-16

He's quiet, unassuming, and intensely private, revealing himself to readers thru bits and pieces revealed in a series of letters to the wife he abandoned years ago. These letters accumulate in his desk drawer at the Hearst home. There are other chapters, some told in 1st person, some told in omniscient 3rd person, a few in the point of view of other characters, that round out the story of Christian's complicated past lives in Iceland and New York. It is frequently difficult for readers, at the beginning of some of these chapters to tell exactly who is speaking and what point in time is being related. While this is initially confusing, it adds, ultimately, to the mesmerizing, dream-like quality that allows readers to feel they are being carried along, floated along, on the sad, guilt-ridden narrative. <BR>Very loosely based (via a series of journals and letters that came into the author's possession) on Hearst's real-life butler, the story is peopled with real people and narrates real events in their lives, all seen thru the remorseful eyes of the butler.<BR>Excellent, excellent, excellent...	2004-07-09

The authors were all formerly affiliated with Chez Panisse, and it shows.<BR>César, a tapas bar/restaurant, was an instant success. The cookbook will be, too. The only downside for some readers will be that fully one half of the book is devoted to cocktail recipes; that same feature will be a huge upside for other readers. The second half of the book is recipes for the tapas, little Spanish dishes that are meant to be ordered with drinks and shared with friends. They're not hard - I've already met with high success with 3 of the recipes, esp the artichoke recipe!!! - but many require ingredients that aren't going to be easy for someone living in East Podunk, Nebraska, to find at her local A&amp;P. However, you can get the stuff online at [...] - or, if you're lucky enough to live 3 minutes from Berkeley as I do, visit The Spanish Table on San Pablo Ave.<BR>This is a cookbook for the experienced cook with a sophisticated palate who wants to treat her guests to a few things they've probably never tasted before.<BR>For the right audience, highest recommendation.	2004-07-05

I suppose it all began with Angela's Ashes. Some of them are mediocre, some are terrific. A Son Called Gabriel is one of the better-than-average ones, and it's author Damian McNicholl's first novel. Kudos.<BR>Set in Northern Ireland between 1964-1978, it follows the struggles of Catholic Gabriel to overcome all the many barriers tossed in his path as he strived to fit into not only his conflicted community but also his family.

With gorgeous language, soaring metaphors, and utterly engaging characters (primarily a missing child, a pregnant teenager, and a disillusioned drug dealer), he weaves a rich and varied tapestry of memories, pain, and a search for redemption in a small Midwestern town. There are ghosts of haunted pasts that bring the characters, maimed both physically and spiritually, to the brink of irredeemable tragedy as their paths converge. <BR>Constructed in the newly popular but not always successful technique of fragmentary flashbacks into times of an indeterminate past, You Remind Me of Me is sometimes confusing, always engaging, and forever memorable.<BR>Highest praise.	2004-07-05

The book is composed of those writings, as well as some from her sister and a friend, who are in New York living the high life.<br />Clara's quiet life in a small Canadian town (read: everyone knows your business and makes it theirs) is shattered when she takes a walk at dusk: she is raped by a drifter, gets pregnant, goes to her sister Nora in NY, and has an abortion. Returning to Canada, she picks up her life as tho nothing happened.<br />Then she meets a married man in a movie theater and becomes his lover. The story of their affair and its aftermath occupies the last part of the book and is the framework for Clara examining her past, her options, and her future.<br />An elegant and quiet book, and a very, very deep one with a heartbreaking Prologue.<br />Definitely worth a read, and don't hurry thru it; it demands some pondering.	2004-07-05

Not. It's set in Chicago. But I'll also wager that they won't regret their purchase. Adam Langer's book is epic in its sprawl and its sometimes insane attention to detail and the minutiae of his characters' lives, but it spans a period of only 2-3 years (1979 - 1981). Focusing primarily on the members of 3 families who live on one side or another of California Ave, the street that divides a Jewish neighborhood into those of the upper middle class from those of the mostly working class, the book allows us to see all aspects of that important time in America's 20th century through the eyes of a group of teenagers who come together, drift apart, and come together again in a different mix.<BR>Really, really, really, really good.	2004-07-04

Chick lit/romance based on grieving	What an unusual premise for a sweet little romance to take off from: our heroine is in her thirties, recently widowed after only a few years of marriage. It's difficult to make profound grief funny, but Lolly Winston manages it in spades. There's an especially funny scene in which Winston keeps the point of view and voice and tone that of Sophie,  her grieving narrator, while she's coming completely unglued (showing up for work in her bathrobe and slippers, scarfing down carbs and sweets - hot dog buns with honey! - and talking in gibberish). In writerly terms, this is called Your Basic Crazy Unreliable Narrator, but Winston holds it together just long enough for the poor woman to be packed off to a shrink.<BR>Somewhere between quitting her job and being fired, she takes a leave of absence in the interest of mental health, treks off to pretty Ashland, Oregon, and begins, improbably, to try patching herself together by becoming a volunteer Big Sister to a very angry pyromaniac teenage girl - not the most sensible choice, but what the hay: it's a romance novel, after all.<BR>And, right on cue, in comes Mr. Wonderful.<BR>Happy ending, eventually, of course.

It's part psychological horror, part espionage, part mystery, part coming-of-age, part character study - and it's splendid. <BR>Set in 1954 in Berlin, before The Wall was built, it's the `true' story of the construction of a secret spy tunnel so the Brits and the Americans could spy on the Russians, whom they no longer trusted. Much to his surprise, Leonard Marnham, an extraordinarily innocent and nave British postal technician, is recruited to participate in this top-secret operation. A virgin at age 25, Leonard falls in love with a pretty German divorcee, and his initiation into the pleasures of a sexual relationship follows. The couples becomes engaged, but their world collapses into macabre horror on the night of their engagement party. The 80-plus pages that follow this horrific event are gruesome and spell-binding at the same time in a way that only a superb writer could possibly handle.<BR>The ending, leap ahead 30 years to 1986, feels a bit contrived and distanced, esp after the intense and personal material that's just been revealed.<BR>At its best, it rivals Pulp Fiction and Fargo for explicit shock value. At its worst...well, it doesn't have a `worst.' It's really, really good.<BR>But: Ian McEwan???? Who knew?	2004-06-18

Germs hadn't been discovered yet, and the idea of washing their hands between doing an autopsy and delivering a baby was anathema to physicians, who strongly resented the implication that they were in any way `dirty,' or that they themselves were the cause of the deaths of between 20-50% of women under their care. Ignaz Semmelweis, an unknown Hungarian obstetrician, concluded that a procedure as simple as hand washing between patients could save nearly all of the women's lives.<BR>He was reviled, sank into despair and depression, and died of self-inflicted puerperal bacteria days after being admitted to a madhouse.<BR>Neuland's superb book updates a much older book on the same subject, The Cry and the Covenant. It documents beautifully an almost forgotten piece of medical history, as Semmelweis's discoveries were later eclipsed by Pasteur and Lister (who had the simple advantage of living after the discovery of the microscope).

There's no through line, no sense of logical progression from beginning to end, no real character growth. Gillespie is Gillespie at the beginning, and she's the same Gillespie at the end of this 279-page ride - but still, it's a fun ride. <BR>This is a perfect book to leave on the bathroom counter for a few days. The chapters are short, short, short, probably designed to be read aloud on a quickie NPR spot of 2-3 minutes duration. Each is complete within itself, so it's easy to put the book down at chapter's end. The next time you pick it up, you'll probably flip through and begin reading at a different section altogether.<BR>This totally irreverent (the title might give you a clue that the author is not a disciple of the religion of Political Correctness), raunchy, bawdy, silly, over-the-top collection of essay-ettes provides lots of giggles and a few moments of honest epiphany.	2004-06-10

The book is told from the point of view of Fowler, an aging British journalist. Fowler's beautiful but opportunistic Vietnamese mistress, Phuong (who is herself a metaphor for the country itself), is coveted and for a while, claimed by a seemingly innocuous American named Pyle.

What happens is that, right as their relationship is probably about to break up, the guy dives into water that's too shallow and is paralyzed. What will his girlfriend do?

It's worth reading to find out, but the book dives deeper than just this superficial plot line.

A tale of New Orleans Creoles	When I visited New Orleans for the first time a few years ago, I took a walking tour of the Garden District that included Ann Rice's house (complete with black limo outside). I also noticed small outbuildings that were referred to as `garconierres.' When I questioned their purpose, I was told that boys were housed away from the main house in order to sow their wild oats in private. They were encouraged to eat, drink, be merry, take mistresses, and generally get the devilment out of their systems before adulthood and the need to marry, begin a family, and take over their fathers' businesses became expected of them.<BR>The Creoles played a large part in this aspect of New Orleans society, and our tour guide said the best novel detailing all the permutations of Creole life was this one, Ann Rice's The Feast of all Saints. So I bought it.<BR>Like all of Rice's books, it's overly long and wordy: I understand it's part of her contract with her publishing house that they will not edit out or change one single word of her manuscript as submitted. That's a shame, because I feel this would have been a better book if it had been a shorter book. I found myself skimming whole pages in places.<BR>Nonetheless, it's a terrific 19th Century story of the gens de couleur libre, or the Free People of Color who were destined to be a distinct race caught between two worlds: slaves and owners. It was the Creole women who frequently became the mistresses of the white men. Descended from a mixture of races including African, French, and Spanish, they played (and continue to play) a unique role in the history of New Orleans.<BR>At its heart, The Feast of All Saints is a coming-of-age story of Marcel, the child of a Creole woman and a wealthy, white plantation owner who has promised to send him to Paris to complete his education when he comes of age. It's also the story of Marcel's younger sister, who could pass for white; his mentor Christophe, another free person of color, and a few othersof his friends. It's a story of struggle against alienation and of complex, intertwined relationships.<BR>It deserves slow and careful reading, for it's rich with detail and passion - but man, it sure is loooong and repetitive in many places.	2004-06-04

Larry, a former TV soap opera star who is sliding into the sleazy world of porn flicks in order to earn some much-needed money and salvage his dissolving marriage, is the more gregarious, outgoing brother. Alec is the shy and bumbling one who has never really left Mum, working as a translator and being jealous of his successful brother. He's presently at work translating a play by Laszlo Lazar, a Hungarian exile who's living the good life - but is haunted by his betrayal of comrades during the 1956 uprising when he was a member of an underground group of activists. Laszlo's parallel story, in which he's given an opportunity to atone for his past, runs alongside that of the English family and intersects it in odd ways.<BR>Shifting between several locales - England, Paris, California, and Budapest - the author manages to hold it all together to create characters we really care about, even when they are not behaving well to each other. At the back of it all is Alice, watching while she's dying, and it's agonizing to live the story thru her eyes. This is a wise, warm, painful, and utterly engrossing novel.	2004-06-04

Thank god for the salvation of a good book!<BR>It's difficult for authors to write about sex. Most of the time, they come off sounding either like a Victorian maiden or a sly pornographer.

It's absolutely beautiful writing.<BR>The central story is Elizabeth's, a girl with parents both frustrated by their own demons. Tragedy is something they can't cope with, and soon Elizabeth find herself living alone and going rapidly downhill in a small town on the coast of Maine. She falls into the arms or clutches (depends on your viewpoint) of a much older man, an architect from New York.

Allesandra, at 16, yearns to be an artist; in order to secure the `freedom' that can only come by leaving her protective home as someone's wife, she agrees to an arranged marriage to elegant 48yo Cristoforo, tho she loves the tormented and nearly voiceless artist her father has hired to paint a family chapel with murals. Cristoforo promises her complete freedom, but it comes with a price tag that she doesn't learn of till her wedding night.<br />Outside her cloistered world, chaos, madness, intrigue, and torture hold sway over the Florentines; they have come under the power of Savanarola, a mad priest eager to see sin in the glimpse of an arm or the lift of an eyebrow. Risking all, Alessandra draws closer to her suffering young artist - and there's soon hell to pay. <br />But all this is merely the central story.

He makes me jealous of his talent	I'm a writer, and occasionally I write a sentence or paragraph - or even several pages, now and then - that I think read quite well. But then, when I read the writing of someone like Normal Maclean, I consider throwing in the towel in recognition of the fact that, no matter how long I try, I'll never write that beautifully. <BR>Of course, the title story in this rather small book, A River Runs Through It, is known to the majority of literate people in the US, and not just because of the marvelous movie made from the novella. But this book has other stories as well. Maclean used his teenage experience working for logging operations and the US Forestry Service as the foundation for a couple of the other loooong stories included in this collection. And, get this: even the Acknowledgments section is worth a careful read; it reads like another essay, in itself.<BR>Normal Maclean, to me, seems to have some of the attributes of E. B. White, specifically the ability to take something concrete and mundane, like fly fishing or packing mules for a 3-day walk into the Montana mountains, and, with the lyricism and beauty and skill of his writing, make it soar into the ethereal world of Universal Truth.<BR>Don't believe me? Read it and see for yourself.	2004-05-08

Max sneaks up on you and grabs you good	The Book Lust lady says to subtract your age from 100 and if you're not engaged in a book after than many pages, set it aside and start another one: there are too many books one must read to waste time reading one you just can't get into.<BR>Well, if I'd followed that advice, I'd have quit reading Max Tivoli at about page 40. I loved the writing, but I thought the story idea (a child who ages chronologically with regard to emotions and mental capacity, but who lives life in reverse: born old, he becomes progressively younger and is destined to die as an infant in 1941) far too contrived and ridiculous to hold my attention thru a whole book. It smacked of sci-fi, a genre which I don't read.<BR>I was wrong. On approximately page 41, I was captivated and held in thrall thru the rest of the book - and sobbed sloppy tears at the end.<BR>Max falls in love at about 16 (when he looks like an elderly man) with 14yo Alice - and she is destined to be his lifelong love. Alice becomes his wife when they are both in their 30s, and it's the only time in his life that Max's real age and apparent age are in synch. But the marriage ends and they go their separate ways. Then, 20 yrs later when Max appears to be a boy of about 12, circumstances arrange for Max to become Alice's son and the brother of his own son.<BR>Throughout this convoluted tale is Max's lifelong friend, Hughie, who sees thru to who Max really is and accepts him as just Max - but there's more, much, much more to this story. The meaning of the memorable first line, We are each the love of someone's life, becomes crystal clear about  thru the book, and then it's repeated again just a few pages from the end, just in case you somehow missed it. A simple chronicle of the events in this book does not begin to do justice to the brilliance of the writing, the heartbreak of Max's situation, and the beauty of the awkward, delicate relationships - hinted at in that opening line - which must be kept in perfect balance for thisall to work.<BR>And it does, oh how well it does.<BR>Don't miss it. And if, like me, you're not in love after 40 pages, just trust me: Keep reading.	2004-04-30

Clustered around centrally located Chez Panisse Restaurant are many small stores and purveyors of specialty items, and these stores have become iconic, synonymous with Good Quality Food. They began in the 70s with The Cheese Board, Bruce Aidell's Poulet, Pig by the Tail, and of course Alice Medrich's Cocolat, dangerously close to Black Oak, a terrific bookstore.<BR>During an era when most of us knew nothing more about chocolate than whether our preferences ran to milk chocolate or dark chocolate, when Hershey's ruled the chocolate-loving country, Medrich opened the eyes of the small nation of Berkeley, CA, to the eye-popping and palate-pleasing enchantments of Really Good Chocolate. French, Belgian, Swiss, German...and we all said Wow! More, please!<BR>In Bittersweet, Medrich acknowledges that we, her devotees, have grown up in our taste appreciation, so these recipes offer sophisticated (but definitely not daunting) information about cocoa bean content and such things that alter the outcome - how one can `play' with the composition of different chocolates to achieve a desired result.<BR>Those of us who drifted into her store on Shattuck Ave. all those many years ago can now create some of those memories of yesteryear right in our own kitchens.<BR>Superb addition to the library of a serious and sophisticated chocoholic.	2004-04-28

A Can of Peas was a delight, and so is Dandelions in a Jelly Jar.<BR>This time around, it's Trudy Ploog who comes to town and shakes things up like snow in a Santa paperweight. When the school board messes with her art program, Trudy doesn't act like a sweet, small-town girl: she brings some of her big city fighting skills with her and creates a little tempest in a teapot. This creates some stress between Trudy and her hometown boyfriend, Bert and the rest of the Morgan family.<BR>There's nothing terribly deep here; just a sweet tale of rural life, faith, hope, and courage.	2004-04-20

It's all Holocaust material. This one is technically a novel, but it so closely follows the author's concentration camp experiences that it's best to read it as if it's autobiography. Like Wiesel, his main character in Night is a piously religious teenager who, having survived the genocide that obliterated his family, suffers survivor guilt.<br />There are no easy answers in this hard-to-read book, but it marks Wiesel's first step in his lifelong goal of bearing witness for those who died.	2004-04-17

After a rather shaky beginning, Kingsland settles down to a slower pace, pulling readers into a lush background tale of her parents' life in India during the era of the Raj. When Partition forced them back to England, her father was devastated by the change in their circumstances and comforted himself with women and writing poetry. Her mother became agoraphobic in defense - until their fortunes were changed by their improbably huge winnings in a football pool, which allowed them to move from the provincial Cornwall into London.<BR>The episodes surrounding her relationship with Burton, when he was a stage star and she was a star-struck, infatuated 14yo schoolgirl, are written with insight that can only be gained by the passage of all the intervening years.<BR>Charming and evocative coming-of-age memoir.	2004-04-17

She heads to a shrink - who promptly falls in love with her and transfers her to another shrink rather than deal with the conflict of interest between patient and doctor. <br />Then comes job conflict, a muckraker who tries to dig up garbage on celebrities, upon which hinges sort of a trick ending.<BR>Pretty good, but not Flagg's best.	2004-04-17

Superlatives aren't powerful enough to describe this book by Harriet Doerr. I read Stones for Ibarra, liked it a lot, so rented The Tiger in the Grass from the library as an audio-book to listen to during a long car trip. Halfway thru, I was exclaiming out loud (all by myself in the car), `OMG, this is soooo good!' I liked it light years more than the Ibarra book, even. As soon as I got home, I bought a used copy on Amazon for 50 cents plus the usual postage, etc.<BR>The first section of this lyrical, oh-so-beautifully written book is a loose memoir, a collection of impassioned memories that she wrote down for her children. She was already old when she published Ibarra, and I believe she was in late 70s or maybe her 80s when she wrote this one. <BR>The rest of the book is composed of short pieces that are ethereal essays or somewhat longer semi-autobiographical short stories, vignettes of people she knew while living in Mexico - but all of them rise so far above the usual stuff we read that it's difficult to describe how powerful they all are, once gathered together. It's like, the individual parts are terrific, but put together, the whole is 100x greater than the sum of its part.<BR>There's one story, I think it's called Low Tide, and it's a lovely memory of a day at the beach in 1939. The author is an adult with young children, but there's a hint of evil somewhere lurking - then we realize it's the rise of Nazism when the hamburger seller comments about bad times coming and `that German paperhanger.' At the end of the story, Doerr comments that she wanted time to stand still long enough for her to paint and frame Low Tide, a metaphor for peace and innocence. Lord, I get goosebumps all over again, just trying to paraphrase it for this review.<BR>Buy it. Read it. Give it as a gift. Then read it again yourself, and again. <BR>Wow.	2004-04-14

Told by Will Tweedy, a 14yo child whose Grandpa Rucker forms the spine of the novel. The story begins with the death of Grandpa Rucker's wife, a saintly woman beloved by all, and there's a lovely scene of Grandpa asking his grandson to cut all the roses from the garden and help him stick them into burlap sacking to make a blanket of roses under which to bury his wife.<BR>After that touching scene, readers - not to mention family members and townsfolk and church people - are shocked to find Grandpa marrying Miss Love, the town's young and beautiful milliner less than a month later. And it's suspected that Miss Love has A Past.<BR>A beautiful coming-of-age story unfolds as Will becomes the confidante of Miss Love and his grandfather, and he learns life-changing lessons about love, life, death, and the meaning of true reverence, and the smallness of some minds.<BR>Wonderful, memorable characters, wonderful life lessons, wonderful set pieces.

McEwan's superb skills illuminate the lives of his characters, who have come together in the rescue of a little boy at a picnic, with clarity, compassion, and insight, and you care about every one of them. <BR>It's hard to write a mad character without descending into caricature, but McEwan succeeds so thoroughly that, as the inner thoughts of all the characters are revealed, including the madman, readers find themselves wondering, Who is right? What is the `real' truth?	2004-04-05

Should be read together	From the age of 4, Beryl Markham lived in East Africa and spent her childhood with native Maruni children as her only playmates. She was there during the same era as Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), author of Out of Africa, and reading these two books together gives a lyrical, poetic, and heart-full-of-love picture of the Africa they both knew. But it wasn't only Africa they loved; they both shared a passion for the same men: Bror Blixen (Dinesen's husband) and Denys Finch-Hatton (Dinnesen's lover), so, inevitably their paths collided at times.<BR>Although Dinesen is more well-known and respected as a writer compared to Markham, better known as an adventurer, Markham rises to heights of poetic imagery and her writing style was praised highly by many other writers of her era, including no less than Ernest Hemingway.	2004-04-03

Nagib Mahfouz won the Nobel Prize (the first Arab author so honored), popularized the craft of the novel in the Arab world, and gained worldwide fame - and it all started with Palace Walk, a good old-fashioned family saga that follows 3 generations in the extended middle-class al-Sayyid Ahmad family in Cairo at the end of WWI. <BR>Palace Walk was the first introduction many of us in the Western World had to what it was/is like for women living in the Arab nations, their cloistered, uneducated, persecuted, and insular existence - but it also points up the power they are able to wield from their miniscule pedestals.<BR>Best portrayed, however, is al-Sayyid himself, a man who lives by conflicting tenets: he gives voice to living by the Koran, but he is a bon vivant man-about-town in Cairo's night clubs every night, rules the women of his family with an iron fist, and terrorizes his sons.<BR>Start with this one, and if you like it, then move on to Palace of Desire and Sugar Street.

In Cleopatra's Sister, she introduced us to two people who meet when their plane makes a forced landing in the fictitious country of Callimbia in No. Africa. Fear and terror in hostile surroundings up the odds for our lovers, Howard and Lucy, as well as for the other passengers, and the story soon becomes a delicious Third World satire. Howard is a paleontologist; Lucy is a journalist. But neither finds their training of much help when they find themselves being held hostage by Callimbia's maniacal leader.<BR>Highly recommended, esp if you like Lively's other stuff.	2004-03-29

Moon Tiger is her most well-known novel, but the others deserve equal attention.  <BR>In Heat Wave, Lively aims her magnifying glass on Pauline Carter and her married daughter. It starts out as a quiet story, set in a summer cottage in England's bucolic countryside. But with each turn of the page, the tension increases and increases...and increases...until the stunning conclusion just knocks your socks off. At it's base, it's a story of romance. Pauline is editing an allegory of romantic love while watching her daughter, Teresa, struggle with the romantic side of her married life, after realizing that her son-in-law is conducting an affair right under their noses. <BR>About midpoint, you think you know where this book is heading. You would be wrong. Lively, in all her books, is fascinated with the conflict and difference between what is real and what appears on the surface. The serenity of the countryside is offset by the violence of the natural world; the appearance of romance is threatened by cynical adultery; love is marred by jealousy.<BR>Don't miss this book; it's one of her best.	2004-03-29

However, that's not what it's advertised to be, and it's not the aspiration of the author to compete with the writers of great literature. For how it came to be (a collection of emails to friends and family during the 8 months the author spent teaching English in Kosovo), this book more than meets its goal.<BR>Paula Huntley went to Kosovo with her husband, who volunteered for an ABA project to help set up a new legal system for the new war-torn country. She took a crash course in teaching English as a second language and, once in Prishtina, Kossovo, quickly found a job teaching the language to a classroom of eager and charming Albanian students.<BR>The book begins as Huntley's story but quickly evolves into being the story of the country and its inhabitants, specifically those who were blessed to be her students. Like volunteers everywhere, Huntley quickly learned that she was gaining and receiving far more than she was giving, in terms of compassion, understanding, insight, and personal growth.<BR>It's not `literature,' but it's sure a terrific little book. Don't miss it. I learned a whole, whole lot about a part of the world about which I have very little knowledge.	2004-03-25

Debra Weinstein's book, Apprentice to the Flower Poet Z, is a painless way to learn a bit about the intent, construction, deconstruction, and composition of poetry - and at the same time it's a scathingly delightful skewering of the academic world of poets.<BR>I began reading this book with skepticism and reluctance (it was a gift), but Weinstein's catty, breezy, self-revelatory style of writing quickly won me over - and I raced toward the conclusion with a grin on my face.<BR>Set-up: a young poet accept a position as assistant/apprentice to a well-known poet/teacher and quickly is absorbed into the woman's artifice, dishonesty, and her weirdo family/lover relationships.<BR>This satirical book pretty much defies classification; just read it on faith.

Written as a novel, there's no doubt it's Duras' own tale of her love affair when she was just a 15yo in Indochina in the 30s, one of three children of a disturbed and impoverished English widow who was trying to make ends meet as a teacher. Her daughter, Duras, was left mostly to fend for herself at a boarding school that was unusually permissive with the odd comings and goings of this precocious child-woman.<BR>Duras tells this story from the distance of years, through a technique of oblique references, forgettings, reiteration, repetition (the straw hat, the dress, the shoes...), fractured images, and readers get the sense of coming at what happened reluctantly, as tho the author is a little unwilling to share everything with us.<BR>It's a mesmerizing, seductive, atmospheric, overlapping, strangely detached story - one that readers will not soon forget.	2004-03-25

Cold Mountain, from a feminine perspective	Adair Colley is an 18yo girl on the lam during the waning months of the Civil War. She and her family have been routed from their rural home by the Union militia, divided, some have maybe been killed, and when she's falsely accused of being a confederate spy, she's incarcerated in a prison for women in St. Louis. There, Major Neumann, her interrogator, falls in love with her, and she with him. He advises her to `go over the wall' and promises to find her back in her little home town when the war ends.<BR>The last two thirds of the book relate Adair's `adventures' as she struggles to return to her home. Occasional chapters are devoted to the trials her lover faces as he works his way through the remainder of the war, gets discharged, and begins looking for her once again, but mostly, this is Adair's story - - - and it's terrific. Well-researched, with many quotes from letters, dispatches, and diary entries of the period, Enemy Women gives a feminine perspective to the Civil War.<BR>Jiles' writing soars into literary realms in many places in this debut novel, and her portrayal of the diverse characters is amusing, horrific, true-to-life, and riveting. Cold Mountain, one of my favorite books of the past 5 years, was heavy going and sometimes plodding, often depressing. By comparison, Enemy Women is highly accessible, never confusing. Depressing at times? Yes, but leavened always by wit, compassion, and hope.<BR>Do NOT miss this book. It was recommended to me by the manager of Cody's Books on Fourth St. in Berkeley, and she knows her business.	2004-03-25

Bitter Lemons is part memoir, part political commentary, part travel writing, and part philosophy. It's the story of Durrell's fairly brief stay on the island of Cyprus, conflict between Greeks and Turks, impending world war, buying a house and trying to settle into a unique niche of the world. It's a book about Life and all its myriad difficulties.<BR>Tip-top - and wonderful writing. It's one of those books whose memory will stay with me always.	2004-03-24

She's hiding from a wicked lover and also hiding from her somewhat shabby and sensational past. But the convent proves to be far from an ideal sanctuary, isolated from the real world by the daily ebb and flow of the tides as it is also caught within the ebb and flow of desire, passion, and nearly medieval ignorance. Into this caldron of frustration and confusion come a new abbess and her confessor, who is none other than the wicked lover in disguise. <BR>Sensual, descriptive, mesmerizing, poetic -  all of these terms apply to Harris's writing, and her skills do not fail her in Holy Fools	2004-03-15

The Spiral Staircase pick up her intellectual and religious questing and brings her devoted readers up to date on the result of her explorations into the nature of God and his/her/? place in our world and lives.<BR>Armstrong garnered many degrees and awards as she pursued a solitary, scholarly life. While she still harbors bitter feelings about how she was treated (and NOT treated, for her epilepsy) within the convent, her life since she left the cloister has been devoted to a style of intellectual live that bears some deep similarity to the routines followed in religious orders - and the irony of this similarity does not escape her. On her lifelong quest, she found herself straying far from orthodox Christianity, delving into the teachings of both Buddhism and Islam - and she has written books on both subjects.<BR>Here's the interesting thing: Lots of modern authors who write memoirs focus with near obsession on their illnesses, disabilities, eating disorders, depression, etc. Armstrong discusses all these issues, too, but while other memorists build them up, Armstrong seems to want to minimize them. What interests her are things she is capable of, not those she is incapable of, and her book's impact is all the richer for her minimalist approach.<BR>This intensely personal book is also an exceedingly solitary book. The only relationship that seems to matter for Karen Armstrong is her relationship with God, a being who, in her view, probably does not exist.<BR>This doesn't stop her from ultimately deciding (with characteristic pragmatism and without retreating from her skepticism), that leading a religious life is worth it, because \\"Faith is not about belief but about practice...The laws of religion are true because they are life-enhancing.\\"<BR>That's good enough for me.	2004-03-15

Yes, there's some of that, but there's so much more to this quite extraordinary fiction debut by Donna Gershten, who won Barbara Kingsolver's Bellwether Prize for her effort. <BR>Guadalupe grew up as a victim of a strong patriarchial culture and learned how to work within that system. Then she manages to use her intelligence and beauty to rise above her origins, she find herself married and moved to the States. There, she's at a loss as to how to fit into her new world. All the old rules no longer seem to apply. This is a cross-cultural tale that deals with the inequities inherent between men and women, between those `with' and those `without' within both societies.	2004-03-15

Everyone is probably familiar with All the Pretty Horses, so if you want to know what became of John Grady Cole, read this one. It picks up a few years after he left Mexico and his first love (if you don't count horses) behind and came back to the USA, where he works as a cowboy on a big ranch in a town across the border from Juarez. This time, he has the misfortune to fall in love with a beautiful young whore, and he determines to marry her. <BR>John Grady's friend and mentor, Billy Parham (read The Crossing to learn his equally powerful story) tries to help him out - but to tell much more of this tale would be to tell too much.<BR>Like in the other two books, McCarthy has a loooooooong passage of philosophy spoken as almost a monologue by some wise old dude. It's good stuff, but it's okay to skim through it if you're not in the mood for about 80 pages of a pretty good speech. It really has no bearing on the story; it's just McCarthy doing his thing.<BR>I'd advise reading these books in the proper order; there's a pathos and continuity that can't be appreciated otherwise. However, they do read as complete within themselves, so, whatever. I flat out loved each one.	2004-03-10

Suzette's girlish aspirations for perhaps being freed to marry and live her own life are cut short when, at age 13, she is taken as the mistress of a cousin of her owners - and she eventually bears him 2 children. <BR>From there, the tale goes forward to follow the life of Philomene, Suzette's 2nd child, then her daughter, Emily, and finally to her children. Through each successive generation, the girls' skin color becomes paler and paler by the diluting quality of white planter's blood.<BR>This tale is author Tademy's attempt to create her own Louisiana family history. She quit a high-level job in the technology industry to explore her roots and then to write this book - a novel, but with lots of truth to back up the story line. Family archival photographs help us see these characters as far more than just people defined by words; they become real in our vision as well as in our imagination.<BR>Stunningly successful first book.	2004-03-08

She gets to visit weird, remote, exotic locations, observe unusual flora and fauna, write about them - and earns enough money to go out and do it again. <BR>In The Rarest of the Rare, she gathers together 6 essays previously published elsewhere; all deal with endangered species such as the golden lion tamarind, the monarchs, monk seals, and others. But she's not just a do-gooder naturalist: she's also a poet, a philosopher, and a heck of a good writer. Some of her musings, the questions she asks of herself, the parallels she makes, remind me of Annie Dillard's nature writing - her books such as Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.<BR>It's a joy to share these things that I will never experience through the eyes of such a consummate scientist and writer and human being.<BR>Also, for an entirely different approach to observing endangered species, see Daniel Glick's Monkey Dancing.	2004-03-03

Susie, the protagonist, is a young girl who is placed in a school class for troubled and troublesome kids - when really she's quite bright and is just reacting to the trauma caused by screaming headlines and daily threats of bombing by the Japanese. <BR>It's a classic struggle between the pull to grow up while at the same time the urge to preserve the innocence of childhood - and it reads like nonfiction.

A dwarf from the 1700s wins our sympathy while disgusting us at the same time. Next comes a lovely couple with children living out their affluent life in a country home in the 1800s - but there are ominous hints that disaster lies just around the next corner. Then there are two siblings living in our modern era, and they seem strangely disconnected, bored with life and their existence. These people cannot know each other, separated as they are by 100 years - but readers begin to grasp subtle connections that make sense of their combined histories.<br />A tour de force.	2004-03-03

Wall was privileged to grow up on a rancho in Old Big Sur, way at the back of a canyon. Before the coastal Highway 1 was built, the area put a new definition to the word `remote,' and Wall was one of many who refused to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the highway. Those people recognized that a whole way of life would disappear within a few years, and they were right.<BR>The first half of her book was most interesting to me. It deals with the historical colonial settlers of Mexican, Indian, and American heritages, how those three came together through business, ranching, and intermarriage to form the unique flavor and heritage of this special region. Wild regions tend to attract wild people, and Big Sur has always had its share of `characters.' It still does. Wall recalls from her own memory many of these people and brings them to life for us.<BR>The second half of the book concerns her own life in Big Sur, and while very interesting, it doesn't have the same historical significance and broad scope of the first half.<BR>A great piece of writing for those who wish to get a sense of the way it used to be down in the Big South.	2004-03-03

Just sit back and allow the beauty of the writing, the images, and the atmosphere carry you along. The book is a series of related stories that weave together like a Venetian tapestry, full of shifting colors and blurry hints of depth and emotion. One is the story of Sosia, a lovely, sensual, but shallow Jewish girl married to a good man whom she detests. She takes many lovers, men of every rank in 15th century Venice society. Another parallel story is about a German who has come to Venice to set up a printing press. <BR>Many themes twist and turn through the pages of The Floating Book, themes that include Judaism, faith, fate, the importance of the written word, jealousy, poetry, seduction - and taken together, they create the old Venice of that era. Hence the title: that Venice was like a floating book of ideas. The author is clearly in love with words, and perhaps there are a few too many of them. <BR>But still, it's a lovely and evocative read.	2004-03-01

That's what literary agents and editors tell writers, but Daniel Stoler's terrific debut collection of 8 short stories, The Middle of the Night, proves them wrong.<BR>Several of these stories are set in St. Louis; the characters are Midwesterners, a group often mocked and given short shrift in `literary' writing. The people in the stories are continually being surprised by life's twists and turns, and they are obviously uncomfortable with the changes brought about by shifting relationships these changes cause. <BR>Throughout the stories, there's a sense of looking back at what might have been, an examination of grief and loss, a withholding of secrets right to the grave, and an aura of quiet detachment that makes the peaks in the writing all the more powerful.<BR>A great addition to any serious reader's bookshelf.	2004-03-01

There is the usual basis information, of course, but it's author Stoller's breezy discussions about the ancient art of knitting, its history, family photos - all sorts of stuff you're highly unlikely to find in any other knitting book. How to start your own knitting group, website information. Oddball projects, too: purses and backpacks.<BR>I knitted up a storm about 40 yrs ago when I was in college. Then I went cold turkey and didn't pick up a pair of knitting needles until about a year ago.

They're great, and I have a lovely one in my front yard. But I can claim exactly none of the credit. My style of gardening is to sit on the front steps chatting with Teri, my gardener, while she prunes the shrubs and tucks primroses and lobelia and cyclamen into the little bare spots.<BR>But I love reading about people who DO enjoy gardening, and Diane Ackerman is a consummate writer on the subject. I've read The Moon by Whale Light and A Natural History of the Senses, two others of her several books, and find myself equally charmed by this one. It's a casual tour through the four seasons of her upstate backyard garden. But, as she's a naturalist, a poet, and a philosopher, she doesn't stop with just the plants; she uses the plants and their interdependent roles as metaphors to browse mentally through a wide variety of topics, including what gardens can do for people more than how people can tend a garden. It's like a role reversal of sorts. Some of the subjects that her free- and far-ranging mind roams over include: how we are like plants, plant's self-defense mechanisms, why we see faces in nature, etc. Her lyrical writing and vast, encyclopedic curiosity sometimes remind me of Annie Dillard's nature writing, a comparison that should be considered a compliment to both authors.	2004-02-24

A Natural History of the Senses does not disappoint. It flows like cool water through literature, history, music, politics, philosophy, and poetry. As a writer, I appreciate this book as a resource of my own, a way to deepen my understanding of our sensory appreciation of the world - but also as an example of beautiful writing by a master of the craft. <BR>In a nutshell, I wish Diane Ackerman lived next door to me.	2004-02-24

Most books of this nature are didactic with occasional leaps into literary writing. Ackerman, in contrast, balances fact with fancy and reality with conjecture; she balances personal experience with the universal; she asks original questions that have no known answers; she merges conversation with conservation; she gives us a sense of who she is without losing the thread of what she's writing about. Not being particular scientific, I was surprised to find myself clinging to every word, reading the book straight through in perhaps two nights of bedtime reading.<BR>The chapters on diverse topics can be read separately as individual essays, but there's a sense of progression of Ackerman's life that lends a personal touch to the book. These wonderful essays found their first home in The New Yorker. Subjects are all over the map: bats, alligators, penguins, and of course the whales of the title, which reads like a misprint - but isn't. In the process, Ackerman underscores man's responsibility to act in the protection of the world's other creatures: we are but one among many (and we're hugely outnumbered, BTW).<BR>Besides being a perfect melding of animal lore, objective study, and conservation, The Moon by Whalelight is an example of nonfiction storytelling at its best.	2004-02-21

She now leads treks into the world's remote and wild regions, but she once rendered me speechless with her offhand reply to my horror at one hair-raising tale she told of crossing an ice bridge about a million miles up a some scary mountain. <BR>\\"Why on earth would you do that?\\" I had asked, when I recovered my voice. And another unspoken question hung right behind the first: Having done it once and survived, why on God's green earth would you do it again? And again, and again.<BR>\\"Oh, it's not really dangerous,\\" and she poured me another cup of tea.<BR>Not dangerous. Yeah, right.<BR>Arlene had already lost a lover and several friends to accidents in high places, and others have died cold and lonely deaths since then. Not dangerous? I mean, what?? <BR>But there will still be those who MUST climb mountains. Some of them will die, and their survivors often are quoted as saying, \\"He died doing what he loved best,\\" or the feminine equivalent. Maria Coffey's book, Where the Mountain Casts Its Shadow,\\" chronicles the naked underbelly of the experience of this particular kind of loss. It looks behind the public quotes into the hearts and bleeding souls of the survivors, and I believe it's a story whose exposure is long overdue. The personal costs of extreme adventure are too often dismissed for the thrill of reading about the adventures themselves. Coffey handles with grace and delicacy the stories of wives, husbands, lovers, friends, and children left behind my someone who just had to climb yet one more mountain - for reasons the rest of us armchair travelers can't even begin to imagine.	2004-02-21

But in its brevity, it manages to explain part of the answer to how our current health care disaster has come to pass. Written in 1973, this book was perfectly timed to coincide with the era of feminism, drastic changes in women's health, and the rise of midwifery as a once-again quasi-respected profession in the US. I am a nurse and a midwife, and I recently attended a book signing for Ehrenreich's Nickle and Dimed. When I set my dog-eared copy of WMN in front of her, she folded her hands in her lap and sat still. Then she placed her hand flat on the book, looked up at me with glistening eyes, and said, \\"Oh. Oh, my dear. This is - and probably always will be - my favorite of all the things I've written.\\"<BR>Witches, Midwives, and Nurses is a scholarly history of how male doctors came to take over power and control of the healing arts, traditionally the domain of women. In their concerted efforts to become the sole practitioners of `scientific medicine,' the male `barber-surgeons' discredited, persecuted, and often killed the wisewomen healers. Spanning the time from the medieval years to the Sixties, it throws the entire course of medical history into a new light. <BR>Witches, Midwives, and Nurses is a MUST READ for anyone remotely involved in health care - and that includes everyone, because we are all consumers, if not practitioners. My 80yo father ate it up one afternoon, and that's saying a lot.	2004-02-21

About thirty or forty `anothers.' As she says, \\"Maybe that would have been a good time to tell him about Reilly. My husband.\\"<BR>Well, yes, maybe so. But if she had, there wouldn't have been much of a book.<BR>Generally the technique of an author addressing the reader directly, in 2nd person, is irritating to me, but I fell right into Coburn's confidential writing style. Her heroine (if you can call such a flawed and delightfully irritating person a heroine) has her eyes wide open to her own faults, and I think it's this internal honesty that makes us like her so much.<BR>If you like good chick lit, you'll like this one; it's way, way, way better than average.	2004-02-20

Their ages span more than a century, so the style of writing varies widely, but each has something quite special to share with a reader looking for a few moments of luminousness or quiet revelation in the midst of a busy day.<BR>Here's one of my favorite bits, and I'm paraphrasing: Men climb mountains to conquer them; women climb mountains to go deeper within themselves, to feel a oneness with nature. When I read that, I lifted my eyes from the page, stared at the horizon and thought how much more poetic and truthful that is than the usual Mars/Venus type of comparison.<BR>Contributors range from regionalist Sarah Orne Jewett to internationalist Diane Ackerman; there are African Americans, Native Americans, Jews, Catholics, mystics, and poets among this mix, with plenty of boundary crossing.<BR>Very lovely. Not, I believe, a book meant to be read cover to cover. Rather, let it rest beside your favorite reading chair or at your bedside, and read a few entries now and then at random. I think you'll be charmed, as I was.	2004-02-20

As a writer, she's so obviously riding the coattails of her husband, Pulitzer winner Michael Chabon, that she's become a literary embarrassment. There are writing friends of mine who write FAR better than Ms. Waldman, but will their books ever get into print? Heck, no. In fact, it's highly doubtful they'll ever even land an agent. Did Waldman have any trouble selling her book? You can bet your sweet bippy she was ushered into the head honcho's office and plied with wine and jumbo shrimp - all the big guys aching to make nice over the wife of a justly famous man. The book itself deals with serious and important material, but Ayelet Waldman is not the writer who should be carrying this flag. <BR>Please, folks: don't waste your money.

They seem able to poke fun at themselves as successfully as they are able to poke it at others. While Pete McCarthy is only half Irish, a percentage I'll bet he wishes he could change to at least  Irish, you'd never know it by his writing. He sounds Irish to his ale and whiskey-drinking core. His style most reminds me of Bill Bryson; they both have a similar ability to stand aside and look at life and one's own place in it with an eye toward humor, compassion, and appreciation for the foibles of our human race.<BR>In The Road to McCarthy, the author takes us with him on what amounts to a travelogue as he gallivants around the world in search of kinfolk and towns and villages that serendipitously share his name - and faith and begore, the lad does find himself in some oddball situations. In fact, I think his compass doesn't turn toward North as much as it turns toward Daffy.<BR>Delightful addition to a shelf of whimsical, irreverent travel books.	2004-02-12

Read Circle of Sodom, and you'll get to follow Owen MacDara on his odyssey from New York to the Atlantic Ocean, from Palm Springs to the backwoods hills of Tennessee, all in the name of love and daring-do. There's a lot of action packed in these 300+ pages, action dealing with terrorism, spying, attempted coups, and religious fanaticism. <BR>Good, tight writing, clean prose that just zips along, and characters that are engaging and memorable all contribute to a great new book in the thriller genre. It's not my usual choice of reading material, but the book was a gift. I read it and am glad I did.	2004-02-12

I don't read too many books in the thriller genre, but Paranoia held my interest from beginning to end. This is a spy story set within the corporate world, and it all starts when Adam Cassidy (maybe Nicholas Cage for the movie?), bored out of his gourd, charges (without permission) a very costly retirement party for a company laborer. I mean, the guy wasn't even an executive, so what was Adam thinking?? Nailed and at risk of losing a job he loves to hate, Adam is trapped, and the CEO offers to let him off the hook if he'll become a mole in a rival high-tech company. In the blink of an eye, Adam, carrying false credentials and a lot of moxie, finds himself names as the personal assistant to the rival company's founder. <BR>Then the plot thickens: he begins to admire his new `boss;' the pressure from his old boss to get yet more secret info increases; he likes his new job with all its benefits; and he likes even more his new lover, a company employee.<BR>You won't get much sleep till you've finished this tale.

Gayle Brandeis' poetic background comes through in the lyrical writing, especially when she's describing the birds in their natural world and when she's delving into the push-pull relationship between mother and daughter.<BR>Book of Dead Birds deals with many issues: gender, race, culture differences, environmental concerns, immigration, guilt, survival, redemption - and love. <BR>Ava Sing Lo is the daughter of Helen, a Korean woman who was forced to work as a prostitute on a military base; Ava's father was one of her mother's `clients.' Brought to America by a white husband, Helen found herself quickly abandoned after she gave birth to a black baby (Ava) who grew into a child and young woman who never felt full acceptance from her immigrant mother. The birds of the title are her mother's, and they carry heavy symbolism in the story. And Ava has been killing them. To atone, she finishes graduate school and volunteers to work with birds that are being poisoned by agricultural run-off.   <BR>Very moving and lyrical first novel. 4  stars.	2004-02-11

I picked it up 2 days ago, read it, and figuratively ate it up. Very much a woman writer's book, Fruitflesh uses the growing cycles of flowers and fruits as metaphors for the structure of writing, a unique approach that will appeal to those of us who struggle with the writing muse each and every day. As in other books for writers, yes, there are writing exercises, and yes, there is advice, but here's the difference: Brandeis offers lush and bountiful suggestions for medications that will help bring to fruition the prose we KNOW we have within us. This book is designed to help us find the true sources of our creativity<BR>It's a feast, and halfway through Fruitflesh, you can almost feel the juice of a peach running down your chin.<BR>Excellent. It's easy to see that the author is also a poet.	2004-02-08

It was the recent selection of the First Edition Club of Book Passage, an iconic bookstore in Corte Madera, CA - and this book is a real winner. <BR>The entire book is a collection of letters of wildly varying length from Olivia Hunt to all the various important people in her life: her sister (who is battling with leukemia in Ohio), her ex-lover (whom she still loves, but he's an artist in NM), and her best friend (who is trying to get pregnant). There are tons of short and hilarious, acerbic and sarcastic letters to Hollywood directors, actors, producers, money-lenders, etc., because Olivia wants to revive her flagging career by coordinating a big-budget production of Don Quixote, starring Robin Williams.<BR>It's a strange juxtaposition of events that come together during the year plus a few months that these `letters' span, and by the end you care deeply about every single one of the characters. Don't miss it.	2004-02-03

But I was held spellbound.<BR>However, you kind of want a dictionary at your side when you read Cold Mountain, but just any dictionary won't do. Frazier uses farming terms from the era of which he writes, the American Civil War, and some of the names for those pieces of equipment simply won't appear in your pocket Webster's. But know what? Skip it. Just keep reading - and reading and reading and reading. It's a long book, but I finished it in about 2 days. It's that good.<BR>Inman is a wounded soldier. Ada, his love, is back on Cold Mountain keeping the home fires burning. The book alternates between Ada's story of her life on the farm with Ruby, a loner who just materializes one day and offers to help run the man-less farm - and with Inman's story of trying to get back to Ada, wandering the countryside with grievous injuries, trying to keep out of the way of the bounty hunters and other baddies.<BR>Frazier's novel is full of dense details of nature, farming, war, the countryside, and the social milieu of the 1860s. The prose is elegant, the details are said to be stunningly accurate, and the story is spellbinding. No wonder it won the National Book Award. Can't wait to see the film, tho I have trouble visualizing glamorous Renee Zelweger as the plain Ruby; if she manages to lose herself in that dificult part, she'll surely win an Oscar.	2004-02-03

We've drooled at her descriptions of the magic and pleasure, the texture and taste, the power and the glory of special foods. Well, she's finally done it: Harris has collaborated with a real cookbook author, Fran Warde, and created a collection of family recipes.

This new generation of young parents all seem to swear by this book, and I really think they're on to something. Honest-to-God, these babies are calm, happy, relaxed, and contented during the period in their lives when we would expect at least 25% of them to be fretful and colicky.<BR>Author Karp offers a common sense method of soothing babies during their newborn phase, a period he calls the Fourth Trimester. Essentially it involves reducing stimuli and introducing the baby very gradually into our chaotic, noisy, and brightly-lit world. It feels right, slowing the transition for these tender little souls so their circuits don't get overloaded. It speaks to some cultures' traditional period of quiet and privacy for approx 6 weeks after the birth before new mother and baby, by then in tune with each other's rhythms, are introduced to society. When I was a public health nurse in LA, I learned their term for this magical and therapeutic period of time: La Cuarenta Dias: The Forty Days. It's an old technique, older than any childcare book ever written, but there's real wisdom in these ancient traditions.<BR>If you're expecting a baby or a grandbaby, buy this book. Now.	2004-01-28

When people from the Bay Area hoof it up Telegraph Hill in SF, they nearly always make the climb from the North Beach access points. It's steep as all get out, but it's not even slightly as steep as the Greenwich steps, which is the way people choose to descend from the famous hill. Rarely on those steps do I meet someone walking up - and when I do, I always notice what great calves they have.<BR>Anyway, there are old cottages from probably the earthquake era situated along these steps, and in one of them lived the author of this delightful book, Mark Bittner. Once a down and out self-described \\"dharma bum,\\" Bittner was given free lodging in return for caretaking one of the mansions higher on the hillside. Jobless and bored, he began spending his days making friends with the small flock of wild parrots who have made that side of Telegraph Hill their home. In the process, he found meaning in his own life for probably the first time. Now a celebrity, Bittner says \\"from being a homeless nobody, now I have a home, a girlfriend, a book, and a movie...it's hilarious!\\" He's become a SF personality and an expert on his parrots, cherry-headed and blue-crowned conures-escapees from a long-ago South American shipment.<BR>This book is as delightful as Bittner himself, more informative than anything else on parrots that I've ever read, and more readable than some novels. It's a sure winner.	2004-01-28

If you can find a used copy that you can afford it, go ahead and buy it: you won't be disappointed. It's a hilarious story of the author's relationship with a squirrel he rescued when it was a baby, about as big as his thumb. Pretty soon it grew up and virtually took over this man's house, his food, his life, and his world. Loving as this squirrel could be, she also seemed to have a mean streak, particularly if he dared to invite females into the home.<BR>Great little story.	2004-01-28

Laugh thru your tears	I have friends who found it impossible to finish Angela's Ashes because they found it relentlessly depressing with its heavy themes of aching poverty, absent drunken loving father and long-suffering mother - classic themes, it seems, in Irish literature.<BR>But in spite of the truth of those parts of the story, it's impossible to finish this book without feeling a sense of triumph for the human spirit, even when surrounded by the realities of McCourt's Irish childhood and young adolescence.<BR>It works, I think, because he writes the entire book in the child's voice - not an easy task to pull off, but he succeeded. And a child, of course, doesn't have much against which to hold up his own life; it's all he knows. So McCourt never comes across as sounding whiney, bitter, jealous, or put-upon.<BR>Scene after hilarious scene is interspersed with real heartbreaking and harrowing and demeaning eqisodes, but the overall feeling I was left with was joy.	2004-01-25

My 18yo son and his friends mess around with it for pennies or toothpicks, and I hear them arguing the rules long after I've gone to bed. But now I find myself in the unlikely position of having read three books on the subject, and I'm really getting into it.<BR>Read 'Em and Weep is a collection of essays, short stories, book excerpts and (of all unlikely things) poems dealing with the eternally interesting world of the game. Many of the tales focus on the fast-paced newish game called Hold 'Em. But most of the contributions (from authors such as Mark Twain, Maugham, and Thurber) deal with the traditional more gentlemanly games from a bygone poker era. It's a good melding of the two worlds, past and present.	2004-01-25

The lyrical writing and the sad story were stellar. Rapture, too, is full of lyrical writing, and again it's a sad story, but this latest book just didn't move me the same way Evening did.<BR>It's an old story (told in a very brief book, not much over 100 pages): two old lovers who managed to hurt each other repeatedly and badly in their past affair, meet again and fall into bed. The whole story is book-ended between the beginning and conclusion of that sexual act that was unspoken till Bill Clinton turned it into dinner table conversation. And it points out again how different are the meanings that men give to sex, compared to that given by women. She is dreamy and reminiscent, worshiping by her ministrations, remembering mostly the good times. He, in contract, is detached and focused on other things, remember what a cad he was and how much pain they gave each other. Through the device of alternating interior monologues, Minot has these two people, Kay and Benjamin, recall their past and all the events that have led to this moment. They never say a word to each other until the end of the book, when their differences again become agonizingly apparent.<BR>It's good, it's revelatory, it's beautifully written. It explores the depths of an emotional relationship more deeply than I think I've ever seen done before. But the distance of the people is somehow passed on to the reader, and I felt just that: distanced.	2004-01-25

The construction itself, with short chapters, essays, and poems, will make it appealing to those first-timers in the dizzy world of parenting in which some days success is measured by having found time to brush your teeth, make the bed, and decide what you're having for dinner. Not actually prepared it and served it, mind you: just decided what to fix. The entries are short enough to be read in the 5-10 minutes at a stretch that are all new parents feel they can call their own. <BR>It's meant to be sweet and sentimental - and it is. I did find myself, at points, wishing for a little more of the gritty and grizzly side of new parenting issues, more of an Annie Lamott take on how very difficult it often is to devote yourself to a 10-pound morsel of demanding humanity.	2004-01-25

This is one of those books people tend to either love or hate - a little like Cold Mountain in the polarization of the reviews. And, whereas I loved Cold Mountain, House of Sand and Fog was not my cup of tea. I couldn't relate or even care much about any of the characters, which is odd, because I have really related to other characters in Andre Dubus' writing. <BR>The book focuses on the different meanings that a certain house takes on for people, people that include a former addict who was the original owner and a once powerful disenfranchised Irani immigrant, and as the story progressed, the house takes on a role of its own in this well written but (for me) ultimately dissatisfying and depressing cultural clash.	2004-01-25

He has become known as the Mark Twain of the 60s, the New Thoreau, and the Zen Trickster. His voice, ebullient, sad, and comic, is pure American. Brautigan's writing straddles the line between prose and poetry as he follows a guy named (trust me here) Trout Fishing In America across his native land in search of Zen enlightenment. The `chapters' are anecdotes that read as fables and continue to delight after multiple re-readings.

Jenny Boylan lived for 40 yrs as James Boylan, an author (fiction) and college professor. It's been 5 yrs since she became female.<BR>It's not the facts that are `off' in this book; it's the tone.

All I know is that it's a damn fine piece of writing. <BR>The setup is that Elizabeth Costelly, an Australian writer whose fame is based on an early piece of work about Ulysses' character, Molly Bloom, cleverly educates us to issues of race, honesty, humanitarianism, and deception in Africa through \\"eight lessons\\" which sometimes read like lectures or debates.<BR>It's not an easy book, and Coetzee's bleak outlook comes through in the writing, but it's worth the effort.

Predictably, the stress and strain of such a choice puts a cramp in their marriage - and their dream is in danger of withering on the vine.<BR>Wonderful story, wonderful storytelling, wonderful author.

Wolff can take a mundane, everyday experience and thru his meticulous craftsmanship dig into the depths to mine it for every nuance of emotional significance. Nothing is present in any of his stories that doesn't serve a purpose: not a dog, a twig, a sweater, or a smile. Everything moves the stories forward and shows us more about each character and his/her relationship to others. \\"Firelight,\\" a story I've now read several times, is my favorite: a boy and his single mom, stranded in a university town, spend their weekends looking at houses and apartments for rent, knowing they can't afford any of them. At the end of the long day, they're invited inside the last house, one where a university professor lives with his wife and daughter. The story, told from the boy's POV, is bittersweet and focuses on a sense of being an outsider to the comforts of home, the warmth of the fireside - but he realizes that all is not as it appears within this family that he still envies.<BR>Absolutely wonderful collection.	2004-01-21

Much has already, of course, been written by this icon, but Kate (the book) is full of fresh and intimate looks at her life with more emphasis on her thoughts and memories than other more straightforward biographies. It becomes something of a cross between the introspection of a memoir blended with the fact-based details of a biography. Katherine Hepburn's own voice comes through clearly in the many quotes with which author Berg seasons his book.<BR>Wonderful. Highest recommendation for those who can't get enough about this very special woman.	2004-01-21

Raised as the docile and obedient daughter, Nazneen accepts an arranged marriage to an old man who takes her from Bangladesh to a Bangladeshi community in London. There, for the first time, she comes in contact with (or at least observes) the freedoms of Western women in The Land of Opportunity. Within the tight Bangaladeshi community, author Ali gives us all degrees of the immigrant experience through Nazneen's eyes. This unsparing look into a world of suppression that few of us can imagine is very gracefully rendered.	2004-01-21

They are far and away the most delicious little snacky to have around when guests arrive. Once you've provided them to your friends, they will insist you bring them to every future gathering. And make them right as folks arrive: the aroma that perfumes the whole house is intoxicating, and the nuts, hot out of the oven, disappear really, really quickly, so make plenty.<BR>Damn, they're SO GOOD.<BR>Okay, the rest of the cookbook is a winner, too. It was given to me as a gift from a friend who visits NYC frequently and dines at this restaurant, so, ta-da, I have a 1st edition sighed by both Meyer and Romano, owner and executive chef.

I was in college, and everyone was suddenly reading it. The fact that it's still in print and selling at #3000 on Amazon is a testament to the universal appeal and underlying message of JH Griffin's book.<BR>Here's the deal: in the 50s, the author was a journalist in the Deep South, and decided to experience the life of a black man by crossing the color line. He took medication that darkened his skin and exchanged his live as a privileged white man for the world of an unemployed black man. Black Like Me is his eyewitness history about race and humanity - and ultimately humility.<BR>Should be read by every thinking person in the country. I just put it into the hands of my 19yo son and said, \\"Read this.\\"	2004-01-21

Then I bought it, because it's a book I'll definitely read another time or two. I've read Tobias Wolff's short stories and memoirs, but this novel, his first, makes me hope he'll write more and more and more of them. <BR>Set in the 60s in a private school, the narrator, who comes from a working-class family and is a scholarship student, longs to fit in among his more upscale and privileged classmates. The school hosts a writing contest in which the winners are granted private audiences with one of three visiting pros: Frost, Ayn Rand, and Hemingway. Of course the narrator (unnamed) determines to win a spot with his favorite, Hemingway, and the process by which he tries to achieve this goal is the territory upon which the story is built.<BR>Written from the perspective of the adult looking back on his adolescence, Old School gives readers a lesson not only in superb writing but also in the art of character formation, and the ultimate message is, as with much great literature, that we are each of us alone in our own world - and often that world is one of our own making.	2004-01-21

Most of my friends despised this book, or at least found it so depressing, &quot;without a single character with a redeeming quality,&quot; so they said, but I really, really liked it. It's not a pretty story, it's true, but the writing, the characterization, the story line, and the social commentary are so spot-on that one can't help but stand in awe of Franzen's expertise. The Lambert family is coming not-so-quietly unglued. Alfred, once the rigid patriarch, stumbles around in the throes of dementia. Enid, his very angry but loyal wife, is trying hard to keep up appearances. The only daughter, a chef, is between love affairs and restaurants. Gary, the eldest son, is stuck in a difficult marriage made worse by his own depression. Most of the book is related from the POV of Chip, the younger son, a writer somehow involved with an Eastern-Bloc politician, but the machinations of that whole episode mostly went right over my head. Throughout the book, there is a sense of the author's savage wit and scathing opinions about - well, about everything.<BR>The Corrections is vast and broad in scope, and in the hands of a less skilled author, it would have been a laughable hodge-podge. Franzen, however, has written a book of such stunning complexity, sadness, and social ennui that we can only stand back and applaud.	2004-01-21

Set against Henry's experiences are those of William Robbins, his previous master/owner, and the relationship between Townsend and Robbins is particularly well wrought. While not possessing the power of the white ruling class, the freed Negroes believed that, for them, it was just a matter of waiting it out. But as Henry lies dying, he worries about what will be come of his holdings after he is gone. Turns out, he has good reason for concern. The Known World explores the bonds of slavery and ownership and how those bonds affect all who are touched by them. This uneasy kaleidoscopic debut novel focuses on difficult moral subjects, and it does so masterfully and with depth and compassion. Superb.	2004-01-21

Stern, a Harvard professor and former fellow on terrorism at the Council on Foreign Relations, expands her definition of religious terrorists worldwide by including the Muslim jihad in Indonesia, militant Palestinians, zealous Israelis, and Americans who kill abortion doctors in the name of Christianity. Stern outlines how militants of all persuasions find recruits and recondition them in cultlike sects to embrace suicide and murder.<BR>Stern spent 5+ years traveling worldwide to research this book, which combines psychology and forensic science in a remarkable study that all who are interested in keeping abreast of the growing role of religious terrorism should be required to read.	2004-01-21

I've read it to myself perhaps 20 times; I've read it to my children and laughed over the pictures maybe 10 more times. But, till now, I've never experienced the joy of hearing the poet himself read it to me. Omigod, what a pure pleasure. Recorded in 1952, this new release is all cleaned up and is a real keeper. Thomas' cadences, inflections, emphasis, pauses, and his marvelous Welsh accent make a listener close her eyes and just get lost in the humor and love and reminiscences of a bygone era.<BR>There are quite a few other selections in this collection - and they're good - but even if you buy it just for A Child's Christmas in Wales, it'll be money well spent.	2004-01-21

So I was surprised that Eric Schlosser wasn't really pushing that philosophy; he's not truly anti-hamburger, he's just in favor of healthy hamburger. Healthy for everyone: cowboys, consumers, corporations, and even the cows.<BR>One effect of those who read Fast Food Nation will probably be a severe lessening in how mindlessly they turn into McDonald's or Burger King when hunger hits on the Interstate. Instead, you just might find yourself looking for kosher and organic meats and packing your own lunches before heading off on a trip to Disneyland.<BR>A much-needed book.	2004-01-21

And prolific, my god is he prolific. Best of all, he's detoured from his original one-track genre of legal-based plots. In Bleachers, Grisham has written a book about a legendary high school football coach. Fifteen years after graduation from HS, Neely, once a star quarterback, comes home upon hearing about the impending death of coach Eddie Rake. He and his old buddies sit in the bleachers drinking beer and waiting for Rake to die. And they talk. And talk and talk and talk. There's a mystery from their past, of course, because that's what Grisham writes: mysteries. And there's a love interest, his old high school flame. This one is okay, but definitely not Grisham at his best.	2004-01-21

Tita pours her heart and her loving into cooking, and as the years go by, and with each new creation she reflects the frustrations of a generation of Mexican women whose options in life to find personal happiness are limited by traditions.

I was busy giving birth to my children during the Vietnam years and didn't follow the process as closely as I might have had I not been preoccupied. This book fills in the blanks on a gut level that's hard to express in mere words.<BR>In fact, the author's ability to paint indelible word pictures is his greatest talent, IMO. Too often, I read a book, and 6 months later see the title somewhere and ask myself, Now what was that one about, again?<BR>Not with the Things They Carried.<BR>There are images in this book that will stay with me forever. O'Brien has published it as fiction; I don't believe that. I find it impossible not to believe every word in this book is true. It may not all have happened to HIM, but it happened to SOMEONE, and that's all that counts.<BR>A masterpiece. Don't miss it.	2004-01-19

I can vouch for this combo as a successful way to combat airport blues.<BR>Mayes takes us with her as she, recently divorced, takes her next egg and, against the strident advice of her accountant, sinks pretty much all of it into a big old house on a large piece of property in Cortona, up in the hills of Tuscany. We watch her wrestle, as Mayle did before her, with the inevitable problems: language barriers, cultural barriers, a European worker's altered sense of time, faulty plumbing, surprises when walls are knocked down, etc. She and her lover (now her husband) weren't even there full time; they did this restoration over a period of years during school breaks and long holiday vacations.<BR>A poet, travel writer, and creative writing professor at SF State, Frances Mayes finest creation is surely her Tuscan house and garden, but coming in a close second is her collection of books she's written on the subject.

Then something shifted, and I began to understand that the author's purpose was different from the usual. Coetzee isn't interested in having his readers 'like' his protagonist - and we don't. David Lurie is no one's hero, least of all his own. After a lackluster life, an affair with a student is exposed and he rather deliberately participates in his own resignation in disgrace.<BR>For no clear reason other than to write something on Byron, he heads to the middle of nowhere to his daughter's farm, where she leads what appears to be a simple rural life. Nothing could be further from 'simple;' indeed, it's dangerous, and events take a particularly nasty turn.<BR>This is a complicated and bleak novel that explores the nuances of disgrace, regret, responsibility, and shame.

The stories of their marriages are told through their points of view - and the man they each married comes to be fleshed out through their very different wants and needs within a marriage.<BR>Not perfect, but what a great start to what should be a stellar writing career.<BR>Highly recommended - if just to say you read her first book way back when...	2004-01-17

My favorite of her many mysteries are those featuring Scotland Yard Commander Adam Dalgleish. James limits her cast of characters and the list of possible suspects by setting her crimes within circumscribed boundaries: the staff of a village church, the walls of a convent, the employees of a publishing house - this time it's within the wall of a museum devoted to British arcane of murders that took place during the years between the two World Wars. <BR>Then a new, modern, and all to real murder occurs, and Dalgleish, with his own history and quirks, is called in one the case. The victim is the museum's owner, a man whose siblings objected to his desire to sell it. James creates characters that rise above the cardboard outlines of those in most mysteries; she adds sinew, flesh, and real live personas with souls to the bones. <BR>And, a surprise twist, there's a love interest for Dalgleish himself in this book! Readers who have followed his career since he first appeared within the pages of PD James' books will feel compelled to read this one as a way of continuing their affair with the charming, tortured, and enigmatic detective.	2004-01-16

There's also not her usual fairy, eerie, other-worldly quality to this one.<BR>But it's a good story with a bit of a mystery woven in from the very beginning: who is Flynn, really, and what's he doing at this godforsaken end of a small island in France?<BR>Protagonist Madeleine Prasteau leaves Paris after her mother's death and returns to Les Salants, the village of her birth, where she discovers her father monosyllabic (and that's on a good day) and fading fast - as is the entire village. Madeleine determines to take on responsibility for not just her father and his wreck of a home, but also for the entire village. She somehow pulls warring factions together to build a floating reef to help sand be redeposited on the old beach, hoping for less flooding, better fishing, and more tourists. But that's not all: there are lots of side stories, family history, undercurrents - and romance.<BR>A really good read, tho it's a little confusing to keep all the patois French names straight at first.	2004-01-15

In Love (have you EVER heard a more audacious title?), Morrison crafts a rich and dense novel that illuminates the full spectrum of desire. Bill Cosey, a charismatic guy who runs a ritzy seaside resort for African Americans in the wild and wooly 40s and 50s, is her protagonist for a while. But now he's dead, and the story becomes a portrait of his power, unusual for black men of his times.<BR>Women. Oh, where would this story be without women? In Bill's wake, the women of his life vie for position, scrabbling over the will he wrote eons ago on a throw-away menu.<BR>If you love Toni Morrison's rich writing style, you won't be disappointed, but you might want to keep a pen and pad of paper handy to keep track of the loooong list of characters.	2004-01-15

But everyone else I know agrees with me: it's a breathtakingly beautiful and heartbreakingly inevitable novel. The internal theme of music in all its depth and richness runs like a treacherous melody through this dramatic story of a ton of people held hostage by a very young, very twitchy, and very idealistic bunch of rebel terrorists in some unnamed poor South American country. One is a famous American soprano, Roxane Coss; eventually she is the only remaining female hostage, and she is the point of communication between the hostages, who speak many different languages but share a love of opera. <BR>The situation turns into a very very long siege, and as happens in these cases, odd bonds develop between terrorists and their captives, and soon the situation comes to feel `normal' to those on the inside. Not so, however, out in the real world, and an inevitable rescue attempt occurs, with astonishing consequences.<BR>My advice: Don't miss this lovely book.	2004-01-15

Just call me Jimmy.\\" I wasn't much of a Carter fan during the man's presidency but have since come to appreciate him greatly, mostly for his honesty, sincerity, and humanity. An Hour Before Daylight makes it easy to understand how he became the person he still in.<BR>Born on a Georgia farm during the Depression, Carter grew up in the days of rigid segregation, but at the same time all his friends were black children. He writes lucidly, sometimes lyrically and with strong nostalgia for an era of American history long past.<BR>It's definitely worth a read.	2004-01-15

The Amateur Marriage is her 16th, and like its predecessors, it deals with one of society's outsiders: Pauline, who is too impulsive and querulous to fit into the tightly knit, Polish Catholic Baltimore community in which she find herself in love (and at war) with Michael. They marry, perhaps too quickly, and live upstairs from his cantankerous, embittered widow mother. Being good Catholics, they quickly saddle themselves with 3 children. Years pass, thirty of them, and we get painful, poignant, quirky, and humorous (all qualities at which Tyler excels in portraying with her writing skills) character development as these two misfits make each other progressively more and more miserable.<BR>Not Tyler's best effort, but you know, I've read anything she's written and have never been really disappointed. This one gets a B.	2004-01-13

Once there, Quoyle finds a job writing the shipping news column for the local paper. In this odd and mostly quiet little town, the strange family finds enough stability to begin recovering from the terrors of their past lives. <BR>But the novel is much greater in scope than just one man's story. It's also a bigger story of people coping with loss, abuse, and change. Annie Proulx is a consummate observer of human nature with all its quirks, and her writing skills are just as skewering in their precision. The Shipping News is a superb addition to a shelf of truly literary modern books.	2004-01-10

Instead, Cornwell turns the spotlight over to her smart-mouthed, perennially angry niece and Marino, the perennially angry cop. Toss in a few psychopaths from previous books, several plot lines that Cornwell is a little too obviously struggling to keep under control, and some gruesome details, however, and it's still pretty good...tho I DO miss Scarpetta and her sassy lines and Attitude with a capital A.	2004-01-10

Cathy was one of thirteen children. At lunchtime, Cathy's mom called out from the hammock where she was reading a magazine. She asked the oldest child to get three loaves of bread and four packages of hot dogs from the freezer and make lunch for the 15-20 (many of her own and lots of their friends) children who played in the big shady Michigan backyard. I remember stopping and staring at her. Four packages of hot dogs? Suddenly I understood why she always commandeered at least two kids to accompany her when she visited the local A&P. Imagine the train of grocery carts...<BR>For me, reading Cheaper by the Dozen was like revisiting those Michigan afternoons. The adventures of the Gilbreth family are enduring and endearing, memories of one not-all-that-unusual huge family that muddled along at the turn of the twentieth century. Experimental industrial efficiency methods were used by the parents, so the household hummed along with the precise scheduling of an assembly-line factory. The humor is broad, the tone is generally loving, the characters are well-developed, and the numerous children manage (mostly) to emerge as individuals both in life and in the telling.<BR>Cheaper by the Dozen remains a classic and can still be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's actually a good one to read aloud to your own modern little family of 3  persons.	2004-01-10

The themes of food and secrets and old stories that run through her books were all again present here, but this time the evils of Nazism (both near and far) lent a darker tone to the story. <BR>Harris's transitions from past to present were less successful than in Chocolat and Blackberry Wine, and I found it difficult to keep the characters straight at times.<BR>But once again, the author manages to surprise, entrance, puzzle, and inform us through our senses as well as through her words.	2004-01-10

O'Brien's writing elevates the telling of Vietnam war events to poetry and art, even in the face of bodies blown to bits by land mined. For instance, at one point he goes on for, oh, maybe 10+ pages commenting on the silence, the lack of anything scary happening, the quiet jungle, the unseen and unfelt enemy. And it began to bug them all, making them edgy and crazy and nervous. And still, page after page, he only talks about the fact that nothing happened. <BR>Then, the last sentence of the chapter: When Pederson stepped on the land mine and blew to bits, it was something of a relief.<BR>For my money, that kind of telling of war stories can't be topped. <BR>Read it; you won't regret it. And read The Things They Carried, too.	2004-01-09

It doesn't cover everything, and some of the 'rules' are of course changing with the passage of time - but if a wannabe writer can't afford a whole bookcase of tomes on How to Write, then this is the one he or she should buy.<br />Beyond those 14 pithy pages, however, are another 100 or so that extend the value of the book immeasurably: Principles of Composition, Commonly Misused Words, and perhaps the most valuable: An Approach to Style, which gives excellent advice along the lines of Do not overwrite, Avoid qualifiers, Don't over-explain, Avoid adverbs, Avoid dialect, Don't inject opinion, and tons of others.<br />When all's said and done, however, one of the very best parts is a wonderful essay by the inimitable EB White himself - the Introduction, which serves as a perfect example of all that the rest of the small book preaches: write concisely, clearly, and well, and say something worthwhile.<br />Other books for writers to consider: Bird by Bird, On Writing, and Writing Down the Bones.	2004-01-09

But The Hours took my breath away with its complexity, its interweaving of plots and time frames and the involvement of V. Woolf's (her writing and her own story) - all brought to modern times in twists and turns of writing that just, well, made me ga-ga, completely entranced. Several story lines are interwoven: Mrs. Dalloway (the book and its characters), Virginia Woolf's own life, the story of Laura Brown, a depressed and suicidal 1950's housewife, and Clarissa Vaughan's preparations for a party for her dying gay friend, who has nicknamed her Mrs. Dalloway. <BR>Reading The Hours sent me on a quest to understand more about Virginia Woolf. I'd read Mrs. Dalloway years ago and found it hard going. But this time I read it slowly, savoring the long interior passages. And I've seen the movie. And I've read Quentin Bell's (Woolf's nephew) books about her and the whole Bloomsbury Set.

I've been a fan of her writing ever since, and 'Nickle and Dimed' doesn't disappoint. To do the research needed to write this book, trying to determine if one can live on the salary of an entry level minimum wage job, Ehrenreich decided to do what was necessary to REALLY find out: she would live the life herself. She worked as a waitress in Florida, a cleaning woman and nursing home aide in Maine, and an employee of Wal-Mart in Minnesota - - - and came up with the not-surprising result that she had to work two jobs, seven days a week, and still almost wound up in a homeless shelter.<BR>But the most enjoyable part of this totally bleak vision is Ehrenreich's inimitable writing style: sarcastic, outraged, funny, witty, and very, very liberal in her political outlook. She makes reading this expose a pleasure.	2004-01-09

Ruth Cole, the surviving child who never knew her lustrous and immortalized brothers, is kind of the main character (among many), but lots of the book is told by Eddie O'Hare, a summer helper of Ruth's author father. Everybody is screwed up: Marion, the mom, exists in a zombie state and is unable to love Ruth - or anyone else. Ted, the father, is alcoholic and faltering in his career of writing creepy novels for kids. Ruth can't sustain a loving relationship. WFOY begins in 1958 and doesn't conclude till 1995, when Ruth, perhaps, embarks on a kind of loving healing.<BR>This book qualifies to be called an epic.

I've heard others complain about his rambling style, meandering between distant past, near past, and present (and I haven't seen the movie yet), but I found the transitions seamless and the flow of time as effortless as thought itself. Bailey shows all phases of the caretaking of someone with late-stage Alzheimers, regret, humor, irritation, rage, impatience, love, silliness...

The author was the oldest girl in a large Catholic family, and she yearned for the bad boys. Learning early that she had something they wanted, she was soon playing fast and loose, getting the attention she craved in the worst way possible: allowing herself to be seen simply as a sexual object. <BR>Then things went from bad to worse and she ended up as the only girl in the car, the victim of a gang rape. Fortunately for Dobie, she found redemption in the world of literature and of writing and now shares her experiences and the wisdom she gained with her reading public.<BR>Not great, but worthy of being read by a wide audience.	2004-01-07

But here's the thing: it's lyrical, poetic, gorgeous writing. Shouldn't be a surprise, I guess, as she IS a poet (something I blush to admit I didn't actually know), but surprised I was. <BR>Sprinkled throughout the `story' are little 3-4 line snippets in italics, each one beginning with the words her aunt used to say: Two or three things I know for sure... And then she completes the sentence in different ways, based on what she's focusing on. Here's one: \\"No one is as hard as my uncles had to pretend to be.&quot; This very short little book (less than 100 pages) is so beautifully written, dense with pain and the cruelty of her South Carolina childhood, as well as that of not just her family, but her townsfolk, her whole \\"white trash\\" social class. Topics range from lust, rape, rage, loss, poverty, beatings, agandonment, and that's just for starters.  Dorothy Allison has an ability to write about exceedingly painful subjects with a luminousness that transforms the cruelty of life. The cadence, the rhythm, the music of the words and the writing carries the reader along. Apparently this was written as a performance piece, and it shows. Old family photos are included, and I found myself flipping constantly to the ID list to get a bead on who she was talking about.<BR>And yet, it's a beautiful book. Don't miss it.	2004-01-07

This searing quasi-autobiography dressed up as fiction is worth every painful moment it takes to get through it. The book's title says a lot: it's the story of the childhood of a \\"white trash bastard\\" and her battles against physical and sexual abuse. I wonder: was this the first book that inaugurated the era of so many memoirs about childhood abuse that Oprah eventually elevated to mythic levels?<BR>Bastard out of Carolina is a scarey story with memorable characters who will haunt readers nearly as thoroughly as they haunted Bone, the child protagonist: the violent ones, the jealous ones, the just plain weird ones, the inexplicable ones...<BR>This is not a book with a happy ending. One gets the sense that the end of the story hasn't been written - possibly because the author hasn't lived it yet.<BR>Outstanding. Worth 6 stars.	2004-01-04

They're both self-glorifying at the same time they're self-deprecating; the authors are both experimenting with new and original writing techniques; and both deal with pain and heartbreak by writing themselves out of it.<BR>Frey is dealing with addiction, and he writes from within the experience with a surreal immediacy that takes the reader along, after two horrific months in the detox unit, on his journey down the Rocky Road to Recovery. He proves to be a difficult patient at the rehab center - and that's putting it mildly - but it is his very rage and uncooperativeness that are also his strengths.<BR>The present tense increases the gritty reality of Frey's tale, and unlike some who found his free-wheeling habit of playing fast and loose with rules of punctuation, I found his techniques enhanced the reading experience. The aside stories of his fellow inpatients make wonderful vignettes in their own right, but really, none can compete for sheer drama and excess with Frey's own tale, told so well.<BR>I wish him the best.	2004-01-04

It was well worth the wait.<BR>The tender story of a hermaphrodite follows the history of the protagonist and his family through 80-90 years of America and The Family. The book defies single word descriptions, but it's strange, haunting and spiraling story lines continue resonating long after the reader closes the book.<BR>It's a long book, but it never dragged, and I honestly don't think it could be more tightly edited without losing something important in the process.<BR>Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...	2004-01-04

I'd read it about 20 years ago and recall struggling with the endless sentences and the rambling explorations of Mrs. Dalloway's interior thoughts, her every little fleeting idea, and the tiny events of the day in her life which this book chronicles.<BR>Then of course when The Hours was published, I rummaged around in the bookshelf, found it, and read it again. <BR>And then the movie came out with that wonderful cast of characters, and, well, I had to read it a third time. And I'll say this: it takes more than a single reading to harvest all the gems from this dense prose. Mrs. Dalloway grew on me with the passage of time and with three careful readings. The studied explorations into past and present, men and women, women and other women, society and the family, love and regret...it's a lot to take on in what is really a pretty small book - and only someone of Woolf's talents and brilliance could have made so much of so little.<BR>Highly recommended, but I'm sorry - you'll probably have to read it more than once to extract every single little diamond chip.	2004-01-04

There's no hint anywhere in the pages that this is some banal last gasp of a wonderful author. <BR>Unless is a difficult and painful book concerning Reta Winters, a well-known author whose oldest daughter, Norah, leaves college and voluntarily takes to the streets with a sign hung around her neck. The sign reads: Goodness. The story begins on a light note as Reta, who is writing a romance, tries to make sense of her daughter's decision in a rather circuitous way. Then, however, the book and its story turn darker and more serious as the true nature of Norah's situation becomes clearer. Shields is able to weave a feminist message into this novel with threads that somehow artfully tie together love, family, writing, and understanding. <BR>RIP, Carol Shields, and thanks for this last book.	2004-01-04

It elevates the word 'dysfunctional' to a whole new level. For scary, surreal, and sexual, Running with Scissors (what a great title) takes the cake.<BR>Starting with the divorce of his wacko parents, an already violently bad situation only gets worse when Augusten is sent to live with his mother's psychiatrist (who treats his mom's problems with visits to a motel), a wildly bizarre egomaniac. I mean, hello? Most of the remainder of the book documents his years spent with the shrink's family, including his initiation into homosexuality by a family member who's 20 yrs older than he is.<BR>It's hard to find a single word to describe this book, so I'll go for a string of single words: scatalogical, sexual, bizarre, scary, depressing, hilarious, pathetic, hopeful, illuminating - and really, really interesting.	2004-01-04

Of course, the local sheriff is miffed when the FBI dudes appear, but when more and more bodies begin to show up, he thinks maybe he could use a little help after all.

The machinations and details she attends to in order to preserve the secret of her embarrassment are hilarious and very telling as to what mid-town life in the Big Apple is all about.

His specialty is ordinary blue-collar people (with memorable and endearing quirks, even the scoundrels) in down and out New England towns. In Empire Falls, which qualifies for the claim of being 'an epic,' Miles Roby is the divorced father of a teenaged daughter, proprietor of a local diner, and son of what has to be one of the most irritating and entertaining fathers ever created in literature. There's a huge case of secondary characters: his ex-wife, a disturbed teenage boy, patrons of the diner, and most memorable, the scathingly nasty widow who owns half the town and, by extension, all the people in it. Set pieces of comedic high-jinks are offset with pathos, regret, and other scenes that bring on the tears.<BR>Empire Falls deals with love, fatherhood, lust, class politics, grief, and honor. There's a mystery, a small but important one, that threads its way insidiously through the book, a mystery having to do with exactly what the real relationship is between Miles and the town's matriarch...<BR>Spectacular book.	2004-01-04

Beautiful memoir by a gifted musician and writer, offering a hymn of praise to his Jewish mother (Orthodox, born in Poland, abusive childhood, etc.) who married two remarkable African American husbands, gave birth to a passel of kids, and refused to discuss issues of race with her many children. She answered their question, Am I Black or White?&quot; by telling them, &quot;You're a human being. Educate yourself or you'll be a nobody!&quot; How this remarkable woman succeeded in raising what? about 11 kids in a crime ridden, all-black ghetto, instilling in them respect for religion and education, is at the core of this book. Told in a linear format, alternating chapters of his childhood with his mother's story (told in her voice), it sucks the reader along like riding the rills of a swiftly-moving stream. When the author asked his mother what color God is, she replied, 'The color of water,' i.e. colorless. But this novel is anything but colorless.<BR>Must reading for all thinkers, people of all races and religions.	2004-01-04

The story begins as Cross's best friend's buddy is found guilty at a military trial of brutally killing three women. He's sentences to die, but of course, he swears he's innocent. Cross and Sampson, his friend, go down south to investigate but meet with blank faces, closed doors, official silence, missing files, and other forms of stonewalling at every turn of a hallway. They push forward anyway and begin to discover a pattern that is hauntingly familiar. Meanwhile, the real killers strike again - and then the two investigating cops find themselves as targets.<br />Okay. That's enough information. To say more might be to say too much. Just know that there's a stunning finale that will keep you reading to the finish line without pausing for a drink of water.<br />Terrific entertainment.	2004-01-03

The book chronicles their movement, over time, from the pampered bosom of an upper-class family into the cause of revolution. Alvarez, having lived it herself, captures the atmosphere of what it's like to live in a police state, in which the population exists under the threat of atrocities and horror that dare not be acknowledged. As the sisters' fervor turns to tragedy, Alvarez writes movingly of their courageous desperation.<BR>Mesmerizing, and as the end of this book approaches, you know what's coming and don't want to read it.

The other friend is a homicide cop, and he begins to suspect Dave, a secretive man who has led a double life ever since the molestation.

It's an idyllic dream, and there are many good moments. But from the very opening of the book, we're told Richard will die, Sara will deny their problems till the end, and they will leave Ibarra without having achieved their dreams. The range and depth of characters in the little town, the juxtaposition of one culture against another, the assimilation of the atheistic Americans into the intensely Catholic community, the gorgeous descriptions of the landscapes, and the many side stories of the myriad characters all contribute to this book's perennial popularity. One gets the sense that the author's love and affection for her characters is real.<BR>It's a beautifully written book, and it's certainly incredible that Harriet Doerr wrote it, her first book (at least the first to be published), when she herself was already an old woman	2004-01-02

No one bought it for me, so I'm buying it for myself. If you can walk and have the wherewithal to travel a bit (time and money help), this book makes it possible to easily plan a very special vacation lasting from 1-2 weeks. <BR>Best of all, you don't have to camp out if you don't want to: there's a hotel, hostel, or inn waiting for you at the end of each day's journey.

Since the publication of Cunningham's spectacular The Hours and the movie titled the same, Woolf's writing has undergone a renaissance, rising once again on bestseller lists everywhere. But she's STILL difficult, with the loooong sentences, endless paragraphs, the convoluted windings of words and thoughts and phrases and explanations and descriptions and disclaimers with which her writing is rife. <BR>This book is the missing link. It includes the complete text of Mrs. Dalloway and Mrs. Dalloway's Party, plus relevant journal entries and letters by Virginia Woolf relating to the creation of Mrs. Dalloway.

Reversible Errors is his 6th, and it deals with the myriad issues surrounding the death penalty, and especially how it relates to defendants who are perhaps retarded or otherwise mentally impaired.

Marcia Muller is one or our more artistic and literate mystery writers, and this is a good one. It deals with an identity puzzle. Matthew's wife appears to have been murdered, but no body is found; because suspicion focuses on him, he hits the trail and makes a new life for himself in a different country. Then his `wife' calls, he travels to seek closure with her, and finds she's gone missing again, this time from the home she shares with her lesbian lover, Carly. She and Matt join forces to find this mystery woman, and...well, read the book yourself.	2003-12-29

Two young brothers in 1897 go off to rob a guy in order to get enough money to pay for the services of a local whore. A revolver is accidentally fired, the man being robbed dies - and he turns out to be a local merchant and politician. The boys flee and swear each other to silence.<BR>Here's where the situation really turns sticky, the story being based on a tale Tom Franklin, the author, heard while growing up in Dickinson, Alabama, a one-horse town where he grew up amid faith-healings and exorcisms. The dead man's cousin, Tooch Bedsole, accused men from a neighboring town of the `murder,' and rounds up a posse (lynch mob would be a word that might occur to some) to seek revenge. The descriptions of the violence, the repercussions of what started as a stupid caper, are horrific and graphically portrayed - this is not a book to read aloud in the drawing room of your great aunt! But don't despair and think it's all just gratuitous sensationalism: there's a beautiful surprise twist at the end.	2003-12-29

Now, with Something Rising, we have the missing link: the Indiana setting we learned about in A Girl Named Zippy combined with a tough and conflicted protagonist like the girl/woman in The Solace of Leaving Early.<BR>Cassie (short for Cassiopeia, not for Cassandra) Claiborne's coming of age process from a schoolgirl thru her teenage years and into sort-of-mature womanhood is chronicled within these pages. We see her struggling with a love/hate relationship with a mostly-absent but charismatic pool-playing ace of a father; interacting with a trapped, bitter, and disappointed mother who `could have married a rich man in New Orleans' but was already pregnant with Cassie; and coming to terms with a brilliant, odd, agoraphobic older sister. Cassie develops a tough shell as she becomes the supporter of her odd little family by working odd jobs but mostly by playing pool at Uncle Bud's bar and pool hall, but her fondest wish is to have a life of her own.<BR>I found myself riveted by this book, pulling for Cassie's redemption as she set out to slay dragons in her mother's and sister's name. Only two things detracted from my enjoyment: the ending came a little too swiftly and was a little too neatly tied together, and, maybe it's me, but I just really, really didn't understand why she felt it necessary to whup (at pool, of course) the man her mother had been engaged to when the man who done her wrong came along. I mean, what did Cassie have against Jackson LaFollette, huh?	2003-12-26

I was surprised that Berkeley wasn't included, but the homes shows epitomize America's love affair with these cozy, well-built structures.

Everywhere, water: ponds, fountains, pools... We can, on these pages, explore the tiled roofs, the thick stone exterior walls and the vine-covered loggia, the exposed wooden beams, luminous frescoes, courtyard gardens, ancient kitchens. It's all here in this seductive book that captures the essence of what is so special about the Tuscan style: stone, wood, earth, and water.

With such a great premise, the characters portrayed during three separate Junes over the period of a decade - and in a handful of lovely settings from Greece to Greenwich Village, Julia Glass's book is still a sterling read and provides fodder for long book group discussions.

She lives very unhappily with her elderly mother who has given her all to assure her daughter's success. Erika has a room of her own in the small apartment they share, a room in which she hides the secret yearnings of her stifled life. But mother and daughter share a bed - definitely a weird dynamic going on here, and it gets weirder. In return for her lifetime of sacrifice, the mother expects loyalty and devotion; Erika wants only to escape - but she's powerless to know how to do it - except by the excesses of her sado-masochistic desires. It's when she enlists the complicity of a young male student, Walter Klemmer, that things begin to veer into the truly disturbed corners of Erika's brain, cracking the fragile shell of a life thoroughly dedicated to control and perfection.<BR>Yowie!	2003-12-17

She is offered escape when she visits her Aunty Ifeoma, a university lecturer who is supporting her children on her small salary. A tragic conclusion slowly builds as old secrets and new tensions rise to the surface. As Kambili blossoms toward maturity, she questions values she once held as inscribed in stone.

There aren't a lot of `good guys' in this book; it's just that some of the bad guys are gooder than the badder bad guys!

The circumstances of each of these stories are odd, a fact that adds to their drawing power.

But this book by Caroline Knapp isn't about WHAT; it's about WHY.  Knapp's 1996 book, Drinking: A Love Story, chronicled her battle with alcoholism, whereas Appetites, a much more ambitious book, examines her early battle with anorexia, a condition which was referred to only peripherally in her previous book. According to Knapp's self-awareness revelations, the denial of food is a metaphor that explores the difficulties women have even acknowledging their deepest desires - desires for sex, love, freedom, professional recognition... just life. The message behind Appetites is made more poignant by the fact that Knapp died last year of lung cancer at age 42. Her book is full of wit and wisdom - and we can hope that before death, she came to appreciate those 2 qualities within herself.	2003-12-14

He wrote A Dangerous Place: California's Unsettling Fate as he was dying of cancer, and it's not just a benchmark of California's environmental history but also a profound and emotional valedictory effort. Living as I do within  mile of the grumbling and growling Hayward Fault, I found Reisner's projections of the cataclysmic effects of the Big One to be more than unsettling. Those of us who are priviledged or doomed to live in this glorious state cannot fail to take heed of the picture he paints of the likely events surrounding our upcoming tectonic hiccups, belches, and sneezes.<BR>The book is divided into 3 sections. The first retells Californias environmental history from the era of Junipero Serra's mission system right up to our own freeway system. The middle section deals with the fundamentals of plate tectonics. But it's that 3rd section that looks forward to (shudder) a hypothetical eruption of the Hayward Fault in 2005 that is most gripping.

The two old men were inseparable until an event occurred that irrevocably divided them and led to 4 decades of isolation from the world for both of them. The subject of this discourse, which took place over a dinner and extended thru the night in the General's Hungarian castle, was an analysis of the events that led up to the rupture of their friendship.<BR>The material flows like oiled silk, rolling on and on in a way that modern writers would doubtless have trouble duplicating. This brilliant translation does ample justice to the rich, evocative language. We readers can smell the old rooms (recently dusted), taste the dinner, see the old men thru the candlelight, hear the pitch and timbre of voices, sense the tension, and suspect the denouement - but even when it occurs as anticipated, there are more surprises in store, surprises that are rooted in the wisdom of old age.<BR>Don't miss this beautiful book.	2003-12-13

He's suing her, as the book-reading world knows by now, for something like defamation of character. I'm sure he thought she would extol his virtues; instead, she wrote honestly of the fiercely patriarchal Afghanistan/Muslim traditional family structure that keeps his tyranny intact and subjugates all women, regardless of their educational level or social status. <BR>The Bookseller of Kabul reads more like good New Journalism. It's not great literature; it's great reportage. But it gives a voice to the women in the extended Family (meant in the broadest sense of the word), a voice that speaks for millions of women in the Middle East, a voice that must be heard. Especially heartbreaking is the fate of Leila, sister of Sultan Khan, educated, literate, bright - but unable to speak up for herself to escape a lifetime of servitude.	2003-12-13

Deeper than it appears	This book is proof that each of us has plenty of material in our `ordinary' lives to use as material for writing a memoir. What most of us DON'T have, however, if Haven Kimmel's ability to write so well that what was really a very simple small-town childhood can be elevated to a 280-page book that utterly captivates. Kimmel achieves what many others have attempted to do and failed: she writes entirely from the child's voice without losing her audience, without becoming cloying, without making us want to smack her and say `get on with it.' By turns wickedly witty, humorous, poignant, sweet, heart-wrenching, wise, A Girl Named Zippy is simply one of the best books I've read this year, a poem to a happy childhood.<BR>I resisted it for over a year, fearing it was going to be a sappy, feel-good story.

He goes all the way back to Joseph Smiths violent journey to Utah where, no surprise, he receives a message from on high that bigamy is just fine with God. Krakauers ability as a writer to render the story right up front and in your face with superb dialogue and scene setting makes for a compelling read.

I read all of them and then just kept going, reading everything he's ever written. Maybe the Moon is one of his most poignant and one of his best.<BR>For this masterpiece, we have a change of venue from SF to LA, and instead of the broad humor with which Maupin painted the characters in the Tales series, he's delved deeply into the development of his protagonist, Cadence Roth, a dwarf. Although teensy, there's nothing small about her personality, a personality that is thwarted only by the fact that she rose to movie fame wearing a highly-recognizable costume in a famous sci-fi movie - and by contract she's forbidden from revealing her real ID. We follow her from one career disappointment to the next, and her personal life isn't very hopeful, either. In spite of a bit of a shocker ending, Maybe the Moon (great title, very apt) is really a paean of hopefulness for people who are different, and you end up smiling thru your tears.	2003-12-12

Well then, you'll love The Pursuit of Alice Thrift. Alice is socially inept and therefore utterly endearing - but get this: she's a Boston intern, hoping to do plastic surgery not on the blue-nosed matrons of Beacon Hill but on the city's poor. But Alice has problems in social situations and has trouble learning how to navigate the political hurdles of inner-hospital communication. Her roommate, a hunk of a pediatric nurse named Leo, tried to help. Then add to the mix a creepy Lothario and a truly vicious senior doctor - and it's a winner. I've worked in hospitals all my life, and Lipman knows her stuff. This book rings with realistic scenarios.	2003-12-12

The genesis of Reading Lolita in Tehran is a book club gathered into the home of Asar Nafisi, after she was expelled from university for refusing hijab. Many of the young women participating in the book club have also suffered under the repressive regime, some in jail, others in 'family cloisters,' although an interesting minority are religiously conservative. Through this extraordinary group of women who gathered to discuss forbidden works of Western literature, we learn about the lives of women in Iran and how exposure to literature can lead to rebirth.<BR>A book that defies genre, refuses to be categorized, Reading Lolita works as literature, memoir, history, anthropology, and philosophy. Highest recommendation for this beautiful and thought-provoking meld of life with literature.	2003-12-12

If you're a fan, you'll like Quentins, especially as it gathers in some favorite characters from her previous novels, so there's a sense of continuity, on an on-going story without end. <BR>The set-up: Ella Brady has been dumped by her unethical lover, and she pulls herself up by the proverbial bootstraps and gets involved with a documentary about Quentins, a Dublin restaurant whose increasing success over the past 30 years seems to parallel the changes in Dublin itself. <BR>The technique: Binchy uses a technique that has become increasingly popular in recent years. She tells her tale as a series of short stories, each with a different character as the main `player.'<BR>It all works pretty well as a good tale, but it ain't great literature. On the other hand, no one ever said it was.	2003-12-12

Trigiani. In this final installment of her trilogy, it feels at the outset that heroine Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney is finally on the right track. But if that's the case, there's no story - so of course Ave is wrong, and more adventures lie in wait. This time it's mostly mother/adolescent daughter Etta angst, and we watch as not only Etta matures toward independence, but also Ave, as she \\"redreams\\" her future and tentatively heads down yet another path on the map of Life.<BR>Earthy wisdom, wacky characters, and a good story await readers.	2003-12-12

Hey, I don't even like horses and don't understand those who do. But then I read a piece in the New Yorker by the author - took me reading halfway into the piece to realize she was Seabiscuit's author, and I was HOOKED - not on the book and the horse so much as on this Hillenbrand's personal courage (battling a crippling case of chronic fatigue syndrome for I forget, maybe like 2 decades?) and perseverance - and the sheer beauty of her writing.<BR>So. Okay. I read the book. And boy, am I ever glad I did, as it's stellar. Hillenbrand dives into the world of thoroughbred horse racing in this incredible story of Seabiscuit, who, I've gotta admit, I'd never heard of before. Apparently he wasn't a very promising-looking horse, and that's putting it mildly. Nor were the horse's owner, trainer, or jockey very promising. But somehow out of this sure-to-court-disaster scenario, they instead came up with a stupendous and heartwarming winner.<BR>And Hillenbrand has written a stupendous and heartwarming book about it.<BR>Don't miss it - even if you don't know a horse from a camel designed by a committee.	2003-12-12

Except for the women, and they steal the show. I know, I know: it's satire, but I'm sure someone of Irving's prodigious gifts and talents can do better with delving into the depths of the human condition. I mean, come on: he's already done it a thousand times over in his previous books.<BR>On the plus side: there're the typical romps through the complicated, twisted, quirky, and inter-twined Irvingesque explorations of all the various relationships involved. TV journalist Wallingford loses his hand to a lion, live on TV, and some fan wills his hand to Wallingford...just in case - and all too soon, he conveniently dies, Wallingford gets the hand, and the widow of the donor wants visitation rights.

Answer: Take the advice of Nancy Pearl, librarian, reviewer and reader par excellence. Paired with Sara Nelson's So Many Books, So Little Time, you're set up with super reading for the next few years, at a minimum. These two authors approach their craft differently, however: Nelson discusses how books affect her, while Pearl is more inclined to discuss choosing a book based on her already-present mood. Together, you're covered for every eventuality.<BR>And here's permission from an expert to do what many of us cannot give ourselves permission to do: quit reading a book after 50 pages if we're not enjoying ourselves. As hard as that is to act upon (\\"but surely it'll get better in another few pages...\\"), think about how many more books you'd have time to read if you skip the last 250 pages of every book you're really not loving.<BR>Perhaps Nancy Pearl's most innovative and imitated accomplishment was to suggest that all the readers within a certain group (hometown, college, newspaper subscribers, PTA, etc.) read the same book and join discussion groups about it. Making this task easier is Pearl's division of her books into about 200 categories, including some unusual groupings such as \\"Shrinks and Shrinkees.\\" Also invaluable to booklovers are the several \\"Too Good to Miss\\" sections in which Pearl discusses particular writers, why they are unique, and what specific books of theirs she would recommend. In this section are authors such as Iris Murdoch as well as many whom Pearl considers inadequately appreciated.<BR>Buy this book. And then begin looking forward to the sequel.	2003-11-30

Farmer founded an apolitical organization that's the only source of medical care for hundreds of thousands of peasants. For his Herculean efforts, in 1993 he received a Genius Grant from the MacArthur Foundation - and of course he plowed the money right back into his organization.<BR>That Farmer has chosen this path is not so surprising when one considers his unconventional childhood, which included living on a leaky boat and in a bus. As a scholarship student at Duke (anthropology major), he worked in the NC tobacco fields with Haitians. After graduation, he spent a year in Haiti and then went to Harvard Medical School. He's married and has a child, but he sees them infrequently; he rarely sleeps, is a workaholic (duh!), and seems to inspire an uncommon degree of devotion among his coworkers and his patients.<BR>Buy this book, and be aware that part of your money will doubtless find its way back to Haiti.

Heather McGowan deserves kudos, as do her publishers, for the bravery it took to select this book as a first novel. It's not an easy read, written in stream of consciousness with minimal paragraphing and punctuation. After reading maybe 5 pages, I admit I flipped through the rest of the book to see if it was ALL written like this (it was), then sighed and figured I was in for 'an experience.' One reviewer suggested reading it aloud, and I tried that with a page or two: it works very well. You have to be in a certain frame of mind to fall under the spell of this book - relaxed, trusting, and open to new experiences. When you get tripped up, as I did and as you will, with the lyricism of the writing in long looping-back-upon-themselves sentences, don't stop and reread - just go for it, keep reading along and letting the music and images carry you on this journey between childhood and adolescence.<BR>Okay. Enough about the style of the writing (experimental, I think, describes it well). The story is great. Catrine, a 13yo from Maine whose mother has recently died, is sent to a boarding school north of London that her father went to during WWII. He reminisces with her about the wonderful experiences he had there and about the excellent education she can expect to receive.<BR>Catrine, however, has a different experience, exposed to hazing, cruelty, cynicism, and the difficulty of always living as an outsider. She is troubled by the realization that she and a friend from her childhood may have caused a death, and she is confused by her the attentions shown to her by Mr. Gilbert, her chemistry teacher and the one person who seems to consider her special. Good stuff. <BR>I'll be curious to see in what style McGowan writes her next book.	2003-11-24

I mean, I'M old, and I read The Cry and the Covenant when I was a teenager, waaay before the era of feminism, women's rights, etc. And it blew me away. I'm sure it's partly responsible for my decision to go to nursing school, work in obstetrics, become a midwife, and write a memoir (Baby Catcher: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife) of my experience doing home births in Berkeley, CA.<BR>In a nutshell, it's a meticulously-researched tale of historical fiction about the life and ultimate death of Ignaz Semmelweiss during the era before the discovery of the germ theory. He noticed that women delivered at home by midwives usually lived, while those delivered by doctors in hospitals usually died. Hmmm, he thought (this was a man who lived way before his time, before the concept of scientific thinking had even been expressed), what's different about these two situations? Midwives work only with healthy women who deliver in their own beds. Doctors, wearing bloody aprons and showing off their bloody hands as badges of status and honor, went from the autopsy room to delivery room, where several women often lay on the same sheets before someone had time to change the bed linen. <BR>Semmelweiss set up a successful experiment, insisting that the medical students in his hospital ward wash their hands between patients. The women stopped dying.<BR>Did the other doctors proclaim him the new hero? What do you think? They did not. They instead castigated him for suggest that they do anything so demeaning as wash their hands - and they self-righteously refused to even consider that perhaps they themselves were the cause of childbed fever (puerperal sepsis) that killed more than half the women who came under their misguided care.<BR>Lister got the credit a generation later for proving the efficacy of aseptic technique (it's all about hand washing), but it was upon the foundation of Semmelweiss's pioneering groundwork that he built his edifice. By then, Semmelweiss was deadof madness brought on by utter despair and by his own hand: he exposed himself to the bacteria that caused childbed fever and died of it.<BR>God. Read this book. Then read the newest book on this subject, The Doctor's Plague, by Sherwin Nuland. I hope somewhere there's a statue of Semmelweiss or an obstetrical ward that bears his name.	2003-11-24

Germs hadn't been discovered yet, and the idea of washing their hands between doing an autopsy and delivering a baby was anathema to physicians, who strongly resented the implication that they were in any way `dirty,' or that they themselves were the cause of the deaths of between 20-50% of women under their care. Ignaz Semmelweis, an unknown Hungarian obstetrician, concluded that a procedure as simple as hand washing between patients could save nearly all of the women's lives.<BR>He was reviled, sank into despair and depression, and died of self-inflicted puerperal bacteria days after being admitted to a madhouse.<BR>Neuland's superb book updates a much older book on the same subject, The Cry and the Covenant. It documents beautifully an almost forgotten piece of medical history, as Semmelweis's discoveries were later eclipsed by Pasteur and Lister (who had the simple advantage of living after the discovery of the microscope and the acceptance of the Germ Theory).

Leave it to Jessica Mitford, who died in 1996, to make the subject of death and the American funeral industry so hilarious. First published to huge acclaim in 1963, The American Way of Death was revised and updated by Mitford, who nearly finished it by the time she died. Her lawyer husband, Robert Treuhaft, completed it with the help of some research assistants. Even a quick and cursory read of this book will make you take out a membership in the Neptune Society as a preemptive strike against high-pressure tactics of funeral home directors to get people (caught as their weakest as they are grieving over someone's death) to spend, spend, spend \\"to honor the memory of your dearly departed.\\"<BR>Mitford was known as the Original Muckraker for her habit of always speaking the truth, calling a spade a spade, and for probing into the cozy relationship between politicians, morticians, monopolistic ownership policies, the FTC, and federal lobbyists.<BR>Interesting, updated, still drop dead (pun intended) funny, endlessly informative, witty and well-written with refreshing bluntness, The American Way of Death once again deserves to be read by everyone.

A young woman he offers to advise might have been an old lover, but he seems to only vaguely recall snippets of a possible past relationship. Not only that, she has a child, and it just might be his.

In Love (have you EVER heard a more audacious title?), Morrison crafts a rich and dense novel that illuminates the full spectrum of desire. Bill Cosey, a charismatic dude if ever there was one, ran a ritzy seaside resort for African Americans in the wild and wooly 40s and 50s. But now he's dead, and the story becomes a portrait of his power, unusual for black men of his times, and its effect on those who came after him.<BR>Women. Oh, where would this story be without women? In Bill's wake, the women of his life vie for position, scrabbling over the will he wrote eons ago on a throw-away menu.<BR>If you love Toni Morrison's rich writing style, you won't be disappointed, but you might want to keep a pen and pad of paper handy to keep track of the loooong list of characters.	2003-11-19

Painstakingly researched, The Ohlone Way is an engrossingly readable study of the way the Native Americans of the Bay Area lived in peace, plenty, and harmony for centuries before the Spanish missionaries came in and annihilated an ancient way of life in the space of two generations. There was plenty of food (acorns from the oaks, birds, small game, fish, and shellfish), the tulle reeds furnished material for clothing, boats, and shelter, there was no cause for violence, and the weather was mild. Now and then I suppose an earthquake came along and knocked down a few tulle huts, but they rebuilt them the next day.<BR>Drive to the top of the hills above Berkeley on a clear day, look west toward the bay, San Francisco and Marin counties, and imagine no cities, just a land of plenty inhabited by many small widely-separated but inter-related tribes, little wisps of their fires rising skyward here and there...<BR>Then put back the freeways and bridges and houses and cars and people - and think about what we've done. Then go out and buy another book, Ishi in Two Worlds for the story of what became of the last of these people.	2003-11-18

The other one is The Ohlone Way, by Malcolm Margolin. Ishi was the lone survivor of a doomed tribe of Yahi Indians on the slopes of Mt. Lassen. Other members of his tribe were murdered by a planned campaign of genocide during the settling of the West. When Ishi stumbled out of the hills of his birth in 1911, he landed in the 20th Century, huddled in the corner of a cattle corral on a ranch, dressed in rags, starving, desperately lonely, and probably certain he would be killed. Instead, a wise sheriff in Oroville called on some anthropologists from Univ of CA in Berkeley, and Ishi eventually came under the benevolent but somewhat demeaning (he was made the centerpiece of a museum exhibit) protection of Alfred Kroeber. It is Kroeber's wife who wrote this touching, heartwarming, illuminating and ultimately tragic history of Ishi's life in the 'modern' world.<BR>Most moving for me was a long middle section that recounted a magical summer when Ishi took Kroeber and his teenage son back to Mt. Lassen and showed them his native territory. They lived together as unspoiled and free Native Americans for the summer, hunting deer, swimming in cold streams, living in huts and caves, building fires, making bows and arrows... An experience that was destined never to be repeated.<BR>Wonderful archival photographs supplement the imminently readable text.<BR>Don't miss this very special and quintessentially Californian piece of history.

Talk about a revelation. The Woman Warrior preceded Amy Tan's novels by at least a decade and went on to win several awards. It's about growing up Chinese American in California's Central Valley, working in the family laundry, and having to listen to her mother's stories that were designed to scare her into \\"good behavior.\\" Some of these \\"talk stories\\" depicted women as fierce and strong warriors, while at the same time they were enslaved by their culture.<BR>This memoir is intense, mystical, introspective, and full of marvelous and unexpected twists and turns.

Hannah, the teenager, sees ghosts in their house, which used to be on an island but was moved to the mainland. When the learns that a man was killed there  of a century ago and his daughter acquitted of the murder, the plot thickens.<BR>Then there's the other story, the story from the 1800s of that lonely daughter who married a quiet, uncommunicative man and moved to the island. <BR>The two stories and their parallel tragedies interweave in a stunning book.<BR>As a writer, what I found particularly admirable was the way the author moved from distant past (200 yrs ago) to more recent past (50 yrs ago) so seamlessly, often with nothing more than a paragraph break. It's not an easy stunt to pull off without jarring your readers; most authors choose a chapter break to leap 150 yrs back and forth.<BR>But it worked, as does the whole book about love, loss, and death, past and present.	2003-11-12

Of course when you're going to do something like that, you want a crackerjack team of people along to help out through the wild and dangerous spots, of which there are probably at least 2500 miles full of those two qualities along the 4200 mile journey. Whoever chose the team was smokin' something, because talk about your ill-assorted multinational party of eleven weirdos. Joe Kane, the sole American, came along as the journalist to document the whole affair - and he'd never paddled a whitewater canoe before in his life. His chances of even living thru the trip, let along being one of the four lone survivors (no, the others didn't all die; don't worry; they dropped out or were uninvited) were less than zero. Yet, improbably, he traveled every mile, even paddling thru wide still waters for days with a raging fever, and reached the Atlantic 6 months after beginning this odyssey.<BR>He has an understated way of writing of his spine-tingling adventures that's particularly suited for high adventure, stuff like extremes of weather, kamikaze bugs, killer rapids, armed guerrillas, fights between the various factions of team members, knee-deep mud, native Indians who'd never seen a white man before (were they cannibals?), cocaine dealers, etc.<BR>I read it twice and then even listened to it on book-on-tape, narrated by Kane himself. <BR>Wonderful.

Katherine Mary comes from a world of privilege and comfort. When she moves with her husband to the North Pole region, let's say it took a bit of adjustment.

Wall was privileged to grow up on a rancho in Old Big Sur, way at the back of a canyon. Before the coastal Highway 1 was built, the area put a new definition to the word `remote,' and Wall was one of many who refused to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the highway. Those people recognized that a whole way of life would disappear within a few years, and they were right.<BR>The first half of her book was most interesting to me. It deals with the historical colonial settlers of Mexican, Indian, and American heritages, how those three came together through business, ranching, and intermarriage to form the unique flavor and heritage of this special region. Wild regions tend to attract wild people, and Big Sur has always had its share of `characters.' It still does. Wall recalls from her own memory many of these people and brings them to life for us.<BR>The second half of the book concerns her own life in Big Sur, and while very interesting, it doesn't have the same historical significance and broad scope of the first half.<BR>A great piece of writing for those who wish to get a sense of the way it used to be down in 'Big South.'	2003-11-11

They're all there. Just get yourself a 4-wheel drive vehicle and go off road and have an adventure as you read each of his mystery tales. Right where he says the truck in his book went left into what looks like an untracked wilderness down a barely-visible double track leading to god knows where, sure enough, there those faint tracks in the dust appear.<BR>Set against the backdrop of the long-vanished Anasazi, Hillerman weaves a complex tale setting Anglo culture against the values of the Dinai, the Navajo tribal people.

Good opening ploy. But. Although I read it over just 3 days, I had trouble keeping the many characters straight, especially when the author sometimes referred to them only by first name, sometimes only by last name, and sometimes by both names. It sort of multiplied the # of characters x 3! Usually Grafton drops a few clues throughout the book, but this one had no trail leading to resolution till pretty close to the end, so I felt as though I was reading a good third of the book of 'writing' that really had not much at all to do w the plot or the solution to Who Killed Benny and Who Shot Mickey.

The most difficult and heartbreaking section relates the achingly sad story of her adoption and rearing of a little girl - and then losing her at the last minute when the mother recanted.	2003-11-02

Raleigh Hayes of Thermopylae, NC, discovers his father has absconded (after escaping from the hospital) with the family fortune and taken off for points unknown in an egg yolk-yellow Cadillac convertible. His companion of choice is a young female - no big surprise - but she's also a mental patient and of a race traditionally looked down upon in the Deep South. Raleigh, following clues on a left-behind list that give him 7 tasks to accomplish, sets off on what quickly and predictably becomes an odyssey. His sidekick is his friend Mingo, and the two of them quickly become the lead comedic characters in their own play as they wend their way toward New Orleans and a \\"planned\\" rendezvous - as if anything could really be planned when dealing with this wacko cast.<BR>Wonderful.	2003-11-01

Only the luminous writing of someone as gifted as Annie Dillard could render the coal industry town of Pittsburg so charmingly. In this quintessentially American book, Dillard captures the pain of growing up. Born into family wealth, she led a privileged childhood among large homes, shady streets, very wealthy grandparents, private school - and a very close and loving family.<BR>It's easy to sense that Dillard's mother was the primary force in her childhood, a woman of formidable interests and energies, questing curiosity, and the determination that her 3 daughters would not grow up as nothing more than the narrow-minded results of too much money and pampering. Dillard was certainly brilliant as a young child, focused and single-minded in her interest-du-jour; that her parents provided her the wherewithal to indulge her fascination with art, nature, music, and writing turns out to have been a gift to us all.<BR>But Pittsburg? Yes, Annie Dillard makes it a place I just might look forward to visiting some day - and that, alone, is a testament to her powers.	2003-11-01

Then, with no warning, came the announcement that \\"this will be her last submission to Gourmet,\\" as she had died unexpectedly and at far too young an age.<br />That's the first I learned that she'd written several novels, so I began reading all of them. A Big Storm Knocked It Over was her fifth and was published posthumously.<br />Happy All the Time is my favorite of her books, but this one is pretty damn good. Like all of Colwin's books, it's quiet and introspective. Jean Louise is a NY book designer whose boss, Sven, comes on to her all the time - and JL can't deny the attraction. But she's totally happily married to a calm and pretty ordinary chemist. Then she gives birth to a daughter, and her joy is complete - almost. She still has those unspecified hankerings, the feeling she's maybe missing something. It's Colwin's wisdom about relationships, her sharp eye of always watching, watching that make her books so special. Unlike this Big Storm, Colwin's books don't knock you over - but you find yourself thinking about them for a long time afterwards.<br />She is greatly missed.	2003-11-01

A secret kept just by his mother, one she then bound him to keep: that he was not the biological child of the cruel, abusive, alcoholic man he had always called `father.'<BR>Even as a child, Anderson knew he was different in every way from his older siblings. It was only after his father's funeral that he finally asked the question of his mother than had haunted him for years: Is this my real father? Her answer sent him on an intense examination of identity and life goals. <BR>Anderson, the chairman of Parade publications, relates his success story with humility and awe. Revealing his life through anecdotes that include stints in Vietnam to meetings with the world's movers and shakers, Anderson's  compassion and appreciation for mankind and its foibles are beautifully rendered.  <BR>Bound to become a coming-of-age classic.	2003-10-31

Tree of Life recounts Darwin's childhood from two points of view: his own and his father's. Terrific art work of various media take readers from the naturalist's youth to his long years of travel aboard the Beagle, where his then revolutionary ideas about the origin of species took root. He knew early on that publication of his theories would create a maelstrom. The unique pictorial presentation of this material is nearly as revolutionary as Darwin's thought processes. Though chronologically linear, it feels bold and sweeping in the process of presenting so much information in so small a space. It's a spectacular, visually exciting intro to Darwin's ideas of the natural world. You feel as though you're inside the great man's brain.	2003-10-30

But oboy, as she's giving us a serious lesson about the inner and cooperative workings of the natural world, what a wonderful story she weaves. The author focuses on one mountain in rural Appalachia (which the natives pronounce Appa-LATCH-a, I learned) and the valley at its base. She peoples it with 3 inner-related 'families,' to use the word loosely, whose connections are gradually strengthened and woven together by the end. <BR>First is Deanna Wolfe, a 40+ forest ranger, native of the valley, and staunch coyote lover. Into her world comes Eddie Bondo, a bounty hunter 20 yrs her junior, with whom she has a push-pull, love-hate affair.<BR>Then there's Lusa, a \\"bugologist,\\" newly married and quickly widowed scientist from Roanoke; she's saddled with her husband's 5 sisters and a determination not to become a tobacco farmer. Two wounded kids whose mother is dying and whose father has abandoned them are added to the family stew.<BR>And finally, we meet crusty old farmer Garnett Walker, who is trying to breed a blight-resistant strain of chestnut before he dies - and his arch enemy is Nannie Rawley, a crusader of organic farming.<BR>Readers will be seduced not only by Kingsolver's story-telling powers, but also by her powers of observation and depth of knowledge of the natural world.

Her life-changing experience begins when a young blond child appears with his Maori foster father. Written in a lyrical style that captures the music of the language in sudden bursts of interior thought, poetry, and tastes of Maori language, this book, if you let it, will carry you away. Before the appearance of this magical but disturbing child (who is mute), the woman, an unhappy and frustrated artist, has been sitting in a tower drinking away her misery. The child has a way of turning everything in his path upside down in terms of meaning. In The Bone People, author Hulme poses a number of intense questions.

As a nurse, I've worked with her in the Berkeley hospital where she based her practice. In my opinion, she should stick to obstetrics and leave the art and craft of writing to others. I began reading this book with anticipation, as I like mysteries and I love obstetrics. It started off poorly, but I knew what she'd earned as an advance, so I figured it'd get better.<BR>Wrong.<BR>It got worse. The characters are cut from cardboard, the writing is repetitive and trite, the book slogs from one cliche to the next, and it's way too melodramatic. If Dr. Cuthbert thinks this level of poor writing is what the market demands, then I don't believe she has much respect for her readers. I hope she has more respect for her OB patients. I kept reading, and I'm embarrassed that I wasted my time. It would have been more productive if I'd done a couple of loads of laundry.<BR>Don't waste your money.	2003-10-30

I was privileged to receive an advance reader's copy of this latest book by Amy Tan. In her novels, Tan uses material culled from her own life and her family's history. But I believe this is her first nonfiction book, and in it she displays the same qualities for which her fiction is so appreciated: humor, poignancy, revelation, a little magic - and always fascination with the world and our relationships within it. In The Opposite of Fate, she reveals herself. Especially moving is a part in which she realizes she only learned who her mother really was as she was writing her obituary. A collection of &quot;musings,&quot; more than a chronological memoir, The Opposite of fate is intimate, literary, and wonderful.	2003-10-30

She was returning from her father's funeral when she saw the hills in flames and made an attempt to save her manuscript. The lost novel was titled The Fourth Book of Peace, inspired by an ancient Chinese tale of three books that were deliberately burned.<BR>Her new book, The Fifth Book of Peace, deals with her efforts to come to terms with her own losses as well as an attempt to understand the suffering of those who are veterans and survivors of war. This luminous book is set in four sections: Fire, a firsthand report of the 1991 inferno; Paper, her search for the original books of peace; Water, a recreation of her lost novel about a couple who flees to Hawaii to avoid the Vietnam War; and Earth, Kingston's moving account of the writing workshops she organized for war veterans.<BR>Always a compelling writer, Maxine Hong Kingston has written a wise and spell-binding meditation on the power of Story and the challenge of living and acting on one's beliefs; she guides us toward peace without avoiding the fact that we live in a world at war.	2003-10-30

I don't know why I had this fascination with the 3 Catherines, 2 Annes, and one Jane from such an early age, but I surely wasn't alone. King Henry's eventful matrimonial history has driven writers and historians to delve into the psyche of this charismatic monarch for several centuries. Generally Henry is portrayed as a depraved glutton, seeking only his own pleasures and intent upon changing laws and religions to have his way. In this terrific new study, David Starkey argues that the king was made of simpler stuff, and was seeking happiness, as well as a son and heir. In the process, he made near cult figures of 6 women and changed the way a nation was governed. <BR>Thumbnail sketches of these women and their fates:<BR>Catherine of Aragon - Catholic , deeply religious, no male child in spite of many pregnancies and miscarriages. Henry divorced her (creating the Anglican church in order to do so) to marry wife #2.<BR>Anne Bolyn's greatest contribution was giving birth to Elizabeth I (who went on to be queen of one of England's greatest eras). She was the first queen to lose her head.<BR>Jane Seymour, whom Henry married the day Anne was executed. She gave birth to Edward VI, the long sought male heir, but he proved sickly, as did his mother, who died 12 days after giving birth.<BR>A brief marriage to Anne of Cleves, which ended in anullment. Grateful for her cooperation, Henry granted her several homes and a generous income; she enjoyed an unusually independent lifestyle and often visited court as an honored guest. It's said ale and gambling were her only vices.<BR>Catherine Howard, an adolescent flirt and a beauty, was Henry's ill-fated 5th wife. She made a fool of him when powerful court figures suggested she conceive a child by one of the many young men who sought her favors and pass that child off as Henry's. She lost her head as a result of that game.<BR>Catherine Parr, a shrewd and brilliantly powerful woman who outlived Henry.<BR>Superb in every way.	2003-10-29

They have it tough in Houston's world, and no wonder. Sometimes even she agrees that she probably treats her dogs better than she does her men.<BR>However, while her women are gutsy, they are still vulnerable, still learning, still making mistakes, and the biggest seems to be falling for inaccessible men. As her character says in the title story of this collection, \\"I've always had a thing for cowboys...but they're hard to find these days, even in the West.\\"<BR>Full of gender-heavy wisecracking, Cowboys are My Weakness will have you laughing, groaning, and crying.

Here's a good scene: on her first foray into the property in years, she stumbles into a cruddy pond and comes up holding hands with some dead guy. Turns out he's a black journalist writing about stuff from the 30s. Things get deeper and murkier when the  man's sister asks Warshawski to investigate the murder.<BR>I get the feeling that Paretski has done some fantastic research in the writing of this book, as the content spans cultures, generations, and politics over 70 yrs as she proves that prejudice is alive and well in our world.<BR>No big surprise there, but she does it so very, very well.	2003-10-29

Okay, I thought that $1.95 was a misprint, and I bought it just to get a bargain. But omigod, talk about a bargain! At ten times the price, this book would be a bargain. It's not going to teach you to speak Spanish. It's not going to help you conjugate Spanish verbs. It's not going to make you fluent or able to read the newspaper in Zihuatenejo. But know what? It's going to make your next foray into a Spanish-speaking country a whole lot easier. <BR>Overall, it's a dictionary, but there are subsections like food, colors, travel, clothing, and within those sections things are arranged alphabetically. Each word is used in a whole sentence (many of which are very handy sentences to have at your disposable) with translation, of course.<BR>Anyway, stop reading this review and buy this book. Hell, at this price, buy 10 and give them to everyone in your family the next time you go south of the border.<BR>Highest recommendation, and an utter steal at this price.	2003-10-29

Corelli's Mandolin is history, romance, mystery, tragedy, comedy, literature, a war story, odyssey, yada-yada. Read it; you won't regret it. Just don't make the mistake of seeing the movie; it's the worst piece of miscasting of Nicholas Cage you can imagine. Once you've read the book, you'll know what I mean.<BR>Set on the Greek island of Cephalonia, the story begins in the early days of WWII before Mussolini's invasion. The `heroine' Pelagia, daughter of the island's doctor, is being taught the healing arts by her father. Then comes the invasion, and Corelli, the Italian commanding officer who takes a cynical view of war (says Heil Puccini instead of Heil Hitler and has his troops singing opera at every opportunity), is quartered in the doctor's house. An affair ensures, but the ugliness of war affects them, as it does everyone else. <BR>To say more would be to say too much, for remember: it's a bit of a mystery.<BR>Louis de Bernieres's other novels soar off into magical realism, but Corelli's Mandolin is grounded in reality, showing, as it does, the nature of war from many different perspectives.<BR>Highest recommendation.	2003-10-28

And could there possibly be a better title than he has chosen? No other words adequately describe his situation when the other climbers, struggling themselves to survive against terrible odds, found him, determined he was dead, made it down to shelter, and told everyone else that Beck Weathers had died. Indeed, nine climbers did die, but Beck Weather was not among them. After spending 18 hrs in exposed sub-zero conditions, he miraculously regained consciousness, stood up, and walked into camp. Horribly damaged both physically and mentally by the experience, Dr. Weathers was urged and supported throughout his long and painful recovery by his wife, from whom he was estranged at the time of the 1996 expedition.<BR>In this deeply personal story of estrangement and redemption, Beck Weathers tells a terrific tale that further fleshes out Krakauer's book	2003-10-26

Clare chooses to do so, cuts herself off from past relationships, while her friend Irene, chooses to remain within the culture of her birth, married a black man and gives birth to 2 sons. Clare's choice is complicated when she married a white bigot who has no suspicion of his wife's origins. Irene's is complicated by her desire to put the violence of her racial past behind her.<BR>By chance, the two women meet again, and hypnotic, powerful Clare moves into Irene's circle in ways that threaten both of their lives. More than a story of passing, hypocrisy, and adultery, Passing is a complex story of origins, history, and acceptance.	2003-10-26

How does she do it?<BR>The great theological question of God's existence seems to be at the heart of everything she writes about, whether it's bugs or babies, glaciers or galaxies, politics or polecats, leaf mold or love letters. She takes such great risks with her writing, letting the subject matter soar on the finest of threads way out into space, far from the central point at which she began - but then, just when you think she's truly gone off course and over into some abyss from which she'll never return, she finds her way home within the writing and ends up with a gorgeous piece of writing that hangs perfectly together. I ask again: how does she do this?<BR>I know, actually: She's a whole lot brighter than most of the rest of us, and thank God she uses her vast curiosity and even more vast intelligence to share her thoughts with us as she ruminates on the eternal questions of God, Life, Death, and the Human Predicament.<BR>Essentially a collection of loosely woven disparate essays, For the Time Being, like all of Dillard's books, is written with lyricism, erudition, intelligence, and humor.

It's a comic melodrama, typical of some of McMurtry's best stuff, that grabs up some unwashed heathens from the mountains and some arrogant English nobs, stirs them altogether on the banks of the Yellowstone River in the middle of the 1800s, and then stands back to watch with high glee as they try to get everything straightened out.

At age 34, teacher and painter Rosa seems to be undergoing an identity crisis: who is she to herself, who is she when she's alone? Never really having been alone before, she buys a house and tries it out. Finding herself pregnant with her 2nd husband's baby, she determines to bear and raise it alone. In spite of her flaws and weaknesses (which only make her a more compelling protagonist), Rosa continues to bravely ask questions, knowing there might be no answers forthcoming, about the roles and values she is expected to live by.<BR>Provocative.	2003-10-16

Nobody writes internal family bitchy dialogue better than RMB, and she's off and running at top speed in Six of One. Love and war are nothing when it comes to sibling rivalry in a small town. Cora is the mother of this contentious clan of spirited, cranky, opinionated women. Spanning years from the early 1900s to the 1980s, the book alternates between past tense for the old years and present tense (told in the POV of Nickel, the bisexual daughter of Juts, one of the feuding sisters) for the more modern years.<BR>Wonderful, nearly epic, and very very funny.	2003-10-15

Perhaps Lytton Strachey was the first to create \\"the new biography,\\" not wrapping his subjects in flowery adjectives as was the style of his times, but instead skewering them with sarcastic and scathingly funny written portraits. And, as he seemed on intimate terms with Everyone Who Was Anybody during the early 1900s, his book created quite a stir. Far from confining his critiques to people, Strachey also lambasted the stilted mores, the hypocrisy, and the severely limiting lines of social strata of his era.<BR>Although it's dated, of course, Eminent Victorians makes terrific reading for anyone interested in that era before everything changed with the First World War.	2003-10-15

Never diving into melodrama, the book follows the story of a woman and her 2 children who move to an internment camp after her husband is arrested on conspiracy charges. Enduring the filth and cramped quarters of the camps for 3 years, she eventually returns to Berkeley to a hostile welcome and a home that has been vandalized. <BR>It's the matter-of-fact tone of the writing (in the face of blatant injustice) that is so compelling. Anger has no place in the voice of the author; she leaves it to her readers to experience the passion of her unspoken rage for her.<BR>Superb.	2003-10-15

No, I'll go further: it's one of maybe 8-10 books I'd choose to take to a deserted isle. I've put The Kite Runner directly into the hands of perfect strangers in book stores and said, \\"Read this one.\\" <BR>In a nutshell, Amir, the son of a well-to-do Afghani , has a best friend, Hassan, who is the illiterate child of Amir's father's long-time servant. Both children are motherless. A horrific event, a secret kept, the loss of personal honor, and a lie come between the boys. From that rift, the story moves forward as Amir and his father emigrate to California, where Amir matures, marries, and becomes a successful writer, but is still plagued by those old sins and lies. Then comes a revelation of still one more long-held secret that sets Amir on a return trip to Afghanistan (now under the worst years of Taliban dominance) to rescue Hassan's child. Author Hosseini doesn't shy from one iota of unpleasantness, and the result is a book with a perfect narrative arc, a sterling story line, unforgettable characters, and and and and... I had the opportunity to meet the author very briefly (just to shake his hand and gush a bit about his extraordinary book) at Books by the Bay in San Francisco and am delighted to report that he is charming, approachable, and thoroughly engaging. He deserves all the accolades that are coming his way.<BR>Buy The Kite Runner. Read it. Then go back to the store and buy 2 more signed 1st editions - one to keep as an investment and one to give to your best friend.<BR>...what a fine book!	2003-10-09

Noah's son-in-law, believing the spark has gone from his marriage, improbably seeks Noah's advice on how to woo Jane back.

Having been diagnosed during her teenage years with bipolar disorder, she'd never quite come to grips with her condition and felt misunderstood and unable to live the normal life she craved. So she took off to travel and found her way home. Detour is a fast-paced memoir, unlike most in this genre of self-absorption, and manages to demystify the aura of mental illness.<BR>It's good, really good.	2003-10-05

The room gets darker with each page, the hands of the clock progress. The mouse is always there, but it is sometimes hard to find him. The kittens get drowsy, and so does the bunny. There's less mush in the bowl. And most of all the moon rises; in each picture it's a little higher above the windowsill.<BR>Simply brilliant.<BR>Always enough to make a tired parent drowsy, for sure, and usually it works for the child, too!

To her horror, she finds herself in an honest-to-God drug rehab program - and she's pretty much stuck there. Hard to imagine a story based on this premise being funny, but since the Irish M.

Turns out Enda and Kevin Dennehy lived a lie for 50 years by pretending to be married. Kevin refuses to marry her at the end, and also refuses to say why. So it's left to Enda to tell Father Declan \\"the all of it,\\" and tell it all she does.

Heat-Moon's journey was precipitated by the double whammy of learning he'd lost both his job and his wife at just about the same time, and he figured, as he felt he'd also lost a sense of direction for his life, that perhaps travel, reflection, and writing might cure what ailed him.<BR>Some have said the book, now almost 30 years old, is dated - and of course it is. But what makes it even more interesting nowadays is, reading it, you can kind of track the process of how America got from what it was then to what it is now. It's a bit scary.	2003-09-26

But she has a secondary agenda: she's seeking passion, adventure, excitement. She gets her wish in spades when a nun places into her hands a pornographic volume bound as a prayer book. The novel could have stayed on the surface of this story, remaining nothing more than an adventure/romance. Author Hellenga, however, digs deeper, and readers come away with a great feeling for the city of Florence, for the art of book preservation, for wall frescoes, and for European city life.<BR>Splendid.	2003-09-26

It became so bad that she felt her brain stopped working for a time.<BR>The most fascinating parts of this book are those that take the reader back into Poland for a behind the scenes glimpse of the 'good life' lived by the middle class. Altho the whole family, plus a live-in maid, lived in just 3 rooms, they lived well, attending the theater and opera regularly. All this, of course, ended when Poland's gov't began persecuting Jews in the late 50s.<BR>Fortunately for her and for us, Hoffman recovered from her period of despair and depression and went on to become editor of the New York Times Book Review.	2003-09-26

There are parts of New Mexico that, if you know of the woman, just scream This is Georgia O'Keeffe Country. This honest and admiring biography lays out the story of this incredible woman who lived to age 99. That's a long, long, long life. Her life found its trajectory when, in 1916, a friend sent some of her drawings to renowned photographer Alfred Stieglitz. He proclaimed her to be \\"a woman on paper.\\" Furious (as only O'Keeffe could be furious), she confronted him, became his lover, and eventually married him, initiating an emotional and artistic collaboration that endured until his death.<BR>O'Keeffe became a feminist before the word was even invented. When she realized that it would be impossible to become her own person while working in his shadow, she established the pattern of spending 6 months with him in NY and 6 months on her own in New Mexico, a place she always referred to as her spiritual home. Stiegitz died in 1946, and O'Keeffe lived on for another incredible half a century.<BR>If you have the opportunity to visit New Mexico, don't miss the O'Keeffe museum in Santa Fe - and my all means visit her home in Abiqueque.

Much of her material bubbled to the surface during the long hours on the road driving to schools to teach poetry. Glancy makes us feel we're accompanying her on her journeys, peeking over her shoulder - no, peeking into her mind as she explores memories and their relevance to the present.<BR>Here's a telling line: \\"Aren't all of us made up of paradox and diversity, anger, hurt, hope, guilt, endurance?\\"<BR>This is not an easy book.

She lived for less than 50 years (1907-1954) but cast a wide swath through the artistic, political, historical, and revolutionary times of her brief era. Born of German/Mexican heritage in Mexico City, her early years were influenced by the Mexican revolution and polio. Her life was changed forever when she was severely injured in a trolley car accident: a steel handrail pierced her body, and she was broken in every sense of the world. During her long convalescence, she lay on her back and began to paint self-portraits. Eventually, she joined the Communist party, was introduced to Diego Rivera - and thus began the secone life-changing experience. Rivera, 41yo and already famous, captivated her - and was simultaneously captivated. They soon married, and in spite of probably one of the most tumultuous relationships within the history of artistic and volatile couples, they remained devoted to each other (in their own fashion) till Kahlo's premature death.<br />Life wasn't perfect for Frida Kahlo, but no one can say she didn't give it her best shot.	2003-09-24

In order to announce this fact to the world, she chose to write about herself in the words of her whatever, lover, Alice B. Toklas (probably secondarily most famous for her marijuana-laced brownies during those flower-power hippie years).<BR>Stein's writing is, um, difficult. Yeah, difficult. And convoluted and innovative and unusual in the extreme - and totally egocentric. This purported autobiography of Alice B. is in reality the autobiography of Gertrude Stein. Here's the most famous line from the book: \\"I may say that only three times in my life have I met a genius and each time a bell within me rang and I was not mistaken.\\" One of the 3, of course, was herself, Gertrude. Sheesh. Fortunately, sublime conceit is tempered with wit and irony, which makes the reader willing to continue slogging thru this epistle.<BR>It ain't easy, though. While this 'autobiography' is one of Stein's most accessible works, it's still pretty hard going for the average literate reader. I think we can thank posterity that this particular experimental style of writing didn't prove to be universally popular.<BR>For a wonderfully original take on the relationship between Toklas and Stein, read the wickedly innovative The Book of Salt.	2003-09-23

And we wonder how he can possibly get out of his own personal nightmare of having become a hit-and-run driver. This guy is an attorney, and he not only covers up his own involvement in the case, but he also finds himself defending in court the transient who is wrongly accused of the crime.<BR>Talk about twisted!<BR>Lies begin to pile up and we find ourselves feeling both sympathy and disgust for Jason, the killer/lawyer.

History, fact, and narrative were balanced by realistic dialogue and vivid scenes.<BR>David Rose had a normal childhood, became a jock, married, and had a son. At several points in his life, he fantasized about being a woman, occasionally donning womens clothing in private, and even Dave/now Donna acknowledges that the early years of his marriage and the years after the birth of his son were some of the happiest and most fulfilling of her life.<BR>But always, somewhere within lurked the gender bender tiger, and inevitable the tiger pounced. Dave became driven to face these difficult issues and explore the much misunderstood need to become the woman he had always felt himself to be.<BR>Excellent story-telling. Astounding photos.<BR>For a very different style of telling this uncommon tale, read Jan Morriss Conundrum. Unlike Donna Rose, Morris is a thoroughly experienced and superb writer. Her tale of the same journey is lyrical, passionate, funny, and so literary itll knock your socks off. Without Morriss book out there as the gold standard, Id have given Wrapped in Blue 5 stars. But for a 4-star read, its darned good.	2003-09-23

It's just not a book to read casually. You've got to concentrate and pay attention and read long chunks at a time.<BR>Dissatisfied with the official account of her lovers death in WWI, crippled artist Mathilde sets out to learn the truth. Here's the deal: five soldiers were condemned to death for self-mutilation. The manner of their execution was odd: they were forced into the no-man's-land between the French and German lines and left to fend for themselves. Everyone assumed they would all quickly die, but it seems at least one didn't . And there's confusion about his identity. And there's the fact that one of the buried men was wearing German boots, so what's that all about?<BR>A spellbinding and enchanting story, Japrisot's A Very Long Engagement is a little of everything: history, mystery, romance, intrigue, and all done in a splendidly literary style.<BR>This book was translated from the French, which may account for a small bit of the obscureness of the writing. But oh boy, is it worth sticking with it. If you're not smokin' anything, not drinkin' anything - if you're paying attention all the time, you're in for a superb reading experience.	2003-09-23

It concerns Italian painter Artemisia Bentileschi. While few concrete facts are known about her, she has fascinated art historians for centuries. Anna Banti, when she began writing her manuscript for the 2nd time, was influenced by her own experiences, and she elected to challenge the boundaries of traditional biography. Artemisia is fleshed out. Neither true biography (obvious, given the paucity of facts) nor historical fiction, Artemisia dives into spurts of detail to capture the feelings and images of `truth,' rather than to pin down verifiable `facts.' Such is the new genre: creative nonfiction, tho Banti definitely and admittedly takes liberties. Truth With Privileges would be a good description.<BR>Artemisia is a rich, complex, and extremely thought-provoking book that demands the reader's careful attention.<BR>Spectacular, but challenging.	2003-09-23

Also, Conroy's writing is understated, haunting, and lyrical, even when he's talking about pretty brutal and gritty stuff. It's a must-read for anyone who wants to study the art of the memoir. First published in 1967, it still rings with the truth of boyhood and adolescence during a certain time in America.<BR>The facts are not so terribly remarkable: He grew up poor, was bright but didn't do well in school, moved around a lot, his father died when he was 12, and he didn't get along with his stepfather (who, after Conroy's mother left, moved an insane girlfriend into the home). Okay, all that makes a good enough tale - but what really elevates it to high art is Conroy's skill as a writer, his ability to take a teensy memory or detail and expand it into something utterly remarkable.<BR>Read it.	2003-09-23

Written in 1939, How Green Was My Valley has become a bittersweet coming of age tale of a boy growing up in a large family in a small town, and of his love for his lovely sister-in-law. This is a coal mine story, so you just know there's going to be some tragedy involved, and of course there is. The story is written from the depths of the author's heart and soul. No wonder it won an Oscar when it was made into a movie.<BR>If you've never read it, do it now. If you read it 40 years ago, read it again. It won't be stale.	2003-09-23

Dinner table conversation at my house with my husband and me and our 3 kids sharing the table often included topics such as teen sex, birth control, AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, the effects of various recreational drugs on pregnancies, herpes  - the kind of stuff that, I strongly suspect, is NOT discussed in normal tone of voice over the meat loaf and mashed potatoes served for dinner in Iowa or Tennessee - or much of anywhere except in homes where midwives, doctors, and nurses live.<BR>The point that Levine is trying to make in Harmful to Minors is that trying to protect young people from sex can actually increase the chance of putting them in the way of sexual danger. Abstinence-based sex education leaves kids without the information they need to make smart choices - and Levine presents documentation to prove this point.<BR>Adults MUST take responsibility for providing their children with LOTS of detailed and accurate information. It's a big and scary world out there, and to send forth a child with no information beyond `Just Say No' (to drugs, sex, wild kids, rock and roll, whatever) is to leave them woefully ill-equipped to handle themselves once they've got a car and a key of their own.<BR>Harmful to Minors is equal to - no, better than - a college course in Preparation for Life. But in all honesty, don't wait for college, no way. It should be read by the parents of every 9th grader in the country. And then do this: Just leave it laying around the house in a prominent place. Your kids will pick it up. I guarantee it. And that's GOOD.	2003-09-23

Faulks goes much deeper by creating complex characters that we grow to really care about. The story leaped from the trenches of WWI to modern-day England without breaking the story thread. It's a dense novel, loaded with thick feelings and philosophy, and as such is probably not for everyone; it's not an easy or casual read. The landscape of both the book's story and the writing is alternately lushly idyllic or lice-ridden gritty. If you know nothing about the use of WWI tunnels when you begin reading this book, by the end you'll probably consider yourself an expert.<BR>And when you've finished this book, hurry right out and buy Sebastien Japrisot's A Very Long Engagement. Together, both books contribute beautifully to our awareness of the nightmare of what many call The Great War.	2003-09-22

Okay, ladies: in spite of the title, go right out and buy this book. If you've ever complained that you just don't understand what makes men tick, The Sportswriter was meant exactly for you.<BR>Frank Bascombe's young son has just died, his marriage has crumbled, and his promising career as a novelist has failed - and the guy's only in his late 30s. Depressing, right? Right. For sure. Sooooo, why bother, you might ask? Answer: Frank has a rich inner life that makes you want to stick with him. This is where his problems originate. We know he is sensitive (these days, we'd say he has a well-developed feminine side) and cares about the pleasures of life's small moments - but he's got a typical male problem: He can't express this side of himself to those closest to him, resorting to moral dishonesty rather than expose himself as a caring human.<BR>Read it, ladies. Then read the sequel, Independence Day, which won the Pulitzer in 1996. But read this one first. It's important.	2003-09-22

She was so taken with everything about the place that she became a cowherd, which gave her time to write about the American West. Reading her books, however, is very much like seeing a film, for her filmmaker's eye and awareness of nuance and gesture is evident in the way she chooses her words.<BR>In The Solace of Open Spaces, Erlich presents us with an eclectic bunch of frontier characters that she met while working as a ranch hand. Almost unaware of what's been accomplished, we readers find ourselves shedding former stereotypes of these people in exchange for seeing them for what they are: unique, quirky, interesting, inexplicable men and women. The Weather (and the word deserves that capital letter, as you'll see upon reading the book) plays as large a role as the people in Ehrlich's book.<BR>About the title: When she arrived in Wyoming, Erlich was grieving the death of someone important to her. As she works hard at physical labor, meets new people, falls in love with the land, and sheds her past like sweat running down her back, healing from grief occurs - although she doesn't exactly say this.<BR>Altogether, a beautiful book and a wonderful read.	2003-09-22

Her lover's friends don't exactly welcome her and no matter how hard she tries, Sarah always seems to be committing some social gaffe.

A court case resulted from the publication of this book, which tells you just how funny and potentially devastating it is. Her ex got a court order that she could never again write about him or their children. In the novel, instead of being a journalist, essayist, and humorist, the protagonist is a cookbook writer, so there are plenty of recipes sprinkled throughout. Published in 1983, Heartburn marked a turning point not only in Ephron's personal life but also in her writing career as she immediately gained entry into the film world as a writer, director, and producer. She wrote the screenplay for the movie based on this book - but don't see it. It's too angry; all the hilarity and subtle humor and caustic asides are missing.<BR>I own a 1st edition of this book, and I'm NEVER selling it.	2003-09-22

Turns out she lives in my neighborhood, Oakland, so perhaps I'll run into her at Peet's coffee near the Claremont some day.<BR>I don't usually read short stories, but these aren't exactly short stories. Rather, they are mood pieces, exquisite slices of life captured with lovely language. Most of them made me stop at the end, look out the window, and sigh with a smile before getting up to refill my coffee cup. <BR>The title story, The White Coat, is about an ermine fur coat once used to hide Jews fleeing from the Nazis; when Frank's character tries on the coat, she disappears for a time, lending a slightly slippery quality to the story. She uses this somewhat otherworldly aspect in some of her other stories, too, which only heightens their lyrical and magical qualities. Absolutely lovely.	2003-09-22

The wonderful character list includes the usual reservation cops, and a lady interest for both Leaphorn (whose beloved wife has died) and Chee (who took fer-frikkin'-ever to get over Janet Pete, his first love). But just as strong a character is the land itself, always a forceful and important presence in TH's wonderful books. There's even mining geology information in Hunting Badger. What you get in a good Tony Hillerman book is more than a story with memorable characters told in economical prose; you also get vivid mental pictures of the bleak beauty of the Southwest, insightful glimpses of Navajo culture, geology and geography lessons, and spiritual shaman lore.<BR>For character development and follow-through, don't read this first; go back at the very beginning of this Leaphorn/Chee series and start with the first one. But if you just want a good book to read on the plane and this is the one that's available in the airport bookstore, then go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it.	2003-09-21

In language that rings with authenticity and the sounds and rhythms of the Indian people, her books are full of rich imagery. You can almost smell the tumeric, see the saffron robes, hear the finger bells, and taste the cardamom and the curry.<BR>Arranged Marriage, a short story collection, is a good place for readers new to Divakaruni to begin to appreciate her; it a lovely addition to the bookshelves of those who already count her as one of our most important contemporary authors.	2003-09-21

One of the true childhood classics, Paddle-To-The-Sea is a rare entity: a cross genre book for kids. The story of the little carved Native American canoe's trip from the North Country to the Sea is an adventure story, a geography lesson, a history lesson, and in some ways, it's even a romance. There are wonderful drawings, accurate maps - and an utterly engaging story.

She deals with such grand themes as guilt, choice, opportunity, love, and loss.

A Yellow Raft in Blue Water is the story of an Indian mother, daughter, and granddaughter torn by disturbing secrets yet bound by love. The varying perspectives allow us to see each woman's point of view. The voice of Rayona, the mixed-race teenager, is particularly engaging, especially in her nearly epic journey to visit her weirdo mother in the hospital.<BR>Once you've gotten your feet wet on this husband/wife writing team, I suspect you'll want to read everything they've written, as I did. And if you have an opportunity to hear Louise Erdrich speak, take advantage of it; she's wise, articulate, and gifted - a real winner with audiences.	2003-09-21

Annie Dillards lovely book focuses on her experiences living at the edge of Tinker Creek in Virginias Blue Ridge mountains. Its a lyrical ode to nature and also a meditation on our ability - or inability - to appreciate the natural world that surrounds us. For a book this thoughtful and thought-provoking, its interesting that its at times both very funny and very violent.<BR>This is a good book to keep on your bedside table and read in 50-page spurts between reading other books. It lends itself to thoughtful musing and shouldnt be raced through at one long reading. Colorful anecdotes (about such things as the sexual habits of the praying mantis) are interspersed with questioning our ability to stay truly within the moment, to achieve ultimate awareness of our surroundings. <BR>Dillard, a consummate writers writer, can be both romantic and irreverent. She rhapsodizes at one moment, then at the next writes, Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly; insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another.<BR>You gotta love it.

We meet 6yo Claude, trapped in a NY apartment all day while his mother drives a taxi. He discovers an old piano in his basement apartment and learns to play. As his talent is recognized, interesting people come into his life and help him along the way toward recognition as a prodigy. As a bonus, the story is set in New York in the 30s thru the 60s, so weget a sociology lesson in inner city life of that era.<BR>Also, read Conroy's engaging memoir, Stop-Time.	2003-09-20

Author Jung Chang, who now lives in London, leads readers through the traumatic events that befell her family members as the Communist revolution overwhelmed the country. Even if you think you understand the far-reaching and pervading effect of Chairman Mao's edicts, I guarantee your eyes will open even wider as you read the 500 pages of Wild Swans.<BR>Although Mao's rise to power destroyed the corrupt Kuomintang and brought quick relief from their brutality, subsequent events proved the truth of the old axiom, Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, for Mao created a maelstrom that ultimately resulted in the deaths of 40 million Chinese. The country plunged into years of famine, torture, and chaos.<BR>Written by a member of the Red Guard and the granddaughter of that concubine introduced in the beginning, Wild Swans will stand the test of time.	2003-09-20

With pleasure, I awaited each issue to see if another of her wonderful columns would appear. Then, in 1992 came the sad announcement of her untimely death at age 48. It was then that I discovered she wasn't only a food writer of incomparable wit and wisdom; she was also a novelist. So I began reading everything she'd written. My favorites are A Big Storm Knocked It Over and this one, Goodbye Without Leaving. <BR>Geraldine Coleshares gives up grad school at the Univ of Chicago to become the only white backup singer for a R&amp;B group, the Shakettes. Her days with the band, life on the bus and on the road, make everything that comes after (marriage, kids, a job) pale by comparison. Told mostly in retrospect, Geraldine's story is a never-boring exploration of  such potential clichs as family, friendship, career, parenthood, and love.<BR>Terrific. Read it, and then read her other ones.	2003-09-20

She creates four very different people and tosses them together in a Chicago apartment building - then allows us to sit back and watch what happens. We've got a Polish immigrant who's a caretaker for an African American jazz musician, and we've got a young woman with secrets who is a caretaker for a sick Jewish gangster. Sound interesting?

But then, people who at first glance seem strikingly glamorous turn...well, weird. This book and its author have the potential of developing a cult following. It begins with Walker, a screenwriter living in Vienna, meeting Maris, a model on the run from a potentially violent lover. The two fall in love, and then author Carroll begins leading us and them down bizarre and frightening paths - all the while making sure we're laughing at every twist in the path.<BR>Don't think you've got the tone of this novel figured out; the author's about to pull the rug out from under you. But you'll willingly suspend belief and go along for the magic carpet ride, I betcha.	2003-09-20

I always turn the last page over, and go, `Huh? Where's the rest of it?' But I make an exception for some authors, and Alice Munro is one of them. The Beggar Maid is a collection of stories that verges on some vague new definition of The Novel. It's full of unexpected time leaps in time and even more unexpected transformations of the constant characters. It's all a bit mysterious, confusing, suggestive - and altogether exhilarating. Munro weaves, picks apart, reweaves, then interweaves these stories about two women over a span of 40 years. They are prudish and suspicious Flo, and Rose, her stepdaughter, an awkward pathetic creature who somehow pulls herself out of her stultifying home town and embarks on her own life out in the big bad world.	2003-09-19

The story is told exclusively through the voice of 5yo Lucia, so the whole odd event is full of images, hints, suspicious, limited observations, and wishes more than on concrete facts. Mom's lovers and the neighborhood street performers, missionaries, beggars, hashish, henna, and holy men add to the exotic atmosphere of this book. The child is mother to the adult for most of the movie, and Lucia yearns for nothing so much as a normal mum to take care of her and send her to school and help her with her homework. Instead, Mum goes off to seek Sufi enlightenment - and comes very close to misplacing one of her children forever.	2003-09-19

Two friends meet at the cremation of Molly Lane, a woman they 'shared.' One is a newspaper editor, the other is a composer. There's a 3rd guy, too, a politician. Then skullduggery enters the stage: the editor discovers photos of the politician in drag among Molly's things, and engages in a moral debate with himself about whether to publish them or not. There are several other issues, as well, that contribute to the book's focus on art, morals, politics, greed - and soon the two friends are bitter enemies. <BR>Not nearly as good as Atonement, IMO, but still very, very good.	2003-09-19

When he is released to return home - he finds everything changed: his family, his marriage, his country, and his world.

The main character is mysterious enough to keep us guessing about his background and motives. Why is this obviously wealthy man willing to take a position as a servant in a London household? Set in Dickens's London and times, and based on Dickens' Great Expectations, there is nevertheless none of the stuffy and verbose excess of that era. Carey's writing is crisp and to the point without destroying the flavor of foggy London, circa 1800.<BR>Carey also wrote Oscar and Lucinda, which won Britain's Booker Prize, so don't think Jack Maggs was written by just any mystery hack.	2003-09-19

I mean, when the book starts out with a little kid's parents being electrocuted in the Tunnel of Love and her being sent off to be raised by two bachelor uncles (one of whom is a transvestite), you just have to go with the flow. Things flow along, and Elray (that's the girl - don't ask about the silly name) meets Raoul, who introduces her to the concept of sexuality; then she meets Granny Harwood, long dead - but she's not. Then she meets...well, just read it.<BR>It's all a little over the top, and one gets the sense that the author is sometimes trying too hard.

It examines the dangers of voyeurism, leaving readers feeling that's exactly what we're guilty of ourselves as we voraciously keep turning the pages. <BR>Barbara slowly befriends Sheba, another woman in the school where they are both teachers, and equally slowly Sheba reveals details of her relationship with a 15yo student.

I'm not a huge fan of short stories, but I'm a Canin fan, so I read it, and I'm glad I did. He's able to find compassion, loveliness, and surprise in the everyday lives of people. In the tale \\"We Are Nighttime Travelers,\\" a retired couple rediscovers their love for each other, and in \\"Star Food,\\" a boy protects the identity of someone stealing groceries from his parents' store. His writing is straightforward but exquisite and should have a wider appreciation among the reading audience. <BR>Emperor of the Air was written during Canin's years as a medical student in Boston, reminding me of parallels with another boy wonder, Daniel Mason, who likewise wrote a dense and mesmerizing novel (The Piano Tuner) while he was in medical school in San Francisco. That it's possible to write like this while fellow classmates are struggling just to keep from flunking out just stuns me.	2003-09-19

Watching as he tries to permit himself to enjoy the world without outright lying to his parents is hilarious and very touching.

Lunch at the Piccadilly is an impossibility: Edgerton manages to create a nursing home environment that sounds downright like fun, even a place you might want to settle in for a stay sometime.

Maudie Lowe and Beatrice Satterwhite can't agree on whether Clara removes her glass eyeball at night. Lil Olive won't give up her driving license. Period. <BR>I still think Walking Across Egypt and Raney are Edgerton's best ones ever, but Lunch at the Piccadilly is pushing at the gates, close on their heels.<BR>You'll love it.

Yeah, the premise is fantasy: a young African American woman, Dana, is transported from present-day California into the brutal life of slave culture in Maryland, 1819. Forget trying to figure things out; that's not important. What's so valuable about this book is the suspense of Dana's situation, how she will deal with her new life on a southern plantation where she counts for almost nothing, and the generous and historically accurate sprinkling of details of plantation life that are strewn liberally throughout.<BR>Excellent.	2003-09-18

As usual, the scene is the sere and gorgeous country around the Four Corners area in the American Southwest. An abandoned pickup truck holds the body of a white man, which leads back in time to two previous murders, the disappearance of the wife of one of the dead men, an old gold mine, and an incident that had been dismissed as nothing more than a Halloween prank. <BR>And then, naturally, there's a simmering and problematic love interest for Chee and the latest new lady in his life.	2003-09-18

Dorothy Bryant, who hales from the planet Berkeley, has written several novels that are so startlingly different from each other than it makes you wonder how one person could have achieved this feat. <BR>I don't like fantasy genre books, not at all. But just because Bryant had written this, I swallowed hard and read it. Oh boy. It's wonderful. It's the tale of a wretched man who seems to have killed not only his girlfriend but also himself. But he rouses from his `swoon' in a strange world where there are no signs of ugliness or violence - and the rest of the novel plays with the question of how he will fare in such an unfamiliar environment.<BR>I strongly recommend three of her other books. The Garden of Eros (a personal favorite; I'm a midwife, and there's a fantastic description of an unattended birth in this book), Miss Giardino, and Ella Price's Journal. Dorothy Bryant created her own publishing company, Ata Books, in Berkeley because of her desire to help local writers get published and to keep their books in print and on local bookstore shelves indefinitely.	2003-09-18

Each of the women comes from a different background, has widely different experiences both in Vassar and after graduation, and sees her world after college thru different eyes. Told mostly thru the point of view of one member of the group, McCarthy's classic story lacerates socialism, the Ivy League, the prevalent double standards of the era, men - and psychoanalysis.

Sue Bender, a Berkeley artist and mother of two with grad degrees from both Harvard and Berkeley, just up and left town one day and went east to spent time with the Amish. Not as easy as it sounds, folks, because the Amish are intensely private people who don't routinely welcome outsiders. Somehow, however, Bender managed to convince two families to take her into the folds of their farming communities in Iowa and Ohio. She was transformed - and in this book that reflects the plain and simple lifestyle of the Simple Folk, she explains why and how this transformation occurred and what it means to her now.<BR>Bender had always lived a life of moving from one list item to another, checking things off from the top only to add more at the bottom. The Amish, not unlike the Zen Buddhists, savor and honor each daily task, finding meaning within the most mundane chores. A book as meaningful and beautifully crafted as an Amish quilt, Plain and Simple deserves to be treasured.	2003-09-17

One of my patients was a friend of Marion Zimmer Bradley - and she came to the home birth. Whoa, were the rest of us impressed to have her among us? Yup! I'd already read the book, and although it was about 20 yrs ago, I still remember many of the details vividly. And I'm not even a fan of fantasy books.<BR>Bradley took the liberty of recreating the Arthurian legend with the women as the main characters. They are the creators of like, the keepers of knowledge, the fonts of spirituality, the holders of the keys to the kingdom. The Mists of Avalon, however, is more than a rewrite of the old legend. It's a scholarly exploration of the lesser known issues of religion, medicine, and power during the Middle Ages. The author accomplished a spectacular success in this book not just by weaving an expertly told story, but also by constructing a mythical time and place so effectively that readers have trouble believing that every detail is not the literal truth. The quality and depth of the research that obviously went into this book is astounding, and it can therefore be read on many levels. Where truth, myth, legend, and pure fiction meet and diverge is very difficult to say.<BR>If you haven't already read this masterpiece, do it now.	2003-09-17

Alongside her delving into brutal events and grotesque facts that she has witnessed, we also follow the story of Hope's failed marriage. That the characters of the primates in this book are nearly as well-developed as the humans is due to the fact that Boyd received assistance from Jane Goodall, the famed primate researcher.	2003-09-17

Antonio is torn betw his father's cowboy side of the family who ride on the llano and his mother's village and farming relations.

She writes novels, short stories, poems, and is a literary critic. Her novels range from highbrow literary, to mystery, to sci-fi. Talk about diversity.<BR>The Robber Bride is a very funny book, which you might not expect if you've read The Handmaid's Tale or Cat's Eye, both quite dark. In this book, Atwood creates a hypnotically attractive woman named Zenia who wreaks havoc everywhere. The other 3 main characters are women drawn together by their suffering at Zenia's hands and their attempts to forget her, now that she's dead. They meet occasionally for lunch - and on one of these lunch dates, in walks Zenia - quite alive, thank you.<BR>Oh boy. Read it yourself and see what happens. In Atwood's hands, what might have been a light romance turns into a catty and witty tale of human frailty and moral choices.	2003-09-16

His first book, The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, introduced the characters and setting that appear again in Reservation Blues. With irresistible humor and a very distinctive point of view, Alexie tells what happens when the guitar of a blues legend passes into the hands of Victor, a troubled guy who becomes the troublesome but extremely talented member of a rock group, Coyote Springs. The bulk of the story follows Victor and 2 friends as they try to pull themselves from the hard-scrabble poverty of the reservation to cope with the possibility of stardom.	2003-09-16

I read Eva Luna, then House of Spirits; after that, I was over it. But this book is different. Paula is the straightforward telling of Allende's colorful family history interwoven with the account of her daughter Paula's death from a rare disease. The economical writing instantly won me over, and Allende's gift for storytelling comes to the fore in the many anecdotes she shares.<BR>While Death is the book's key element, it doesn't overwhelm with pity or sorrow. As Allende distracts herself by writing this book as a long letter to Paula, who lies in a coma for months, the author distracts us as well. Absolutely superb.	2003-09-16

Skirts is the mesmerizing story of three young women on their own in Greenwich Village, seeking excitement among the Beat Generation. Mimi Albert (The Second Story Man) writes with power of the seduced and the seducer with Zalman, the handsome son of a rabbi, urging `turning on' to life (which includes drugs). He is both alluring and scary, esp as he lures the innocent Helene deeper into a world of exotics she could not previously have imagined.<BR>I believe it's difficult for today's female readers (the young ones, anyway) to imagine the strictures under which women of the 50s and early 60s were expected to live - and it is against that background that Helene, Ruth, and Victoria are operating. Albert's eloquent language and dramatic narrative help make that background come alive with even more contrast to what the women discover about the world and themselves in the rarified air of Greenwich Village.	2003-09-16

She is surrounded by mainstream America, she is required to follow the strict rules of a culture dating from the Jewish ghettos of 18th century Poland. Rachel wants to fit into the streets of New York kids of the 60s, a desire that nearly makes her rabbi father, dutiful mother, and indeed her entire community, come undone with shock. To readers, Rachel sneaking into the public library to read classical literature is endearing; to her family, it's akin to sacrilege.	2003-09-16

Imagine Amelia Earhart stranded on a tropical island, and imagine that 40 yrs later a young couple beaches their sailboat on that same island. That's the premise of Hidden Latitudes. Anderson writes convincingly, alternating between Earhart's voice (and now 70yo doesn't immediately reveal herself to these newcomers) and a 3rd-person narrative of the two sailors, whose marriage was shaky to begin with, and now they've got shipwreck to contend with.<BR>Sounds iffy, right?

The beautiful and emerging give-and-take relationship betw grandfather and grandson lends force to an already strong tale.<BR>Abbey is known as the father of the environmental movement, a label he didn't much like.

The Irish have always been known as great storytellers, but now they're all turning into great writers as well, and it seems they're coming out of the woodwork. Sebastian Barry's The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty places the protagonist in the small village of Sligo where he is an innocent among angry partisans. When he chooses to alleviate his problems of employment by taking a job with the Royal Irish Constabulary, the British-led police force, he irrevocably alters his life - as you might imagine! With beautiful language and ethereal descriptive passages, Barry allows readers to follow Eneas' travels and travails - all of us hoping for a happy ending.	2003-09-16

Through Beard's fine writing and descriptive skilly, she shows that the typical days of her life are loaded with drama, humor, and pathos. The book is a loose collection of vignettes spanning the author's 60's childhood and flows into her early adulthood.  The title, however (as well as the jacket cover), is misleading. One might expect sexual initiation and experimentation to play a large role. The Boys of My Youth, however, is more about the LACK of boys in her youth - and the importance of having a good friend. Wonderful, wonderful book. Buy it.	2003-09-16

I actually read this book a couple of years ago, but it seems appropriate to submit a review now, just a few days after Johnny Cash's death. I guess we all knew it was coming; the guy hasn't looked well for the last 5+ years. But somehow, staring at that craggy face, listening to that rumbling baritone, it seemed like maybe he'd live forever.<BR>The Man in Black. Johnny Cash. Husband of June Carter. Friend of damn near everyone he ever met, and that includes millions of fans. Johnny Cash lived his life with the same candid openness and complexity with which he sang his songs - and he always laid it all out, right on the line. He hides nothing, not his struggles with substance abuse, not his self-proclaimed failures as a father, not his much-reviled opposition to the Vietnam War, not his attempts at sincere spirituality. Johnny Cash's humor and intelligent mind come through is this book, more a reflection on his 40-yr career than a straightforward \\"and then this happened, and then this, and then this\\" style of celebrity autobiography. \\"I Walk the Line,\\" he sang, and now it's time for the great man to lay it down and take a rest.<BR>Kudos.

Political activist, critic, and playwrite, Hellman cut a wide swath thru literary circles during her heyday in the 40s, 50s and 60s. This introspective collection of her journal entries and memories shines with her acerbic brilliance. Her circle of `friends' included just about all the famous people of her era: Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, Faulkner, and of course Dashiell Hammett, her lover, friend, and confidant. This is a personal account of a life lived as if there were no tomorrow, a nearly romantic rendering of the flavor of a special era in this country, and the documentation of feminine empowerment before the word had even been invented.	2003-09-15

Only a writer of McMurtry's skill and stature could have written a book about a couple of drunken and inarticulate Texas Rangers turned horse rustlers and have it become, right before your eyes, into an epic, mythic saga of redemption, conviction, friendship, responsibility, and quiet heroism that is impossible to put down. This is a loooong book, too, so saying it's impossible to put down means you're not going to get much sleep once you begin reading. So drink some high-test coffee, fluff up your bed pillows, and settle down for the joy of reading one of the best books ever written about the American West.	2003-09-15

She woke up one day to discover she'd pretty much disappeared as a person who counted for anything in the eyes of her husband, her children, her friends - and even herself. So she did something I'll wager lots and lots of women have been tempted to do at some time or another: she walked away, took a bus to wherever it was going, settled in a small town in Nowhere, USA, and rediscovered/recreated herself.<BR>This book is one of Anne Tyler's best. Spot-on characterization, situations, dialogue, effortless prose, hilarity and pathos on the same page. Satisfying and enlightening, endearing and emotional. A lesson in understanding and forgiveness, Ladder of Years bears up under reading and rereading.	2003-09-15

Afterall, it was Bird by Bird and Operating Instructions that put her over the top; then she followed up with Traveling Mercies. The quality and longevity of her fiction pale by comparison.<BR>Bird by Bird is simply one of the three best books on the angst of writing and being a writer that's ever been written. The other two are Writing Down the Bones and S. King's On Writing. But the three books are very, very different. King's is actually pretty weird in spots, as he is, but for the most part it's all about philosophy. Natalie Goldberg's 'Bones' is very instructional and inspirational.<BR>But Lamott! Oh, Annie's book is just as outrageously honest and funny and true and painful in the telling as it is in actuality to be a writer.<BR>Wonderful, wonderful book; highest recommendation.<BR>Read it.<BR>If you're a writer, you'll get some advice from a master on how to cope with (or not) self-doubt, writer's block, and jealousy.

She has created a worthy and literary memoir from the material gathered during the years before she was claimed by her benevolent Seattle grandparents from the truly draconian aunt and uncle who kept her for 5 years prior to that. Somewhere along the way, this child who was probably difficult and moody - and certainly intelligent and scathingly witty - developed the ability to step outside herself, observe what was happening, remember it, then later write about it. The result is a classic memoir that deserves to be read by writers as well as the general reading audience. Funny, heartbreaking, sarcastic, bitingly acerbic - and always excellent.	2003-09-11

Only Hiaasen could come up with something like that, but know what? I'll bet he culled it from a honest-to-God clipping from some south Florida rag. As he himself says, he couldn't make up all this stuff. Hiaasen's manic, wicked, and satirical sense of humor is in evidence on every page. The central plot is not especially important in his books - it's the process of going along for the ride that keeps us, his devotees, turning page after page after page long after we should have turned out the light and gone to sleep.	2003-09-04

Love is in the offing when Logan meets up with Annie Ancelet, who has all sorts of ideas for evading the lawmen.<BR>Logan's storm is an affectionate and  endearing character study, full of humor and adventure.	2003-09-02

Charlotte is having the time of her life. She'd been about to leave her husband of forever-many years, and here she suddenly finds herself off on an adventure she never could have dreamed up in her wildest imaginings. Hard to believe a story that begins with a robbery and a kidnapping could end up as touching and poignant - but it does.	2003-09-02

Isabel, recently widowed, is looking for love in all the wrong places, starting with the wilderness on a vacation in the Adirondacks with new man in her life, Paul, his family, and his dangerously attractive brother. This all makes it sound like some sappy romance novel - and it's not. It's a rapturous paean to love of life and love of nature, penned by a gifted writer.	2003-09-02

As we hear each character's story in his or her own voice, another piece of the puzzle falls into place until we are left with a more or less intact understanding of how things came to be the way they are. Like all of Tyler's books, Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant is peopled with eccentric oddballs who are borderline social misfits, just working at trying to get through the day and make sense of their lives - but it always seems to degenerate into dinner table conflict.	2003-09-01

Realistic, harrowing, and profoundly honest account of caring for someone heading down the steep slide of Alzheimer's. Author Cooney's grief when she realizes there's nothing she can do to prevent or slow down her mother's galloping dementia is stressful to read; I can't imagine what it must have been like to live it, especially as Cooney's mother was always elegant, talented, gracious, and witty. To watch her withering dependence and confusion is horrific, and things only get worse when Mom moves into their house.<BR>This is a very harrowing memoir, not only of the disease's gradual destruction of an individual, but also what it can do to the caregivers.	2003-09-01

Ruth Cole, the surviving child who never knew her lustrous and immortalized brothers, is kind of the main character (among many), but lots of the book is told by Eddie O'Hare, a summer helper of Ruth's author father. Everybody is screwed up: Marion, the mom, exists in a zombie state and is unable to love Ruth - or anyone else. Ted, the father, is alcoholic and faltering in his career of writing creepy novels for kids. Ruth can't sustain a loving relationship. WFOY begins in 1958 and doesn't conclude till 1995, when Ruth, perhaps, embarks on a kind of loving healing.<BR>This book qualifies to be called an epic.

Afterward, however, she carries on with her life acting like she's got PTS with the surreal, crazy-making behavior of someone who's been victimized, including quite a string of inappropriate men. She ricochets to the Philippines to - get this! - help doctors with eye surgery for poor people. <BR>Only 200 pages long, Vida packs her book with lean, mean, and wonderful prose.

The writing is brilliant, and that makes it doubly incredible that someone with this hard-scrabble background could achieve this feat. The Beans are representative of the generally unwashed and usually uneducated extended families that populate every part of our country.

A chanteuse, a sex symbol, the mother of 12 adopted children, French Resistance heroine, Baker reinvented herself as often as necessary to stay at the top of her trade - whatever that trade was at any given moment. Jean-Claude Baker (one of her 'adopted' children) chronicles her life in this engaging biography with a mix of love, admiration, and incredulity. The lady had balls, and while not a tell-all book, The Hungry Heart does her ample justice.	2003-08-31

Balanchine was at his peak, and Allegra Kent was more than his principal dancer - she was his muse, his passion, his nemesis. And her dancing was incredible. Once a Dancer, Kent's autobiography, chronicles the strange world of famous ballerinas, plagued as most of them are by anorexia, domineering stage mothers, vulnerability to dance gurus, plastic surgery, and a long, long series of self-destructive behavior. Wonderful sketches of other luminaries from her era are included, plus photos, but it's the end of the book that one remembers: the poignancy of someone of Allegra Kent's talents looking back on her life and appreciating in retrospect all that she once was, is heartbreaking.	2003-08-31

The family has already come unglued by the opening of the book, with eldest son Buck drowned in a boating accident and Conrad, the younger son, trying to reenter life after a suicide attempt. But it is quickly clear that the family will not easily once again become just ordinary people in their future. The mother is cold and self-absorbed; the father is like a puppy, trying to please everyone; the doting grandparents are clueless; Conrad is just trying to survive.<BR>The best parts of the book, I believe, are those involving Conrad's relationship with Dr. Berger, his shrink, a very extraordinary psychiatrist - and trust me, I've known more than a few.<BR>Excellent rating.	2003-08-30

Morgan of the title delivers a baby in a car, and when he asks the guy to get some newspaper, the flustered fellow asks, \\"The Times, the Post, or the Trib??\\" or some such nonsense. And believe me, I know from experience that you just can't make that kind of stuff up. It's true, it's all true.<BR>But back to the main theme. Morgan is a very odd and very irritating eccentric, married to a clearly long-suffering wife with whom he has seven children. All girls. Morgan works in a hardware store where he mostly tries to talk people out of buying the stock. Morgan talks and talks and talks and talks. And Morgan is going through a confusing slide into a mid life crisis.<BR>It makes for some of Tyler's best writing - and for some of our best reading.	2003-08-30

Just read those 20 or so pages, and you'll be hooked for the rest of the book.<BR>Carol Shields won the Pulitzer for this novel, a creative and highly original style of narrative that many others have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate. Stone Diaries wanders all the way through Daisy's rather extraordinary life, both her on-the-surface role as daughter, wife, and mother as well as her rich and vividly-described inner life. When you reluctantly come to the end, you'll probably sit back as I did, stare into space, and just sigh, \\"Wow...\\"	2003-08-30

While Hanging Up is not her best, it's well worth the read (and sure a bazillion times better than the sappy movie). The setup is difficult and conflicted: three daughters trying to cope in their various ways with the senility and death of their father. The girls/women are very different, and much of the book is heavy on telephone dialogue as they stay in touch with each other and try to make sense of their past: divorce, abandonment by their mother, alcoholism, and the eventual dementia of their father. All that phone conversation, however, gets tiresome, and the daughters suffer from an excess of vapidity and other irritating qualities. Still, it's pretty good.	2003-08-30

Eric Hansen truly travels where few others would even want to. My favorite of his several very wonderful books will always be Motoring with Mohamed, but this one is a close followup.<BR>An epic adventure through a world of extraordinary people, going about what they consider ordinary lives, Stranger in the Forest takes us step by step through the portals into an unimaginable world.

Set in New Canaan, CT, an affluent WASP town which some consider a suburb of NY, two dysfunctional families pay the ultimate price for their jaded life-styles. It's the children who suffer as their parents struggle with issues too myriad and complicated to detail in a short review.

Now sporting a wooden leg, Junior is more despicable than ever, a drunk who finds himself taken on as 'a cause' by Iris Mary Parfait. Herself on the run from the law after she killed a dude in self-defense, she starts trying to get Junior to mend his ways. When he discovers he can get some cash by turning her in - but realizes he might be falling in love with her - things get mighty complicated. <BR>Full of Cajun dialect, humor, honest, and most of all compassion, Junior's Leg is a worthy step-brother book to Meely LaBauve.	2003-08-29

It was a gift, and I didn't quite know what to expect, but it's turned into a real winner.<BR>Spanning the years from 1902 till the end of WWI, we follow the life of Grania, a child/woman who became deaf following scarlet fever. From a loving middle-class family, she went to a boarding school for hundreds and hundreds of deaf children, grew into a self-sufficient young woman, became a nurse, and married a hearing man, Jim. He went off to war, as did her childhood friend and brother-in-law, Kenan. Improbably for that Great War, both men returned - but in very different conditions.<BR>Divided into several parts, the early chapters are Grania's education, learning to live as a deaf person in the world of the hearing. The next part is Jim's story of his war experience.<BR>Then comes Grania's ultimately successful efforts to return the power of speech to her mute and traumatized childhood friend. And finally the resolution of all the stories.<BR>This book grows on you. One of the boldest risks author Itani took was to try (successfully) to convey Grania's silent world to readers, and to imitate the understanding of sign language as well as lip reading for those of us unfamiliar with the Deaf World.<BR>It's a stunning and powerful book, showing the power of Story to convey love, union, and understanding - and ultimately, joy.	2003-08-28

The Crossing begins with a long section where the protagonist, Billy Parham, is tracking a she-wolf, setting traps which she fails to get caught in, finally catching her, then being unable to kill her. So he sets off to Mexico from his home in NM, planning to return her to the mountains where from which she surely came. Things don't quite work out the way he'd planned.<br />And when he returns home, he finds his world forever changed. He and his brother, Boyd, return to Mexico to try to find his father's stolen horses and the men who stole them. Again, things don't quite work out as planned.<br />Without saying too much that would reveal the plot line, I'll mention that Billy eventually sets out to Mexico a third time on a mission of reclamation and redemption. And yet again, all does not go according to plan.<br />Along the way, there are long stretches of other travelers or characters Billy meets who tell their stories: a priest, a blind man, a gypsy, among others. The overall effect is one of melancholy, and of course, having been written by such a consummate master of the art, the eloquence of the language shines through everywhere. As a side benefit, you'll learn or re-learn quite a bit of Spanish along the way. I began by rewinding the tape and doing word for word translations from my rusty memory. By about tape #6 I became aware that I was understanding the Spanish perfectly, scarcely aware he'd shifted into it.<br />Spectacular book on tape.	2003-08-28

Lovell's biography of the famous, infamous, and infinitely interesting Mitford sisters is a truly engaging book. 'Those crazy Mitford girls' is how they were known during their heyday, and this book will prolong and perpetuate that sobriquet. There were 6 of them, plus one handsome and doted-upon male sibling who went and got himself killed during the war, leaving the road clear for the girls to completely dominate. Lovell succeeds in making each girl unique for us, so we don?t get them confused, a real feat with so many characters. The Mitford sisters obliged, however, and made Lovell's task easier by being 6 entirely different personalities. It seems the only thing they had in common was good looks. They ranged from Fascist Hitler-lovers (Diana) to communists (Jessica). The story of their lives spans the 20th century and is well worth the read on many levels. Just pity the Mitford sisters long-suffering parents.	2003-08-26

Jacqueline Winspear's character, Maisie Dobbs, is a girl to watch. Set in the post-WWI era (with flashbacks to Maisie's pre-war childhood, housemaid, and Cambridge years), MD is a good piece of social commentary as the times, they are a-changin'. As the first of a proposed series, it's a good setup for what is sure to follow: more crime solving based on psychology and delicate sleuth work. The primary case in this book deals with The Retreat, a refuge for deformed and otherwise damaged war veterans that may or may not be a cult. While the story line is good, the outcome is predictable, and the main character is marred by an excess of goodness. Everyone loves her, she is loyal to those who helped here climb the class/social ladder along the way, she has no known enemies, and she has no visible weaknesses or faults. We could use a little depth of character here.	2003-08-26

The book follows the children into young adulthood, with frustration and fate battling against the crushing odds of rural poverty.

It's capable of standing alone, selling forever, and being widely and deeply admired without anyone ever writing another review of it. Published in 1989, This Boy's Life is a memoir of Tobias Wolff's grim teenage years in which he is pitted in a battle of wills against his abusive stepfather. The intelligence and deception employed by the child prove a nearly equal match against the cruelty of the adult in this equation. In exquisite prose, Wolff leavens the grisly reality with dark humor, and readers are surprised, considering the subject matter, to find themselves not depressed overall, but uplifted.	2003-08-24

It seems that anybody who was anyone in the world of art, letters, literature, and/or intellectuals appeared at some time within this circle of friends and lovers. This loose and shifting group of people alternately lived, worked, and loved together between 1900-1940, and included Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Vanessa and Clive Bell, E. M. Forster, Maynard Keynes, Lytton Strachey, and many other names that are familiar to today's readers. These personal recollections from Quentin Bell's childhood memories are a delight to read and prove enlightening not only with regard to his subjects but also of Bell himself.	2003-08-23

This is her fourth novel, and in it she applies her mystical slant of mind and prose to a snug little tale about a wedding. Ansay was raised Catholic, and she writes of modern Catholic issues with an insiders point of view. In this book, the wedding, a nondenominational one held in 'a hall' during a raging snowstorm, is as confused and conflicted as are the lives of the characters. There's even a murder in this book - and a ghost. The metaphysical events multiply, and we find ourselves drawn more and more deeply into the stunning depths of this bittersweet tale. Wow.	2003-08-21

Fire is a recurring motif, having been responsible for initiating the series of tragic events that both unite a family and pull it asunder.

Firebird is a coming-of-age memoir of a pre-gay geeky kid with a deranged and alcoholic mother, a passive/conflicted father, and a sister whose middle name is Trouble.<BR>Firebird is beautifully written, revealing how a person who lives in a world of art, music, and literature rose from the ashes of his youth like the proverbial Phoenix of legend.

Really a series of inter-connected short stories, it can easily be read a chapter at a time, cuz each character gets her own chapter. While not all the characters are thoroughly likeable, they all have plenty of redeeming qualities. Focusing not only on the women's trials and tribulations, Naylor also delves into the history and background that came before, contributing to each woman's present situation. These women, mostly abandoned or cast off by the men in their lives, struggle to make a sense of community from a handful of hopes and dreams.	2003-08-19

Skin is her contribution to the essay genre, a collection of two dozen bits of astute rambling across a crazy quilt of subjects stitched together by the fierce honesty her readers have come to expect from all of her writing. Coming from a poor white trash family in South Carolina, she traveled beyond her origins thanks to a rampant intelligence that nothing could dull. A feminist before the word was invented, Allison is also a proud card-carrying lesbian, a writer, mentor, teacher, lecturer, and a woman who is always generous to other writers. Skin deals more explicitly and in greater depth with erotica and sexuality than her other works, so readers would do well to be forewarned. But if you're a Dorothy Allison fan, this is NOT a book to be missed.	2003-08-18

Set in the South, like all her books, this one takes place during the era of the Civil War. Near death, Emma Garnet Tate recounts her life, beginning with her childhood as a bright 12yo in 1842, on a Virginia plantation. Her foulmouthed and racially prejudiced father dominates his long-suffering wife and 6 children but has a literary and artistic side as well. This abusive and tyrannical man collects Old Masters' paintings. Clarise, the formidable black woman who truly runs the family (as the overseer of Samuel Tate's dark secret, she runs him, too), cares for everyone and leaves with Emma when she marries and moves away from `home.' The graphic portrayal of Emma and her surgeon husband's duties tending for the maimed and dying soldiers during the war is a heart-rending expression of the futility of war.	2003-08-17

Miller's ability to render the landscape and the people in the incomparable clarity of Greece's pure air is a rare talent. The Colossus of Maroussi is destined to be read for a long time, for it has a timeless power to transport the reader not only into the mind of the author but also into mind, heart, and soul of the Greek people.

Reuben's father goes in search of Davy, Reuben's brother, who's on the lam in North Dakota's Badlands, wanted for murder by the FBI. Someone said this story, a real saga, reads like an old-time ballad translated into prose, and it's true.

There is a mystical quality in both the story and the prose that is not unusual in the works of Indian authors, but Le Hunte, now based in Sydney, Australia, seems to have her feet planted in Western reality even as she wiggles her toes in Eastern philosophy.

For 15 years, between 1914 and 1931, Baroness Karen Blixen ran a coffee plantation in Kenya. Her unhappy marriage and her much happier, though tragic, love affair are not prominent subjects in her book, as they were in the movie of the same name (excellent, with Meryl Streep and Robert Redford so excellently cast). Isak Dinesen (Blixen's pen name) is primarily a story-teller, and this lovely book is a collection that elevates her stories to mythic, poetic, and epic levels. While one of the first of the era's feminists, she was also gifted with sensitivity, the ability to form deep and lasting friendships, awareness of what was being lost in Africa, and an appreciation for both the mundane and the magical.

Now an old woman still living on a big-island plantation, Mary-Mathilda, in the process of confessing something having to do with the 'hoe' of the title to the local cops, reminisces about her past, chronicling the plantation's history as well as her own. The novel explores the brutality of plantation life not in the fields but in the Big House where as a girl, Mary M caught the manager's eye and became his mistress, the mother of his only son. Separated from her own people by her comforts and privilege, she is also separated from the white establishment by the barriers of racism, servitude, and sexual exploitation.	2003-08-04

Langston Braverman (and howz THAT for a great name for your character?) returns home (after a grim end to an affair and in the middle of her PhD orals) not for the usual reasons; she wants to get away from it all. But she find herself right in the middle of it all, the biggest 'it' being the death of her childhood friend and the fact that she's asked to help care for her friends deeply disturbed daughters. With great story lines, believable dialog, and revised Midwestern values, we read, compulsively hooked, as these troubled individuals struggle to find solace and peace. Wow, what a terrific book!	2003-08-04

He, is drawn into deeper evils that suck him ever deeper and deeper, not releasing him - or we readers - till the very last page. Based on a true-life triple homicide in Ireland in 1994, O'Brien's tale takes us into the hunted and haunted mind of O'Kane, the murderer. This story deals with acts of naked violence and is not for the faint of heart. No sunny conclusion, either.	2003-08-04

Perhaps it's the lure of midwifery that pulled me in (I'm a midwife and author of BABY CATCHER: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife, Scribner 2002), but I found the parallel stories of Ella and Isabelle captivating. Ella's story is told in present-day 1st person, while Isabelle's is told in 16th Century 3rd person. Both women are midwives, struggling with displacement and parallel desires. Ella is driven by a recurrent dream in blue, the typical blue color in which the Virgin Mary's robes are painted, to delve into her past and finds many coincidental connections with Isabelle.<BR>Worthwhile; not stellar.	2003-08-03

There aren't enough words to describe the content of Mary Karr's memoir of her upbringing in a seething, sweaty, swampy East Texas refinery town. But not many words are needed, especially when it comes to Karr's lyrical and poetic writing style: perfect. At the core of her tale is her family, often funny, occasionally violent, but always defiantly loving. Karr's mother is artistic, borderline psychotic, and determinedly free-spirited. Her father is a drunk, a liar, amazingly tolerant of his wife's nuttiness, and in spite of his many faults, devoted to holding his family together. The Liar's Club is a story of survival.	2003-08-03

Take a deep breath before you read this slim little volume - and then try to imagine you can't do it, can't draw in enough air to feel like you've accomplished anything. That's life for Laura Rothenberg, who, we readers know at the outset, died at age 22 of cystic fibrosis before seeing her memoir published. Strung together from a series of essays, diary notes, and emails she kept during her adolescence and very brief young adulthood, Breathing for a Living is a devastating portrayal of what life is like for a very young and very terminally ill person. It's raw, beautiful, bittersweet, honest - and as the most joyful section (a lung transplant becomes available) quickly becomes the saddest as complications and tissue rejection set it, the writing becomes more illuminating and lustrous.<BR>Superb. Would that Laura had lived on to write again.	2003-08-02

I still have my tattered T-shirt proclaiming women should be 'on top,' that I bought in Berkeley way back then, in support of Blum?s fundraising for her 1978 all-woman assault on Annapurna. By proving to the skeptical small mountain-climbing community of men, as well as to the world at large, that women COULD be leaders of expeditions into the high Himilayas, Blum opened the door to a new vision of women's abilities in sports as well as all other areas of life.	2003-08-02

Caroline Dunlap, who has just graduated from a proper college, has come home to the world she left and finds it essentially unchanged with everyone coming quietly and oh-so-properly unglued. Everyone is looking for his or her own key to happiness, and it is as their paths cross and overlap that the pathos, humor, and sensitive writing are revealed.<BR>A good summer read.	2003-07-31

Her several trips to the US began during an era when most Americans, apparently, didn't quite know where Iran was, exactly. This was quickly followed by the Shah's downfall, the hostage crisis, and the whole Islamic conservative movement. She see her native country through Americanized eyes - and the US through Middle-Eastern eyes - and sees the humor and pathos in both. Dumas manages to make light of the suffering and financial downturns her family experienced during those years - and to emerge prouder still of her father's resilience and determination to provide well for his family. And through it all runs a profound appreciation for her family, for America, and for Iran.	2003-07-31

But even with the same material, few could render the experience of growing up Italian and female in suburbia as well as Cascone has done in this, her 2nd book. The eels! Omigod, the eels for Christmas dinner, first writhing in the bathtub, then writhing around your arm, then writhing on the chopping block, and STILL writhing as, cut into cross-sections, they were tossed into the saute pan! Now, that's a memory few can share. Funny, sad, sentimental, tolerant, it's everything you could want from a short little book.

Huxley is a difficult subject to pin down politically, as her opinions shifted with the tide of the changing times. She lived through the fall and failure of the colonial period, and her best and most loving writing comes from the era when it was in full bloom: the period around both sides of the First World War. As an old woman (she lived to age 90) in the mid 90s, she still held to some of her beliefs concerning the benefits of English rule of Africa.	2003-07-29

Kumalo's love for his people (and not just his, but for the inherent goodness in ALL people), his family, his church - and most of all, his country.<BR>It's a classic that has already withstood the test of time - and will doubtless continue to do so.<BR>Don't miss it, and share it with someone else.	2003-07-29

At age 10, the only problem in her otherwise perfect world is her mother's ineptitude and inability to hold her own life together, much less that of her impressionable daughter. This lovely story follows Evelyn on the teetery see-saw path between childhood and young adulthood with warmth, sincerity, and hope, deftly offering a cameo look at middle-class life smack dab in the middle of America.	2003-07-29

Time to throw out stuff, clear surfaces, realign furniture, put a single perfect flower in a simple vase, sit back, and begin to relax and thrive in your own home. Feng shui, the Asian art that crosses the borders of architecture, philosophy, Zen, and housekeeping, has stormed the shores of America and found a welcome reception. Much bunk has been written about this ancient `art,' but this book pares it down to one simple aspect of the process: getting rid of clutter. Once that's done, much stress is reduced from one's life, and you can begin to enjoy your home environment on a level previously unimagined. This is a good book to get you started.	2003-07-29

She wants all that she has, wants still more, and knows the price on marriage, family, and self. But instead of being a downer, it's all told with high intelligence and humor, many laugh-aloud moments and some touching ones, and, for good measure, the men are often pretty good guys instead of insensitive cads.<BR>Even if you think you ought to be turned off by this book, even if it sounds like a light fluffy beach read, well, read it anyway.

I appreciate all of Kingsolver's books for different reasons, but this one is a particular triumph in her ability to write in the very distinctive voices of several different characters. You have only to open the book at random and read 2 or 3 lines to know exactly which character is telling her part of the story. A tour de force.<BR>The story concerns the family of Nathan Price, a self-righteousness religious fanatic who drags them all off to the Congo to save souls. Disaster is inevitable, and disaster is what happens. The story is told mostly by the four daughters: the malaprop and clich-ridden vapid eldest daughter, the intelligent and sincerely adoring 2nd child, the schrewd, watchful and mute 3rd child, and  the youngest, a 5yo. Beyond the story of just this family, however, Kingsolver carefully spoon-feeds us a lesson in brutal nationalistic rule of the Belgian Congo, racial genocide, the CIA's involvement in some of the horrors that engulfed Africa, and exploitation of poor countries by rich ones.<BR>Top notch book by one of the US's top notch writers.	2003-07-24

Greenlaw has given up swordfishing and lives on a teensy island off Maine's coast where she's a lobster-woman. Only 47 souls live full-time on this island, and she figures she's someway related to more than half of them.

A classic that kids shouldn't be assigned to read in 10th grade, as I was. I truly hated this book, didn't understand it at all, at all. The symbolism, the racism, the class system, the whole period of the British raj - it all went right over my head. Then, to discover it in adulthood! Well, it was an awakening. It was as if I'd never read it before, and indeed on most levels, I hadn't. What really happened in the Marabar Caves? Was it an assault? A dream or hallucination? An actual rape? Nothing? A case of mistaken identity? This mystery, unanswered at the end, lies at the heart of A Passage to India. We have Muslims, Hindus, and the British Christians mixing within the society. Dr. Aziz is a good and gentle man, a friendly, open-minded, highly educated Indian who is eventually accused of assaulting a British women - and that sort of thing doesn't go over well with the high-mucky-mucky of the era. According to the political sensitivities of the era (1920s), there's always bound to be trouble when you mix the races within society.<BR>Passage to India presents British colonialism at its worst with a marvelous and deeply-layered cast of characters. This is probably Forster's best book.	2003-07-23

She stood out on the East Coast. She'd have stood out anywhere, except perhaps for the gritty streets in Oregon and California where she was raised, essentially homeless. Lauralee Summer is protective of her mother in this memoir, and one quickly understands why. Certainly hampered by despair, depression, perhaps mental illness, and the stigma of welfare mom and Bag Lady, Lauralee's intelligent mother nevertheless home schooled her daughter, protected her, stayed with her, and loved her. <BR>Somehow Lauralee won a scholarship to Harvard - in wrestling.!?! Graduated now, surviving even the Parents' Weekend when Mom arrived from the shelter, she has written a memoir without self-pity, full of the shame, rage, and heartbreak of her growing up years on the streets and in shelters.<BR>It's not a perfect book, but it deserves 5 stars for talent, guts, storytelling, and a great forecast for the future.	2003-07-23

But few have rivaled her beautiful prose, and I recall reading that she once said she considered it a day well-lived if she'd managed to compose one perfect sentence. To consider her just a food writer is to do her an injustice; she is a writer, first and foremost, who happens, sometimes, to write about food.<BR>Two Towns in Provence is a memoir of the years she spent in France, after her divorce from her 3rd husband, with her two young daughters. The two towns in question are Aix-en-Provence and Marseille. Aix is full of artists, eccentrics, gardens, and wonderful food. Marseille is grittier, less beautiful, but still, oh, the food! Fisher's talent, besides the obvious ones of food appreciation, cooking, and writing spectacularly crystalline prose, is her ability to accept life at face value, adapt, and make the best of situations, managing to observe closely and have a wonderful time in the process.<BR>Highest recommendation for all Francophiles, cooks, and lovers of memoirs and superior writing.	2003-07-23

Medicine Women is a compilation of first-person accounts of women healers, midwives, dentists, abortionists, often just good women helping others during the brief era of the settling of the West. This is a book to read carefully from beginning to end, but it's also a book to pick up and browse through at random.

Okay. I read the book. And boy, am I ever glad I did, as it's stellar. Hillenbrand dives into the world of thoroughbred horse racing in this incredible story of Seabiscuit, who, I've gotta admit, I'd never heard of before. Apparently he wasn't a very promising-looking horse, and that's putting it mildly. Nor were the horse's owner, trainer, or jockey very promising. But somehow out of this sure-to-court-disaster scenario, they instead came up with a stupendous and heartwarming winner.<BR>And Hillenbrand has written a stupendous and heartwarming book about it.<BR>Don't miss it - even if you don't know a horse from a camel designed by a committee.	2003-07-23

The plumbing is dreadful, the meals are awful, the roof leaks, but the code of WASP gentility and morality rules Lily's actions as family members begin to accumulate like extra spoons in a place setting. Then non-relatives start to appear, and pretty soon the place is populated with enough eccentrics to make you suspect that it'll all turn into an American version of a British house party murder mystery. Indeed, the place IS raided by the FBI, but it's not about murder. Amusing, The Hills at Home is an old-fashioned comedy of manners, a great little read.	2003-07-22

The movement now has a magazine, a web site, and over 400,000 followers organized into local chapters. With a foreword written by Alice Waters, it's no surprise to learn that Petrini advocates the same philosophy as Chez Panisse's founder: traditional recipes, locally grown foods and wines, and eating as an event.<BR>It's a small book, only 170 pages, but it packs a wallop as a philosophy, a recipe for Life.	2003-07-21

Imagine this child, quiet and observant, watching, always watching and listening. She listens to family stories well enough to begin her tale prior to her own birth. It's a different tale of anti-Semitism, one that only someone who lived it on intimate terms would be in a position to tell.<BR>Engaging writing and a believable narrator contribute to the book's value.	2003-07-20

But having read this superb book, I believe I'm going to pick up one of his other ones, take a deep breath, and dive into his spooky world. On Writing was given to me by a writing friend, or perhaps I never would have read it, as I don't like the sci-fi, horror, weird genre of his stuff. But this one, this On Writing treatise (and it's short, less than 300 pages), works on so many levels, and none of them are spooky. It's part memoir, part philosophy, part motivational, and a bit, too, on the actual craft. Don't buy it is you're looking just for a how-to book; it's not meant to be any such thing. DO buy it if you want to read an extremely well-written book about the process of writing, the journey toward becoming someone who can call oneself a writer, the obstacles (including King's horrific accident) to the process and if you're interested in Stephen King, the man, and Tabitha, his muse. Within the middle of the book, aspiring writers will find a pithy and terse section of writing advice; nothing new here, but coming from such a master, this advice should be taken seriously by all wannabe writers.<BR>A rambling, intelligent, imminently readable book.	2003-07-19

Son, Rose's 2nd husband, is a giant of a man who is damaged by a tragedy and finds a place for himself as handyman in a 60's home for unwed mothers.

Although they vary tremendously in tone, subject, angle, and focus, all together they create a powerfully articulate image of what it means to be Mother.

If you haven't read either one, it doesn't matter which book you start with; you'll end up reading both of them anyway.<BR>Ladies' Night at FH is seven female Irish writer's response to the first book, and it's a winner. Authors among the 7 include Maeve Binchy and Dierdre Purcell, but it's up to the reader to try to figure out who wrote what. I didn't bother, too caught up in the delicious mini-plots and connections between guests in Rooms 101, 107, 110, and so forth. The neat twist is that the old hotel has been renovated by a rock-n-roll couple and has become The Place to be Seen in old Dublin.<BR>Wonderful.	2003-07-19

Bitter Lemons is part memoir, part political commentary, part travel writing, and part philosophy. It's the story of Durrell's fairly brief stay on the island of Cyprus, conflict between Greeks and Turks, impending world war, buying a house and trying to settle into a unique niche of the world. It's a book about Life and all its myriad difficulties.<BR>Tip-top - and wonderful writing. It's one of those books whose memory will stay with me always.	2003-07-19

No one can create quirky, beguiling, harmless misfits as well as Anne Tyler, and in A Patchwork Planet, Barnaby Gaitland steps onto the page. He's the black sheep of an affluent family, living in a rented basement studio, divorced, wanting to be a better father to his daughter, working for Rent-a-Back, a service company that does household jobs its elderly clients can no longer manage. Along comes 'an angel,' and his life seems to take a major turn for the better. But niggling in the background of this too-perfect arrangement are hints of Barnaby's dissatisfaction - and he can't quite put his finger on what's wrong with the relationship till he's accused of theft.

In fact, I'll bet this is the only one, and it's a winner. Just made for reading aloud (especially to a young teenage son), the story is told in first person by a 13yo kid who lives in a falling-down (literally) shack back in a Louisiana bayou with his usually absent gator-hunting, kindly, nearly-always-drunk, renegade father who never recovered from his wife's death 8 yrs earlier during childbirth. The sexual initiation scene with Cassie in the middle of a field is unrivaled. Somebody needs to make a movie of this book!	2003-07-18

So I had to read Orchid Fever (don't get it confused with Orchid Thief), a novel about greed, thievery, skullduggery, incomprehensible gov't regulations, and an underworld of orchid fanciers/growers that rivals the drug trade.

Durrell, was responsible for my husband and me quitting our jobs in LA and going to Greece for a year. And several times in the past decades, I've made pilgrimages to Partington Ridge/cove/trail/creek down the coast of Big Sur to revisit the place Miller lived and to pay homage to a great writer, a great spirit, and a great human being. Each time I stop and look up the trail toward the ridge, I swear I can see stringy, rangy Miller, sweating as he pulls a goat-cart laden with mail and groceries from the drop-off spot by the highway back up to his convict shack near the top. <BR>The book has no real plot; it?s just a rambling and random collection of philosophy, character studies, literary/artistic commentary, and journaling - all delivered with Miller's completely unique and quirky mind. I don't believe a more open-minded, curious, brilliant writer has ever lived, and for me, this is his best book, written perhaps during some of his best and most peaceful years of his long and joyful life. At its core, it's a recipe for Life.	2003-07-18

It's great. Big boobs? Little boobs? Big butt, thick ankles, short legs, flabby upper arms? What's you problem? With this book, you won't have one - or two. These babes will tell you which clothes to give away (to someone with the opposite set of problems), what to buy and why, how to wear it - and even where to buy it. Forget `love yourself just the way you are;' this book is about `love yourself in the right clothes, just the way you are.'<BR>Wonderful.	2003-07-17

The good cop boyfriend Morelli and the stranger named Ranger (the shadowy `other' boyfriend...sorta). The gravel-voiced granny, flamboyant sidekick Lula, and mom and her macaroni... It just doesn't get stale, thank god. This time, ol' Stephanie is trying to find a guy named Singh who skipped when his visa expired. Then there's a murder, then more, and threats of still more - directed to Steph herself. Hilarious slapstick set pieces, something Evanovich excels at, are interspersed with real knuckle-biters. It's sexy, too; sexier than her others, in fact - and it's all good.	2003-07-16

Hey, I don't even like horses and don't understand those who do. But then I read a piece in the New Yorker by the author - took me reading halfway into the piece to realize she was Seabiscuit's author, and I was HOOKED - not on the book and the horse so much as on this Hillenbrand's personal courage (battling a crippling case of chronic fatigue syndrome for I forget, maybe like 2 decades?) and perseverance - and the sheer beauty of her writing.<BR>So. Okay. I read the book. And boy, am I ever glad I did, as it's stellar. Hillenbrand dives into the world of thoroughbred horse racing in this incredible story of Seabiscuit, who, I've gotta admit, I'd never heard of before. Apparently he wasn't a very promising-looking horse, and that's putting it mildly. Nor were the horse's owner, trainer, or jockey very promising. But somehow out of this sure-to-court-disaster scenario, they instead came up with a stupendous and heartwarming winner.<BR>And Hillenbrand has written a stupendous and heartwarming book about it.<BR>Don't miss it - even if you don't know a horse from a camel designed by a committee.	2003-07-16

Two yrs later, she and her young son (fathered by Aram) find themselves stuck behind enemy lines in their journey to find him.

Lucky You is one of his best, the story of greed, grace, low-life types (picture this: a glue-sniffing jerk with a crab claw hanging from his infected hand as he peers at you from the leg holes of a pair of orange Hooters short shorts that hes pulled over his head), religious fanatics, skinhead survivalists  all focused on skullduggery surrounding  two winning Florida lottery tickets, each worth $14 million.

Time to throw out stuff, clear surfaces, realign furniture, put a single perfect flower in a simple vase, sit back, and begin to relax and thrive in your own home. Feng shui, the Asian art that crosses the borders of architecture, philosophy, Zen, and housekeeping, has stormed the shores of America and found a welcome reception.

Once that's done, much stress is reduced from one's life, and you can begin to enjoy your home environment on a level previously unimagined. This is a good book to get you started.	2003-07-15

It also helps to explain how a short, rotund, balding, `older gentleman' managed to surround himself with beautiful women all his life. His secret? He appealed to their intellect. Few of Franklin's many women were empty-headed beauties, but they were seen as such by other men. Franklin appears to have been far ahead of his time in appreciating a good brain within a pretty woman's head.<BR> No matter how much you think you may already know about Franklin, read this wonderful and eminently readable biography: you'll lean more.<BR>I guarantee it.	2003-07-15

I far prefer this one, along with The Colossus of Maroussi and Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch.<BR>Quiet Days in Clichy is a memoir, a nostalgic love story of life in Paris before WW II, a celebration of the Bohemian life Miller lived when he was a poor unknown writer. It's wonderful, rollicking, hilarious, and introduces fans to a whole cast of characters who became Miller's lifelong friends, people who influenced his writing and his art forever.	2003-07-14

Detailed to the max, esp considering he was totally plastered into near or real unconsciousness through part of the book. Amazing recall; hard to believe, given his severe alcoholism, that he can remember all this...but somehow I totally believe it. Pathos, tenderness, love, despair, hope... What more can one ask for, as a reader?  Oh. Well. Good writing? Yeah, that. Make that EXCELLENT writing. Burrows has a way with similes and metaphors that I, as a writer myself, can only wish for. Example: &#34;His laugh is made of porch swing and lemonade.&#34; Doesn't that just say paragraphs about this person? And in just one short and lovely sentence. The book is full of such examples. Me? I'm moving seamlessly onto another book by Burroughs.	2003-07-14

Life for Jimmy D begins to shred apart following a break-in at his LV bar. And that's just the tip of his iceberg sized problems: a past of heavy drinking and gambling, IRS troubles, and threats to his otherwise good relationship with his daughter. Then along comes an introduction to Amaris, the Dice Angel of the title.<BR>Engaging and true to the atmosphere of Sin City.	2003-07-14

The rich writing, the sensory power of French Vietnamese influence, the blend of cultures and traditions, set against the background of living with/working for Gertrude Stein and AB Toklas, all add richness and depth to a book already replete with both.<BR>I wish a more evocative title had been chosen. I understand the implication - salt is the ultimate 'spice,' used to enhance all flavors - but I fear the baldness of the wording, The Book of Salt, might put off some casual readers from even picking up the book at first opportunity. When I rec'd it, I thought at first it was a history of salt; not exactly riveting.<BR>I predict readers of all persuasions will treasure this gem. It has something for foodies, something for travelers, something for the romantics at heart (and aren't we all?), something especially for those interested in a certain era during Vietnam's tumultuous history. <BR>Buy it. No. Buy 2, and give one to a good friend. In fact, buy an autographed first edition; it's going to be valuable somewhere down the road.	2003-07-14

I mean, come on! A man trying to teach his dog to talk so the dog can tell him what really happened the day his wife died of a freak accident. Sounds more like a fairy tale, right? Wrong. It's a morality play, a story that probes the deepest recesses of grief, marriage, relationships, and all that lies beneath the surface of the ties that bind.<BR>Don't miss this spectacular debut novel. In fact, buy a signed first edition; it'll be worth something 20 years from now.	2003-07-14

It traces dear Agnes?s own childhood and gives us insight into her mother and grandparents. With its inclusion, avid readers now have the whole picture. Just as full of rollicking hilarity and side-splitting laughter as the others, The Young Wan is also the darkest of the four as it documents the brutality, stupidity and cruelty of certain levels of Irish life.<BR>A marvelous set of books by a gifted author.	2003-07-13

It's hard to take a mystery seriously when the main character is named Bubbles and the guy's name (well, his last name) is Stiletto. Bubbles, true to her name, looks frothy and wears Spandex, but we're to believe a mind hides beneath the hair spray (reminiscent of Legally Blonde) as she investigates what appears to be theft, extortion and maybe murder.<BR>Totally silly, but fun.	2003-07-12

Marcia Muller is one or our more artistic and literate mystery writers, and this is a good one. It deals with an identity puzzle. Matthew's wife appears to have been murdered, but no body is found; because suspicion focuses on him, he hits the trail and makes a new life for himself in a different country. Then his `wife' calls, he travels to seek closure with her, and finds she's gone missing again, this time from the home she shares with her lesbian lover, Carly. She and Matt join forces to find this mystery woman, and...well, read the book yourself.	2003-07-12

AIDS, childbirth, men, lies, [physical activity], drugs, and rock and roll - Where are world wars and espionage? That's all that's lacking in this too-long attempt to explore the dynamics of friendship between two women (one from the Midwest, one from LA) who met as college roommates.

Further tales of Mary Ann Singleton and Michael Tolliver, Maupin's alter-ego, a sweet young gay man lookin' for love in all the wrong places. The continuation of Tales of the City, first serialized in the San Francisco Chronicle, follows the further calamitous adventures of the residents of 28 Barbary Lane. This series of books focused around the early ages of the Dark Age of the AIDS era, but the tragic effect is leavened by Maupin's wild and wacky sense of humor, the preposterous interweaving of the lives of these people, and an overwhelming love for nearly each and every character. As someone said, these books are a love letter to San Francisco and all the best that it stands for.	2003-07-11

Russell Baker, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979, deserves to be a national treasure on the basis of this book alone. It traces his youth in rural Virginia, from the death of his father when he was only five through his growing up years between the wars. The rest of the book is a paean to his mother, a strong-willed optimist who never accepted defeat as an alternative to success. Her unfailing faith in the talents of her young son were not misplaced. This is an iconic and magical piece of literature, a story of courage and love, of the bonds of family in spite of tension and disagreement.<BR>Wonderful both as a story and as a piece of writing.	2003-07-11

They would be wrong. Life did NOT go well for Jennifer Lauck when she was picked up at the bus station by her grandfather and left eventually at the 'safe haven' of her aunt and uncle's home. Although by the conclusion of Still Waters, we are asked to believe Lauck, with the help of New Age spirituality, has at last made peace with her tragic past, one can't help believing that it wasn't the power of hope that carried her to a relatively triumphant adulthood: it was the power of rage.	2003-07-05

Almost unknown in the all-too-common annals of the tragic history of genocide is the annihilation of Greeks who had lived for 3000 years in the mountains near the Black Sea. After WWI, the entire population of one village, including 10yo Sano Halo, was forced on a one-year death march to Syria. Sano became separated from her family and even lost her name when she was purchased by a man three times her age. Eventually she and the man, by then a married couple, moved to NY, and there Sano raised 10 children, including the author.  <BR>A tale of resilience and grace, lacking the anger and regret so often found in such survivor stories.	2003-07-05

Against all odds (given the dour subject), the result is insightful, moving and often downright hilarious. As a writer of poetry and novels, Skloot is able to plumb the depths of his mind for just the right word or phrase to lift his tragedy to heroic levels.

Witness: The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Has ever a book title been created that can top that for sheer wackiness? Sounds more like a Dr. Seuss book than something written by such an eminent guy as Sachs.<BR>In Uncle Tungsten, Sacks has written a memoir of his wartime childhood in England and his early fascination with science, a love fostered by an extended household full of learned and curious adults. The seeds of Sacks' lifelong fascination with the depths of weird psychoses were doubtless sewn by his older brother's mental illness.<BR>For Sacks' fans, this book is essential for understanding the origin of the man.

There are the usual LOL moments, the usual quirky characters, the usual brilliant schticks, but the character development strikes me as weak and hurried - or rather, almost nonexistent. Except for the women, and they steal the show. I know, I know: it's satire, but I'm sure someone of Irving's prodigious gifts and talents can do better with delving into the depths of the human condition. I mean, come on: he's already done it a thousand times over in his previous books.<BR>On the plus side: there're the typical romps through the complicated, twisted, quirky, and inter-twined Irvingesque explorations of all the various relationships involved. TV journalist Wallingford loses his hand to a lion, live on TV, and some fan wills his hand to Wallingford, just in case, and all too soon, he conveniently dies, Wallingford gets the hand, and the widow of the donor wants visitation rights. <BR>Um, yeah, right.

She chronicles her process of slowly coming to grips with her illness and her eventual acceptance of the beneficial role proper medication can play in the treatment of the disorder. And inspirational and highly educational book for general readers as well as for those who struggle with BPD themselves or have family members who do.	2003-06-29

Hard to imagine anyone other than Kaye Gibbons writing a story of simple love between two people with troubled histories - and bringing it off with such beautiful panache. Told principally in flashbacks as Jack Stokes is grieving over Ruby's death, the tale of their dissimilar backgrounds, courtship, and improbably successful marriage is written with unsentimental straightforward power.	2003-06-28

Imagine an about-to-be-demolished venerable old Dublin hotel. Imagine hallways with room numbers on the doors. Imagine the interwoven lives of the people spending the night behind those doors. <BR>NOW: Imagine that 7 different Irish authors are each assigned a room number and told to write the stories, somehow collaborating so that the stories link loosely together as the characters meet - or don't - in the lobby, the lounge, the bar, the restaurant, whatever. And no credits are assigned to the chapters, i.e. we readers don't know which was written by, say, Roddy Doyle. So besides the book filled with stories, there's the added fun of trying to figure out who wrote what.<BR>Terrific.	2003-06-28

Her book provoked endless discussions about the reliability (or Unreliability) of memory and the role it plays in memoir writing. Hampl's A Romantic Education allows us to continue following her down her chosen path as she returns to Prague in search of her heritage during the gray pall of socialism. This edition of A Romantic Education is a reissue following the Velvet Revolution and is full of richly nuanced detail that we have come to expect from Hampl. It's an elegant piece of writing that allows us to taste and dabble in the trickling stream of history running beneath the surface of the everlasting riddle of personal memory.	2003-06-28

Tell people about it, and they're likely to say, 'Oh, you mean a thesaurus,' and you say, 'No, not exactly,' and then they say, 'Oh, a reverse dictionary?' and you say, 'No. Better.' It's for those times when you sort of know what you're trying to say, but you either can't think of the word or you've used a word too much and you need to jiggle loose from your cranium some new ways of trying to say it. And it leads you on and on down an ever branching set of references so pretty soon you find yourself just sitting down and reading the Flip Dictionary instead of writing. It's that much fun.<BR>An invaluable resource, recommended to me by a fellow writer.	2003-06-28

Accident, suicide, or murder? When Adam Dalgliesh comes to investigate, readers will know it must be murder. Then an old woman is murdered, and the plot thickens. Dalgliesh begins to suspect it has something to do with an event from the past: incest, a secret marriage, thievery...

In Charms for an Easy Life, talented Kaye Gibbons sticks to what she does best: write about several generations of Southern women. Written as a fictional memoir, it chronicles the lives of a trio of strong willed women within one family, led by Charlie Kate, a turn-of-the-century  unlicensed midwife in North Carolina. None of the women in this book have much use for any of the men, remaining together (if conflicted) in their cynical self-sufficiency...until...<br />Read it and find out. A good read.	2003-06-27

Eucalyptus feels more like a painting or a poem than a novel; there's a misty, surreal, magical tone to the crafting of the story, and sometimes I got a little lost, wondering what Australian path the author was leading me along.<BR>The setup is that Holland planted on his land at least one each of all the hundreds of different varieties of eucalyptus and then declared that only a man who could name every tree correctly would be worthy to marry Ellen, his daughter. A fairy tale? Yes, sort of, and therein lies both the charm and the problem with this small book full of beautiful, if elusive, language.<BR>Give it a try, though. It's worth it.	2003-06-27

Yes, but there's a difference: the understated, matter-of-fact telling of the story that makes this book so special. In Ellen Foster, Gibbons uses her beautiful language, literary acumen, and attention to detail to craft a clean, small spare portrait, a gift to all readers.	2003-06-27

Wesley , the delinquent sort of adopted by Mrs. Mattie Rigsbee in Walking Across Egypt, is now 24, and still a bit of a handful. He's a resident in a Christian halfway house in rural North Carolina. There's a love interest, a band, and there's Vernon, who 'bout steals the show when he appears on the page.

Like all of Forster's tales, it's concerned with the deep and petty differences in the various classes of English society, as well as economics and education, and how these issues come to affect personal relationships. Set in the early 20th century, Howard's End follows the two Schlegel sisters. Margaret, the elder, rather suddenly finds herself engaged, then married to Mr. Wilcox, a much older widower, a rather superficial and bombastic English gentleman. Meanwhile, her sister, Helen, becomes involved in politics, good works, and the attempted salvation of Leonard Bast, an impoverished clerk and intellectual. The ownership of Howard's End, the country estate of the late Mrs. Wilcox, becomes central to the story; the wrangling this bequest causes is a metaphor for the class struggles that weave like tangled braids throughout the whole of the book. The tragedy chronicled in the book is seen to have resulted from chance encounters, foolish pride, and petty misunderstandings.<BR>A deeply sad and beautiful book.	2003-06-26

There are wonderful characters in this book, and each gets an opportunity to tell his or her own story, each using a very unique voice. <BR>This fairly recent technique of writing stories on a similar theme, set in a common location, is catching on.

Tragic central story of a proud black man who has tried to live as just Man, not black man, and suffers for it when he is wrongfully accused of murdering a white woman, a woman who for many years was his lover. The further you read, the more certain you are that this cannot end well - but no way can you stop reading.<BR>Classic Faulkner at his best, with the typical huge cast of 'characters' (in every sense of the word) and side plots.	2003-06-26

The 'how to write' shelves at bookstores groan beneath the weight of all the tomes written on the subject. How to choose, how to choose? Easy: choose this one. I'm primarily a nonfiction writer with a published memoir (BABY CATCHER: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife, Scribner 2002), but I itch to write fiction. Like many writers of occasional fiction, I often have trouble with one aspect of the craft. For me, the middle of the stories comes easily, but I often have difficulty knowing how to begin - or, once begun, I can't figure out how to wrap it up with a believable ending.<BR>This book, Beginnings, Middles &amp; Ends, is a HUGE help at every step along the way.<BR>Five stars and then some.	2003-06-26

In this gently amusing memoir, he recreates the experience for us, his readers, ushering us into a world in which everything was provided to the family by the hotel and its purveyors. Bathroom supplies were mysteriously restocked; meals arrived by room service; beds were made and floors swept; clothing was ordered by phone and appeared in drawers and closets.<BR>Hotel Kid is a gentle and affectionate portrayal of New York's Time Square area as it once was, and of a very unusual childhood lived amid the then-splendor of the theater district.

Babycakes, in which ambitious Mary Ann (the wide-eyed innocent from the Midwest through whose eyes we earlier came to see an ingenue's view of live and love in the City) has a baby, was the first work of fiction to recognize the scourge of AIDS in SF.<BR>Drop dead funny, bittersweet, and enchanting, Babycakes dangles intricate and outrageously interwoven plot threads in front of the readers, and it all just makes you want more, more, more.	2003-06-26

Dance of Anger provides a clear explanation of many of the situations in which women find themselves feeling angry and not quite knowing why or how or who or most of all, what to do about it. Bottom line is, it is only by changing yourself within a relationship that you can hope to motivate (or just make it possible for) others to change and grow. Women are conditioned to stifle their anger or deny it, and this only leads to reactions in other areas that compound the situation. &quot;Anger deserves recognition.&quot;<br />It's definitely not a quick fix, but it just may lead to long term solutions for the things that mightily bug us in our daily relationships with spouses, parents, children, co-workers, bosses, etc., etc., etc.<br />Read it and give another copy to a friend - or enemy!	2003-06-26

The stories, though unrelated, share a common thread so that there is a sense of continuity that is often lacking in such collections.

Though both are Southern, they are cut from different cloth, she from calico, and he from tweed.

M. Forster is full of wicked humor that punctures the 19th century English class system. Superb cameo pieces. The character development is subtle and sure, beginning with our heroine traveling to Italy with her maiden aunt as chaperone. There, in a pensione, she meets an iconoclastic father and son, honest, rough-hewn, plain-spoken, who insist upon trading rooms when they overhear the prim aunt complaining that she booked a room with a view. It, of course, becomes a metaphor for room to view life as a whole, without prejudice, in all its wonderful complexity.<br />Don't miss this excellent book by this excellent author.

What a phenomenal talent...<br />Moo is a tour de force of satire on life at an agricultural university (known as Moo U., in the parlance) that scathingly leaves no cow pie unkicked. Smiley uses the hypocrisy, prejudice, and self-importance of the characters as a metaphor for our entire society. No one who reads this outrageous novel will ever forget Earl Butz, the Herculean pig that becomes such an obsession for more than one of the quirky characters that sometimes teeter on the edge of caricature. That quality and the fact that the whole charade seemed to go on about 100 pages too long is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.<br />A great book, nontheless.	2003-06-20

Josephine Tey excels at the twisted plot, the kind of story in which the unreal seems so real that not only are readers puzzled by the meaning of Truth, but even the characters in the story seem a little confused. This was made into an excellent movie, but the book weaves an even tighter and spookier plot. Brat Farrar agrees to assume the ID of a dead boy and step in as master of a British estate. Then he begins to believe his own tale as things that should be foreign to him somehow feel oddly familiar. Fully developed side-characters and tight, tense plot make for a wide-eyed, suspensful read set against the irresistible backdrop of post-war English country life with all the usual quirky and eccentric inhabitants of the genre.<BR>Excellent.	2003-06-20

Her exquisite and thoughtful language persists throughout as, trained as a naturalist, she links minutae in the natural world with the more close-to-home issues of parenting, family, honesty, and her political views. Some of her best writing can be found in this collection. <BR>Top rating.	2003-06-18

Both already altered by what they've seen and experienced, they drift into a relationship that neither intended to become serious. But serious it does become, to the point that Henry becomes a deserter to be with his pregnant lover. Things go steadily downhill after that...and the ending becomes inevitable.<br />A classic war story with the Hemingway signature.	2003-06-18

To sound trite, it was clear they were meant for each other. Without giving too much away, suffice it to say that they didn't not marry and live happily ever after. In spite of what might seem to others a full life filled with the usual ups and down, successes and tragedies, Ann never again experiences the love she felt for Harris.<BR>Heartbreak, pathos, love, memory, aching pain, and soaring passion - all come back in bits and pieces as Ann's deathbed vigil plays itself out. Beautiful writing throughout, the quality of which Susan Minot has come to be known for.<BR>Exquisite book.	2003-06-17

A child is a prisoner, caught between warring factions. In the camp, her life is made bearable when she is befriended by a wise old man.<BR>When, later, she seeks to find him again, she discovers that...well, I can't reveal what she finds, because it'd give away the magic of the story. It's a bit of Twilight Zone do-do-DO-do music that's called for here.<BR>Quick, easy read - wonderful and compelling book.	2003-06-17

Hampl shows and explains how it's possible to create a narrative arc within the genre of memoir writing from the most commonplace and seemingly mundane occurrences.<BR>Superb book written thoughtfully, quietly, lingeringly - meant to be savored, not gulped down all at once.	2003-06-17

In a Sunburned Country is not his best, best book, but it's right up there.<BR>Bryson is in his favorite element when confronted with oddities of whatever area of the planet he's exploring. If there's one place on this planet that's filled with enough oddities to keep a curious man on the tips of his toes, it's Australia. The place abounds with critters that exist nowhere else on earth, including its people. As usual, for at least part of the way he is accompanied by a memorable companion, which gives him an opportunity to talk to his reading audience via dialogue with the guy sharing his motel room or sitting next to him in a car traveling thousands of miles through sere terrain.<BR>This is travel writing at its best, with a HUGE dose of humor.	2003-06-14

Now I've just picked up knitting needles for the first time in 30 years. First I made a scarf (duh), then I made an afghan with a scallop pattern. Then I bought this book and made a couple of hats.

Her  insatiable curiosity, her obvious intelligence, and her ability to transition from one culture to another with remarkable ease all account for her rise in academe.<BR>The best part of this book, IMO, is the first two thirds; after that, it gets a little pedantic, almost as if she knew she'd finished with the good stuff and was just hustling along to get it all down and be finished with it.	2003-06-13

I'm the odd duck who didn't LOVE this book. Yeah, yeah, it was sad and sweet and touching and all that. But it's a cliche to have an old man on his deathbed imparting hard-earned wisdom to a brash young comer. I probably would have liked Morrie, actually, but I think I'd have emphasized a different side of him, if I'd been writing about him. This reads too much like the ubiquitous Chicken Soup series. Too much of a good thing, even truly good things, is still too much. I'm over it.	2003-06-13

When forced to make a choice, Lillian's world opens to self-discovery. Folly is an elegant examination of the inner workings of the heart of a woman.	2003-06-13

When Suzanne Arms' first edition of this book was released, it rattled the bars of the cage of OB departments everywhere. Nurses, midwives, and women lauded SA and sang her praises, while traditional-minded OBs hid in the corners and prayed their own patients wouldn't get hold of The Book. I believe that S. Arms practically fired the cannon that started the Natural Childbirth and Birth Center wars. Thank god.<BR>But, of course, doctors are far more powerful (not to mention lawyers and the insurance industry), so ultimately they prevailed, with the result that Cesarean rates increased, epidural rates skyrocketed, lawsuits increased, the $$$ amounts of lawsuit awards went out the roof, and patient satisfaction rates plunged. Partly as a result of that and their own culpability in setting up impossible expectations ('just trust me, do as I say, and you'll have a healthy baby'), many OBs now find themselves leaving their specialty because of unaffordable insurance premiums - and whole towns are without the services of an obstetrician.<BR>So this newest edition of this desperately needed book comes out not a moment too soon. Buy it, read it, pass it on to a friend. Women have GOT to take back their birthright before we breed an entire generation of women who don't trust their own bodies intrinsic wisdom of How to Birth.	2003-06-13

History, romance, mystery, a morality lesson.<BR>Set in Greece in the early days of WWII, the story of Pelagia, the daughter of the village doctor, spans her life into old age.<BR>Corelli is the captain of the occupying Italian forces and he takes over their house and stays with them. But he's not your typical military man: He is an opera buff, responds to Nazi greetings with \\"Heil Puccini,\\" and his most treasured possession is his mandolin. Love is complicated in wartime, even more so when the lovers are on opposite sides. <BR>Corelli's Mandolin explores all the various kinds of love known to man: love between people (passionate and platonic), parent and child, doctor and patient, love of people for their homes, their country, for life itself.<BR>Buy two, and give one to a good friend.	2003-06-13

Written as a series of vignettes focusing on the cases that come along, the author explores and enlightens her readers at a leisurely pace, which is just perfect for sitting on the warm sand and glancing up every now and then to check on the children playing at water's edge. <BR>Written with wit and wisdom, this is a book to be read, savored, and then passed on to a friend.	2003-06-13

There's a lot going on in Hanna's Daughters, and there's a lot of ground covered, and there are a lot of characters (and the fact that some of them have identical names makes it even more confusing). Sometimes all this makes for slow going, but it's worth the effort. In short, it's a family saga, a history of the women in one Swedish family moving through the history of Europe over a span of nearly a century.<br />Multi-layered, full of secrets, harsh truths, resentment and bitterness over the decades, it's worth the trouble it takes to plough through it.	2003-06-12

Man, Adair Lara knows how to follow that advice - and apparently is still on good terms with everyone in this book. Stupidly shelvedin parenting sections, bookstores should better market this as memoir. No one, having read it, would take it for a parenting manual. It's one woman's story of her difficulties, triumphs, and failures, challenges and sacrifices, doubts and agonies of blundering her way through parenting one of god's most difficult and brilliant (always a dangerous combination) teenage girls.<BR>Also, as Lara is primarily a humor writer, it's screamingly funny, and laugh you will, when you're not holding your breath to see what new devilment Morgan (the daughter) will get up to next. I think the most profound lesson a parent would get from this book is that if you love your kids and let them know it, you'll all probably survive those difficult transitional years.	2003-06-12

The story, in a nutshell, concerns the clash between 4 forces in a remote South American jungle reason: misguided Christian missionaries, corrupt local politicians, the near Stone Age jungle natives, and Lewis Moon. Beautiful progress of a story in which it's hard at any moment to know who to root for, a story in which no one really comes out a winner, and therein lies the moral.	2003-06-12

He will always remain as one of the best American essayists while at the same time continuing to earn acclaim for several other books that will always stay in print: childhood classics Charlotte's Web and Stuart Little, as well as the newer edition of Elements of Style.<BR>But his essays! Oh, they are so good, so rambling and thoughtful and gently pointed, many humorous while still making a deep and important impression. Anyone who strives to write good prose must read these essays to find out how a master did it and made it look easy. The first one in this volume, Death of a Pig, could serve as a lesson in How to Write.	2003-06-12

She becomes his helper and the subject of his painting. This wonderful, multi-layered book is historical fiction that rises many notches above other books in the genre.<BR>Vermeer's prosperous household is full of tensions: servents who have their own heirarchy, his domineering and perpetually-pregnant wife, the many resulting children, and his incredibly powerful mother-in-law. An exquisite  and painstakingly- researched portrayal of life in 16th century Delft through all levels of society - giving a vivid understanding of how small a sphere of life the characters were able to experience.<BR>Masterful and memorable book.	2003-06-12

Homestead is spectacular. The setting is an isolated Austrian village, and the inter-related stories span several generations of the villagers, exploring their known and secret links and relationships to each other. The history told in Homestead spans the time from early 1900s to almost 1980, and some of the most gut-wrenching and poignant tales concern the nearness of the Nazi threat during WWII. Once met through the pages of this book, the characters and their motives and secrets will stay with you for a long time.	2003-06-11

It's her kith and kin and neighbors and townsfolk and everybody in south Georgia, to hear her tell it. An engaging series of stories about memorable and eccentric folks who seem to populate White's world, this book makes it clear that White is a magnet for those with a story to tell.

The bed &amp; breakfast house in which they stay is run by the elusive, charming, and secretive Mrs. Smith-Porter who seems to be a helpful angel of some sort.<BR>Not a deep book, but no one ever said it was; just a thoroughly enjoyable way to pass the day on a screened porch with a fan, a squeaky rocker, and a glass of iced tea.	2003-06-11

Well, when this book came out, who could resist all the fuss and hullabaloo? Not me. And I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially knowing it had employed the new genre of creative nonfiction (my favorite, as a writer) to whole new extremes. Much of the book reads like pure fiction written by Faulkner in the modern era. That device is both the book's greatest weakness and its greatest strength.<br />But aside from the disclaimers of those who say, 'but that's not really how it happened,' it's a helluva good story, and full of character that are unforgettable and stole every scene in which they appear (in both book and movie). Lady Chablis, of course, tops the list and fortunately went on to write a book of her own and actually played herself in the movie - and thank god: no one else could possibly have done her justice.<br />Read it and enjoy it for what it is, an expose of Savannah society, a city whose residents at first were horrified to recognize themselves, and then when fame came, others were majorly upset to find they were not included. Go figure.	2003-06-11

The bulk of Breathing Lessons takes place during a car ride from Maryland to Pennsylvania that a middle-age couple, bound together by who-knows-what, take to attend a funeral. Most of Tyler's characters are misfits or eccentrics. In Breathing Lessons, she focuses on a couple so average as to be boring, and nothing much happens to them by the end of the trip/book. But we, her readers, come to understand the serious business of relationships and the ties that bind. Hilarious in spots, as all of her books are, it is the poignant insights into the moments that show this couple in all their everyday uniqueness that we remember long after closing the book.	2003-06-11

Me, I like Cider House and Widow better.<BR>Irving sure can write a good story, and he never leaves a loose end; everything in his books is there for a purpose, and there's virtually no such thing as an insignificant character or event.<BR>Cider House is really a morality play beginning in an orphanage that fronts for an abortion clinic. Homer, one of the orphans, grows up there, leaved to follow a girl he's fallen in love with on 1st sight, and becomes beholden and attached to her, her boyfriend, and her family, a family that runs 'an apple business' and hires migrant workers during picking and cider time. The story follows Homer, who seems to be following nothing much (but he's sure not leading!), throughout his life until well into adulthood, and every bit of it counts.<BR>And the movie's good, too, with Michael Caine as the infamous ether-addicted doctor in the orphanage.	2003-06-11

Pregnant women for the past 30 years have asked me '...but what does labor/birth really FEEL like?' Dorothy Bryant, by choosing to have her main character be blind and placing her in a situation where she is totally alone in a remote cabin when she gives birth, has written one of the most gripping and realistic accounts of what it's really like that I've ever read.<BR>A small masterpiece, just for that part of the story alone.	2003-06-11

The transient, rootless, poverty-stricken upbringing of the children in the Mason family is rife with tension, resentment, and a level of bleakness that's hard to comprehend. Bo Mason is the most powerful character, by far, a bootlegger always chasing the dream of fast money and instant wealth. It's hard to know exactly how Stegner feels about the character of Bo's wife, a long-suffering, self-sacrificing woman who remains loyal and always seems to be making excuses for him to their children. It's tough reading a story of such an abusive family situation, but it sure reads 'real' in its portrayal of a search for roots, for home, for love, for connection.	2003-06-11

We follow Larry, an ordinary guy, through his life through jumps in time of several years at a leap. Through the chapters, we follow him through a callow youth, through a first marriage and parenthood, divorce, his parents and sister's relationships with him and each other, remarriage and re-divorce, and most central to the book, his mundane job and rise to stellar status in his field of maze designer, of all things. But of course the maze is a metaphor for the complexities of life, trying to find ones way in the world. The dinner party at the end is clearly meant to represent the 'goal,' the center of the maze, but it's left to the readers to decide if Larry is likely to find his way out again.<BR>A lovely tour de force.	2003-06-11

He and his wife, Bernadette Dohrn, lived as fugitives for 10 years. The writing is good and tight and very engaging, but there's a self-serving quality to the story-line, and somehow I just don't get the feeling that I'm getting the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.<BR>Ayers story was at its best and most engaging during the first two thirds and then lost its hold on me once the bombing in Greenwich Village occurred and they went on the run><BR>Worthwhile, but I'm not sure it'll stand the test of time.	2003-06-07

This story is told in first person entirely in the child's voice by Eliza Minot, the babe of the family. Touching and poignent, funny and sad, the only negative is that the imagery and language sometimes pulls us out of the child's range of possibilities.<BR>A promising new voice from the talented Minot family.	2003-06-07

The story is based on a creative writing professor who is reasonably content with his life, nevertheless dallies with an 'innocent' female student, and suffers persecution by everyone from his wife, his peers, the PC police of the university, and ultimately himself. The spontaneous sex scene in the dorm that's interrupted by a dental emergency is drop dead, LOL funny. By turns hilarious, scathing, world-weary, and hateful, it keeps you turning page after page, always hoping for some uplifting turn toward resolution and forgiveness - but noooooo.....	2003-06-07

This is not a deep or revelatory book, not terribly meaningful in any literary way - it's just a great story with some delightfully memorable, and yes, Crazy Ladies. Three generations are spanned, headed by matriarch Gussie. Though some memorably dreadful events are chronicled, the overall tone is hilarity - and, in the end, love.<BR>May Michael Lee Smith write on and on.	2003-06-07

It doesn't cover everything, and some of the 'rules' are of course changing with the passage of time - but if a wannabe writer can't afford a whole bookcase of tomes on How to Write, then this is the one he or she should buy.<BR>Beyond those 14 pithy pages, however, are another 100 or so that extend the value of the book immeasurably: Principles of Composition, Commonly Misused Words, and perhaps the most valuable: An Approach to Style, which gives excellent advice along the lines of Do not overwrite, Avoid qualifiers, Don't over-explain, Avoid adverbs, Avoid dialect, Don't inject opinion, and tons of others.<BR>When all's said and done, however, one of the very best parts is a wonderful essay by the inimitable EB White himself - the Introduction, which serves as a perfect example of all that the rest of the small book preaches: write concisely, clearly, and well, and say something worthwhile.<BR>Other books for writers to consider: Bird by Bird, On Writing, and Writing Down the Bones.	2003-06-07

But his erstwhile hiking companion, klutzy, overweight, out-of-shape, pragmatic Katz steals the show in this book about a couple of neophytes attempting to hike the spectacular and challenging Appalachian Trail. You'll never look at Little Debbie's treats again without thinking of Bryson, but most of all of Katz.<BR>Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: the last 75 pages could have been scratched. Once the non-dynamic duo left the Trail, I lost interest.	2003-06-07

Isabelle has kept secret from everyone that Amy's birth was illegitimate - one gets the sense that she's almost begun to believe the lie herself. In her hunger for respectability and her attempts to 'protect' herself and her daughter, she has cut herself off from life, emotion, the art of living. A beautifully nuanced novel of understanding, compassion, and hope.	2003-06-06

I had difficulty believing a woman of Mary's era would actually behave in this way.

Guterson hasn't quite done it with East of the Mountains. But it's definitely a worthwhile read, a quiet exploration of the meaning of life set against the certainty of death, whether it comes naturally or by suicide, which is the crux of this book. At the beginning, the protagonist, Ben, a retired surgeon, has been diagnosed with cancer, knows it's terminal, and sets off toward his childhood home in the Cascade Mts for the purpose of committing suicide. Like most of us, he dreads a slow inevitable decline in which he becomes a burden to his family. As he moves forward toward what he expects will be his death, at the same time he moves back in time to his past. Like a film rolling backwards in a story that's moving forward, readers are treated to the history and analysis of his whole life, the choices he made, and how those choices continue to affect him. The odd people he meets along the way contribute to his saga with their own incomplete stories. He is yanked back and forth between life and death decisions, hard choices, philosophically faced, reasoned with, and decided upon.<BR>Beautiful rhythm and flow to the quiet, low-keyed writing, as well.	2003-06-05

The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think it could have been shorter and been improved by the editing.<BR>Thousand Acres starts out as idyllic: a family farm in 1979 in Iowa where everything seems to be humming along lovingly and perfectly. Larry Cook, the father (Lear) of three daughters, abruptly decides to turn the farm over to two of them, cutting the third out of the deal. Dark secrets emerge, recovered memories, the girls divide and unite among themselves and with or against their father. It's a story of love, hate, greed, pathos, and what it means to be 'family.' Painful to read in parts, but ultimately revelatory. Just needed an editor with a sharper pair of scissors.	2003-06-05

In Blackberry Wine, the magical character is Joe Cox, the pivotal character of Jay, an author's, youth in a small English village. Joe had a magical cottage and garden and made wine from the fruits and berries on his squatter's land by a river, and was the main character in Jay's award-winning novel. Joe's sudden disappearance devastated Jay. When he suffers depression and writer's block, he buys, sight unseen, an 18th century chateau. Joe's bottles of wine, which he's been carting around with him for the past 2 decades, also move to the French chateau. As Jay begins drinking them, magic happens, and there's the over-riding question of, Where is Joe now, and could it be that he's that guy who...?<BR>To say more would be to say too much.<BR>Lovely book.	2003-06-05

Exquisite writing about Mary Karr's volatile, on-the-edge adolescence in a nowhere little town in Texas. Anyone who thinks kids in a small town can't get up to 'mischief' would do well to read Cherry. Karr is talented, brilliant, and challenged by her situation: the child of unreliable, often absent parents who blunder through life as if parenting were a game you can choose to play - or not.<BR>As a writer myself, I found Karr's use of the second person 'you' when referring to herself to be a stunningly successful ploy, a way of showing how adolescents distant themselves from their own lives even in speech and writing. Maturing out of childhood and directly into sexuality, Karr finds her salvation in books and language, but it obviously wasn't easy.<BR>Wonderful writing, scary story, great book.	2003-06-05

Some of Virginia Woolf's writing is difficult for the modern reader to plough through - loooong sentences, convoluted construction, excessive naval gazing (in fictional form). But A Room of One's Own, a very long essay about feminism, independence, writing, and becoming one's own person, is actually quite readable, quite educational, and quite wonderful. The reader, at least this one, feels she's in the presence of a great mind at work as it ruminates on and on about these topics in a somewhat rambling but engaging personal reflection. Although written in 1929, the situation for women artists hasn't changed all that much, so it's far from dated.<br />A must-read.	2003-06-05

William Trevor is a master of nuance and existential questions with no answers. In The Story of Lucy Gault, it seems he's trying to answer a couple of the biggies: Why are we here, and what is the meaning of life.<BR>Set in the 20s in Ireland, this novel addresses the issues of loss and longing. Not wanting to leave her beloved ancestral home, Lucy runs away into the woods on the eve of her family's departure for England. Bereft, believing she's killed herself, her parents cut all ties with their past and wander Europe through the decades. Lucy is not dead; she's just broken her leg. But when she's returned to the house, of course her family is nowhere to be found. She lives out her life in her old home, alone, almost hypnotized by her past.<BR>Trevor's elegiac sense of place and deep understanding of the tragedy of the Irish character are perfectly suited for this novel. The Story of Lucy Gault is a book to be treasured quietly, preferably while one is seated in a deep wing-backed chair in front of a fire, and, on a gleaming side table, a drop of Irish whisky in a Waterford glass, poured from a crystal decanter.	2003-06-04

It reads as fast as a proper saute, progressing from his pottering around his mother's humble cafe in the 40s, thru the nerve-wracking French apprenticeship system, to his current star-studded life as chef, TV personality, author, and dean of the French Culinary Inst. in NYC. Firmly simmered in the stew of American life now, he still straddles the Atlantic with his humor and attitudes toward food remaining decidedly French.<BR>A winner, and as a bonus you get a few recipes tossed in along the way.	2003-06-03

While mourning the death of his brother and his rather sudden divorce from his wife, Glick finds himself alone with his two children for almost the first time. He chooses to take them around the world in an effort to see some of the planet's endangered species before it's too late. One gets the sense that it's also his effort to become a father before it's too late.<BR>Monkey Dancing works on many levels: environmental journalism, a travelogue, a lesson in parenting. Using the metaphor of world travel, Glick journeys into the heart of fatherhood, marriage, family, loss, conflict, change, and life.	2003-06-03

He's on the loose	If you've read Running with Scissors and liked (or at least appreciated) it, you'd better read Dry, too. It's mostly about Augusten Burroughs's re-entry after leaving rehab after his obligatory 30 days. Somewhere in the process of his experience 'inside,' something clicked, and he actually starts to examine himself, his motivations, his life, and the choices he's made - and it's not easy. Not easy for Burroughs to live through, certainly not easy stuff to write, not all that easy to read, either, but it sure makes for a good story.<BR>Funny, heartbreaking, and searingly true.

Passion, power, problems, and poignancy.<BR>The Other Woman is a passionate and bold walk across the minefield of marriage, and the characters take not careful mincing steps, but giant strides into uncharted territory. It's a story of a marriage dissolving around issues of mutual betrayal, but there's a twist: Instead of instant separation and 'getting on with life,' the couple segue into an exploration of 'what is it that makes a marriage,' the glue that can hold a union together, the tenuous bonds that make them test their staying power.<BR>Powerful stuff here...<BR>Sexy, too!	2003-05-31

Ooh, I gobble JK's books up as if they're M&Ms. What I love best is the fact that his background as a clinical psychologist lends credence to his probing expolorations and penetrating pick-pick-picking into the twisted criminal mind. In A Cold Heart (talk about a chilling title...), he extends his delving further to explore not only the criminal, but also A. Delaware and Milo Sturgis, and a cast of other characters, combining them into a melange of motivations and intricasies that somehow hold together perfectly.<BR>It is when Kellerman travels into the mind of a serial killer that he hits top stride, and that's what A Cold Heart deals with: the elaborate crime scene staging of a murder with no obvious motive. Then, of course, other murders occur, and the chase is on...<BR>Kellerman at his best. If you've liked his others, you'll love this one.	2003-05-31

I seem to need a dose of a new book by him about twice a year.<BR>His books featuring Leaphorn and Chee, for me, are the best of the lot, so Sinister Pig goes right to the top of the list.<BR>Here's the thing: Hillerman and his editors KNOW anything he writes is going to sell like thermal longjohns in Alaska. But still, his books read like they've actually been edited and checked and coddled a bit.<BR>Sinister Pig deals with murder - of course - dum-de-dum-dum: otherwise, it wouldn't be a Hillerman mystery. It also deals with lots and lots of $$$ missing from the Tribal Trust, drugs, greed, and hanky-panky on the 'rez.' I just wish Janet Whatzername, Chee's first love interest, hadn't vanished from the series so early... Here comes Bernadette Manuelito, however, to take up the slack.<BR>Don't miss it - but here's the thing lots of casual readers don't realize: You can take a Hillerman book, a topographical map of the Four Corners area, and a 4-wheel drive vehicle, and actually track down every single rock and arroyo and mesa and creek that's mentioned.

Here's the thing: I KNOW Anne Lamott loves writing fiction, and she's helluv good at it. But I swear she's at her best when writing nonfiction. Afterall, it was Bird by Bird and Operating Instructions that put her over the top; then she followed up with Traveling Mercies. The quality and longevity of her fiction pale by comparison.<BR>Bird by Bird is simply one of the three best books on the angst of writing and being a writer that's ever been written. The other two are Writing Down the Bones and S. King's On Writing. But the three books are very, very different. King's is actually pretty weird in spots, as he is, but for the most part it's all about philosophy. Natalie Goldberg's 'Bones' is very instructional and inspirational.<BR>But Lamott! Oh, Annie's book is just as outrageously honest and funny and true and painful in the telling as it is in actuality to be a writer.<BR>Wonderful, wonderful book; highest recommendation.<BR>Read it.<BR>If you're a writer, you'll get some advice from a master on how to cope with (or not) self-doubt, writer's block, and jealousy. But read it anyway, even if you're not the least bit interested in being a writer but just happen to like her other books; you won't be disappointed.	2003-05-28

There's just too much going on in this book for it to hang together; I felt as though I ought to take notes or draw up an outline to keep all the plot threads from getting tangled. In some books, multiple points of view work well, but in this case, it might have made the reading easier if Landvik had simplified, stayed inside one character's head, and cut out lots of the side stories.

Brenda Cullerton's family makes everyone else's look like The Cleavers in the 50s. Always strange, eccentric, and downright dippy, the eclectic blend of people she calls 'family' descends to purely outrageous behavior as they age. Cullerton, who escaped the craziness early on to try to build her own life, finds it necessary to return to help care for them as they dwindle in death's inevitable direction. What she finds defies belief and has the neighborhood association in full battle stance.<BR>Both hilarious and heartbreaking (sometimes we're not sure if we're laughing AT her or WITH her), Nearly Departed is an offering of love and a measure of belated understanding to her parents, however strange they may be.	2003-05-25

So her daughter, protagonist and pregnant teen Billy Beede, sets off to find Momma and dig her up for the loot.<BR>A sense of immediacy, of being right in the middle of the action of this laugh-out-loud book, is enhanced by the multiple first-person points of view in which the story is told. With electric and eccentric dialogue and perspective, Parks takes her readers on a hilarious car trip across rigidly segregated (and opinionated) Texas during the turbulent and sometimes dangerous 60s, dangerous especially if you're black in a redneck culture.	2003-05-25

In this coming-of-age story set in a small Italian village, the 9yo protagonist comes across a secret so powerful that it threatens to destroy his world. It's a tale of betrayal, morality, divinity, mystery, and redemption, set against the sere and harsh but beautiful background of Italy, circa 1980. And oh! the language! I know this is a translation, but it seems to me that the original in Italian must be spectacular for this gifted translator to produce such a masterpiece.<BR>Highest praise: this is a book that will stay with you, haunt you, and may even transform you.

Here on Earth is an attempt to explore the many sides of a once-loving relationship that has gone unexamined and unrealized for many years. The language, of course, is evocative, and makes the sharp evidence of damage to the individuals involved all the more searing.

Hints and innuendo propel the six characters of The Marriage of the Sea between the two irresistibly romantic settings of Venice and New Orleans as fluidly as a sleek sailboat upon the waves. This ornate and complex novel explores aging and decay (physical, spiritual, and architectural), marriage, barrenness in its many manifestations, lonliness, and the complex nature of relationships.<BR>A piece of writing as finely drawn as the lines of Venitian canals and as richly layered as the levels of New Orleans society.<BR>A winner.

At puberty, she enters the Red Tent, the inviolate space among the tribes of Israel in which the women gather for menstruation, childbirth, and the initiation of the girls into religious and sexual knowledge. All that was good stuff. And I loved, of course, the scenes in which midwives played a major part.<br />What I didn't love was the last third of the book, in which Dinah is in Egypt, separated from her son, working as a midwife (the only part of this section that I DID like), and living as somewhat of an outcast on the fringes of royal society. I felt this part went on waaaaay toooo looooong, for no purpose that I could discern. <br />Love came at last for Dinah, late in her life, and its portrayal, along with her marriage and married life to a good and loving man, was beautifully rendered. Her death scene at the end was spectacular - think about it: a death scene told from the point of view of the dying person. Masterful.<br />But overall, it could have been a much shorter book and been better for the editing.	2003-05-23

When writing a memoir, authors are advised to write the first draft as if everyone is dead - and then to prune the damaging parts in subsequent rewrites. Perhaps Mason pruned a bit too much. This otherwise lovely and affectionate memoir of how it was to grow up in a small, working-class town in Kentucky in the 40s and 50s is a bit long on respect and caution - and a bit short on grit.<BR>Otherwise, I loved it. I grew up in Kansas in the 50s and can relate to the pace, small-town values, and lack of danger (except from the \\"evil Communists\\" and \\"the bomb\\") that Mason portrays as such inherent parts of her roots. Her language, esp in the first part of the book focusing on her own childhood memories, is rich and multi-layered and pulls readers into every scene right along with her. In the rest of the book, she uses the techniques of creative nonfiction to weave a background narrative that spans the lives of three generations of women within the community.<BR>A worthwhile read; it won't change your life, but it might make you think, and it's certainly a pleasant trip to take with this accomplished author.	2003-05-23

For someone of Armstrong's mind-set, that last privation must have been hardest to bear. Outside the walls of the cloister, meanwhile, the chaos of the 60s was raging, making the life within more inexplicable - and ultimately, irrelevant.<br />There is one bright, kind, and encouraging Mother Superior, however, who provides the necessary window of light, a person who provides Armstrong with both a reason to stay and a reason to leave the convent.<br />It's a blessing for us that she did leave and go on to live her life as a scholar, teacher and author. It's almost an equal blessing, however, that she endured those 7 years and writes about it so poitnantly; it makes her presence in the world all the more valuable.	2003-05-22

Undaunted at the prospect of taking on everything in the universe as a topic, Bryson pretty much succeeds in taking us on a journey through his quirky mind with his own insatiable curiosity as a tour guide who both asks and answers questions the rest of us probably never thought to pose.<BR>If you like Bryson, this is a must read. If you've never read him before, well, you'll quickly become a regular reader such as myself, eagerly awaiting each of his books as they come off the press.	2003-05-21

I wouldn't advise other readers to do the same. It's an interesting book, an attempt to describe the state of criminal investigation during the Victorian Era, and the advent of psychological profiling. However, there were long stretches of writing, whole pages sometimes, that just went on and on and on - and I skimmed.<BR>Life during the Victorian years proceeded at a more leisurely pace than it does in our own era, but lordy, does the writing about it have to be just as slow?<BR>I think not.	2003-05-19

This book became essential to me	I came to my midwifery career (see my memoir, BABY CATCHER, Scribner 2002) via the traditional route of nursing school, working in hospital delivery rooms and alternative birth centers, then going to midwifery school, graduating as a CNM. Nowhere along the way was I taught anything about herbs. When I found myself doing home births in Berkeley, CA, many of my clients assumed I was an herbalist. Although I never once claimed to have a knowledge base in that field, I learned enough from Wise Woman Herbal to talk intelligently on the subject. Many women who choose home birth shun not just hospitals but also traditional Western medications. Wise Woman Herbal was always the resource to which I turned when I needed to know if a particular herb a woman wanted to use was safe and/or efficacious in pregnancy. And eventually I carried and recommended certain ones with confidence, especially blue and black cohosh, ginger, and oil of evening primrose.<BR>From me and from all midwives when they were new: Thank you, Susan Weed.	2003-05-17

Geared toward midwives of all persuasions (CNM, CM, LM, DEM, etc.) some of whom may find themselves in a homebirth practice by default (as I did after completing midwifery school in 1980 and unable to secure hospital privileges until 1984), it's also essential reading for those pregnant couples who plan to give birth with a midwife in attendance. It is also an excellent resource for those who, because of their insurance, are destined to birth with doctors in hospitals but still want to be prepared with knowledge that will help them claim as much control as possible.<BR>Beautiful photographs, exquisite drawings, and personal stories complement the appeal of this classic book that is destined, one hopes, never to go out of print.	2003-05-17

The attitudes of today's obstetricians have regressed to those of the 50s when women expected to be treated like sheep, and the doctors accommodated them. We had a surge of feminist autonomy during the 70s and 80s (when I caught babies in Berkeley, CA, and wrote a memoir, BABY CATCHER, Scribner 2002), but then the Epidural Epidemic struck full force. And now far, far too many women are acting like sheep again - and their doctors are just following standard procedures.<BR>Henci Goer's wonderful book gives credit to the fact that pregnant women still have brains: they can think, read, talk, and make decisions about their own care. In order to do this, they need unbiased information about the prodigious amount of obstetrical interference that goes on under the radar screen of the average woman's awareness, especially when she's in labor. Not afraid to call a spade a spade, and a charlatan a charlatan, Henci Goer lets readers inside her own head as she reasons and rationalizes her way through tons of 'scientific evidence' to arrive at logical and user-friendly recommendations.<BR>If you're thinking of becoming pregnant, know someone who is, or already are, DO NOT FAIL TO READ THIS BOOK.	2003-05-16

It's obvious that she's drawn on a wealth of personal experience and poured it all into these pages.

Doh! I coulduv hadda V-8! Why didn't I write this book myself???<BR>Anyway, thank goodness Penny Simpkin got around to it, and she's done a beautiful job. Her book is structured like a series of childbirth education classes with emphasis on the partner instead of on the laboring mom herself. She deals with the stages of labor, drugs, anesthesia, Cesareans, and emergencies in an easily-comprehended and logical format - discussing helping measures and their rationale at each step in the process.<BR>As someone from within the system, I highly recommend this book.	2003-05-16

She hightails it back to her dysfunctional and wacky family in Dublin - dysfunctional as only an Irish family can be.

Couldn't be better, especially if you love the authors, love feminine point of view writing, love all things Irish, and love a collection of wonderful stories that make you laugh, weep, and rejoice, sometimes all in the same story. These tales are as celebratory of female friendship as good heart-to-heart girl-talk. The best moments, to me, are when tradition-bound Irish mores come face-to-face with 'someone different' (read 'scandalous') - all seasoned with pink-cheeked Irish wit and red-nosed Irish charm.<BR>A winner on all counts.	2003-05-15

I usually come up short at the end of one, flip the page looking for more, and go huh? Where's the rest of it?  <BR>With The Laws of Evening, such is not the case. It's a collection of stories around a central theme, the clash of cultures in post-World War II Japan. They have female protagonists and a very feminine point of view, tho the tales deal with strong and tough material: death, abandonment, fading of cultural values, war's aftermath, national guilt, individual shame...<BR>There is a strain of wistful saddness that binds these tales, each of which can stand alone.

A physically absent father and emotionally absent and defeated mother didn't prevent O'Faolain from somehow finding her path through the medium of books. It was actually her near disastrous mistakes with 'boys' that, oddly, fostered her escape. To save Nuala's immortal soul, she was sent to a convent - and then with a scholarship, on to Oxford and a career.<BR>Career. Not a word usually found in the same sentence with 'woman' in Ireland in the 50s and 60s. The fact that O'Faolin chooses not to bear children, finding solace in books, literature, and writing, does not always settle well with her compatriots - and indeed, she herself admits that it wasn't always the best situation as she struggled with alcoholism and depression.<BR>Ultimately, however, Are You Somebody emerges as a sociological expose of Irish women and the choices they are too often forced to make.<BR>Not just 'another Irish memoir.'

His melancholy, measured style of writing makes it easier to believe the fact that he stayed on in Cambodia of his own free choice when the blood-letting began. His refusal to abandon the autonomy of the ability to think for himself forms the spine of his tale. Heroism is balanced with fear; understanding balances anger; the senselessness of tragedy gains a measure of the majestic when rendered by Bizot.<BR>A very worthwhile read from an insider's perspective.	2003-05-10

I discovered Millay's poetry when I was in high school in Kansas in the Fifties, the Beatnik era, but in Kansas, I certainly knew no Beatniks. Millay became my muse, the poetic string connecting me to another world beyond the endless fields of corn and wheat. I visited her home in Greenwich Village, read all of her poetry, and can still quote long passages from memory.<BR>Savage Beauty, a large book, does ample justice to the large personality of Millay, chronicling her life and lifestyle, both of which were 'unconventional,' in every sense of the word. Such was the impact of this genius, this 'force of nature,' that she willfully created her persona, in the process lifting herself and her dependent family out of poverty and onto the front pages.<BR>The intensity of her poetic works is mirrored in the intensity with which she lived her life. Her short signature poem 'I burn my candle at both ends; it will not last the night.

Namu's mother breaks with the cultural by moving to a nearby village, and, like mother, like daughter, Namu breaks out even further, eventually touring far from home with a musical troupe. Returning home to her powerful mother, she finds the truth in the adage: you can't go home again.<BR>Leaving Mother Lake is an anthropological study presented as memoir, a satisfying way to learn much about this hidden and previously unknown culture.	2003-05-08

It's a beautiful coming-of-age story set in the French countryside. I first read it back when the earth was cooling, and I have no idea what became of that original copy. I bought it again as an adult, loaned it to a friend and never saw it again. I recently bought it yet a third time, a used copy on Amazon, and this one I'm not loaning out.<BR>Greengage Summer is a delicious melange of mystery, romance, travel writing, and character study. I'm surprised it's no longer in print, because I truly think it's a classic. It started me reading everything Rumer Godden's written. I like her writing tremendously, but Greengage Summer is her best.<BR>When Mum is confined to bed in a small French village, her children are left on their own in the pensione. It's mainly the story of the oldest daughter's blossoming toward maturity, but it's more, much more, than what appears on the surface.<BR>Read it, and loan it to a friend - but be sure you get it back!	2003-05-07

Powerful, evocative, painful, and beautiful	Beloved, Toni Morrison's beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning story of the south about one woman's life during the years on both sides of the Civil War, sucks readers in and doesn't spit them out till it's good and ready. Mesmerizing style of writing with the story-line weaving in and out, back and forth through time and location. That loose time thread sometimes makes for confusion in the reader's mind - as indeed it confuses Sethe, the protagonist with a deep dark secret that loosened the anchors of her mind.<br />The story begins with hints (well, more than hints) of a dead child, a ghost, a runaway slave, and all the horrors associated with those issues. But the writing, Oh, the writing! It reads like poetry, words wrapping around images, caressing them from all angles, shaping them like wet river clay into the precise phrases needed to reshape the structure and flow of the story.<br />Parts are so graphic that it becomes difficult to continue reading; parts are so touching that rereading is desired; parts are so lyrical that they just flow along like a slow, sultry river in Louisiana<br />And most readers don't quite see the end coming till it's right upon them. There are a bazillion hints as to what's really behind Sethe's often inexplicable words and actions and memories, but they are leaked out one by one, like slow drips from a leaky faucet. When the truth comes, spelled out in screaming letters, it's still a shock.<br />Mandatory reading on many levels: history, literature, style of writing, and message.	2003-05-07

Her obvious love for her magical childhood in Tuscany (esp the years before she was shipped off to England for school) shines forth from every paragraph as she recounts her life as one of the benignly-neglected children of a pair of English aristocrats who owned a 15th century castle, the Fortezza della Brunella, as well as a villa above Florence.<BR>Centered around two very different periods of the author's life, the rural castle and the more urban villa, A Tuscan Childhood is full of famous people (her parents were part of the literati), beloved peasant farm workers, nursemaids, and Aunt Janet, upon whose death the villa falls into the hands of Ms. Beevor's mother.<BR>Toward the end, in diatribes against Mussolini, the Allies, death taxes, and everything and everyone else, an old lady's peevishness with changing times mars what is otherwise a lovely and evocative piece of writing.	2003-05-07

But Eugenides manages to create a stunning literary achievement in The Virgin Suicides. There are long passages of writing so lyrical it makes you forget about the underlying tragedy of the macabre story.<BR>One my one, the daughters of the Lisbon family walk the road to suicide. But that's just the surface of this many-layered book. Read it, and get lost as this talented author explores universal themes of adolescence.	2003-05-06

Bohjalian refuses to be typecast, and for a straight guy he writes very well from the woman's point of view. And of course he writes well from the man's point of view. Well, now he's challenged the swampy middle ground: writing from the point of view of a transgendered man-to-woman.<BR>The plot line is subtle, and the story is told from many different vantage points: Dana (the transgender character), his girlfriend, the girlfriend's ex-husband, and the girlfriend's college-aged daughter. All eventually come across as complex and sympathetic, and, for a small Vermont town, amazingly accepting. The 'bad guys' are the parents of the school children who are students of Dana's girlfriend and want her ousted for dating him/her.<BR>The only part that I found difficult (and I'm a medical professional) was the ultra-graphic description of the surgery itself. I found myself sort of looking at the printed page out of the corner of my visual field, not sure I wanted to continue reading. If I, a woman, had some trouble with it, I can't imagine how a man would feel reading it - - - and how the heck did Bohjalian ever manage to write it without some major tranquilizers?<BR>There's a lovely twist at the end of this book, which against all odds, has a happy ending.	2003-05-06

I'm primarily a nonfiction writer (memoir, first person essays), and when I began dabbling in fiction, I found myself adrift in a world without fixed borders. At least in nonfiction, I always knew what happened, cuz I'd lived it, right? But with fiction, the sky's the limit. I didn't know where to start - and even more important, I didn't know where or how to end.<BR>What If is a series of exercises that will help make a good writer better and help even experienced writers to craft better stories.	2003-05-06

The cafe run by Idgie and Ruth, women in love with each other, was the focal point of all the little town's life. There's an unsolved murder threaded like a hank of old yarn that runs through the tale, and once you've finished the book, you'll never again feel quite the same about eating southern barbecue.<BR>Fannie Flagg manages in this small book to deal with some of the great literary themes: racism, sexism, ageism, love, disability, death, and grief.<BR>The stories run backwards and forwards in time, just as an old lady's mind does, and sometimes it gets a bit confusing, but it you make a point of checking the date at the top of each entry, you won't get lost.<BR>On top of all that, there are some great recipes at the end, including of course, one for fried green tomatoes. I tried it. Delicious, just like the book itself.	2003-05-06

I mean, after he wrote The Things They Carried and In the Lake of the Woods, it must be tough for the poor guy to compete with himself.<BR>But if he hadn't written those books, if this was the first thing he'd written, I'd have given it 5 stars.<BR>July, July has a big cast of characters, a group of college graduates returning for their 30th reunion, and the characters intermix and mingle as people will during a reunion weekend, making it sometimes difficult to keep track of who's who.<BR>Inserting pivotal tales from Julys past, O'Brien give us wonderful explorations of universal themes in this daring novel: hope, love, disappointment, despair, and of course the Vietnam War. <BR>A couple of chapters from July, July appeared as separate short stories in The New Yorker, and they work well in that way, especially the bittersweet and tragically funny story of Dorothy confronting her husband's discomfort regarding her mastectomy by getting plastered and walking topless toward him down the driveway. The reaction of her elderly next-door neighbor is masterful. Utterly priceless.<BR>The book is a testament to the entire generation of us who grew up in the long shadow of Vietnam.	2003-05-06

A feminist social satire set in the early 1900 somewhere in Australia. It's the story of Missy, a poor and put-upon spinster living under the autocratic tyranny of the male members of the family. She seems destined to a life of misery till a cousin, recently divorced (delicious scandal!!) arrives in town and sets the 'gentlemen' in their place with a scheme that leaves the women in the story and the readers of the book richer for the experience in every way.<BR>Very witty and very wonderful.	2003-05-06

This searing quasi-autobiography dressed up as fiction is worth every painful moment it takes to get through it. The book's title says a lot: it's the story of the childhood of a \\"white trash bastard\\" and her battles against physical and sexual abuse. I wonder: was this the first book that inaugurated the era of so many memoirs about childhood abuse that Oprah eventually elevated to mythic levels?<BR>Bastard out of Carolina is a scarey story with memorable characters who will haunt readers nearly as thoroughly as they haunted Bone, the child protagonist: the violent ones, the jealous ones, the just plain weird ones, the inexplicable ones...<BR>This is not a book with a happy ending. One gets the sense that the end of the story hasn't been written - possibly because the author hasn't lived it yet.<BR>Outstanding. Worth 6 stars.	2003-05-04

Funny, heartbreaking, brave, fearsome.<BR>Marietta, the protagonist, is a large, &quot;blue-black&quot; pregnant teenager in the Gullah speaking region of South Carolina. Big Ma (her granny) delivers her of a set of surprise twin boys (a scene that I, a midwife, found particularly engaging), and the rest of the book is Marietta's struggles to do right by her two hulking sons. Not to give the end away, but football becomes their salvation.<BR>The daring part of the book's construction is that huge sections of dialogue are rendered in accurate Gullah dialect. It takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it flows beautifully and adds immeasurable richness to the reading.<BR>Don't miss this one.	2003-05-04

What a wonderful, rollicking, emotional, roller-coaster of a story about the assimilation of a family - focusing mainly on the four de la Torre daughters - from the Dominican Republic into America after they fled for political reasons.<BR>Enough time has passed that Alvarez's stature and place in the ranks of authors to become firmly established, but this book is still one of her best.	2003-05-04

Lost in America, written by the gifted Nuland, is an ode to his father, a work of self-therapy for himself, a gift to his readers, and an offering to anyone looking for resolution and understanding of a difficult family situation.<BR>Lost in America begins with the author admitting to coming under the grips of debilitating depression, and the writing of this book seems to have been his way of fighting out of that despair, of coming to terms with some of its causes, and of trying to explain all that went wrong with his father's life as a Jewish immigrant in America - and how those failures impacted Sherwin Nuland. The turning point comes with Nuland's discovery that his father suffered the mental and neurological effects of late-stage syphilis - and with his acceptance that happiness for him would be impossible.<BR>Heartbreaking and oh, so beautifully written. But also difficult (on an emotional level) to read; you may find yourself putting it aside for a few days before wanting to continue. But persevere and read to the end. You won't regret it.	2003-05-03

It's the only way this story could have been successfully told. Otherwise, it'd read as self-gratifying pathos. In the immediacy of the child's voice, it reads as spare truth without the self-pity that writing from the distance of adulthood might have introduced.<BR>An unbelievable series of tragic events ripped this family apart: death of the mother, remarriage of the father to an unloving woman, death of the father, exploitation by the stepmother in order to continue receiving the social security checks, involvement with some weird religion, persecution and abandonment of the children...the list goes on and on till finally Jennifer is pretty much on her own in a communal quasi-religious household, cut off from all her relatives and still just a child. Rescue by a seemingly loving aunt and uncle comes at the end...but read the sequel to find out the rest of this horrific story.<BR>Yeah, it's depressing - but Blackbird is also full of hope and it's written in such a lyrical style that you can't help but continue reading. However, I'm glad I didn't know any more about the rest of her life till later. Jennifer Lauck was only 11 or 12 at the end of this odyssey of endurance, and you just know that's not the end of her story.<BR>You would be right.	2003-05-03

You wanna talk about a dysfunctional family? Here it is. It's during the years of WWII. The author's father is off fighting for God and country, and her mother is having a delayed adolescence, so author Lorna Sage is shipped to her grandparents house somewhere in rural England. Her grandparents are weird, weird, weird, but it is their very faults that ultimately make Sage, a well-known and powerful literary critic, into the person she becomes.<BR>Her grandfather is a debauched, intellectual, furious and infuriating vicar whose idiosyncrasies were seemingly limitless. Her grandmother's rage at her lot in life and the man who was responsible for it (and by extension, ALL men) never once abates - and you almost champion her for her constancy.<BR>Bad Blood reads as wicked fun with a strongly feminist underlying message. I loved it.	2003-05-03

It's light and funny, a little rambling in spots, which he never was in his 'literature,' and simply delightful. It focuses on that golden era in Paris when starving young artists didn't really have to starve as they gathered in the cafes and discussed life and art and literature and politics.<BR>Peopled with memorable and well-known (try Gertrude Stein and Picasso) characters, Moveable Feast is a delight for modern readers.	2003-05-02

I'm old enough to remember this story from when it came around for the first time, about a bazillion years ago. But I only heard about it then; I didn't read it. This time I read it, and wow, what a story. This guy, obviously loaded with charm, guts, and savy aplenty, was probably the biggest swindler and impersonater the world has ever known. He passed himself off as a doctor, a pilot, a professor, and a lawyer, all on the basis of a glib tongue, a demeanor that inspired trust, and a 10th grade education!<BR>Now totally reformed and earning a great living helping to catch people such as he used to be, he's still as charming as ever.<BR>Talk about a con artist. You just can't help but admire his chutzpah - and see? We're all going out and buying his book. So he's winning all over again!<BR>Enjoy it.	2003-05-02

In fact, I could have written it!<BR>Although my mother stuck, more or less, with one main man (my father) from the time she turned sixteen, I couldn't help comment on the similarities between Aneita Jean and Mary Churchman (my mom). Those many points of comparison made this delicious reading. I believe anyone with a flamboyant female relative in her background would find this book a delight. For me, it filled in many areas of my mother's life during that same era (30s and 40s) that she has pulled a gauzy curtain over - now that preserving her self-image as a devoted wife and mother is more important to her than creating the well-bred hussy image.<BR>Beauty Before Comfort - what a great title! It sort of says it all, and this book reads as well as a pair of beautiful and sexy sling-back high-heeled pumps: even if the shoes were borrowed from a cousin, aren't quite the right size, and pinch horribly by the end of the evening, by God, they sure look great!	2003-05-02

It's sharp, sassy, irreverent, funny, and just made for women to enjoy like tortilla chips with salsa and a cold Dos Equis straight out of the bottle.<BR>This debut novel by a skilled and experienced writer with Attitude with a capital A delivers on its promise.

Focusing on the decade after Saigon fell and ending with his emigration to the United States when he was 18, the author documents the crazy shifts in his life from one of privilege before the age of 8, to one of pathos and fear under the Communists, when the whole social order was reversed and his family was at risk of losing everything, including their lives. Now a dentist in the US, Nguyen initially penned his memoir as a self-healing attempt to overcome the many scars of his difficult childhood. It is fortunate for his readers that he decided to seek publication.	2003-05-02

Kincaid sucks readers in again	Autobiography of My Mother is a powerful, mesmerizing, and other-worldy tale of Xuela, a woman of Dominica, West Indies, who is a worthy subject for Kincaid's musical cadences and rapturous prose. Boy, can this woman write - and she infuses all her prose with the lilting voices of her compatriots. There's no way to read her work aloud without finding yourself lapsing into the patois, sing-songy style of speech that comes thru so clearly in her writing. This book is a painful tale, the recounting of a difficult life without much love shown to the girl as she grows from motherless infant to strong and bitter young woman who aborts her pregnancy and remains defiant the rest of her life. Raised motherless herself, she determines never to mother others. Taken on a metaphorical level, the woman's story could be the story of Dominica, torn by suffering, racism, power, and the unbreakable bonds that bind them together.<br />Powerful writing on so, so many levels.	2003-05-02

With her usual grace and compassion, Mary Higgins Clark's book The Second Time Around explores the mind of a mass killer; in fact, a good part of the book is told from his point of view. It's a complicated plot with everything spinning off from a corporate crime committed by a character who then dies in a small plane crash. As is usual with her books - indeed most mysteries, there is the sense of a clock ticking as the book nears its end: will the culprit be caught before...whatever?<BR>Very well done, and a classic Higgins plot line.	2003-05-02

After reading 2-3, I began to see a sameness in tone and plot, so I moved on to other authors... So when a friend gave me this memoir, I flipped it open and began reading with a healthy dose of skepticism.<BR>Well.<BR>This memoir puts MHC right at the top of my list - not my list of wonderful mystery writers, but at the top of my list of wonderful memoirists. Widowed at a young age to raise 5 children on her own, Clark drawn on her mother's example of selflessness in making ends meet and making the best of every situation - and every opportunity. Kitchen Privileges is an inspiring read - much more so than I ever expected.	2003-05-02

Serafina, an illegal immigrant, is mistakenly separated from her toddler daughter and sent back to Mexico where she gets trapped caring for her ailing mother. Her daughter treks through the CA welfare system, one foster home to another, and emerges as a pregnant teenager. <BR>The majority of the book parallels Serafina's trek north, across the border once again to search for her child, while Elvia does the same in the opposite direction, searching for her mother.<BR>Frankly, I loved the story and the writing.	2003-05-01

The flip side of the equation, the part that makes this book a dangerous one to read in bed beside a sleeping mate, is that the manuscript is found by a bear who manages to sell it on a trip to New York. The bear is courted by NY's best and finest celebs, and he impresses reviewers, agents, and editors with his hyper-intelligent and deeply moving monosyllabic grunts and one-word responses to interview questions.<BR>But the parts that'll make your trying-to-sleep spouse want to kill you are the love scenes between the bear and the object of his affection, a 'fur-bearing woman,' (a lady who doesn't shave her legs).<BR>Don't miss it. Buy two, and give one to your favorite quirky friend.	2003-04-30

This book, however, deserves all the praise. A writing team of mother/daughter wrote it (how do they DO that??), basing the dense and riviting plot on a computer game that suddenly seems to be imitated in real life as people, based on characters in the game, keep turning up dead. The plot thickens (dum-de-dum-dum...) when we learn that one of the protagonists lives as a near recluse, surrounded by protective devices, due to having been threatened with murder years earlier - and the perp was never nabbed. And when it's discovered that the employees of the software company (the game's inventors) all have been given new IDs by the tight-lipped FBI, well, things get dicey. With 3-4 sub-plots unwinding, the book is a testament to the skill of the authors' ability to keep everything moving along with the skill and precision of a teenager with a joystick.	2003-04-30

She tells her 'cuenta' through many, many, many very short chapters, each of which is usually a little family anecdote that, strung together like the beads of a rosary, form a loop that completes this tale of history and mystery, of love and jealousy, of sin and forgiveness - and most of all of joy and celebration.<BR>Caramelo, titled in honor of an unfinished striped antique rebozo (shawl) in which the fringe is partially unknotted, is a beautiful offering for Cisneros fans, like a platter of colorful tropical fruits.	2003-04-29

In this book, the camera lens is on the interplay of contact between members of the Ramsay family as they vacation (in about 1913-ish) at their summer home in the Hebrides, trying to plan an excursion to the lighthouse.<BR>Popular once again because of Cunningham's novel The Hours (a spin-off of Mrs. Dalloway) and the superbe movie based on the novel, Virginia Woolf's books are once again bestsellers - and that's a very, very good sign.	2003-04-29

It couldn't have come at a better time, as legions of today's women voluntarily turn to the tricks of modern obstetrics, notably epidemic epidurals.<BR>I'm a retired midwife (and author of Baby Catcher, a modern midwifery memoir), and feel I learned a good bit of my craft by listening to Gaskin speak, visiting The Farm a bazillion years ago, and reading and rereading and rereading Spiritual Midwifery. But much in obstetrics has changed since Spir. Mid. was published; at that time, natural childbirth was all the vogue, and Ina May was sort of preaching to the choir. Now, oh lordy, now things are very, very different. Cesarean rates hover around 25-30% in some hospitals, and the epidural rate is twice that. What are these women thinking??<BR>It was by studying Ina May's 'style' that I realized the power of teaching by parable: the power of story-telling. Women's eyes glaze over when they're lectured to, but their attention is rivited by birth stories. In this Guide to Childbirth, Gaskin deals with the changes in modern OB and offers ways to get around the routines. But she once again relies on her story-telling techniques for getting across her central message: If you're surrounded by people who believe you can do it and who support your own belief that you can do it, then guess what? You can do it.	2003-04-29

In reading this book, you get a strong sense of McDougal's honesty and integrity, and how difficult it must have been, in the presence of so much idiocy and insanity, to maintain that integrity.<BR>Once she more or less finishes dealing with Kenneth Starr and his grandstanding attempts to elevate himself while destroying the presidency, she spends the rest of the book describing her horrendous experiences in prison, her fellow female inmates, her fear of the guards, and her interest in prison reform.<BR>The amazing thing, after all she's been through, is that somehow McDougal decency and sense of humor survived her ordeal - and it makes her book a pleasure to read, even as it makes us wince and wish to avert our gaze.	2003-04-29

Shutter Island came to me by accident; I ordered a different book, the bookstore sent this one, then discovered their mistake and told me to keep it anyway. So I read it - and became instantly engrossed, as well as an instant fan of Dennis Lehane.<br />The plot revolves around the investigation into the almost magical, surely impossible disappearance of a woman from a heavily guarded hospital for the criminally insane. Set in the milieu of the 50s, that decade of The American Dream, there's an inherent innocence at play in the background, a sense of truth, but something dark and maybe deadly is going on. Then comes the threat of a hurricane and a prison riot...<br />It'll keep you up all night, no lie.	2003-04-28

Anita Shreve just can't seem to write a bad book.<BR>In All He Ever Wanted, her tale concerns unrequited love, the results of the somewhat unlikely 'love at first sight.' Maybe this was more commn in the early 20th century, the era in which this book is set, but it was the only part of the tale that stretched my credulity.

This is one of my all-time favorite quick funny reads, a book that my husband, 12yo son, and I read in bed together. Why on earth has it gone out of print? It deserves to appear in storefront windows next to a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe.<br />It's an affectionate spoof of the residents of San Francisco Mission District, focusing on the intertwining lives of three families. At the hub of the story is Delfina Varela, who sells her soul to the devil in exchange for begging for a new Cadillac so she can visit her hermana in the valley. What she gets is 'a used Chevy (a sports car with about 25 miles on it) that comes with a dying petty criminal whom she tries to cure of his mortal bleeding wounds by offering him an enema.<br />Buy it used, read it, and laugh, laugh, laugh.

She can write pathos, tragedy, slapstick, satire, mystery... Where will it end? Never and nowhere, we hope. <BR>This is a novel about greed in the 80s, that decade when it seemed the Good Times would roll on forever. The story concerns an amiable, trusting, 'good' man who is lured down the shady paths of easy money. It's a story about principles, ambition viewed through the gauzy curtain that hides (not very well) The American Dream.<BR>Smiley scores again.	2003-04-27

It's really the story of the re-making of Chicago, the site of the 1983 World's Fair, but that doesn't even begin to describe all the shenanigans that are detailed in this book. The result of all the efforts was the 'in record speed' creation of The White City, at which time the world was introduced to a bazillion innovations including electric kitchens, zippers, the Ferris wheel, and Juicy Fruit Gum.<BR>Will ceases never wonder?!

I live in the East Bay, and she knew I wouldn't be able to resist a true story set so close to home, San Francisco. The story spans two eras. The first is April, 1906, San Francisco's golden era in every sense of the word; a fortune in gold coins was set loose - and then came the earthquake. <BR>The book then jumps forward to 1989, and history turns to mystery and murder. <BR>Much more than it seems at first glance, The Lost Gold of San Francisco is a poem of grace to a city both past and present that the author obviously holds dear.	2003-04-27

And she proves it with remarkable aplomb, including the answer to the nagging question of what really kills you if you jump from the Golden Gate Bridge.<BR>Stiff is highly readable, even if you're squeamish (which I'm not), because of the macabre, bizarre, and esoteric nature of much of her material, as well as the gallows humor and dark hilarity with which she spices her writing. That 'material' would be CADAVERS. Dum-de-dum-dum. Your only risk is that you might die laughing.<BR>Read it. Actually, buy a signed first edition.

Then I got ahold of Cavedweller - and it might as well have dwelt in a cave itself for all the notice I took of it. Why did it take me so long to pick it up and read it?<BR>Answer: the cover photo was ambiguous and didn't draw me in, and the title was...odd. <BR>What a mistake! I picked it up while cleaning out bookshelves a few days ago, flipped to the first page, and barely put it down till I'd finished it. It begins with death, and death (or the threat of death - many near misses) persists throughout. But somehow the women of this book triumph above poverty, narrow-minded neighbors, small town pettiness, Holy Roller invective, no-good men (though, to Allison's credit, there ARE a few good men), and lack of opportunity.<BR>I admire the author's ability to move seamlessly forward in time without her readers demanding to know absolutely everything that happened in the intervening years. Characters grow and learn and change, and Allison's writing plops us down at the critical moments so we can observe first-hand the events that caused the transitions.<BR>Wonderful book, wonderful characters, wonderful writing.<BR>Highest recommendation, right behind Bastard out of Carolina.	2003-04-25

It's almost all telling, written in narrative style. There's very little dialogue or writing in scenes.

It's difficult to believe it was written in 1938, because it is as pertinent now as it ever was. Even Carl Sandburg called it &quot;The best book ever written about how to write.'<br />Brenda Ueland says, '...we must...find our True Conscience...the very Center, for (there lie) all originality, talent, honor, truthfulness, and courage.'<br />If you want to write, read If You Want to Write.	2003-04-23

Jane teaches herself to write so she can leave a series to letters to her daughter, and the letters are full of misspellings and grammar errors, written as she would speak.<BR>Wonderful fictional telling of a brief era that ended with the death of Calamity Jane and her contemporaries.	2003-04-22

The story concerns 28yo Edna Pontellier, a well-to-do wife and mother in New Orleans' Creole society. Her frustration with the limits placed on her sexual, creative, and artistic leanings lead her to rebel in a way society cannot understand or condone.<br />The writing style, popular when the book was written a century ago, is more 'telling' than 'showing,' and modern readers may find the reading a bit of a slog these days. But the story, even though the outcome quickly becomes predictable, is compelling enough to keep one reading and reading.<br />A classic.	2003-04-18

Many of her books are set in India during British rule, and the patrician tone may be off-putting to some. But she sees the comedic humor in certain British government 'types' as well as the stereotypical Indian servants, landlords, and petty town mayors.<br />Kingfisher's Catch Fire is a classic cultural clash in which a clueless but well-meaning English widow with two children goes to Kashmir where she can live cheaply on her widow's pension - and one of her children is nearly killed in the process.<br />She is, of course, defeated in her attempts to change or 'civilize' the natives and...well, read the book yourself and find out what happens.<br />A good read.	2003-04-16

She chooses not to abort her Downs Syndrome child, Adam.<BR>Beck comes from a Mormon upbringing, which may have influenced her choice, although she has broken from the practice of the faith of her childhood (without breaking from her family).<br />But more than being just a book about choice, it's a book about spirituality of the New Age variety, a transforming process that leaves the author herself confounded by and almost disbelieving of the metaphysical and 'New Age crystal kissing' woo-woo 'stuff' that happens to her during the process of her pregnancy, birth, and her son's babyhood.<BR>Adam becomes her teacher, her conduit into a deep and mysterious world that she, herself, barely believes in.<BR>I found myself suspending disbelief and just going with the flow of this lovely book.

Writing is a lonely process, as I quickly learned when I began writing my memoir, Baby Catcher (Scribner 2002). It helped considerably to know that the agonizing moments I experienced while trying to craft just the right phrase, the perfect sentence, the hang-together paragraph were shared by Ms. Dillard and, by extension I suspect, most other serious writers as well.<BR>As we authors and as-yet unpublished writers sit alone and get RST of wrists and fingers and forearms from incessant pounding of the keyboard, staring out the window at a telephone wire or a bare tree or a garage wall, it's immeasurably helpful to know that Annie Dillard is sitting in a remote cabin somewhere, doing the same thing.

The dialogue sings, the action never stops, and the situations are side-splittingly funny. It's a book that should not be read in bed at night beside a sleeping mate: the bed shaking with your laughter will waken your partner.<BR>Don't miss The Mammy - and then read the other two in the trilogy.	2003-04-02

It's a saga, the chronicaling of a child's (as she grows to old age and death) Appalachian life in a cabin 'up a holler.'<BR>Rich with loving detail, philosophy, and the indications of the passing of time not only for the protagonist but also for her community and the country itself, it'll make you laugh and cry and sigh.<BR>Read it, if you haven't already!	2003-04-02

There is a lilting quality to the way she puts words together that lets you know exactly how she wants the lines to be read. It's easy to add the Carib accent, as well.<BR>Lucy is a bright young girl come from The Islands to work as au pair for a wealthy couple with 4 daughters. As Lucy matures and rises from her past to carve out her own definition of herself in this strange new world, the marriage between the parents of the little girls unravels.<BR>At the core of this book by Kincaid (and from others of her's I've read thus far)is the ambiguous love/hate relationship she has with her powerful mother.<BR>Read it!	2003-03-09

It's good.	2003-02-23

She describes her mother as waking up every morning not knowing who she would be that day - so imagine the child's life, waking up not knowing who your mother would be.<br />Reichl was obviously scarred by this childhood, but she also triumphed, raised herself - and learned to cook and appreciate the good food others offered her along the way.<br />Read it.

When I wanted to reread it, I couldn't find it, so I bought another copy. I've loaned it out, never had it returned, bought it again, ditto, ditto, ditto.<BR>I've probably bought this book 10 times over the past 20 years, and that's no doubt a record for me.<BR>People associate Colette with Cheri and her other erotic and somewhat scandalous writing and life-style.<BR>Sido (her mother) and My Mother's House are written in an altogether different tone: lyrical, idyllic, dreamy, funny (of course; she's a very funny writer), nostalgic.<BR>Read these two companion books, usually sold in a single volume, to get a real taste of what it was like to spend your childhood in rural France before the turn of the last century, in an eccentric household run by an unusually permissive mother and a much older, loving but distant father.<BR>To read these books is to be sucked into another era by a writer uniquely skilled at her craft - and most of all, it gives you a fresh appreciation for the child who became Colette.	2003-02-16

Set in 19th century Poland in a Jewish shtetl, it's the interwoven stories of a group of women who were born and raised in the tight-knit village and have now grown into women, many with children of their own.<BR>The central figure of the story, and of the village, is the local midwife and healer. Being a midwife myself, I was of course drawn to this character who held great appeal for me.<BR>There's a quality of magical realism, almost like a fable, that sustains the book, and I found it captivating and very inspirational.<BR>Lovely. Read it. You won't regret it.	2003-02-16

That's a mistake. Introduce yourself to The Dubliners, a series of unrelated stories about the people of the great city. It's imminently readable, enjoyable, and is the best way to begin to take a dive into the writing of one of the 20th Century's greatest writers.

No gorgeous 15yo girl I've ever met or heard of would devote herself so completely to all the children of a tiny village on Long Island. I kept wondering: Where are the 15yo BOYS in this town, and why aren't they tromping down the dune grass to get to this shimmering morsel of female teenage perfection??<BR>But the writing was beautiful, and McDermott can cast a spell with mood writing.<BR>As I said, it's difficult to review this one. I'm conflicted.	2003-02-06

Most of the message comes in 'story,' a kinder and gentler way to impart knowledge. <BR>The title essay has received mixed reviews, dealing as it does with Sept. 11. I found it a beautifully crafted piece of writing, with the information proceeding in a snail-like coil of images and stories that pulled me into its spell.<BR>Small Wonder is a book to buy, to treasure, and to share.	2003-01-25

Each 'chapter,' some of which are only a few sentences in length, is a little vignette of a different aspect of Esperanza's life in her home, on the street, with relatives, at school, and in her wider neighborhood.<BR>It's written in the child's voice, and maybe that's one of what I would call the books difficulties. A persistent child narrator's voice can become cloying, and it's necessarily limited by 'what the child can know.' I guess that's another way of saying the voice got a little tiresome after while.<BR>But that very voice is also part of the book's strong appeal...<BR>I dunno...You'll have to read it yourself, something that's easily done at one sitting.<BR>House on Mango Street is a very interesting experiment, bound to be dissected and discussed in writing classes for a long time.	2003-01-25

It's the story of a man he never met, his maternal grandfather, Charlie Bundrum, who died a year before Bragg was born. The story is told through the masterful sewing together of snippets of memories of his relatives, achieving the status of near folk history as Bragg creates a whole quilt from a pile of scraps.<BR>Beautiful writing about a man all of us would have been privileged to know, an illiterate man, a wonderful father, a 'pretty good husband,' a God-fearing man who never set foot in a church, a man some would dismiss as an Alabama hillbilly - but never would they say that, having once read this book.<BR>More than having written just a memoir of a memorable man, Rick Bragg celebrates an entire family, a class of people, a region of our country, and the generations of those whose lives spanned both sides of the Depression.<BR>Read it. You're gonna love it.	2003-01-01

A good friend kept tellng me, \\"Read it, read it,\\" and finally, reluctantly, I did. And I couldn't put it down.<BR>I laughed like the hyena who plays a pivotal role early in the book. I bought into the outrageous setup. I don't give a fig for the religious message that others argue about. I found the book, the story, and the moral thoroughly engaging and 'believable,' at least in a metaphorical sense. Lay aside your reservations, and read this one. It's great.	2002-12-30

Vietnam and the massacre at My Lai are at the core of this book about secrets one hides even from oneself, post-traumatic stress syndrome, a marriage of love that's based on deceit.<BR>O'Brien is working through his own Vietman demons in all of his writing, and one feels the essential truth behind this fictional account of a rising political star brought down by incidents from his past. The writing coils back on itself, revisiting common threads that keep recurring but each time are viewed either from a slightly different angle or with just a little more recovered memory or self-knowledge. <BR>A tour de force of writing.<BR>Highest recommendation, along with all of his other books.	2002-12-19

It beguiles, it teases, and it delivers. Mattie's life is a mess, her love affairs are a mess, her mother is a mess . . . and aren't we all in some kind of mess? What I especially loved about Blue Shoe is that there's a little mystery thread running through all the messiness that somehow manages to connect everything in a very tidy way that's not typical of Lamott's writing. Very clever and simple, at the same time.<br />Read it.	2002-12-17

And humble (in person), too, so what's not to like?<BR>Well, the beginning was long-ish, and the end seemed to come on too quickly. The middle was perfect.<BR>Interesting way of writing dialogue that I've never seen employed before, all in a single paragraph with only commas separating what one speaker says from another. In Mason's capable hands, it works well.<BR>Give it a try, pass it on to a friend, and look forward to his next book - after he graduates from medical school in 2 years!	2002-12-16

They are caught, tortured, raped; they escape (or not)and return to leave yet again. And in between, they tell family history, stories, myths, and folk tales to help explain the milieu in which they are living and the motivations for their sometimes inexplicable behavior.<BR>A brave and worthy first novel that gets better and better as it goes along.  Organized in four 'books,' with each told in first person by 4 different people, including a guerrilla for the resistance. By the midpoint, the author has hit her stride.<BR>A worthy read.	2002-12-16

Frankly, I'm not sure it's going to stand the test of time, and I don't feel moved to reread it. But there was a quiet power in the story, and a rare kind of healing took place, in spite of the somewhat unfulfilling ending (which I don't mention for the sake of those who haven't read the book yet).<BR>Read it.

I only recently purchased it and just finished it last night. It's a book to read in a quiet spot, to savor, to melt into as Cronin carries you very gently through three generations of O'Neil's family.<BR>The book is written as a series of short stories; each can be read without benefit of the others, but together, they prove the statement that, sometimes, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. <BR>Very beautifully constructed.

But as soon as I started reading, I was hooked. I found the woman's reactions believable; people's reactions to grief come in many forms, and this dissociated response is but one of many.   <BR>    In creating a protagonist who was just barely on the sane side of a total breakdown, the author made it possible to stay within her main character's point of view throughout the writing. I found that compelling.<BR>    The shift in tone from jaunty, sexy, and hilariously funny to the many lyrically beautiful passages (especially at the end, in the park) didn't bother me. Her flip, sassy, seemingly shallow responses wereclearly defensive. Her deep, gut-level, poignant grief was painful to share. Both felt exactly right. <BR>    This Zeidner lady can really write.

But, really, I love Hiaasen and just can't resist reading everything he writes. He's wacky, loony, impious, a total lunatic. I went to a book signing when Basket Case was released, and he's just as funny in person as he is on the printed page.<BR>Hiaasen is a full-speed ahead man when it comes to the use of similies; being a fellow author and a simile-lover myself, I treasure his gems and wish I could come up with even half as many that were as good as all of his, things like: 'She looked about as Latin as Goldie Hawn,' 'he blinked like a sleepy porch lizard,' ' he scratched at his Old Testament tattoos,' and 'he had about as much charisma as a bowl of cold oatmeal.'<BR>You gotta love it!	2002-07-04

I've never read Ian McEwan before, but I will read everything of his I can get my hands on in the future. I found this book reeled me into its aura as though I were a fish on a line.<BR>The technique of having each of the four parts focus on a single pivotal day in the very long lives of the characters worked perfectly.<BR>When I read the last two pages, I burst into tears with no warning. I never saw the end coming.<BR>Also, there's a terrific sex scene beginning on p. 126...McEwan has nailed it!	2002-07-04

It cast a spell on me.<br />The sense of impending doom both in the present-day story and in the parallel story set on the Isles of Shoals off the coast of Maine/NY was handled with breathtaking control and precision.<br />Most of all, as a writer myself, I was captivated with how easily she made the shifts between present and past, switching many times within a single chapter with no separation between the two other than a paragraph break. Never once was I confused or lost.<br />Shreve held the tension and suspense perfectly. While I began to suspect the conclusion of the 1833 story about 2/3 of the way through the book, I never saw the end of the modern story coming, which made it all the more powerful. And Shreve managed to make every single character sympathetic.<br />I thought it a masterful job.	2002-07-04

But I came away strangely disappointed. It's not that it wasn't a good book; it's just not what I expected.<BR>If a reader hopes to get a feeling for the present day Vietnam, this is probably not the book to begin with. As a returning Vietnamese who left his country as a 10 yo after it fell to the Communists, the author experiences almost exclusively the underbelly of the culture and sees little to praise.<br />As a vehicle for exploring his own conflicted relationship with his parents, siblings, extended family, and his own identity, it works well.<BR>As a source for learning more about the length, width, and most of all the depth of Vietnam, it is less successful.	2002-07-04

I found the tone, the subject, and the nanny and Grayer, her 4yo charge, engaging. Mrs. X was rendered as both hateful and worthy of pity, while Mr. X was painted as a cardboard figure, the epitome of the philandering AWOL dad. The writing was good (I'd give it a B), although some of the transitions were confusing. The success of this book is not surprising, but I doubt it will stand the test of time. It should, however, make a hilarious movie, one that will NOT appeal to wealthy Manhattan couples who hire nannies. They will all be too worried about seeing themselves!	2002-05-17

Books	5	5	7	N	N	memoir masquerading as fiction	I've never known anyone (clearly Julia Alvarez is writing about herself in this book, maximizing on the genre of creative nonfiction and morphing it into Fiction) with such an ability to see oneself as others see one. I've written a memoir myself (Baby Catcher: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife) about my 15 years as a homebirth midwife in Berkeley, and I could never come close to Ms. Alvarez's unflinching self-analysis through the eyes of others. Cudos to this prolific, entertaining, and self-revealing author. I have met her at bookstore reading events, and she is as delightful in person as she is in print. Write on!	2002-05-11

I've recently seen my first book, BABY CATCHER: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife, published by a major NY publishing house (Scribner). What they say is true: authors, even new ones, don't receive the in-depth editing that they used to. I had a great experience with Jake Morrissey, my editor, but without the help I got from this wonderful book, the completed manuscript I presented him with would have needed much more work - and I'm not sure Scribner would have paid for his time at that level of scrutiny.<BR>Using the skills I gained by studying Browne and King's book, I am now teaching classes in How to Improve Your Writing; it's that good. Writing it one thing. Writing well is altogether another. This book teaches you how to do it. Buy it. Read it. Pass it on to others. <BR>Highest recommendation; they've done a service to all those who seek publication. It worked for me!	2002-05-10

I found Ansay's prose lyrical, mesmerizing, and almost poetic throughout this beautiful book. To be able to write about her losses as a result of a still-mysterious illness similar to MS, with calmness and lack of hyperbole, is admirable and enviable. From the very beginning you know this story doesn't have a happy outcome, but at no time did I feel depressed. On some level, I rejoiced for this author, for her own successes and insight and hope and the joy in small gains, small triumphs over her difficulties. Limbo is a love story, an admirable one. I wish this author lived next door to me. I would sit at her feet in awe and bake her cookies and bread at every opportunity. May she continue to write and write and write.	2002-05-10

Three years ago, while I was researching available midwifery books in preparation for writing my own recently-published midwife memoir, BABY CATCHER: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife, I found Juliana's book, snatched it up, and devoured it. Sitting on the subway, I muttered aloud, 'Rats, someone else wrote the book I should have written!' But I wrote my own story, anyway, because, after all, it's different from her story. I enjoyed and appreciated every line of Juliana's book, paralleling as it does the struggles of most midwives who have tried to maintain a private practice. I recommend her book without qualification, not just as a midwife tale but also as a memoir of a courageous and empassioned woman leader.	2002-04-17

He writes so well, with such craft and passion. I went recently to Book Passage (an independent bookstore in Corte Madera, CA) to hear him reading from Ava's Man, and I just wanted to kidnap him so he could be my own personal writing muse. He talks like he writes: warmly, honestly, and from the heart.<BR>Highest praise.	2002-04-17
