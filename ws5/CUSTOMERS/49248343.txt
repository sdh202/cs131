What a joy it was to pick up this book and roar with loud laughter on the commuter train once again! I couldn't help myself!<br /><br />Everything we love about Stephanie and the Burg is here in spades...where to begin? Sister Valerie and her swain, \\"Ooogie Oogums,\\" are nervously preparing for their wedding. Valerie has gained 60 pounds and Alfred Kloughn (\\"Oogie's\\" real name) has taken to having violent anxiety attacks about being suffocated by a whale in a wedding dress.<br /><br />Grandma Mazur is still hankering after the funeral home. Joe Morelli is as gorgeous and sexy as ever, ditto the mysterious luscious Ranger. But Stephanie has changed. Oh, she's still chugging donuts, she's still having car after car blown up. But in this book, she has decided to quit being a bounty hunter! That leaves Lula in charge...shudder! Stephanie feels she needs a safer environment.<br /><br />But when Steph gets a job at the local cleaners, she is accosted by the very deadly Grandma Macaroni, she of the hideous, mind-boggling mole. I won't even tell you the rest...not even what happened to the mole.<br /><br />Read it and love it! Welcome back, Stephanie!!	2005-10-08

He has always been the sardonic type, but now, perhaps due to a scary and painful problem with his urinary system, he views his world with a (pardon the expression) jaundiced eye.<br /><br />From the staff meeting from which he emerges with a ghastly torn and bloody nose (after sneezing blood all over his colleagues), to his serious run-in with a rather nasty goose, to his ernest male writing student whose only claim to fame is describing violent rapes, to the amazingly dysfunctional professors with whom he works, \\"Lucky Hank,\\" our progragonist and \\"Straight Man,\\" describes his life in a masterpiece of understated hilarity.<br /><br />Having been an English major, I roared at certain students...they must exist at every university...and at the pompous, often idiotic professors.<br /><br />Truly, this is a cannot-miss work of fiction. I only wonder what took me so long to find it. Highly recommended.	2005-10-05

And if not, what of the person in the shroud? And why are so many people dying over these bones?<br /><br />The mystery thickens confusingly as Temperance, her lover and police sidekick Ryan, and her friend and archaeologist Jake keep stumbling over bodies, modern and ancient--as they struggle to solve a mystery of importance to every modern religion on the planet.<br /><br />It sounds breathtaking, but somehow remained flat throughout. I was never fully engaged, and remained mildly interested. Still, it's a fairly good read. An interesting addition to this book was at the end: \\"From the Case Files of Dr. Kathy Reichs,\\" where the author/real-life forensic anthropologist explains what lead her to concoct this plot. I found that more interesting than the book itself. Die-hard Reichs fans (like me) need to read this book, but if you have never read her, start with one of her early ones, like \\"Deja Dead.\\"	2005-09-29

It seems like ages since loyal readers said goodbye to Rhyme and Sachs in \\"The Vanished Man,\\" which I read several times to keep myself company until Deaver's newest in the series would arrive--and here it is!<br /><br />While maybe not as intense as some of his others in the series, \\"The Twelfth Card\\" is nevertheless a fun, forensic ride as we join Rhyme et al for two days of solving a potentially unsolveable crime. In this case, it is truly puzzling: Somebody is trying to murder a teenaged student in Harlem, and it's no street murder. The most sophisticated hired guns are after thin, bookish Geneva Settle, but why? Rhyme gets involved after a failed attempt on Geneva's life results in the murder of the librarian in the library where Geneva was studying. And the terrifying attempt on her own life is plain to see. As is the professionalism of the crime scene.<br /><br />In his now state-of-the-art home office, quadriplegic Rhyme barks out orders in characteristic unpleasant way (but we love him) as he sends his team, all of whom we know well, out in the field to follow each clue.<br /><br />There is very little of the personal relationship between Rhyme and his protege Amelia Sachs in this outing, and I found that disappointing. Nevertheless, \\"The Twelfth Card\\" is, as all of Deaver's works, ingenious, engrossing and intensely satisfying.	2005-09-20

On the cover, the word \\"Thought\\" is underlined, lest we lose the point. Oh please! Argh!<br /><br />Anyway, this is a highly disjointed very slow story of two women in different eras: Barbara, quintessential 50s housewife who is so boring (although we are meant to know that she has Deep Thoughts) and inconsequential that it is impossible to engage; and Siena, a spoiled, self-centered fashion writer who lives in a perfect apartment with her lawyer husband.<br /><br />Each woman's story is told in competing chapters, with no foreseeable link between them, and nothing to draw the reader. Siena's issue is that she doesn't want children and her husband does. Barbara's issue is that she sometimes feels stifled in her perfect life, and is drawn to a young man (yawn). By the way, she is only 42, and thinks of herself as at least 60, so it's very hard to sympathise.<br /><br />ANYWAY, the link between the two women is revealed on the very last page, and my reaction was, \\"So?\\"<br /><br />This is NOT Buchan's best; and nothing near \\"Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman.\\" Be forewarned.	2005-09-12

I don't really have the words to describe the brilliance of J.K. Rowling or to say how much I feel she has enriched the reading world. Words simply fail me.<br /><br />As in each successive book, \\"Half Blood Prince\\" is very dark--as one would expect in a classic parable of good vs. evil. But Rowling is full of tricks, even for the reader who thinks she has prophesied everything. Wrong. Rowling is always one step ahead.<br /><br />So we are left with many many questions (Spoiler Alert: Do not read the following unless you have read the book):<br /><br />1. What's with Snape? Was he following Dumbledore's orders? Or is he really what Harry thinks he is?<br /><br />2. Is Dumbledore really dead? And if so, will he still be able to interact with the living (eg, Harry)?<br /><br />3. Why was Dolores Umbridge at the funeral? She of all people?<br /><br />4. Will Harry truly desert Hogwarts? Is this a wise move?<br /><br />5. Will Hogwarts in fact stay open?<br /><br />6. When will Voldemort make his move, and is Harry really ready?<br /><br />7. Will Draco survive to join the right side?<br /><br />Just a few questions...and like everybody else, I don't think I can survive until the next--and last--book. But then the thought of it being the last is almost unbearable, so maybe it's wiser to wait!	2005-09-06

I bought the boxed set and prepared to be mildly entertained, if not outright bored to death. Well...from the very first page of the very first book, \\"The Sorcerers Stone,\\" I have been hooked. Totally and completely and irrevocably hooked.<br /><br />These works are so beyond \\"children's books,\\" which people who haven't read them still say to me when they see me reading. I find them completely brilliant, often hilarious (some of the names she comes up with just have me on the floor), insightful, well you all know the rest as you all have read the books, I must be the last one in creation.<br /><br />From the innocent joy of Harry's first realization that he is a wizard, in Book One, to the increasingly dark battle with the forces of evil, these books are a parable for all mankind. Do I sound pompous? I can't help it. I defy anyone to read \\"Goblet of Fire\\" and tell me that there is a better good-vs-evil allegory that is so deep and yet so much fun to read.<br /><br />If anybody reading this has not yet read the Harry Potter books, I urge you to put away your prejudices and take the leap. You'll be so glad you did.	2005-09-01

It has a forward by Catherine Crier, whose book on the case I loved; the author has credentials; I couldn't wait to get some insight.<br /><br />Instead, I got a theory (repeated endlessly, as in over and over and over and over), which is: \\"Birth Is Death.\\" See...infant Scott was MURDERED...his pysche, that is, because Bad Mommy Jackie Peterson had already given away other children and Scott had pneumonia and was SEPARATED FROM MOMMY AT BIRTH, thereafter to experience a sort of psychic death. Apparently Ablow doesn't know that ill infants, even dying infants, are allowed to be touched and held by their mothers in the NICU. But nevermind.<br /><br />See...Mommy and Daddy didn't really WANT Scottie, so he had to be their GOLDEN BOY so they wouldn't MURDER HIS PSYCHE even more than he had cause see...Birth Is Death! Oh, did I say that?<br /><br />So when Scott murdered Laci and his unborn child, it was because he himself was already the \\"walking dead.\\"<br /><br />Wait for the paperback.<br /><br />Better still, wait for somebody to LOAN you the paperback.	2005-08-17

That is stressful enough (and defies belief, frankly), but no sooner does Anna try to get acclimated than she finds herself smack in the middle of a horrendous case of child abduction.<br /><br />A secondary, but intertwined story, involves Heath, a former avid ice climber who is now a bitter paraplegic thanks to a bad fall the year before. How she comes to be up to her neck in the nefarious doings of the child abduction lends quite a bit of tension to the story, but also some confusion as well, as we switch back and forth from Anna's to Heath's points of view.<br /><br />Add a strict polygamous religious cult, and you run the gamut from A to Z of people torturing people.<br /><br />This book makes for fast reading, and is definitely a page-turner, but don't expect the typical Barr novel; look instead for some real uneasiness.	2005-08-08

The horror of this particular murder has never left Alex, and when he receives a call from one of the just-set-free murderers, he is upset and nonplused. Especially when the young man is himself murdered before he can ever tell Alex what he wanted.<br /><br />Alex tries to shake off the unease of the call, but before he knows it, he and police buddy Milo Sturgis are knee-deep in pursuit of one of the slimiest serial killers in all of fiction--and there are quite a few! Trying to piece together the horror of who is doing what to whom, and just how vile the killer is, takes all of Alex's time--while his love life with new woman Allison seems to be taking a turn for the worse.<br /><br />This book barrels along; it's hard to put it down, and for once Kellerman has kept his obsession with street names and Los Angeles freeways to a minimum. Highly recommended, a great summer read, good to see Kellerman at his best!	2005-08-02

Yes, it's part Auntie Mame, part To Kill a Mockingbird and part The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.<br /><br />I don't care. I simply raced through this book, enjoying every single derivative page, wincing in some parts, but smiling most of the time. Other reviewers have described the plot in detail, so I will only add my small comments: Small-town Southern motherless girl on the cusp of puberty in the early 60s (well before the hippies) meets free spirited, wild as the wind, too good to be true cousin Nora, who has been everywhere, done everything, seen everyone...and comes roaring into town in her bright pink T-bird. She changes young Peyton's life, the life of Peyton's sad, widowed father, and the lives of just about everyone in the town.<br /><br />Is there a message? I don't really think so. I just went along for the whirlwind, enjoying it immensely as a highly pleasurable summer read. Don't look for deep insight, but if you need something to take along to the beach, Nora, Nora is perfect.	2005-07-26

Robb) seems to be paling a bit in her romance novel genre, the In Death series is getting better and better with each subsequent book.<br /><br />Origin in Death starts with a bang: The ugly, possibly professional murder of a Nobel Prize winning doctor and scientist, Dr. Icove, he of the famed Icove Center, plastic surgery hub for the rich and famous. Before the blood is even dry, so to speak, Icove's son, who co-runs the tony clinic, is murdered as well, in the same way.<br /><br />It's up to Eve, cop extraordinaire, to get to the bottom of the murders and figure out what's behind the \\"too perfect\\" profiles of the two Icoves and their clinic. What she finds is beyond human imagination, even in the year 2059, where this novel takes place.<br /><br />Along the way, Eve's husband Roarke painfully tries to plan a Thanksgiving dinner/reunion for his recently discovered huge Irish family; Mavis, near the end of her pregnancy, reminds a horrified Eve and Roarke that they are to be birth coaches, and Peabody and McNabb continue to cohabit in bliss. There are some really funny moments in this book, and the mystery and eventual solution are \\"prime,\\" as McNabb would say. A winner!	2005-07-25

Mark steps in to help manage the children and lend succor to Eve. A man who has had a lot of trouble becoming and staying an adult, and consquently cannot truly commit, even to those he loves best, Mark harbors secret longings to reunite with Eve. But Eve found her true happiness in steadfast John, and is grieving truly and mightily.<br /><br />Against this backdrop of sorrow and rebirth is an ugly secret so vile and so opposite the lovely setting in which it takes place, that it takes the reader's breath away. Miller presents this secret, which I will not reveal for fear of presenting a spoiler, in such a calm and understated way, from the point of view of the victim, that it makes it even more appalling. And we are completely drawn in to the danger and the wish to protect and repair this truly nice family.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book, well written, well crafted, well told, by an author who is at the peak of her talent.	2005-07-15

The stranger makes it clear that either Taylor takes the baby, who \\"has no people,\\" or the baby will be in mortal danger. Taylor, a single woman who wants, more than anything on earth, to have no ties, accepts the little bundle, whom, for reasons explained in the book, she names \\"Turtle.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the story is absolutely quintessential Kingsolver: car trips through the Southwest in a ramshackle half-dead Volkswagon Beetle; a stranger than strange assortment of characters, male and female, who defy description; and at the heart, the growing love between the homeless little toddler Turtle and her reluctant \\"mother\\" Taylor.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about Kingsolver herself as an author, or about this book in particular. I have never read anything less than spectacular by this author, but \\"The Bean Trees\\" may well be the best of them all.	2005-07-07

It had me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning to the very last page, and I was sorry when it ended.<br /><br />Nora Roberts, a.k.a. J.D. Robb, really hits her stride in this story of a nice, upper-middle-class family that is brutally murdered, one by one, in their beds. The murderers, brutal assassins, even get the housekeeper and a sleepover guest--but inadvertently leave behind a 9-year-old survivor, spunky Nixie Swisher, who witnessed the murders while hiding.<br /><br />Nixie, who seems like a young Eve (the futuristic hard-edged New York cop who stars in this series), is taken under Eve and Roarke's collective wing while Eve doggedly stays on the scent of the killers. Nixie is a delightful character; I couldn't help but wish that Eve and Roarke would adopt her, and I won't do a spoiler by saying if they do. Suffice to say that I hope she appears in future books.<br /><br />This outing is much more focused on the cop work, and much less on Eve and Roarke's collective childhood traumas, which is a welcome rest. There is enough to let us know they're still dealing, but the story itself is fast-paced, suspenseful and satisfying. On to the next!	2005-07-01

Unlike the last few in Fairstein's Alexandra Cooper series, this one really held my interest, as the plot is wound around the tales of Edgar Allen Poe.<br /><br />When a decades-old skeleton is found entombed behind a brick wall in a home where Poe once lived, and it is ascertained that the corpse was buried alive, Poe's tales become all too real. Alex, Mercer and Chapman are quickly caught up in this very cold case that becomes hotter by the second as they uncover a mysterious Poe society, all of whose members could have been invented by the master himself.<br /><br />Entwined with that interesting mystery is another case Alex has on her plate: the return of the so-called \\"Silk-Stocking Rapist,\\" who terrorized women on the East Side of New York, and then mysteriously disappeared without ever having been caught. Now, it seems, he is back, and Alex, head of the DA's Sex Crimes Unit, is desperate to catch him.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this book and am glad that Fairstein seems back on track like she was in her early works. Recommended.	2005-06-19

It feels like blasphemy for me to give less than 5 stars to a Nora Roberts book, particularly one of a trilogy, which I always love; one about gardening, a particular passion of mine; and one with a ghost in it, which Nora always handles so well. But, much as I don't want to say it, \\"Black Rose\\" bored me to tears.<br /><br />This second offering in the \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy starts with a charming note to readers from Nora herself, all about her own love of gardening, and I liked that better than the entire book. It felt real. But, just like \\"Blue Dahlia\\" before it, \\"Black Rose\\" is lacking something, I'm not sure what. It just doesn't read like a Nora Roberts novel. There is no spark. There is no verve. There is no passion. Yes, the story of Roz, a very likeable character, and her growing love for the research professor, Mitch Carnegie, should be passionate. We met these two in the last book. But for the life of me, I couldn't see the attraction. It just didn't ring true.<br /><br />Yes, the ghost is interesting, and certainly \\"comes alive\\" (in an ethereal sense, of course!)in this book, much more so than in the last, but not enough to make me flip the pages faster and faster.<br /><br />I love the other women, Hayley and Stella, but I found myself turning to the back of the book to see how much more I had to read. This is unheard-of as far as a Nora Roberts novel is concerned. Is it me? I'm anxious to see what other reviewers are thinking and what I have missed.	2005-06-14

The wonderful old McPharon brothers, Harold and Raymond, are still farming their cattle, but now they have something to live for in their adopted granddaughter Victoria, and her winsome toddler daughter Katie. Just to see the old men come alive with their ready made family is heartwarming.<br /><br />There is not enough of Tom Guthrie and his sons Ike and Bobby in this book, but we see them enough to know they are doing well. And we meet some other favorites too...along with some heartbreaking new ones: a mentally challenged couple struggling to raise their two school-aged children; the wife's abusive uncle, who terrorizes the entire family (absolutely heartrending, but told with Haruf's unblinking style as always); a pair of little girls whose mother ignores them after her husband deserts her; and a valiant young boy who is single handedly looking after his aged grandfather.<br /><br />The simplicity of life in this tiny town is really a metaphor for all life, and of course is not simple at all. Haruf moves the reader in a way few authors can do, and has created another masterpiece with this superb sequel.	2005-06-06

Example, \\"Thank you,\\" Elizabeth SAID.<br /><br />Once having gotten used to that weirdness, one is blown away by the plethora of cliches contained in only one small book. Middle-aged woman faces empty nest and boredom in her marriage. Husband wants something more. Wife wants to \\"find herself.\\" College-age bratty daughters want mom and dad to stay together forever so they feel secure.<br /><br />The middle-aged wife, Elizabeth, was once a promising painter, but of course she got married and gave up painting and yada yada yada...husband Jack was once a star quarterback, but \\"blew out his knee\\" and got addicted to painkillers, so now he's a third-string TV commentator in Oregon. He yearns to be back in the bigtime. Yawn. Daughters are polar opposites, but both at Georgetown University, sharing a room (as if!!). Back in Tennessee, Elizabeth's Daddy is almost a mockery of grade C Southern Tobacco Grower movies. Stepmother Anita has piled up hair and high heeled shoes and Elizabeth hates her.<br /><br />Enough. This is probably an OK book to read on a boring plane ride or better yet, when stuck in the airport. But don't expect a single original thought or word.	2005-06-01

Dotttie Benton Frank's Lowcountry Tales are so much fun to read, so perfectly charming, that I snapped this new one up the minute it was available. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This fifth entry in Frank's wonderful Lowcountry series takes place on South Carolina's barrier island, Pawleys Island (I have learned so much about South Carolina's low country since reading these books and I want to visit so much!). Here we find the quirky, one-of-a-kind Huey Valentine, owner of an art gallery, and a throwback to the fine gentlemen of the Old South--with a very modern twist (I'll let readers find out for themselves). He lives on an impossibly elegant and beautiful plantation with his grand dame mother, Miss Olivia, and his houseman, Julian.<br /><br />Best friend and former high-powered family law attorney Abigail Thurmond is there too, having retired from her practice in Columbia and come home to her family's shabby but much-loved cottage. Abigail is nursing deep wounds and is in danger of sinking into a depression when newly single mother Rebecca stumbles upon the scene.<br /><br />Immediately, Huey, Abigail and Miss Olivia take this wronged wife under their collective wings...worming the story out of her as only genteel gossips can--and then opening up their homes and hearts to help her. The process of undoing the wrongs Rebecca's vile ex husband has heaped on her bring Abigail back to life, helping her, Rebecca, Rebecca's wronged children and everybody else in the process.<br /><br />As always, the story is told with enough humor to make the reader guffaw, and enough truth and sensitivity to sooth any heart. An absolutey PERFECT summer read; snap it up!	2005-05-29

So when I began, I went backwards, from her newest to \\"Animal Dreams,\\" one of her first and most brilliant works.<br /><br />How can I describe the way Kingsolver writes? She has a way of putting together simple words in ways not thought of before, and the result is a kind of poetry--a lyrical, deceptively simple way of sharing deep truths--that simply is one of a kind.<br /><br />Most of her books are similar: Disaffected woman seeks meaning of life in the simplicity of a forest, a small town, travels through the Southwest, or whatever. This book is no different, but seems so original, so distinct. It's the story of Codi Noline, who returns to her hometown of Grace, AZ, to care for her ailing father, recently diagnosed with Alzheimers. Codi has left behind a half-hearted relationship, a go-nowhere minimum wage job (despite the fact that she has all but completed her medical degree) and a go-nowhere life.<br /><br />Now she returns to memories, dreamed or otherwise, that almost overwhelm her with their vividness. Deeply missing her cherished sister Hallie, Codi tries to find some sort of center--all the time desperately wanting to run away. The ending, like all of Kingsolver's books, is so true, so satisfying, so real that the reader just has to weep.<br /><br />Along the way are Kingsolver's deeply held views on the environment, the sanctity of the earth, the beauty of the Native American culture--all woven into the story but never subtle. It's part of who she is, and she is indeed one of a kind. A gem.	2005-05-24

Jill Mansell is one of those Brit Lit authors whose books you cannot resist and cannot put down, and \\"Falling For You\\" is a perfect example.<br /><br />With tongue in cheek, Mansell tells us about a modern-day Romeo and Juliet-type feud. But instead of the Capulets and Montagues, we have two very modern dysfunctional (or otherwise) families living in and near Bath, England. Many years ago, the teenaged son of the McKinnon family struck and killed the disabled daughter of the Harvey family in his speeding car. A trial found him guilty and sentenced him to jail, but an overheard thoughtless remark by his mother was never forgotten or forgiven.<br /><br />Fast forward a decade. The Harvey father has passed away, but his wife Marcella, ferociously adoring stepmother of Maddy, Jake and the late disabled April, still keeps the feud going strong. That's fine with everyone--until Maddy falls in love with Kerr, brother of the man who struck down April. And even though Kerr was not even in the country at the time, Marcella cannot and will not allow a McKinnon anywhere near her family.<br /><br />Along with this interesting tale are several subplots involving marriages, affairs, breakups and \\"hookups\\"--all told with such verve and charm that one cannot help but keep the pages turning. This is simply a gem of the genre. Enjoy!	2005-05-20

A crisis arises when long-time boyfriend wants to move to California to a brand new place called \\"Silicon Valley\\" to work on something worlwide web-ish, and Beau doesn't want to move.<br /><br />So which Mike did she marry? Her beloved long-time lover who makes the ultimate sacrifice for her? Or the dimpled, gorgeous would-be TV actor who has stolen her heart as well? The treat of the book is that we do not know until almost the last page. The NON-treat of the book is that, after a while, the endless back and forth between the two Mikes and Beau's inability, then and now, to make up her mind gets repetitive and tiresome. But nonetheless, this is still a fun afternoon's read.	2005-05-09

So Tom, a good man through and through, is single-handed raising their two boys, Ike and Bobby, who are only a year apart and who cope with their mother's \\"disappearance\\" with a stoicism beyond their years.<br /><br />Then there are the two old McFaren brothers, bachelors who have farmed their cattle for some 60 years after the death of their parents. They are gruff, taciturn, set in their ways, and the adult version of Ike and Bobby.<br /><br />Turning their world completely upside down is the young, pregnant teenaged girl, Victoria, who winds up in their care through a series of events I won't describe here...but who opens their craggy hearts to love and longing after too many years to count.<br /><br />And that is the whole simple story: how human love and kindness, juxtaposed against the roughest of realities (and there are plenty of them, especially those described on the farm), can bring redemption and meaning to any life.<br /><br />I found this book to be completely brilliant, in a way that Richard Russo's \\"Empire Falls,\\" which it vaguely resembles and which won the Pulitzer Prize, never was. \\"Plainsong\\" is a masterpiece.	2005-05-07

Maybe it's only me, but I had to stop several times to go back and find out which player was which.<br /><br />The plot, a confusing amalgram of rape, murder, terrorism, top-drawer coin heists, Middle Eastern history and a hurricane thrown in to boot, starts with preliminary doings in which Manhattan Assistant DA Alexandra Cooper is defending investment banker Paige Vallis. The victim asserts she was raped by a Manhattan biggie named Andrew Tripping, a snearing nasty high-powered corporate shark with equally snearing nasty high-powered attorneys. Oh...Tripping also just happens to be a paranoid schizophrenic, and a child abuser (his own child) as well.<br /><br />Still with me? There's a sub plot that becomes bigger than the first plot, involving an extremely rare coin stolen from the greedy coffers of Egypt's late King Farouk--and it just so happens that an elderly black woman whose murder sidekick Mike Chapman is investigating provides a direct link to the coin. And so on. And so on.<br /><br />OK, I finished the book, and I still can't help liking Alex Cooper, Chapman and Mercer, the series' regulars, but whew! this was a tough one. I hope it's just me.	2005-05-02

And yet she cannot stop. She feels that her lover has opened her eyes to the world, to her self, to feelings she has never felt. And although she hates herself for wronging her husband, nothing can make her forsake her lover, not even the thought of destroying the lives of her family.<br /><br />It makes for interesting reading, that's for sure, but it's not so easy to read. Is that because women readers are conditioned to think of the female gender as always wronged? Or is it because you want to slap the main character across the face? I don't know, but this is one heck of a book...way off the beaten track and very well written.	2005-04-18

Somebody shot into a bunch of teenaged kids, leaving several dead or injured. No clues, no leads, nothing. It's a case that has the \\"upstairs\\" nervous, and everything Petra does is either criticized or ridiculed.<br /><br />Quietly sitting in the background while Petra frustratedly tries to get some leads is a young hispanic genius, Isaac Gomez, a prodigy who finished high school and college early, is enrolled in med school, and is doing some interning with the police as a learning tool. He's got a crush on Petra--but more than that, he drops in her lap a mathematical theory that may just point to a serial killer on the loose who's about to strike again.<br /><br />Should Petra ignore the kid? Or should she follow up on what admittedly seems like a red herring in the extreme, but a theory that ties up years of unsolved murders? Petra tries to do both...and gets in way over her head.<br /><br />The last 30 pages or so of the book had this reader on the edge of her seat. And even better--Kellerman mostly refrained from his endless roadmap of streets, making the story faster, tighter, and much easier to read.<br /><br />This one's a winner.	2005-04-09

I can't explain it more than that, but it has a curious lack of affect to it, maybe because the plot was not close to the author's heart?<br /><br />At any rate, this book tells the story of Dan and Ellie, a couple who meet, fall in love, get pregnant and marry (in that order), falling into an idyllic life that is marred by only one thing: \\"the other woman\\"--in this case, Dan's overbearing, in-your-face, no-boundaries-whatsoever mother, Linda. This woman is so over-the-top awful that she reads as a caricature; you really can't believe her antics or the rather lame reasons that Ellie, a high-powered career woman, folds into helpless girlhood in Linda's presence.<br /><br />The book meanders on, pleasantly enough, until a denoument is reached. I didn't believe any of it, but I cannot say I didn't like the book. It has Green's usual fun cast of characters (although not half as endearing as in most of her books) and moves along quickly. Just don't expect a \\"Babyville\\"--or you will be very disappointed.	2005-03-29

Under his aegis, it becomes a real academic showplace, a center of learning in the true classic sense.<br /><br />The book begins in the year 1998, when the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal is in full bloom. Now 71, Silk should be gently sliding into a well-deserved old age. But a series of events that are all too believable in today's society (now even more than then) saddle him with a completely false, utterly preposterous label of racist. And from there, his life spins out of control.<br /><br />Or was it ever IN control? What's behind Silk's facade? Brilliantly played against the Clinton scandal (is anyone what they seem?), the story, told by Silk's late-in-life friend, the author Nathan Zuckerman, also includes a brilliantly drawn character, the college janitor, Faunia, who becomes Silk's lover, to the horror of all the self-righteous petty little people in the academic community. She is a complicated, many-layered being who is so honest, so totally herself that the reader has to love her. And then there is her ex-husband, the demented Vietnam Vet Les Farley, whose demons came back with him from the war and portend the tragic deaths of the main characters (no spoiler here; that's the beginning of the novel!).<br /><br />A must read, Roth at his very very best.	2005-03-27

Then there's the carpenter, \\"Droop,\\" a handsome widowed stranger, the pilot Ben, and last but certainly not least, the wonderful black lab Blink.<br /><br />What's best about this book is that it completely avoides the cliched ending. Mibby grows, but she struggles every day with her demons. She is not a perfect mother, not a perfect widow, not perfect in any way, just like the rest of us. But she tries, and she tries hard, and the entire book is heartwarming because it is so real.	2005-03-21

The author tells us almost from the start that she believes Scott Peterson to be a classic sociopath. And then she simply lets the story tell itself, using reams of material never allowed in court, and never publicized before now.<br /><br />The case, for those of us who followed it from Day One, comes alive again as we follow the detectives from their initial response to an anguised family's phone call (Scott never called the police about his missing wife; he left that to his frantic mother- and father-in-law) to the web of increasingly bizarre and contradictory lies that Scott told with impunity.<br /><br />As becomes obvious in very short order, despite Geragos' claims to the contrary, it was not the police who suspected Scott from Day 1, but rather Scott himself, with his bizarre, flat behavior and endlessly ridiculous lies, who put himself in their faces as the likely suspect. And their meticulous behind-the-scenes fitting of the pieces of the puzzle only strengthened what Scott all but told them from the first.<br /><br />I mentioned above that the book is horrifying; in terms of what a sociopath can do, the lies that come so easily, the complete lack of human feeling or remorse, the intense narcisism that these people display and for which Peterson was the poster boy, is really scary. And of course the crime he committed was completely vile.<br /><br />As for bombshells, those of us riveted to the case didn't know everything. I kept finding myself saying, WHAT? WHAT? I didn't know that! He's so much guiltier than I ever thought!<br /><br />The Rochas come across in the book as more human--yes, Sharon Rocha can use the F word--and more tragic than they ever appeared on television, if such a thing is possible. As for the Petersons, as in Anne Bird's book, they do not fare well. At least not in my opinion. While I have complete sympathy for their own bewilderment and grief, they were scarcely likeable people behind the scenes, particularly Jackie.<br /><br />This book is well-written (although it has its share of grammatical errors and typos; a rush to print?), intelligent, meticulous, and completely mesmerizing. Even if one had lived on another planet and never heard of the Peterson case, it reads like a first-rate True Crime tale, worthy of the best of them.

Simply a biological collection of mother/father/kids? Or, more than that, a scattering of unique and unrelated people who make up one's extended group of loved ones?<br /><br />That question is charmingly explored in Lily of the Valley, the story of one 39-year-old Polish-American artist living in Western Massachusetts who has been dealt a series of life blows. Her husband and step-son have returned to the first wife when the story opens. Lily is bereft, hurting, questioning everything about herself and her profession. For, artist though she is, Lily mainly paints signs in shop windows, or, in one major job, a mural of heaven on the wall of the town's funeral parlor.<br /><br />What keeps Lily going is her collection of people. Her best friend Louise and husband, who own the restaurant above which Lily lives (and who tell her just to stomp on the floor if they need her). Their teenaged daughter Heather. A quirky, truly \\"different\\" career counselor. The owner of the funeral parlor, who constantly says, \\"I know, I know,\\" when he doesn't. Lily's fabulous Uncle Unc, and his longtime (VERY longtime) but very proper lady friend Phyllis. All of these people enrich and fill Lily's world, but she has lost sight of that fact after her husband decamps.<br /><br />Enter the mysterious Mary Ziemba, the town philanthropist and wealthy owner of a chain of successful supermarkets. Mary summons Lily up to her mansion on the hill to commission her for a painting. A REAL painting. Working from snapshots and Mary's moving and interesting stories, Lily slowly puts together just the painting Mary wanted: Herself in the center surrounded by her loved ones. And the truth behind the painting sets Lily free to become herself again.<br /><br />Simply charming, unique, and special. A book not to miss!	2005-03-12

This chilling account of a perfectly normal, nice-seeming woman who reunites happily with her biological family only to be drawn in to the Laci Peterson murder case is truly scary on many levels.<br /><br />Anne Bird was given up for adoption by Jackie Peterson (then Latham) at birth. Raised by two wonderful people who gave her every advantage, Anne was a happy college student when she was contacted by her biological family--and went on to meet her mother Jackie and her half siblings--one of whom was the family's \\"golden boy\\"--Scott Peterson.<br /><br />Anne and Scott became very close, or so Anne thought at the time, and she especially adored Laci, whose bubbly personality enchanted her. Laci's charm, however, was lost on mother-in-law Jackie, whose behind-the-scenes snipes at her were so cruel, according to conversations cited in this book, that this reader was quite taken aback. Although Bird apologizes for her biological mother repeatedly, it doesn't ring true.<br /><br />And neither does Scott's entire personality, which Anne had taken on faith. As the events of Laci's disappearance take place, Anne, who is in total denial about her brother's possible involvement, even to the point of hurting her own marriage, nevertheless cannot but notice Scott's seeming lack of caring, or any emotion at all. He finds time to hit on Anne's attractive adult babysitter, even mixing \\"flirtinis\\" for her! After nearly breaking down with anxiety, Anne finally comes to terms with what she had been hiding from herself all along: The brother she has come to love so dearly has a VERY secret side.<br /><br />As a lover of true-crime books, I found this seemingly innocuous book to be very scary. In fact, it gave me nightmares, not from anything Bird said in the book, but from the message behind it: You never really know another human being. Quick, fast, read...not really revealing, except for Jackie Peterson's less-than-perfect side, but riveting nonetheless.	2005-03-08

He figures he'll last a winter, maybe find himself a reason to live--or not. He doesn't much care.<br /><br />Arriving in the obscenely cold snowy winter, which the locals are taking in stride, Nate settles in fairly quickly to a pro forma police job that's night and day from the seedy streets he's used to. Fighting the darkness, both outside and in, he manages to get the job done--and then two things stir his long-dead juices.<br /><br />One is a sassy, tough-as-nails, gorgeous bush pilot named Meg Galloway--who stirs Nate's blood on their very first meeting. The other is the discovery of a body long buried in a mountain ice cave--with a pickax stuck in its chest. The dead man, missing 17 years, is Meg's long lost father. And revelation of his murder starts a chain of events in the quiet little town that begin with the suicide of a beloved local, and escalate from there. Nate snaps to attention despite himself, and the desire to solve the murder-suicide, if it in fact IS a suicide, pulls him out of his doldrums.<br /><br />The mystery of who murdered the mountain man lasts all the way through the book, and definitely held my interest. Nora never flags as she expertly mixes mystery, murder, passion and just good old plain storytelling as only she can.

There was much more substance to the individual stories as well, which concentrated on clashes through the generations: mother/daughter, wife/mother-in-law, fiancee/husband's mother.

Scorned for what and who he is, and endlessly posturing to cover up his own insecurities, he eventually escapes, as a young man, to England. And finds his posturing only achieves new levels of intentiveness. For Willie, as Naipul points out so brilliantly, is living a \\"half life,\\" neither one thing nor the other in the ways that society cruelly judges himself.<br /><br />Excelling at university, he is nevertheless neither British nor \\"acceptable\\" Indian. Trying to be a young man about town, he finds himself frozen in situations his classmates take for granted. Trying to connect with other humans, he finds himself always aloof, always seeing things from a distance.<br /><br />When he falls in love--or thinks he does--it's more just the taking of an opportunity--Willie travels with his bride to her home country of Africa, and there they live for 18 years with Willie keeping his sardonic and always-apart views of their friends and family in secret. Here, too, he lives half a life, but is more comfortable as he realizes that the many African Portuguese also live this way--neither African nor Portuguese, scorning one way of life while trying to be the height of society.<br /><br />This is a scathing view of society in the 50s and 60s, but really it is a view of human nature, the secrets that every human holds, and that color the way lives are lived and experienced.

Suzanne Strempek Shea has written a wonderfully delightful quirky story that is so much fun, so fresh, so witty, that I am loathe to categorize it. It simply stands alone.<br /><br />Sophie White, a nice, thirtysomething New Englander, agrees to accompany her newly widowed and terribly grieving best friend Gina to a remote village in Ireland, where Gina hopes she will regain her equilibrium and start to heal. The two women arrive at a charming cottage (prepaid by Gina) near the sea, prepare to unpack their myriad clothing and belongings (also bought by Gina) and stay until Gina feels better. But Gina takes off after less than 24 hours, and Sophie is left alone in this friendly, tiny village that is seemingly haunted.<br /><br />Haunted, that is, by the very undead but very much revered and remembered Finola, who took off two years before with her German lover. Absolutely everybody in the village has a story about Finola, from her still lonely ex lover Liam, whom Sophie thinks looks like a young Eric Clapton, to the very \\"auld\\" Joe, whom Finola brought back to life and happiness by taking him for a long walk every day. Even the dog Pepsi owes his well-being to Finola, who rescued him from a wretched existence tied up in an uncaring yard.<br /><br />Unwittingly, Sophie starts to model herself on this mythical woman, thinking, \\"What would Finola do?\\" And in this way, she gradually assumes Finola's life, from her jewelry-making in the craft store run by Liam, to taking Joe for walks, to living in the cottage that was apparently Finola's before she left--to wearing Finola's left-behind, perfect, clothes. Oh--and Sophie also takes over Liam, until like it or not, she feels she IS Finola.<br /><br />The inevitable denoument is so tragicomic, but so full of wisdom, that it simply makes the book. I won't give away the ending, but in my mind, it was perfect.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read everything Shea has written; where has she been all my life?/> <br />I cannot wait to read everything Shea has written; where has she been all my life?	2005-02-20

Pigs in Heaven is the type of book that you must own just so you can touch it every now and then, just so you can let the pages fall open where they will so you can sample even a paragraph of Kingsolver's brilliant lyrical style.<br /><br />A sequel to The Bean Trees but a full novel unto itself, this is the continuation of the story of Taylor Greer and her adopted Cherokee daughter Turtle, the abused child given to Taylor in a parking lot some 3 years earlier. Now fully bonded as mother and child, Taylor and Turtle are living a happy iconoclastic life as only Kingsolver can describe. Turtle has come far from her earlier trauma, although not completely healed. And Taylor's fierce adoration of her child cannot be disputed.<br /><br />Through a series of unbelievable events, Taylor and Turtle appear on the Oprah show, and catch the eye of Cherokee lawyer-activist Anawake Fourkiller, who immediately determines that she must wrest the child from her non-Indian mother and return her to the fold of the Tribe. On the face of it, Anawake seems the enemy and Taylor and Turtle her victims. But nothing is as it seems. With the addition of such unforgettable characters as Taylor's irrascible mother Alice, plus a real-life Barbie doll cum waitress who latches on to the family and won't let go, and the various tribal members, this is a book rich in meaning, deep in thought, and brimming with human truth that transcends all barriers, racial or otherwise.<br /><br />And that, of course, is the point.<br /><br />If you have not read Kingsolver before, start with this brilliant offering. You won't be sorry. She is a voice not to be missed.	2005-02-19

This outing finds Kate in Anchorage, where she has been called upon to solve a 30-year-old murder that took place in a patrician Alaskan family with many politically important connections all the way to the top. Charlotte Muravieff writes Kate a check she cannot refuse, and tells her to clear her mother Victoria, in jail all these years for supposedly setting the fire that killed one son and permanently injured another. Kate is sure that Victoria did in fact set the fire, but reluctantly agrees to take on the case.<br /><br />While in Anchorage, Kate's nosing around leads to all kinds of strange and scary happenings, including murder, that would scare off the average PI, but just make Kate more anxious to get to the bottom of the mystery. And while she's at it, she turns up the flames under her torrid romance with Chopper Jim the Gorgeous Trooper. Warning to the faint-hearted: Stabenow is quite bawdy and bold with her descriptions in this book, so if that is not your cup of tea, better skip this one. I thought it added a great deal of amusement and romantic intrigue to the story!<br /><br />Mutt is back as her superhero self, and there are enough local characters to fit the bill, as we have come to expect in any Shugak novel. I'm not going to say I even understand how the mystery ended, but I loved the book anyway. A good, fun, fast and satisfying read.	2005-02-14

Robb, aka Nora Roberts, has infused this latest In Death book with new life and a whole new sense of energy.<br /><br />In this outing, futuristic cop Eve Dallas is hunting a particularly horrendous serial killer, who kidnaps, beats and rapes his female victims--and then removes their eyes. The motive is unknown, but he is obviously \\"punishing\\" a previous female in his life, as all the victims--but one--match a particular physical pattern.<br /><br />As Eve fights dangerous physical and mental exhaustion to stop the killing, which is escalating quickly, she also comes to some real truths about herself and her own relationships with people close to her. And it is these revelations, done with thought and delicacy, which make this book so interesting, different and fascinating.<br /><br />All our beloved regulars are in this book, but they have changed as well: Peabody (now a detective) and McNab are about to move in together; Mavis and Leonardo are happily awaiting the arrival of their first child in a way only these over-the-top people can do; Doctor Mira is still hovering over Eve and trying to get her to rest; and Eve's verbal bantering with the hated major domo Summerset reaches some new highs (or lows, depending on how you look at it) in some hilarious repartee.<br /><br />Look for a quick, can't-stop read and a true surprise at the end, not the usualy J.D. Robb ending at all!	2005-02-04

All ensconced in the frothy, fast and fun tone typical of the genre, the book nevertheless tackles some truly serious issues...and tackles them well.<br /><br />Having been on the Mommy Track, having agonized every time I had a sick child and had to be at work rather than at home making soup, I sympathized heartily with Kate Reddy, fast-track female superstar in the all-male world of stocks and bonds. Star of her company, Kate pays and pays and pays as no male colleague would ever be expected to do: It's her nanny Paula who knows how much baby Ben weighs; it's Paula who knows what 6-year-old Emily likes to eat. And it's Paula they turn to for comort. And Kate's husband Richard? Somebody with whom to share the chores and exchange one-sentence orders in the morning; somebody to turn away from at night from sheer exhaustion.<br /><br />Something has to give in Kate's world, but what? Her marriage? Her career? Her sanity? Her soul? We don't have the answer until the very end of the book, and even then we are left to wonder why only women have to make these decisions.<br /><br />A truly delightful easy-to-read book, but one with some meat on its bones. Highly recommended.	2005-01-28

Nel halfheartedly thinks she will probably settle down at some point with Simon so she has a man around to do DIY work, when she gets embroiled in a community effort to safe Paradise Fields, a strip of riverfront land upon which sits the sick-children's hospice, a charity dear to her heart.<br /><br />Nel is used to running farmers' markets and other charity events on Paradise Fields, all of whose profits go to the hospice, but now she is up against a real threat as a heartless couple and their equally heartless land developer plan to turn it into a housing development. As Nel plots and plans desperately to save the land, the landowning couple's nefarious (maybe) attorney Jake comes to muddy the waters. Literally. Nel knows better than to consort with the enemy, but Jake's charm is lethal.<br /><br />Does Nel find love and happiness in Jake's arms? Or is he the devil? Will the hospice be saved? I found myself zipping through the pages, trying hard not to skip to the end to find out. It's that kind of book, as only Katie Fforde could write it. Enjoy!	2005-01-21

It is very different, very moving, and is the type of book that doesn't allow the reader to forget its haunting atmosphere.<br /><br />Although the flyleaf on the hardback version calls it a \\"funny and touching romance...\\" I found nothing funny about it whatsoever, and what romance there is, is largely in the torturedly shy minds of two of the two awkward protagonists: big-boned, plain and shy Harley Savage, and equally shy and plain Douglas Cheeseman. Harley has come to the tiny Australian Bush village of Karakarook to set up a \\"heritage museum\\" of local crafts (she is a renowned craftsperson in her own right and lives in Sydney); Douglas, an engineer, has come to demolish and rebuild a Karakarook icon: the \\"twisted bridge.\\" These two unlikely people meet and are attracted to one another, but are so terribly awkward and shy that they cannot possibly express anything other than \\"wrong\\" smiles and comments.<br /><br />A subplot involves the wife of the banker, whose inner self is focused solely on keeping herself young with various beauty products, certainly NOT on the Chinese butcher to whom she is powerfully attracted. Certain reviews found this subplot specious and/or funny; I did not. It had a hysterical edge to it that exactly matched the inner terrible turmoil of the wife, whose empty existence in Karakarook has obviously driven her to the edge of madness.<br /><br />A truly outstanding book; a work of art. I'm glad I read it.	2005-01-13

But the murderer miscalculated the movements of the glacier, and Park handyman Len Dwyer's remains are all too visible.<br /><br />Now comes the question: Who killed Len and why? Almost everyone in the Park, including Kate, had used his services during the past year; he was an excellent all-around handyman, quiet, pleasant, and no trouble to anyone. Or was he?<br /><br />Hunky trooper Jim Chopin, whose romance with Kate heats up a great deal in this book, is out to solve the mystery while trying to keep Kate out of it.

Needless to say, 95% of the women die.<br /><br />And that's where Kimberley Quincey comes in. The hard-bitten rookie FBI student with an attitude stumbles across a body on the hallowed grounds of Quantico, and all hell breaks loose. Kimberley, the daughter of a revered FBI profiler whom we've met in an earlier Gardener book, is still recovering (if that's the word) from the brutal murders of her mother and sister six years earlier. She has a chip on her shoulder a mile wide, a dangerous disregard for authority, and a drive to succeed that outweighs her common sense. Having discovered the body, she takes a proprietary, and inappropriate (by FBI standards)interest in solving the case.<br /><br />Joined by a hunky maverick law enforcement officer, Kimberley tries to stay one step ahead of the brutally brilliant serial killer. The reader knows just how brutal he is, because half the book is told from his point of view, and the point of view of one victim dumped in a swamp from which there is seemingly no exit.<br /><br />Taut, fast, fun. Another grade-A Lisa Gardener thriller!	2005-01-03

But surprise--I loved this book, and disagree with the negative comments it has received.<br /><br />It might be because I had a slightly different take, and here it is: The plot concerns a group of disparate tourists from America, Ireland, England and Germany, who find themselves drawn together in the tiny Greek village of Aghia Anna , after a terrible fire kills a large number of locals and tourists alike. In a sort of \\"Ship of Fools\\" venue, if you will, the tiny group becomes, for a short time, inseparable, sharing various stories, heartbreaks and dreams.<br /><br />In the unreal bubble that is the island in a particular time warp, there is one voice of truth in Vonni, an Irish expatriate who has spent her last 30 years in the village, and who refuses to be bowled over by either romance or dreaming. Don't ask me why, but I consistently thought of Vonni as Maeve Binchy herself--exasperated with her own characters and the fact that they cannot see what is right in front of their noses.<br /><br />All the foibles of human nature appear in this one short microcosm, with Vonni desperately making everybody \\"see\\" the truth. It's interesting, and it worked for me. I'm sorry that the majority does not agree, but I was pleased that Binchy seems back on track!	2004-12-28

Any time I might think that one person cannot make a difference and that I should just continue to sit and do nothing, I can read about Goodall and her singular and single-minded vision of changing the world.<br /><br />This volume of Goodall's autobiography consists of hundreds of her personal letters, adroitly gathered together and explained by the editor so that there is a cohesive whole. We follow her through years of expanding her work with chimpanzees at her original research facilities in Gombe (where, as a very young woman, she worked ALONE), to her expanding environmental empire, to her ceaseless lobbying, traveling, letter-writing, speech-making, and appeals to leaders throughout the world to help in her efforts to save her beloved chimps (our closest primate cousins), baboons, other wildlife, and especially the rain forests upon which these animals depend for life.<br /><br />Her letters show the private Jane, full of the joy of motherhood (she raised her only son, Hugo Jr., or \\"Grublin,\\" in the wild in a childhood that had to be spectacular beyond belief, but was like any other mother worried about teething, late talking, naughtiness and refusal to do his math!), battling bouts of malaria while writing endless (it seems) books, proposals, thank-yous, acknowledgements, and so forth.<br /><br />We see her through the pain of divorce, a happy remarriage, and the horror of seeing her new husband die of inoperable cancer. We see her renewed efforts to save her beloved chimpanzees, and her first horrified visit to a lab, where she was reduced to kneeling in tears at the plight of captive apes treated like things rather than the sensitive creatures they are.<br /><br />The book ends in the late 90s, with Jane's latest conservation efforts still going strong. I was so intent and so wound up in her story that I immediately went to the Jane Goodall Institute Website to see what I could do in some small way to further her cause. But you don't have to be a conservationist to admire this strong, brilliant, single-minded and fabulous woman.

It is, in a word: Perfect.<br /><br />For anyone who has ever felt unbearable grief, or for anyone who has felt the same measure of real love, this book is a tribute to the best of the human spirit. I was lucky enough to have listened to the Audio version, which is read by the author herself, and her lightly southern-tinged pleasant voice adds a measure of poignancy she may or may not have intended.<br /><br />The fictional characters, Rudi and Christine, an author and a composer, live a life rich in every way, from their afternoon cocktail hour (preceded by a phone call from \\"Cope Paul,\\" Rudi's fictional pontiff who urges them to have a drink) to their wide and wonderful collection of shared jokes, memories, people and most of all words...rich tapestries of words.

I am such a huge fan of Dana Stabenow's \\"Kate Shugak\\" series that I really wasn't much interested in starting another Stabenow series, I guess out of loyalty or something. But I picked up this book while waiting for somebody, and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Alaska trooper Liam Campbell is just wonderful, very much like the regulars in the Shugak series. And in fact, there is a very sly reference to Kate herself--not by name, but by inference (\\"I know somebody who carries a hand-carved otter in her pocket\\")--that just thrilled me!<br /><br />Campbell's sweetie, Wy the pilot, is a typical Stabenow female: no-nonsense, tough, competent, and deeply in love with her man without wanting to reveal just how much.<br /><br />The plot was a bit thin...a glacier melts enough to expose the remains of a World War II plane and its occupants...and a myserious gold coin. The discover may or may not be related to two terrible murders in town. It's a confusing plot, but as always, the Alaska lore of which Stabenow is a master far outweighs the story itself.<br /><br />I plan to read all of the Liam Campbell books now, and just am happy that Stabenow is so darned prolific!	2004-12-16

Marie Winn, the ornithology (for lack of a more romantic word) columnist for The Wall Street Journal, wrote this lovely account of a band of birdwatchers who discover nesting raptors right across from Central Park in 1998. This was before 9/11 by a few years, and it has that wonderful innocence we all felt about life before the attacks.<br /><br />The story concerns a red-tailed male hawk, dubbed \\"Pale Male\\" by the birdwatchers because of his unusually pale coloring, and his various mates and fledglings who live and breed in the most exclusive of addresses: New York's Upper East Side. We get to know the birds, their babies, their nesting triumphs and tragedies. We learn about the phenomenally prolific wildlife in Central Park, from birds to turtles to raccoons to dragonflies to butterflies to edible plants. We learn to know and love the dedicated band of independent souls who track these wonders of nature from season to season, year to year.<br /><br />I hope that all will go well with Pale Male this year.

In a truly witty and spare manner just like Austen herself, Fowler tells us the different tales of the people in the group--from the one-time hippie who has married numerous times, to the \\"out there\\" lesbian whose toughness belies an almost exquisitely sensitive heart, to the tough individualist dog breeder with a heart of gold, to her best friend, the just-jilted middle-aged wife, to the young wife with the safe young husband she may or may not love. The lone man, Grigg, is a story unto himself! Their lives are completely ordinary and yet completely unique, just like Austen's characters.<br /><br />Once the all-too-short, spare tale is done, there is a plethora of fun things at the back of the book, from the above-mentioned precis of the books themselves to the most interesting collection of reviews of Austen--from her contemporaries down through the present day. Absolutely fabulous in its own right. We also have some \\"book club notes\\" from one of the main characters, and it just all jells in the most perfect way.	2004-12-09

I have always harbored a fantasy where I retire with lots of money (yeah, right) and spend my remaining years traveling around the country looking for birds I have never seen. Forget that I am not a birder, have never been able to memorize the tiniest fact about species, and am bad at identifying bird calls: The truth is I just love birds, and love to watch them on my backyard feeders.<br /><br />Well, any fantasy I may have harbored was killed forever with this strange and off-putting story of competitive birders striving to outdo each other in sightings in one Big Year (not my term or even the author's; a legitimate competitive birding term). Yes, the writing is sprightly, humorous, well done and competent--the author is a birder himself, although not in the same league as the three gentlemen he describes who take off at the beginning of 1998 to break the Big Year record.<br /><br />It seems to me that the more grueling the trek to spot a rare bird, the more humorous and tall-tale-like the stories became, the more put off I was. Nowhere in the book did I sense any joy of seeing a bird for its own sake, but rather for quickly spotting it, jotting it down in one's \\"life list\\" or Big Year list, and moving on. ALL the birders in the book appeared to me to care more about the competition and the listing of the birds than the birds themselves. In fact, in one horrifying story, an anonymous person actually KILLS a bird in order to make an identification. Although this is not condoned, it happens...and it's disgusting.<br /><br />I disliked the book so much for its subject matter, I would have given it one star, but the writing is great, and this world of competitive bird watching is certainly described well, whether I liked it or not. Apparently, due to el nino and a strange combination of weather factors, 1998 was the biggest birding year of all time vis a vis The Big Year counts. Good. I hope I never have to read about it again!	2004-12-03

But the agency seems to be harboring a rogue who is out of control--and will not stop until he thinks his tracks are covered. And his \\"tracks\\" include not only Eve herself, but Roarke Industries, and that means her hunky husband Roarke.<br /><br />That's bad enough, but Eve and Roarke are in a bad marital patch for the first time in their relationship. If Eve allows herself to feel the fear about THAT, she won't be able to concentrate on the case that could bring them both down and destroy her career.<br /><br />It makes for an interesting and fun read.

In this hilarious and yet touching addition to the Number One Ladies' Detective Agency series, the ultra-proper and ultra-serious Mma Makutsi, she of the very large glasses and formidable secretarial powers, has Met A Man! As devotees of the series know, Mma Makutsi is fast approaching that age where men no longer want to marry, and she has not been lucky in love.<br /><br />Will this time be different? Or...as the reader and Mma Ramotswe fear...has the very careful Mma Makutsi been caught in the cluthes of a Bad Man?<br /><br />That's only one of the connundrums in this highly entertaining book, that finds Precious Ramotswe still unmarried, still solving mysteries, and strained to her last nerve by a male detective who is trying to usurp her business.<br /><br />Absolutely a gem from page one to the end. This is simply a series NOT to be missed.	2004-11-28

It is so full of wisdom, insight, delicacy and depth that it fairly stuns the reader.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the plot, while straightforward, is a dream within a dream. How much is real? How much is fantasy? How much is a waking dream or a dreaming wakefulness? We only know for sure that the highly improbable circumstance of shy, self-effacing piano tuner Edgar Drake journeying beyond his ken (in more ways than one) into the jungles of Burma at the request of the British War Office is true within the confines of the novel.<br /><br />Once Edgar begins his dreamlike journey from the London of his safe world and on through Europe, into India and into the otherworldly Burma, where he is to tune the piano of surgeon-major Anthony Carroll, we are no longer sure what is real.<br /><br />There are so many contrasts--a jungle that is brown and dead one day and awash with exotic flowers the next; a man driven deaf by the beauty of a song; a love affair that may not be; a man who may be the hero of the British Empire or may be a deadly spy...all of this is filtered through the enchanted and dreamlike state of Edgar's impressionable mind.<br /><br />The end is terribly disturbing, and I will not present it in order not to have a spoiler. I took it as a condemnation of British Imperialism at its worst. But maybe not. Like the entire rest of the book, the end may just be a dream.<br /><br />Absolutely a reading must for anyone who loves literature and is ready for something truly different and new.	2004-11-25

Zoe, whose fairytale wedding we attend on the very first page, is a housewife and mother contending with a marriage she refuses to acknowledge is horrible. Leila (Lulu), her younger sister, is a beatnik-free spirit, an artist whose constant rebellion against the way things are masks an essentially lonely life.<br /><br />As these two very close but very different women live their lives against the backdrop of intense societal change, we see things from their perspective--and it is absolutely fascinating.<br /><br />The front cover of the copy I picked up has a blurb from Rosamunde Pilcher. Unlike Rosamunde, Stubbs has an acerbic tone that is different and interesting. But like Rosamunde, she can tell a story that completely draws the reader in.<br /><br />This is a book to order and read!	2004-11-19

We also catch up on all our \\"Park rats,\\" the regulars who populate each of the novels, and I found that catchup process completely enjoyable.<br /><br />The second half of this short book is devoted to a shocking and heartbreaking murder of one of our favorites; Kate and Chopper Jim's efforts to solve the murder--and--to Kate's fear and wrath, her growing interest in Jim. I am very anxious to get to the next book to see what will happen!<br /><br />Fun, fast, and quintessential Stabenow.	2004-11-15

It is Nora, no doubt about that...but it is Nora with no spark, almost as if she had written it by rote. When compared with some of her spectacular trilogies like the phenomenal \\"Born In\\" series, her wonderful witchcraft series, and her recent \\"Light\\" series, there is definitely something missing...and that something is Nora's wonderful enthusiasm.<br /><br />This first book in the trilogy is the story of Stella, recently widowed mother of two young boys, who leaves Michigan to go home to Tennessee, where she was born, just outside of Memphis. There, she gets a job at In the Garden, a nursery owned by wealthy socialite Roz Harper, and is invited to live, with her sons, at Harper House, the family mansion that has a long history--and a ghost.<br /><br />This should be prime Roberts fodder...but somehow, the entire story, including the predictable hot hunk who falls for Stella; the subplots involving a loveable unwed pregnant girl named Hayley; and all the gardening lore--which I should have loved--was without a single spark. Reading this book, I got the very uneasy feeling that my beloved Nora Robert is burned out. And if she is, she deserves to be, after her incredibly prolific and fabulous career--but I hope it is only this book that gives me this feeling, and that she is still \\"my\\" Nora.	2004-11-10

But waaaaay too long!<br /><br />I'm not going to say that I didn't somewhat enjoy this book, or that I was not caught up in its mystery (I refrain from describing the plot here, as myriad reviewers have done it as well, or better than, I could do). It's just that I had some problems:<br /><br />The main characters were completely wooden. The clues to the mystery went from truly interesting and engaging to tiresome to boring to parody (I found myself laughing by the last half of the book). The entire premise, while fun to read, was ridiculous. And so on.<br /><br />As a friend of mine has said, this book would make a great movie, and I agree. We are having fun \\"casting\\" the main characters, but they are so one-dimensional, it's hard to do so. I'm glad I read the book, I give it a C-plus, but I think it could have ended, and ended well, a good 100 pages before it did. As for the religious premise: I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole. At first I took it somewhat seriously, but by the end, I was literally laughing aloud.<br /><br />My take: fun, frivolous and mediocre.	2004-11-08

None other than the desperate move of one woman, Margaret, who is struggling to keep her family-owned farm against all odds. Margaret makes the finest cheese...and to call attention to her plight and the plight of so many other family farmers faced with extinction and foreclosure, she decides to replicate a stunt from Thomas Jefferson's day and create a 1200-pound \\"mammoth cheese\\" to be ferried to Washington as a gift for the President.<br /><br />How this noble cause becomes perverted by local personal interest, the press, the pastor, and just about everything and everybody else is the center of this hilarious but disturbing book. We see the facetious and sometimes horrifying modern-day obsession with fame and fortune through the eyes of Margaret's only daughter, 13-year-old Polly, who is under the influence of her cynical and smarmy history teacher, Mr. March.<br /><br />All in all, a simply brilliant, albeit very upsetting, look at the underside of all that is good about America and society in general. Highly recommended.	2004-11-05

And before I even get to the fun, lively and irresistible plot, let me just say that we know on page one that Miss Lavinia, our own Low Country Auntie Mame, has passed away. And yet at the end, when we have finished getting to know her and attend her death and funeral, I was crying like a baby. And I don't cry at books!!<br /><br />The plot to this book is true to Dotty Frank's genre: displaced Low Country gal comes home, gets mesmerized, and slowly regains her roots. In this case, the woman is Caroline Wimbley Levine, married to a cold and smug psychiatrist, Richard, and living in equally cold luxury in New York with their beloved son Eric.<br /><br />When Caroline hears from her brother Trip that their mother, Lavinia, is losing her marbles and must be put in assisted living, Caroline grabs Eric and goes home for what she thinks will be for a few days. And there she is caught up in the gullah magic; the Low Country mystique (in which I thoroughly believe, thanks to Dotty's wonderful books) and a chance to become, once again, the \\"real\\" Caroline.<br /><br />This might be the best of the four books Dotty Frank has so-far written. I cannot praise it highly enough. Grab it and lose yourself in a truly wonderful read!	2004-10-29

Half Japanese, half American, Rei fits completely into neither culture, which is the main reason for her enormous charm. But in the last book or two, she is in the United States, and I hope this isn't forever.<br /><br />Mindful of spoilers, I won't tell those who have not read the entire series the story of Rei's departure from Japan. It is mentioned in this book, but only in passing. Rei now lives in Washington, DC, with her hunky fiance, Scottish lawyer Hugh Glendenning. At the beginning of this book, they are planning their wedding, and as always, Rei is reluctant to commit (a trait that becomes annoying for the very first time, at least to me, in this installment).<br /><br />A struggling antiques dealer, Rei is thrilled when she gets a commission to decorate an up-and-coming Japanese restaurant newly purchased by a trendy DC restauranteur. But as she becomes involved with the kitchen help, the nasty but interesting hostess Andrea, and a cast of other characters, Rei once again switches from onlooker to sleuth. Somebody kidnaps her wealthy cousin on the eve of the restaurant's gala opening, and the plot thickens from there.<br /><br />Rei's delicious Aunt Norrie is in this book, fresh from Japan, and a welcome reminder of Rei's background--like a delicate spice in a Japanese soup. And Rei is her own difficult self, with the old push-pull of her traditional ways and her ultra modern self. But some of the piquancy of the earlier novels has been lost in the all-American venue, and I miss it.<br /><br />I would never miss one of Sujata Massey's novels, and I eagerly look forward to the next one, but like other reviewers, I hope that she allows Rei and Hugh to go back to Japan--at least for the next few books!	2004-10-18

First of all, understand that this book is written entirely in phoenetically spelled Glaswegian dialect. And for the first few chapters, it can stand in the way. And then you get the rhythm. And then it doesn't matter. And you have achieved what the quirky main character in this book, a Glasgow house painter named Jimmy, is trying so hard to achieve--simplicity and clarity.<br /><br />The charming and very quirky story revolves around a working-class family in Glasgow, Scotland. The dad (or \\"da,\\" as they say), Jimmy, owns the house-painting business with his brother John. His wife, Liz, his sweetheart since she was 14, is a secretary. Their only daughter, Anne-Marie, is herself 14, and simply loveable--the most centered character in the book.<br /><br />Sensing some sort of inner turmoil, Jimmy is drawn to the local Buddhist center (we are talking about a working class beer drinking simple soul whose previous idea of humor was to moon for the video camera) and finds a sense of self he never had before. As he earnestly seeks to immerse himself in this new way of being, he becomes increasingly neglectful of his family--up to and including declaring to Liz that he must be celibate from now on! The story is told first person from alternating points of view, and the reader is sympathetic to all of them (at least I was).<br /><br />The disarming simplicity of the tale, and the work it takes to overcome the dialect, mirrors Jimmy's immersion into Buddhism, and is simply brilliant. This is a completely different kind of book, and well worth reading. I loved it and recommend it with the caveat that it is a book that takes some work.	2004-10-18

He tells Tabby they can pick the pears and make them into jelly, and both their mouths start to water.<br /><br />But the problem, as we all know, is that Mr. Putter has cranky legs, and Tabby has a cranky tail...and neither of them can manage the job of climbing the ladder to pick the pears. Tabby handles it by curling into a cat circle and going to sleep. Mr. Putter handles it by accepting what he cannot change. But when the two go home...they find a BIG SURPRISE!<br /><br />This book is appropriate for the youngest child through (ahem) adulthood...it can be enjoyed on levels you would not believe.

There's our heroine, Linda Breland, single mother of two teenaged daughters who moves back home from decades in New Jersey in hopes of taming her younger child and finding some peace of mind. There's her fabulous sister Mimi, the Martha Stewart of Shem Creek, perfect in every single way and enough to drive you crazy if you fold the napkins wrong. There is young Gracie, 16-year-old daughter of Linda, and enough to turn any mama's hair pure white overnight. There's big sister Lindsay, about to start college and leave her mother for the first time.<br /><br />And then there is the drop-dead wonderful cast of \\"Jackson Hole,\\" a local restaurant where Linda gets a job--and promptly finds herself interested (although she denies it) in her boss Brad.<br /><br />What I love about this book, and about ALL of Frank's books, is that she is not afraid to describe the very deep love between women--sisters, mothers and daughters, best friends, aunts and nieces. And she has unabashedly happy endings, and what, exactly, is wrong with that? Her take is that the entire South Carolina Low Country is a place of magic where all things are possible. And you know what? I believe her!<br /><br />Pick up the book and lose yourself in some fabulous geechee charm.	2004-10-06

Although \\"Unlucky in Law\\" takes a very long time to get to the point, and although I almost gave up several times, I'm so glad I didn't. Because once the tedious and long beginning is done with, the story is one of the best in the Nina Reilly series.<br /><br />Nina has now moved down to be with Paul, and as always, she is conflicted about the relationship. What else is new? But this time, we see some things from Paul's perspective, and that is both interesting and unique to the series...and adds some real interest to their dynamic.<br /><br />While Nina is, as always, grappling with her personal feelings, she gets pulled into a case that first appears to be a simple murder--and winds up embroiled in Russian history, all the way back to the last Czar! Nina's client, a hapless young man named Stefan, is accused of the brutal murder of a young woman of Russian descent whom he swears he never met. But his blood was found at the scene of the crime. And the DNA is conclusive.<br /><br />Hopeless? Nina doesn't think so--something doesn't rub her right, and she's going to find out what. Even if it means destroying her personal life.<br /><br />Worth the read, worth the series. Give it a try.	2004-10-02

Matekoni's auto repair shop, often had me laughing aloud.<br /><br />In a tale whose loose ends wind up in the most unexpected and delightful of ways, our heroine and owner of the Ladies Number One Detective Agency, Mma Ramotswe, has her hands full. Her fiance, the above-mentioned Mr. Matekoni, is suffering from a mysterious malaise, and has started to neglect his thriving business. Her own detective agency, while still getting customers, is showing no profit and may have to move into different premises. Put that together with the lazy, girl-chasing auto-repair apprentices, the earnest and ambitious Mma Makutsi, and a case for the detective agency that just might save the business, and there are plot twists aplenty.<br /><br />Of course, Mma Ramotswe faces all her problems unscathed, after many cups of bush tea. And of course Mma Makutsi proves herself to be invaluable--as usual.<br /><br />A delightful tale in this utterly delightful series!	2004-09-28

This enchanting sequel to \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" is every bit as charming, wonderful, sweet and brilliant (to this adult's eyes, anyway) as the first book...and has a theme so true and so wise and so non-preachy that I recommend it as must reading for all teenaged girls AND their moms.<br /><br />The girls are now one year older, and, as readers of the first book well know, they have not come through the past year unscathed. They are still mourning a death (Tibby), still conflicted over too much too soon with a too-old guy (Bee), confused over love and longing in a foreign country (Lena) and grappling with an out-of-control temper (Carmen).<br /><br />As the new summer begins, each of the girls has an issue with her mother (even Bee, whose mother is long dead), and these issues come bubbling to the surface unexpectedly and often cruelly. We get to see the age-old mother-daughter conflict from the teenaged point of view, and how refreshing, if not painful, it is for a mother of a 20-year-old to see just what she may have been thinking at 17! What I love most about the book(s) is that the girls are good, decent and wonderful people--with all the human frailities and faults. And their battles with their respective mothers are so true, so heart wrenching and yet so real, that the solutions to each of the battles wring entirely true.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book in this enchanting series. I know this is a set of books for adolescent girls, but Moms, I'm telling you, there's good reading in here for you too. Maybe more than our daughters will ever know.	2004-09-28

For there is no real time continuum in this book, which ranges from beginnings to endings to middles with no real sense of purpose...quite like real life.<br /><br />Anne Rivers Siddons is always good, but this is a really special book--a celebration of middle age, perhaps? A celebration of tides and smells and sounds and sand and dogs and all that is good in life is closer to the mark. The story of several couples who stay together through decades of friendship, love and loss, \\"Islands\\" evokes the joy of the South Carolina beaches--and even though I have not had the privilege of being there, I felt the sand and smelled the pluff mud and ran with the book's dogs in the we sand, and slept in the wonderful beach house the couples all shared.<br /><br />There is no real plot per se, although there is a strange undercurrent of danger--almost like waiting for a hurricane to hit. And when it does, as in real life, everything is changed forever. My only small problem with the book was the confusion over time. I felt that decades had gone by, and yet the dogs were still alive--elderly, but alive. And that would have been impossible. I felt the characters getting much older, but then it seemed they had not. Was this a deliberate attempt to capture the timelessness of the healing sea and beach? It may have been.<br /><br />At any rate, I sense a change in Siddons, and I have read just about everything she has ever written. I say give this book a chance, because once you open the pages, you won't lift your head again until you are finished--and then you'll be surprised that there isn't sand and sea all around you.	2004-09-27

Call me unsophisticated, call me unworldly, whatever...I cannot understand why this book won the Pulitzer Prize. Yes, it is well-written, but no more so than many others of its ilk. Yes, it is interesting, and I suppose it has some human truths--although none that speak to me.<br /><br />Russo's sweeping panorama of a blue-collar failing town is meant to be a metaphor for what--the worst of human nature? Human beings against forces they cannot control? Human beings against the God described in his book as having a nasty bent and an odd sense of humor at His best, or a propensity to screw up at His least? I don't know. I only know that I found the main character, Miles Roby, distasteful in the extreme. Poor Miles, always at the mercy of somebody else's expectations of him, from his beloved late mother to the town harridan to his ex-wife to the loser macho-men who regularly show up at his failing greasy spoon diner, all pummel Miles regularly in his effort to lead a decent life.<br /><br />Miles is a very nice man...a loving father, a good Catholic, a smart and mild-mannered friend and son-in-law and even a good ex-husband. But everything happens to poor Max, and he is simply powerless to stop it, powerless to get a grip. I don't buy it, and I don't buy the entire premise.<br /><br />The characterization of Max's teenaged daughter Tick is well-drawn. Her own inability to rise above circumstances is more understandable, given her age and her two parents. She seems real, as do the other teenagers in the book, including the very spooky and troubled John Voss, who ultimately becomes the protagonist for change.<br /><br />The town harridan, the rich woman who controls everyone's lives, gains most of her power from her manipulative genius--and of course Miles Roby falls right in to the trap. Mrs. Whiting, his nemesis, reminds me of the town bully in another book, Penelope Fitzgerald's \\"The Book Shop.\\" That person, too, was able to destroy lives. But in THAT book, the heroine put up quite a fight and almost won. In this book, Miles just lies down and lets life walk all over him.<br /><br />I know that other reviewers are going to say that I missed the point. So be it. The utter passivity described in this book is not my idea of the human condition, and I never bought in to the premise. I know I am in the minority, so take this review as simply another, and honest, point of view.e heroine put up quite a fight and almost won.

What I loved most was that the four protagonists, each of whom speaks to the reader in the first person, were real, live girls--smart, funny, precocious, and dealing with that first painful step into womanhood in the most recognizably painful and funny ways.<br /><br />The four girls, Tibby, Bridget, Lena and Carmen, who live in Maryland, have been friends literally since the womb, since their mothers all met while taking a prenatal aerobics class. While the mothers have drifted apart, the girls have remained inseparable throughout their lives, and now--as they approach age 16--they are going to be separated all summer long for various reasons.<br /><br />Lena goes to her native Greece to be with her grandparents. Bridget goes to Baja California (\\"it's in Mexico, who knew?\\") to soccer camp. Carmen is traveling to South Carolina to spend an idyllic (she hopes) summer with her divorced father. And poor Tibby is staying home to work in a chain drugstore. Each girl changes profoundly, and yet the bonds of the \\"sisterhood\\" are stronger than ever.<br /><br />I liked this book so much, I am ordering copies to give to the very special \\"sisters\\" in my own life, from my 16-year-old niece to my 70-something aunt.

I just loved it, from start to finish, and recommend it highly, especially for chilly fall evenings when one needs a good, meaty story.<br /><br />The Light Years introduces the reader to three generations of the wealthy, upper-class Cazalet Family, of London and the countryside (the parents' estate) in the uneasy pre-War years of 1937 and 1938. Here, as in so many well-written books about this particular time period in England, we are on the very cusp of a way of life that will disappear forever during the war, never to return. The rigidly structured society, completely ignorant of the lower classes and their needs and wants, was doomed as never before, and that sense of doom is exquisitely portrayed, not in words, but in subtleties all through this first book.<br /><br />The Cazalets are in a charmed world of their own, and although they are intelligent, mostly kind, very open-minded in many cases, and truly nice people in others, in fact they haven't a clue about what is to come to destroy their world and that of their society. England between the wars was such a tenuous, almost careful time, based on all of the books written about that particular microcosm, and this book seems to capture every essence and feeling, so delicately and yet so unforgettably.<br /><br />From the most senior Cazalets, the elderly Brig and his wife, the Duchy, to their brood of children: Edward and Hugh, each having fought in World War I (one unscathed, one deeply wounded in body and soul), unmarried daughter Rachel, a lesbian who does not know her own bent, and younger son Rupert, shakily married to a much-younger woman upon the loss of his first wife, each is a true human being facing his or her own fears and doubts against the backdrop of a larger reality.<br /><br />The daughters-in-law: Edward's wife Villie, grappling with an unwanted pregnancy and trying to ignore her husband's philandering; Hugh's Sybil, always self-effacing in the face of her husband's terrible wounds; and Rupert's silly Zoe, who is terrified of losing him, form the strength of the family along with the matriarch, the Duchy.<br /><br />But it is the children, all the cousins who gather with their parents at the grandparents' summer estate, who truly speak the hopes and fears of a generation wanting to live a normal life while terrified of a faceless man named Hitler who might destroy it all.<br /><br />This book stands up to its third reading (albeit by tape) as well as it did the first, and I look forward very much to the second in the series. For those who love generational family novels, The Cazalet Chronicles is a wonderful choice for very happy reading./> <br />The daughters-in-law: Edward's wife Villie, grappling with an unwanted pregnancy and trying to ignore her husband's philandering; Hugh's Sybil, always self-effacing in the face of her husband's terrible wounds; and Rupert's silly Zoe, who is terrified of losing him, form the strength of the family along with the matriarch, the Duchy. <br /> <br />But it is the children, all the cousins who gather with their parents at the grandparents' summer estate, who truly speak the hopes and fears of a generation wanting to live a normal life while terrified of a faceless man named Hitler who might destroy it all. <br /> <br />This book stands up to its third reading (albeit by tape) as well as it did the first, and I look forward very much to the second in the series.

(One of the most fun things about Frank's books is that she teaches you, and uses, the \\"Gullah\\" language of her native Low Country, and it's a hoot!)<br /><br />Here is the story of Susan Hayes, a really nice woman in her 40s with a teenaged daughter (very accurately portrayed, for those of us who have suffered through raising a 14-year-old female) and a handsome hunk of a husband...who suddenly manifests a VERY wandering eye.<br /><br />So now we have the suddenly-single-woman-with-child making it on her own, except this book is so original, so completely different, that it's like the tale is being told for the very first time. Interspersed with Susan's efforts to pull herself together in the here and now are long forays into her childhood, growing up \\"geechee\\" (native Low Country) in the segregated South, when her dearest, closest, most loving human is her family's housekeeper, a black woman named Livvie. This wise and wonderful woman saves Susan's and her siblings' souls in more ways than one...and the strength she gave them allows Susan to find the strength to get back on her feet in the here and now.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this book. It was the first for Frank, and you would never know it. I hope she writes hundreds more--Dorothea, you hear me, girl? Pick up a copy and love it to death. I know you will.	2004-09-09

Like all politicians, Anne is quick with the glib tongue and the familiar handshake, and Kate finds it hard to like her, even though on the surface, her platform seems sound. What's worse for Kate is the folderol that goes with any campaign, and stalwart native Kate is truly a fish out of water--until the murders start.<br /><br />Somebody is dogging the candidate's heels, and victims are having a nasty way of turning up when least expected. Kate tries to solve the mystery, joined by her would-be lover Jim Chopin (Chopper Jim) and other regulars--including, of course, half-wolf, half wonderdog Mutt.<br /><br />What saves the plot from being entirely tired is the parallel story that takes place early in the century--that of a dancehall hostess/prostitute in the wild and woolly Alaskan gold rush. Many authors before Stabenow have used this double plot trick to very good effect, and it works for her too, except that the tie-in between the prostitute Angel and the candidate Anne is very weak and very confusing.<br /><br />So be it...worth reading for diehard Shugak fans. On to the next!	2004-09-05

L. B. Matekoni, will live (whose house is better)? whether or not she should promote her stalwart secretary to Junior Detective, whether she should get a diamond engagement ring, and most of all, what happened to a young American college man missing for 10 years, whose distraught mother has come to beg Ramotswe's services.<br /><br />This book is no less than perfection. I am eagerly looking foward to the next!	2004-08-31

Honey, plop on down raht chea on your beach blanket, even if you set it up on your livingroom floor, because here is your quintessential beach book. Highly reminiscent of \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" but with a voice all its own, \\"Isle of Palms\\" has everything from enjoyable characters to wonderful plot twists to a happy ending.<br /><br />What I liked most about the book was the easy, Southern way of the characters, from our heroine, hairderesser Anna Lutz Abbot of the highly dysfunctional family and even more dysfunctional marriage, to her much-loved ex-husband Jim, to her best friend Francie, to her college-age daughter Emily, to all the friends and family and acquaintances in between.<br /><br />Anna is in her late 30s when she decides once and for all to return to the dreamland of her childhood, the Isle of Palms. Frightened by her own boldness, she buys a small beach cottage--her first place that is truly her own--and then, throwing caution to the winds, buys and sets up her own hairdressing business. Along the way, she confronts many ghosts (and everyone on the Isle of Palms knows that ghosts are real)-- from her mother, dead at a tragically early age, to her own frightened child self.<br /><br />I ate this book up, I loved it so much. I can't wait to read the others by this entertaining, funny, and altogether delicious author!	2004-08-30

And as Steph herself would say (and often does): same old, same old. Ten Big Ones is still funny, hilarious in parts, but the Burg has lost its sparkle. There are just so many times one can revisit the formula without getting the teeniest bit bored, even though I am a rabid fan of the Stephanie Plum series.<br /><br />I can't say that anything is wrong with the book, other than it seemed like I had read it before--and I had, in the nine other ones, just slightly different. All our old favorites are on board, from Lula and Grandma Mazur to Morelli and Ranger (even that is getting boring; it's gone from two sexy guys between whom Stephanie can't make up her mind to \\"who cares?\\") to one of our old friends, Sally the Transvestite.<br /><br />This time out, Stephenie inadvertently (however else?) gets mixed up with a deadly and dangerous street gang--who put a contract out for her murder. And of course she does not listen to Morelli the cop or Ranger the--what--spy? We never really know. And she gets herself right smack in the middle of the worst and most deadly plot of her career.<br /><br />It should be cute. It WAS cute. But I would advise those who have never read a Plum novel not to start with this one. For the rest of us, I guess it's on to Number Eleven!	2004-08-22

I want to take a ride in her tiny white van. And most of all, I want to help her solve people's problems as part of her Number One Ladies' Detective Agency.<br /><br />I want to go to Botswana. I want to look out for snakes and smell the dust and worry about the rains. I want to take part in the courteous greetings, and I would not at all mind having a boyfriend named Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. I would speak in the lyrical tongue of a people who seem much more in touch with the realities of life and death than anyone in my own world.<br /><br />This is not a book to lose. This is a book that has so much simple wisdom on almost every page that you will find yourself, as I did, marking the pages, writing in the margins, copying certain phrases to keep forever!!!<br /><br />Wonderful, enchanting, charming, outstanding. Read it!	2004-08-18

Highly reminiscent of one of her later books, Life Skills (which I guess cannot be called reminiscent, since it came several years later), this is the story of a cheeky girl named May who lives on a canal boat. Feisty, self-sufficient and used to a bit of hardship, May is now facing true disaster: She has lost her job and her nasty mooring master(something like a landlord) is threatening to sell her boat's mooring berth out from under her if she does not come up with the considerable debt she owes to him.<br /><br />Fast forward to a nasty man dubbed Slimeball, who offers May and two equally desperate young women--Sally, an out-of-work actress, and Harriet, a single mother in danger of losing custody of her son, jobs as a house cleaners for his agency. The women take the job--even though nobody but Harriet has ever truly cleaned a house. A wild and woolly adventure begins.<br /><br />Will Slimeball pocket all the women's hard-earned profits? Will Harriet become a famous artist, keep her son, and incidentally make her sexy art teacher notice her? Will May keep her beloved boat, The Rose Revived? And what of Sally, who, up until now, has relied only on her beauty and stick insect body to make her way in the world?<br /><br />I defy anybody to read this book without breaking out into huge smiles. This is the type of book where, when you reach the last page, you emit a huge sigh and then read the last chapter all over again just to keep from ending it.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2004-08-16
560010:US	49248343	R2RPZAAVL6F7JB	0743233476	695751496	Monday Mourning: A Novel (Reichs, Kathy)	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Not Her Best	Although I am a diehard fan of Dr. Reichs, I find I don't agree with most of the other enthusiastic reviews of \\"Monday Mourning.\\" I found it too pat, too quick, and way way too full of Dr. Reichs' new affectation (evident in her last few books): Raymond Chandler-esque bon mots.<br /><br />Examples: \\"The coat hung on him like a bedsheet on an unstuffed scarecrow.\\" Or: \\"A young couple sat pressed together closer than socks from a dryer.\\" And on and on and on. As if that were not bad enough, our beloved main character, the brilliant forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan (Tempe), now speaks in the same way--rapid-fire bon mots. It drives me crazy! I see that I am alone in this, since no other reviewer has even mentioned it, but it was enough to make me very impatient with the book.<br /><br />The story takes place in Montreal this time: Longtime readers know that Tempe, like Dr. Reichs herself, divides her time between North Carolina and Canada. The plot involves three skeletons found in a cellar beneath a pizza parlor. Tempe thinks they are recent and could be the work of a mass murderer; her nemesis, detective Luc Claudel, disagrees. So begins the usual war of evidence as Tempe strives to prove her point against the disapproving wall of the nasty Claudel.<br /><br />Added to the plot are a visit from Tempe's longtime friend Annie, whose slick line of patter (see above) almost obscures her very real problems; and a very confusing continuation (or not) of Tempe's romance with hunky cop Andrew Ryan.<br /><br />The last 40 or so pages are truly suspenseful, but I found the book as a whole to be a big disappointment. Nevertheless, I would never give up on Kathy Reichs, who is a hero of mine as an author and as a woman. I just wish she would revert to the serious self she was in her earlier books!	2004-08-10

And the proof that it works is this: I am well past the thirtysomething dating game, and I found it as interesting, fun to read, and most of all, TRUE, as I would have done in my earlier years--and still do! And that's the sign of a good writer.<br /><br />The main character in this story is your basic Brit Lit heroine: Think Sarah Jessica Parker with an accent. Tasha is single, gorgeous and a successful TV producer--but her love life is as confusing and tangled as it was when she was 15. She wants the \\"passion\\" (and gets it--plenty) but also wants to be loved. Can the two exist? This is the endless discussion between Tasha and her best friends: lovely sweet Mel, a therapist stuck in a go-nowhere relationship; Emma, waiting and waiting for her beloved to propose; and Andy, who could give Kim Cattrall's character a run for the money.<br /><br />Straight Talking is a fun and fast book, perfect for the beach, perfect to \\"cleanse your palate\\" between heavier fare. The end is satisfying in every regard, and I give this book a solid B plus.	2004-08-09

Probably so. It is so evocative, so rich, so different, so completely wonderful, I cannot imagine not having loved it. And yet I find it almost impossible to describe.<br /><br /> All I can come up with is a microcosm of one single summer in a farming and mountain community in Kentucky, where the nearest big city is Lexington. Each of the several main characters, both male and female, is as fiercely independent and tough as the land itself, and each finds him/herself thoroughly changed by one seemingly normal summer, where nothing seems to happen. But oh, so much does. And we learn these subtle changes through the flora and fauna, the moths, the coyotes, the trees, even the weeds.<br /><br /> For this is nothing if not a paean to nature. The author is unabashed about her ecologic views, which this reader happens to share. I'm not sure how a reader not so inclined would take this book; it is an unabashed plea for environmental safety.It is fiercely anti-hunting, anti-pesticide, anti anything that in any way tampers with the natural ways of the earth. It all makes perfect sense to me--would it convince a reader not so inclined? I don't know. It just might...there is a coyote hunter in the book who is mightily tempted to change. Does he do so? I will not say.<br /><br /> All in all, this book, my first taste of Kingsolver, has left me a changed person, as those in the book were changed. It is not a book to read in an instant and toss aside, and it is not anything I am going to forget anytime soon. It is, at least in the audio version, a total and almost mystical experience. Highly, highly recommended.	2004-08-04

And so they find glorious treasure in the most unlikely of fellow human beings.<br /><br /> That may sound corny, it may sound pat--but the message here is if you look beyond the surface, you just might find gold. And, like Anne Tyler before her, Gaffney takes the most seemingly ordinary people and graces their lives with beauty, showing us that every human being is an angel--no matter how deep you have to dig!<br /><br /> This is the story of Caddie Winger, a music teacher in her early 30s who has no notion of herself at all. She considers herself blah and invisible when she is quite the opposite. She lives an invisible existence, though, in an old house with the woman who raised her, her grandmother Nana.<br /><br /> As the book opens, Nana, an eclectic, very &quot;out there&quot; &quot;performance artist&quot; given to creating obscene sculptures out of mud and plants in the front yard, suddenly and without warning asks Caddie to take her to a local residence for the elderly. It is not a nursing home, but one step from it. Caddie is appalled and upset--this is totally unlike Nana. But she complies, and at the home itself, Caddie, a young and attractive woman, gets drawn in to the various lives, large and small, of Nana's residential neighbors.<br /><br /> In the process of listening to, and at times recording, the interesting life histories of the residents, Caddie begins to come out of her shell and put together the clues of her own self as well. It's a slow and painful process, and there is no &quot;eureka!&quot; suddenly on page 300. More, it is like real life is, a surprise, good or bad, around every corner.<br /><br /> This is simply a wonderful book. I recommend it highly.	2004-08-03

It's a life that suits Joe to a tee: He is free to conduct his secret life as a serial adulterer, and can also see and be seen with his eye-candy wife.<br /><br /> Is Alice happy? Not really--she is at heart a country girl who wants roses and kids and dogs and gardens and an unpretentious life. But the more she realizes this, the more she hides the truth from herself. Especially about Joe. Alice doesn't know about his prodigious extra-marital appetites because she doesn't want to know.<br /><br /> When Joe is hastily removed from his London office after being found in a compromising position with a co-worker (on the conference room table!), his and Alice's subsequent relocation to Manhattan spells a whole new life for Alice--and possibly one for Joe as well.<br /><br /> This is not Green's best, but is fast and fun to read. As always, her heroine is so likeable that the reader is on her side from the very first page. A fun, frolicking read.	2004-07-28

No spoilers as to why: Midnight Come Again serves as a flawless continuation of the horrifying Singing of the Dead, and I have no wish to spoil the former in order to praise the latter.<br /><br /> Suffice to say that Kate has survived--but barely. She is sick at heart, sick in her soul, and so unlike herself that Chopper Jim, who is ostensibly on an undercover mission but really searching for his old and dear friend, is horrified when he finally meets up with her again.<br /><br /> It is Jim's undercover mission, however clandestine he tries to keep it, that sparks the first modicum of interest in Kate since the unspeakable events the year before. As she and her trusty sidekick Mutt (who thankfully has survived as well) get embroiled in the doings of Russian Mafia members who may be hiding a stolen cache of plutonium, she seems to come back to life, slowly but surely.<br /><br /> Along the way are a pair of bumbling FBI agents who are sure that Kate is among the bad guys; and from afar, the call of Kate's nearest and dearest, all of whom pull her back to the world of the living.<br /><br /> A superb entry in the series!	2004-07-24

This is her special talent: You open the book, you read the first sentence, and you have magically entered the room in which resides the lead character. You can see it, you can smell it, you are THERE. This has happened in her previous two books, and it has happened here. I don't know how she does it.<br /><br /> &quot;The Children's Hour&quot; takes place concurrently in the present and in the past, namely the 30s and 40s, in the same Cornish estate overlooking the sea where our two protagonists, elderly sisters Mina and Nest, were brought up in a large family of laughing children, dogs, books and a loving, wonderful mother.<br /><br /> As the book begins, Mina, in her seventies, is both caretaker and loving companion to her disabled sister Nest, also in her seventies, whose disability has resulted from a decade-old car crash that killed another sister, Henrietta, and her husband Connor. We know that Nest feels tremendous guilt over being the only survivor of the crash, but we don't know quite why. The sisters live quite calmly and cozily together in their childhood home with three dogs and all the comforts--including the Internet--until their serenity is shattered by discomfiting news: Their oldest sister Georgia, in the first distressing stages of alzheimers disease, is being brought to stay by her grown daughter Helena until space can be found for her in a nursing home.<br /><br /> Georgia's terrible disease, which includes a terribly disconcerting desire to spill long-buried family secrets, becomes the catalyst by which we learn those very same secrets as the book slides effortlessly between the present and the past. We meet the five sisters (and one brother) as children, as teens, as young women--and in their middle age, and we learn to love them and to despair of their sometimes foolish and heartbreaking--even heartrending--decisions.<br /><br /> As Georgia's increasing illness creates more and more stress in the formerly calm little household, an entire story of a time and place long gone entertwines with the present day until, like Georgia herself, we are hard put to tell them apart. The end, when it comes, makes perfect sense, and will cause any reader to weep sad but sweet tears.<br /><br /> This book is a keeper, a gem.

With mighty strength, Florence doggedly tries to make a go of her book shop by steadfastly ignoring her enemy, Violet Gamart, who wants the premises for an &quot;arts center.&quot;<br />The end is unbelievably sad, and more so because really, in four decades, nothing much has changed about human nature. This is a strange and depressing book, not to everyone's taste. I found it fascinating and well-written, but it takes some doing to get through it.<br />This is my first Fitzgerald novel, and I am now interested in seeing her style in her other books. I cannot comment on whether this is representative of her other writings, but I would defnitely recommend giving it a try.	2004-07-16

For those of us who have followed Kate from the very first book, this story is almost unbearable in its suspense, its heart-pounding intensity, and its gut-wrenching ending. It brings the series to a whole new level, and if I never read another one in the series, I will always remember this book.<br />The story starts out simply enough: Kate and her lover Jack Morgan, along with Kate's trusty half-wolf, half-husky Mutt, join feisty Old Sam and others as hired guides to a party of largely tenderfoot hunters. They've done work like this before, and they know all the pitfalls of such an escorted hunting trip, but this group of paid participants is more obnoxious than the average amateur: The entire group is from a multinational computer software company headquartered in Germany, and each of the teutonic wilderness wannabees is more obnoxious than the next. Before the first shot moose is cold, there has been an accidental shooting of a human being. And that's only the beginning. It becomes clear in very short order that a mass murderer has signed along for the trip, and that nobody is safe.<br />As Kate and Jack rely on their wits and their wildnerness savvy to figure out who is doing the killing, the reader is increasingly afraid for their very existence.<br />This is an amazingly powerful book. I'm glad I read it, but I'm still crying as I write this review. Whew!	2004-07-13

Having lost their domineering old battle-axe of a mother as the book begins, both brother and sister are having trouble banishing her critical and strident voice from each of their minds.<br />As they go about their days--Helen as a part-time librarian, Edward as a schoolteacher--the reader senses that something horrific is about to happen. The very stillness of their lives portends something awful. It is the genius of the author that can portray that feeling without in any way discussing it or warning the reader...it's just there.<br />And when it happens, lives are shattered, and the reader simply must weep.<br />This is a tour de force. A brilliant piece of writing. And something that cannot be put down and forgotten.	2004-07-08

The youngest sister, Merry, has passed away at 32 after a long illness as the book begins. As the remaining sisters convene at the family's aging Victorian house, all their long-time hurts, dreams, failures and successes are almost palpable as each grieves in her own way. It sounds like a million other books of this type, but a different twist makes it all brand new, and very interesting.<br />That is the search for the illegitimate daughter of Jilly, the sister who went on to become a top model in Paris, and a minor celebrity. It turns out that at age 17, she was shunted off to a strict Catholic home for unwed mothers, and forced by circumstances, the time in which she lived, her unyielding parents, and the nuns themselves to give up her baby without being allowed to hold or see it. That momentous situation, it turns out, has colored the lives of all the sisters--even Merry, left brain damaged after a childhood accident. Her last wish was that Jilly and the other sisters find &quot;Spring,&quot; the name she has, in her childlike innocence, chosen for the missing Season.<br />This is not a deep and unforgettable book, but it is well worth reading, and simply perfect for the beach, which is where I finished reading with a long sigh and many tears. Go for it!	2004-07-06

And I WANT to like her books, because I like her as an author; I like the part of her that seems to appear in her books. But try as I might, I could not like this book--there were simply too many groaners.<br />For example: the &quot;perfect housewife&quot; who suddenly realizes her husband has been unfaithful throughout their marriage--so escapes to lie naked on the grass and &quot;find herself&quot; (straight from the above-mentioned &quot;Pull of the Moon&quot;--I kept wondering if bugs were walking on her private parts? Do you HAVE to be naked on the grass to find yourself?)<br />And...high-powered career woman used to controlling every part of her life suddenly finds she cannot get pregnant--thus losing control. Argh! And...suddenly widowed, a grieving wife goes through her husband's effects and finds a picture of another woman.<br />The one possibly interesting thread, one of the women very tentatively coming out of the closet, is as tentatively mentioned, and never explored again for the rest of the novel. That would have been a departure that could have added some originality to the tale. But it was not to be.<br />OK. That's enough, and none of the above is a spoiler. Monroe seems to be a dear person, so I wish her well and will not tell you not to read this book. But be warned. You have read it a thousand times before, and you will read it a thousand times again until this particular genre lays its weary head to rest.	2004-06-29

And here I thought I knew all about it--salmon swim upstream, right?<br />Yes, but in the hundreds and thousands, and Kate is serving on an ancient fishing boat right in the thick of things. As we find out from this fascinating look at the salmon season, the work is backbreaking, intense, smelly and unending--and that's just the fights among the fishermen jockeying for a place to put their nets.<br />In the middle of this frantic fishing, which is governed by environmental and other laws, comes a nasty rogue aptly named Calvin Meany. He disregards the unwritten law of the waters, impinging on others' nets, catching their salmon, resorting to thuggery when he has to (and even when he doesn't), and beating on his crew--his own teenaged son.<br />Kate hates him on sight, as does everybody else, so when Meany turns up brutally murdered, it's hard to feel sorry. Still, Kate has to do her job. And her investigation into the nasty circumstances of the murder place her own life in jeopardy.<br />Another fast-paced, fascinating read from Stabenow!	2004-06-27

You loved this book!&quot; Anyway, there are no half stars available.<br />OK, so maybe some of the plot was a bit far-fetched. And maybe the three-page soliloquy by the dying mother, Lovie, was in words that no real person would use. And maybe the corporate circumstances of our heroine, Caretta (Cara) Rutledge, were a bit unreal. I realized at the end, which found me crying my eyes out, that I simply did not care. This was a perfect summertime read for me, and I suspect will be so for many others.<br />The plot is nothing new: An independent Chicago woman, Cara, comes home to the Carolina Low Country (The Isle of Palms, beautifully and evocatively described) at the behest of her long-estranged mother, Olivia (Lovie). It is only after a week of licking her wounds (for she was fired from her high-powered job right before leaving on her visit) that Cara comes awake and realizes that her mother is very ill. And it takes all summer for the two to reconcile and reach an understanding granted to very few.<br />As a backdrop to the story is a wonderful, absolutely wonderful, side plot about the real-life Isle of Palms/Sullivan Island Turtle Team, and its heroic efforts to save the loggerhead turtles. The author is a proud member of the team, which figures prominently in the story; and in fact, her &quot;author picture&quot; is a portrait of the real-life  &quot;Turtle Ladies&quot; and herself. I was so fascinated by the turtle team, and so profoundly affected by the wonderful descriptions of the island, I would probably be on the next plane if I could.<br />There are some other satisfying subplots as well: One is about a young unwed mother from a trailer park, who is taken in by Lovie not only as a companion, but to protect the young woman from her abusive boyfriend; the other is the growing love affair between hard-bitten Cara and quintessential Low Country man, the hunky Brett Beauchamps.<br />I have to admit that I was enchanted by this book. And all I want to do is relocate to Palm Island and help save the turtles. I wish that real life were as easy to reconcile as that in this lovely book!<br />Read it and enjoy.and quintessential Low Country man, the hunky Brett Beauchamps.<br />I have to admit that I was enchanted by this book.

Although Soames is supposed to be the enemy--cold, forbidding, and capable of raping his own wife to claim his &quot;rights as a husband,&quot; nevertheless, I have always felt sorry for him, especially in this reading. Would he have been a different man if Irene could have loved him back? Would he have softened, become more human, more able to feel happiness? In later books, he is loved back by his only daughter Fleur (by his second wife), but by then he is too set in his ways to change.<br />And Irene...the modern-day Helen of Troy. The beauty who breaks men's hearts without even knowing it...could she help being so terribly cold to Soames? With her warm, loving nature, could she possibly have found it in herself to love her exact opposite? That dilemma continues through the generations to culminate in a truly intense tragedy involving Irene's only son and Soames' only daughter.<br />I am so glad to have revisited this book once again and seeing it with new eyes. It is so much more than a mere melodrama, and the quality of Galsworthy's writing is much more talented than I had ever realized. The Forsyte Saga should be included among the masterpieces of a certain era. It has the universal truth and staying power that is deserving of status as a true classic.true classic.	2004-06-22

She is something of a genius of the genre.<br />&quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; is not one of those books. Yes, it is written in the same style. Yes, some of the wording, the turns of phrase, the bon mots are side-splitting. Yes, Rachel is one of the loveable Brit Lit Irish girls--in this case, a Dubliner living in New York with her lifelong friend Brigit and an entire cast of memorable and hilarious characters. In fact, Rachel is a sister of Claire, the wonderful heroine of &quot;Watermelon&quot;--and those of us who read that gem know what a truly baroque family of five sisters Rachel and Claire belong to.<br />Here the similarity ends. For this is a serious and heart-wrenching story of addiction and its horrible aftermath. For loveable, sweet, funny and huggble Rachel, who thinks of herself as a typical recreational drug user on the New York social scene, is in fact an addict--slipping away from reality, slipping away from her friends' and her boyfriends' grasp--swirling deeper and deeper out of control.<br />As we follow the excrutiating progress of Rachel's descent from fun party girl to whacked-out user, we hear it all from her own point of view. I think this is the first time I have truly understood the powerful denial that rules the truly hooked. It is very frightening. And, like Brigit, Luke (the boyfriend) and others who love her, we cannot help but only watch in despair.<br />Most of the book takes place in The Cloisters, a rehab facility back in Dublin, which Rachel agrees to try only because she has a fantasy that it is loaded with rock stars and is something like an upscale spa (hence, her &quot;holiday&quot;). Instead, she is met with other addicts, from alcohol to drugs to gambling to food--and as she vigorously asserts that she is in the wrong place and &quot;nothing like them,&quot; in fact, as the reader can plainly see, she very much is.<br />Can Rachel accept the help and support of the counselors and fellow patients in rehab? Will she save her own life? We truly want her to do so, because from page one to the very end, she is a person about whom we care intensely, even during the times when we want to conk her over the head with a frying pan at her self-delusion.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

It is that wonderful--the type of book that can cause a smile on a rainy day whether one is planning to cook or not.<br />I have not tried all the recipes in this book, although just about all of them intrigue me, and I hope to try them all. I can only say that I find Nigella's irrepressible narration during her recipes (just like she does on television) as amusing and helpful as the recipes themselves. She invariably says, &quot;if you don't have [this ingredient], it's ok,&quot; which is my type of cookbook. I have learned so much just from reading the recipes, because Nigella explains spices with which I am not familiar; or tells you how to strip the leaves off a fresh basil stalk (believe it or not, I did not know how to do this, and probably would have thrown the entire stalk in the pot); and gives you all kinds of ideas you may not have had before.<br />For instance, in a lemon chicken recipe (which I have made to rave reviews), she says that the lemon bits themselves, peel and all, carmelize during cooking, and become sweet enough to eat whole. I tried it--she was right, and I have to tell you that a hot, baked, carmelized lemon is a treat not to miss--who would have ever thought of it? Maybe gourmet cooks, but certainly not me. Same with the parsley and tomato salad. It never occurred to me that parsley could be served and eaten as a salad green. Nigella says she &quot;invented&quot; it when nothing else was available in her fridge.<br />Most of the recipes in this book are what I would call &quot;light,&quot; although she does include some heavier fare such as spareribs. Mostly, though, these are dishes just perfect to prepare for a lovely summer dinner party, or--as I have done--to pig out on all alone!<br />A word to the dieters who may be reading this review: I am on a low-carb diet and have found plenty of things to eat. I have had to skip many of the desserts (sigh), but I can still read about them! All in all, take my word for it: I am no gourmet cook, but I certainly feel like one with Nigella by my side. This is a fun, fabulous cookbook for just about everybody.of the desserts (sigh), but I can still read about them!

It is--the plot is fun, fast, lovely and very readable. No major surprises, no life-changing revelations, nothing too taxing for the summertime brain. I say give it a chance. I found it absolutely charming and will definitely look for more by this author.	2004-06-13

Um...I really liked this book.<br />With each Marian Keyes novel I read, I come to love her more. She has the most endearing way of combining fluff (or so it seems) with real substance, real truth, and a compassion for her characters, good and bad, that makes her a storyteller par excellence. She is one of the few authors I would love to meet at the local pub (even though I'm an American, so I guess it wouldn't work) and hang out. Even though she gently but effectively skewers such book fans in this delicious book!<br />&quot;The Other Side of the Story&quot; is a tale of love and revenge, Brit Lit style. It has three &quot;heroines,&quot; if you will: Gemma, a professional event planner who harbors and nurtures a deep grudge against Lily, who has stolen her boyfriend. We go along and hate Lily--until we meet her. And then we simply love her. And then there is JoJo, a hard-bitten, tough-as-nails book agent whose affair with a married co-worker could bring down her entire career. We want to hate her; we can't.<br />Each of these three women is facing, in her own way, terrible guilt and an inability to let go of it and move on. And each must dig deep into her own resources as things go terribly wrong. I won't say how, but trust me, you will have to fight yourself to turn to the back of the book to make sure that everything turns out alright!<br />As a backdrop, Keyes draws a totally hilarious picture of the book publishing world and all its various sordid and self-serving behind-the-scenes goings-on. Obviously, she has first-hand knowledge, and some of the scenes made me squirm with glee as I figured she was skewering some real-life people, in her own funny and disarming way!<br />What can I say. I loved this book from start to finish, and I can't wait to share it with everyone I know. Read it and give yourself a treat!	2004-06-10

As readers of this hilarious entry in the wonderful Kate Shugak series now know, Breakup is the time between the frozen solid Alaska winter and the spring--a time when the potholes reach several feet deep, the slush competes with the mud, the weather is unpredictable--and the bears wake up crabby and hungry from their long hibernation. It's also a time, apparently, when the locals take leave of their senses, and the most mundane errand is run at one's own risk.<br />Kate sees most of the action in this novel from the floor of her local pub, where stray bullets from angry housewives are flying at random; in the mud, where she is knocked down several times by everyone from friend to foe to bear; and from her house, which just happens to be partially demolished by an engine that has dropped from the sky off a jetliner. And that's just in the first few pages!<br />Even wonder-dog Mutt is cranky in this truly funny look at all the regulars as they emerge--like the bears--from their long winter hibernation. There's a serious undertone dealing with Kate's new and unwanted position as head of tribal affairs, but mostly it's just a wild romp as we get to know our favorite Alaskans maybe a bit too well.<br />Much recommended!	2004-06-05

Their men are not caricatures, but real people whose thoughts and needs are sensitively described in this book--a breath of fresh air! As we watch the three women grapple with different issues in the fertility arena, we come to love them and care deeply for the babies they may or may not have.<br />I was surprised at just how good this book really was. I was expecting another light, breezy British outing, and although this book certainly delivers on that level, it is also a thoughtful and thought-provoking look at parenthood and what it does, and does not, mean to those of us who have children, or who have every thought of having one.<br />A keeper!	2004-06-01

But these murders are particularly and horribly brutal. The woman has not only been shot, but skewered with an iron bar. It's a big case of overkill, and a little digging unearths a particularly nasty underbelly to the murder and its aftermath.<br /><br />As Milo and Alex dig into the multiple webs that surround this murder and its motive, the plot gets increasingly difficult, so that the reader has to stop more than once to unravel the latest string and put it in context. I know the author meant that to reflect the puzzle that the two are trying to solve, but it stopped me cold more than once.<br />And the other thing that stopped me cold many, many times was the endlessly intricate narration of streets and routes that Kellerman affects in each of his books. I grew up in LA. The streets are all real, and I know most of them. So when he says, &quot;I drove down Robertson to Pico,&quot; I know exactly what he is talking about, and I have to stop reading to visualize it. This time out, he actually gets into the minute details of a neighborhood in which I grew up, and we're talking streets, hills, even foliage. WHY does he do this? Does anybody in the entire world need to know the in-depth &quot;Mapquest&quot; routing of every ride that Delaware takes? It's gone from simple author quirk to something so annoying that it takes away from each and every book he writes, and this one truly is the worst.<br />I can't say that &quot;Therapy&quot; isn't a fun book, especially as summertime reading. I finished it in a day. But be warned: Unless you enjoy map-reading for fun and pleasure, prepare to be annoyed throughout the otherwise fast-paced mystery.are to be annoyed throughout the otherwise fast-paced mystery.	2004-05-27

Quite against her will, Kate has been roped in by her grandmother into leaving her beloved homestead, where she is just settling down with Mutt in anticipation of a lovely long winter, and traveling to Anchorage to attend the annual native Alaska convention.<br />As any devotee of this series knows, crowds of any kind are anathema to Kate, and having to attend such a convention is true punishment. But as readers also know, Ekaterina is not to be denied. So Kate and Mutt reluctantly say goodbye to peace and silence and travel off to the convention--only to be entangled in a nasty behind-the-scenes environmental ripoff that will not only cheat Kate's native people, but one that involves murder and danger.<br />Much more than usual, we earn about the Aleut customs and beliefs, and much more than usual, this reader was moved to tears several times.<br />A must for fans of this series to read, definitely a keeper.	2004-05-22

I couldn't put it down!<br />Another entry in the Brit Lit thirtysomething genre, this is the story of Libby, who, even though she has a trendy job (PR), wonderful friends, great clothes, and a terrific flat in London, wants to get married more than anything in the world. Libby wants the entire ball of wax: a rich husband who has a fabulous car, an even more fabulous house, and enough money to keep her in designer clothes forever. And then one day, she meets her fantasy!<br />The story of how Libby tries to fit the fantasy to reality, and what she gives up on the way, is funny, frantic, touching, meaningful, and just pure fun from start to finish. I found it not only wonderfully amusing and true, but surprisingly moving as well, considering I am not a Brit, not a thirtysomething (and never had this much fun when I was) and not a single young career woman any more.

It has all the wonderful Pilcher elements: the stately old home gone slightly shabby; the wonderfully individual characters (in this case, in Scotland rather than Pilcher's often-used Cornwall venue); the stalwart hero/heroines bearing secret grief in silence.<br />Our heroine, Flora, suddenly finds at age 22 that she has an identical twin from whom she was separated at birth. That twin, Rose, is everything that Flora is not--and does not wish to be. But before Flora can find this out, she is drawn into a ridiculous and dangerous scheme. She will impersonate Rose, who has jilted her perfectly nice fiance Antony, in front of Antony's dying grandmother, Tuppy.<br />Thus begins a fraught journey to the aforementioned crumbling estate in Scotland, a love-at-first-sight meeting with the grandmother, and a week-long charade that brings Flora close to permanent disaster, and changes everyone around her. Of course the reader prays for a happy ending and a nice, bracing cup of hot tea.<br />Simply a gem. If this is a Pilcher you have missed, give yourself a treat and curl up with it at the first opportunity.	2004-05-14

She has a dead-end job at a local paper, and even though she is highly talented, she will go nowhere and she knows it. People do not look at fat women as superstars, she thinks. But Jemima knows deep inside, and we do too, that she is most definitely a star.<br />And so, through this fun and lovely book, Jemima slowly, slowly, slowly begins to pull herself together and take control of her life. And it is told with such humor, and such love for the main character, that the reader is brought right along on the ride, from cheerless London to impossibly sunny Los Angeles in a truly baroque adventure.<br />I loved this book. I still do not think that Jane Green is the writer that Marian Keyes is, but \\"Jemima J\\" is a classic in the new genre of young British women writers. In impossibly American slang, I just have to say to Green: You go, girl!	2004-05-11

It's back-breaking work, but highly lucrative, and Kate is joined by her paraplegic Vietnam Vet friend Bobby, and his new lover, a bright-eyed young photographer named Dinah, whose enthusiasm wins Kate over.<br />It is while Kate and Dinah are hard at work at picking (Kate) and snapping (Dinah) that Kate makes a nauseating and horrific discovery: Under a particularly lush growth of mushrooms lies a badly decomposing body. Kate's subsequent inquiry into the identity of the victim and the manner of his death leads her into a mosquitos' nest (literally) of dangerously unstable religious fanatics. It's a situation that doesn't sit well with Kate as a professional PI, or with Kate as a native Aleut, with religious views quite different than those espoused by the narrow-minded group who are opposing her investigation.<br />Another fine, fast read in the series; highly recommended, as always.	2004-05-10

Some were better than others, in my view, but all were distinctive and brilliant.<br />Brother and Sister, to this reader, was a terrible letdown. The premise is sound: Adoption and its aftermath lasts well into the adults lives of those adopted and those who gave up their children for whatever good reasons. Well and good. And when adult adoptees seek their birth parents, everyone around them is affected as much as they are. This is perfectly in line with Trollope's ongoing theme in all of her novels--that people are not islands, that the behavior of one person can affect, for ill or good, a wide circle of others. Trollope has embroidered on that theme throughout her ouvre, often brilliantly.<br />Why, then, did this book leave me so unmoved? Perhaps because the main characters--the two adoptees, Nathalie and her adopted brother David--were so unlikeable. Perhaps because their significant others were equally unlikeable. Perhaps because not one character in the book, with the exception of two young children, meant anything to me as a reader. Nathalie is the one who begins it, who suddenly, in her 30s, feels the driving need to find her birth mother. I could relate to that--but not to the fact that she selfishly forces her brother David, who does NOT have the same need--to join her in the search and find his own roots.<br />The book goes on and on and on and on as we learn who the birth parents are, and their stories, and see the inevitable havoc that the searches wreak upon everybody in sight. There are no happy endings, no ecstatic reunions on Oprah. Funnily enough, while reading this book, I spoke with an adoptive mother whose son had just found his birth mother, and everybody was ecstatic. I'm not saying that this should be the inevitable outcome, but I found the entire negative premise of this book to be over the top.<br />As one of Joanna Trollope's most ardent fans, it pains me to say that, had Brother and Sister not had her name on it, I would have tossed it into the bin before finishing even half.t fans, it pains me to say that, had Brother and Sister not had her name on it, I would have tossed it into the bin before finishing even half.	2004-05-02

I had heard and read so much about Jane Green, I finally got this book, and was surprised at how long it took me to become involved in the characters and the plot. I think the problem was that I was comparing Ms. Green, who writes about very similar people, to the divine Marian Keyes, and there is really no comparison. While Green is certainly a skilled writer, Keyes is truly inspired. And so the same-old same-old stories of the travails of a group of thirty-something \\"Friends\\" in contemporary London does not seem as fresh and original as do Keyes' stories.<br />That having been said, \\"Bookends\\" is a nice book. Yes, the characters are all too similar, including the token single person, the token gay man, the token witchy gorgeous woman out to steal everybody's boyfriends. But it turns into a good story about two dear friends, women who are disparate in character, looks and circumstances, who manage to team up and fulfill their lifes' dreams by opening a bookstore cum cafe.<br />Along the way, there are the requisite relationships in trouble, hurts, and real pain. I cannot say there was anything truly original in this book, nor is there the wonderfully fey humor of Keyes, but nevertheless, I do want to read more Green.<br />If, like me, you are besotted with Brit Lit, and you cannot get enough, then Jane Green is a good addition to your library, and this book is certainly worth reading. If, however, you are not particularly a fan of the genre, I'm not sure that \\"Bookends\\" is the place to start. It will be interesting to see how her other very well-received books affect this reviewer--I'll let you know!	2004-04-29

Not only that, he has stripped their house bare of every stick of furniture, every knicknack, even a broken lamp. As Molly literally bends over from the shock and emits a long, heartbroken wail, she is overheard by Rafe Garrick, a handyman who just happens to be in the neighborhood. And so the scene is set.<br />Can Molly, unaccountably attracted to the gorgeous, hunky Rafe, overcome her own prejudices, pain, and outrage over being dumped by her husband to find new love? Can Rafe, who has fallen in love with Molly on first sight, trust his heart when the secret he carries is so full of hurt? Each of these people is more than they seem...but neither will let the other one see what is inside.<br />It's a typical romance, a typical plot, but it all comes together so sweetly that it is just the thing for a night in a warm bathrobe and fuzzy slippers, with hot cocoa and the lights down low. Barbara Bretton's books are always like that--nothing spectacular, but wonderful nonetheless.	2004-04-22

There's really no love lost, but Ellen is justifiably humiliated and at loose ends, and the last thing on earth she needs is her hippie dippie half-sister Deirdre blowing into town without warning. But that's Deirdre, and this time she's not alone. She has a barely running old heap of a Hyundai, a large harp, a 110-pound dog named Stanley--and, as Ellen quickly finds out, an agenda.<br />And so begins a summer that changes many lives, including those of Ellen, her sister (and another one to boot), and her handsome, thrice-married medical partner, Hall Talbot, whose friendship means more than Ellen can admit.<br />This book is basic Bretton--not every loose end is tied up, not every plot line is explained, but who cares? The book, like all her work, is simply charming.	2004-04-20

Not only did I not find it boring, I zipped through the book in record time.<br />Other reviewers have described the plot in detail...ominous forest fires, obviously the result of arson, are decimating the forests around the Carmel area--and young Wish Whitefeather, whom we have followed through all the books and brought to young adulthood, is arrested for setting the fires, with one count of murder to boot. It is up to Nina, who wanted nothing more than to take a hiatus from her career and explore her personal relationship with her lover and PI partner Paul, to take the case and save Wish from almost certain conviction.<br />As Paul and Nina struggle to find a center to their relationship and to solve the increasingly thorny mystery of who really set the fires and why, a whole subcast of characters is explored. The end was sufficient enough for this reviewer to be on tenterhooks for the next book. I know this is not a popular point of view among other reviewers, and again, I don't know why. My reaction to this book was wholly positive, and I would definitely urge those who follow the series to read it. For those who have not been Nina Reilly fans in the past, my view is that this will turn the tide.<br />Enough said!	2004-04-14

Only Keyes could take such a serious subject and write about it with such love and real humor. But it is there, nevertheless, so if one is looking for a mindless romp, this is not the book.<br />Like all her main characters, Keyes' Lucy Sullivan is loveable through and through, and the reader follows Lucy's perpetual escapades with all the wrong men with wringing hands! Why go for the alcoholic, drug-sodden user, the admittedly gorgeous Gus, when there is a man in the wings who really wants her and is entirely suitable? Will Lucy ever see what we see? Will she allow herself to stopped being used and start being happy?<br />Read it and see...and prepare to be enchanted.	2004-04-12

Knowing that her very presence at the oil company's home base will offend her formidable grandmother for all time, Kate nevertheless quickly gets used to the work, the comraderie--and most of all, the nonstop food, akin to a cruise ship. Between gorging herself on luscious steaks, homemade fries and all-you-can-eat ice cream sundaes, Kate begins to sense the evil and dangerous drug busines that lurks beneath the surface.<br />With some much-needed &quot;down time&quot; with lover Jack and wonder dog Mutt (half huskie, half wolf) to clear her head, Kate uncovers a plot that threatens to undermine not only the giant oil company, but her very life as well.<br />Fun, fast read...absolutely delightful.	2004-04-06

I don't know whether one has to be middle-aged to become so completely involved with Rebecca Davich, the book's main character, as I became, or whether my reaction was due to a combination of the spot-on rendering by Blair Brown (on the unabridged audio recording--superb!) and the fabulous writing we have come to expect from Tyler.<br />No matter. All I can say that all Tyler does best, from her quirky, distinctive characterizations (and there are quite a few in this book, from 100-year-old Poppy to NoNo, to Min-Foo, to Patch, et al.) to her insightful looks into the special qualities she finds in every ordinary human being, comes together to make this book a perfect whole.<br />The story of Rebecca, who wakes up one morning convinced that she has turned into the &quot;wrong person&quot; is enormously moving, even though Rebecca is an ordinary too-heavy middle-aged woman given to intoning rhyming toasts at endless family parties, and to wearing blowsy hippie-dippie clothing. I loved her from the very first page, which is always Tyler's magic. She makes the reader care deeply about all the Rebeccas she writes about, and this is no exception.<br />Rebecca married on a whim, leaving college and her stodgy college boyfriend to marry a dashing divorced man with three young girls, a decaying old mansion his family rents out for parties, a demandingly impossible mother, and an extended family one has to know to believe. Rebecca walks into all this with aplomb, rescuing the family's business, dealing with her mother-in-law, raising resentful and difficult stepchildren and eventually a daughter of her own, and finally inheriting her husband's elderly uncle, &quot;Poppy,&quot; who becomes a full-time job in himself. Rebecca has only 6 years with her husband before he dies in an accident, but she carries on with grace and aplomb--in her own unique way.<br />It is only when she is 53 that Rebecca grinds to a mental halt, so to speak, and wonders whether she took a wrong turn in her life, whether it has all been for nothing, and whether she matters one bit to all the people for whom she has sacrificed. She finds out in this moving, funny, poignant and wonderful journey into her past and her present in this wonderful, special book.to a mental halt, so to speak, and wonders whether she took a wrong turn in her life, whether it has all been for nothing, and whether she matters one bit to all the people for whom she has sacrificed.

It's a silly, formulaic concoction that she must have written at top speed. But somehow, even though it's predictable, hackneyed, and been done a million times before, it's fun to read. What can I say.<br />Here we have--as though it hasn't been done a zillion times before--a group of disparate women of a certain age who meet at a boring party, bond instantly, go to dinner, and start their own group, named (gag) the Hot Flash Club. Each woman in the club has, of course, her own problem, from the high-powered executive, an African-American powerhouse who now fears for her job; to the mousy professor who spends all of her time researching prehistoric bugs; to the wild-haired hippie masseuse; to the wealthy widow who has lost her ability to paint. Each forms a plan to tackle her problems, with the aid of the others.<br />Thayer, who knows better, had no business writing such a silly book. This reviewer, who knows better, had no business reading it in one gulp. But she did. And so did I. I wanted to give it two stars instead of three, but that would have been a lie, because I had a lot of fun reading it, even though I rolled my eyes every chapter or two. So...three starts for Thayer, who has kept me a happy reader for far too many years to give up on her now.	2004-03-30

Those who follow her books will experience some strong deja vu, as whole sections of Keyes' truly baroque life seem to make their way sooner or later to her novels--eg, the famous mudbath that one main character took just before her wedding in order to fit into her dress!<br />The charm of this book is that it can be picked up and put down at random. Each essay functions on its own, and in fact, the author, in her preface, suggests that the reader simply browse and choose according to his or her mood at that moment. And so I did--and loved every single essay in the book.<br />A keeper!	2004-03-27

As the book opens, Dan is a house husband, dealing with his three surly teenagers and his equally surly wife Jackie, a high-powered executive in her own right who has no patience or sympathy with her husband's jobless condition.<br />Dan is going in circles, both emotionally and professionally, when, on pure whim (unlike him completely), he suddenly decides to invest in a Scottish clothing company he has read about in a magazine. Dan's trip to Scotland, his subsequent reawakening, the friends he makes, and the unexpected turns he experiences, both in his own life, and that of his three children, change him, his marriage, his view of life, and his very soul forever.<br />I could not turn the pages fast enough to finish this wonderful book, and I am thrilled that Robin Pilcher has finally found his way, free of his mother's formidible reputation and finally able, like Dan Porter, to stand on his own. Bravo, Robin! Well done indeed.	2004-03-26

But somehow, &quot;High Country&quot; never gets the reader's blood flowing the way earlier entries in the series have done.<br />That is not to say that the book is not enjoyable, or even that it's a tough read. It simply does not, for this reader, anyway, have the spark that so many others have had. Perhaps it's because Anna is working undercover at a lodge in Yosemetie rather than in her park-ranger personna--and also because all through the book, she keeps harping on the fact that she is middle-aged now and has slowed way down. I kept expecting her to order a rocking chair! And her thoughts are belied by her eventual confrontation with the villain--no used-up woman could ever fight back the way Anna does.<br />The plot concerns Anna's placement in the park to help investigate the mysterious disappearance of four young and able climbers, each of whom was more than able to fend for him/herself. Anna starts to nose around while trying to keep in the guise of a waitress--the temperamental chef hates her, the boss lady hates her, everybody seems to hate her. And they have reason to as Anna doggedly and determinedly uncovers a truly nefarious set of circumstances.<br />This was a fun read despite its curious lack of life. I wouldn't read it as a first sample of the Anna Pigeon series, but for us diehard readers, it's a must.	2004-03-22

Kathryn's competent and serious airliner pilot husband Jack is the pilot of a plane that mysteriously explodes just off the Irish coast. There are no survivors.<br />As shell-shocked Kathryn struggles to come to terms with this horrendous and horrible news, and to shelter her teenaged daughter Maddy from the press and the whispers, rumors of pilot suicide almost break her. She knows that Jack would never commit suicide and kill 150 people along with himself--but what she doesn't know, and is soon to find out, is that Jack was not all that he seemed.<br />Yada yada yada. I was not impressed, I found no deep and life-altering meanings. Instead, I felt maniuplated by a progressively more silly plot line that left me, in the end, feeling that I had completey wasted my time. My advice: If you have any respect for Shreve as an author, as I do, forget she ever wrote this one. Her reputation remains intact without it.	2004-03-18

And each of these relatively young people, who thought they had loads of time to \\"find themselves\\" and a mate and a meaningful life, are strongly affected by their dear friend's suffering.<br />Woven into this tale, even with the cancer, are Keyes' trademark hilarities. I don't know how she does it, but each of her characters--from Fintan's \\"Irish mammy\\" and his two clomping farm-bred brothers from Ireland, feckless Tara and her horrible live-in boyfriend Thomas, who dresses all in brown and \\"says as he sees\\" (always an insult), to the supermodel-type blonde Swedish Liv, always on the edge of depression, to Katharine, strangely cold and enigmatic, each has his or her moment of side-splitting insight from the reader's point of view.<br />This book was not as fluffy and fun to read as, say, \\"Watermelon,\\" but it is worth its weight in gold. If you haven't read any Marian Keyes, you are doing yourself a major disservice!	2004-03-17

The work is dangerous, grueling, back-breaking, and tough beyond measure as the crew battles high seas, horrible weather, ice storms, and even treachery from other fishing boats out to grab the same lucrative catch. Kate is no shrinking violet, and she can outdo anyone on board, given half a chance. But this is no ordinary ship. And its captain is either the most incompetent sailing man on the Bering or any other sea, or--as Kate suspects and must prove--up to no good in a very major way.<br />Putting herself in considerable danger, both from the job itself and from those who have a murderous secret to hide, Kate methodically sets out to find out who murdered the former crew members--and why.<br />The only thing missing from this wonderful tale is Kate's faithful half-wolf dog, Mutt, who I missed very much. Mutt is back on the Alaskan mainland, where Kate very much wants to be as well...and where the reader hopes she will return in one piece. A great yarn, a wonderful read.

Just like that. No muss, no fuss. With a beginning like that, it's hard to imagine where to go from here, but Keyes manages to pick Claire up by the scruff of her neck, shake her off, and move her and her newborn back to Dublin from London, where she had been living with James.<br />Once in Dublin, Claire runs the gamut of emotions, from not showering for a week to crying nonstop for 24 hours to yelling and screaming to becoming the &quot;antichrist&quot; to her large, extended and very strange family. Yet we love her more on every page. And we want so much for Claire to &quot;sort herself out,&quot; as the Brits say.<br />Will Claire sort herself out? Will James come back and grovel? If he does, will Claire take him back? Will her parents ever break free of their strange and abominable daughters? It's all answered in the book, in prose that is so completely fresh and witty, so very funny, that the reader almost forgets that there is actually a real story here, and a good one at that.<br />It's nice to know that Keyes only got better with time, because this, her first novel, is just about perfect, and I'm glad to know that it wasn't a flash in the pan!	2004-03-10

Nevertheless, I was not prepared for the brutal read that is \\"The Third Child.\\"<br />When I say \\"brutal,\\" I am not referring to violence or mayhem, although one could certainly make a case for psychological violence in this plot ... Melissa Dickinson, who considers herself too tall, too fat, and altogether lumpish, thanks to her shrew of a mother, is the third of four chidren in the picture-perfect family of her father, Senator Dick Dickinson. We gather that the senator is an arch conservative, whose wife (and Melissa's uncaring mother), Rosemary, a small-boned, brittle beauty, is the power behind the throne. Nothing, absolutely nothing, will stop Rosemary in her constant and obsessive push to further her husband's career all the way to the presidency. Every aspect of Melissa's life is a photo op. Otherwise, she sees nothing of her father, and her mother only communicates to criticize.<br />So it is no wonder, then, that when Melissa finally escapes to college, she falls heavily and hard for just the \\"wrong type of boy\\" in her mother's eyes, had her mother known about the romance. Blake is 19, like Melissa, a gorgeous black man who was adopted and raised by a prominent Jewish famiy and who considers himself Jewish as well. A double whammy for the oh-so-WASP Dickinsons. But Melissa is besotted with Blake, madly passionately in love as only a first love can be. Too bad the reader is not--there is something just a bit off with this boy, and the reader is at a loss to know what it is.<br />Here is Piercy's genius coming through. The Dickinson matriarch is such a horrible, manipulative and terrible person, that the reader is loathe to take any opinion that would in any way coincide with hers. And yet as a mother of a 19-year-old daughter, all I could think as a reader was, \\"get away from this boy! He's no good!\\" And yet I didn't know why.<br />This sense of unease grows throughout the book to an almost unbearable level as we see the insidious manipulation of Melissa from all sides, even when we can't figure out what it's about. The ending is explosive and troubling in the extreme.<br />This is a scathing indictment of politics in America, no matter what the political party. It makes any reader stop and think, especially in an election year...I recommend it to everybody, no matter how liberal or conservative they may be. Another triumph for Piercy, who simply gets better and better with every book she writes.e, manipulative and terrible person, that the reader is loathe to take any opinion that would in any way coincide with hers.

They meet and marry in the prewar haste of 1941--when Pearl Harbor galvanized ordinary young men into rushing off to enlist, and ordinary young women into marrying them in haste.<br />Cocooned in his Polish Baltimore neighborhood, the only surviving son of a grocery-store proprietor (his mother), Michael Anton is completely naive to the ways of the world--until he meets vivacious, pretty young Pauline, so daring that she wears a bright red coat! She comes from the next neighborhood, and that makes her exotic to Michael, who courts and marries her before ever stopping to see who she is.<br />What follows is an almost 60-year saga of this terribly mismatched couple--their children, their neighbors, their lives. What makes it interesting? The fact that Michael and Pauline and everyone in their circle could be us--the fact that while while we may think our own lives and doings are unique and important, they are only so to us.<br />We see Michael and Pauline through the eyes of each of their children, through the changing decades of postwar America, through tragedy and pain and death--and the end? As simple as the beginning. And that is Tyler's gift. Showing us that in the end, we are all alike, no matter how we choose to dress it up, no matter what our choices. In the end, we are simple human beings who live the best we can in a life that may or may not bring us happiness.<br />This is one of Tyler's best books, as good as she has ever been, and I highly recommend it.	2004-03-05

Maggie has her Irish eyes opened wide by the antics in Los Angeles, which include everything from eyebrow waxing (a procedure she is painfully forced to submit to) to bleaching unmentionable parts of the posterior.<br />What Maggie really wants, deep inside, is her husband back, but she doesn't quite realize that--as she sorts through her hurt feelings and the story of her marriage, we know it before she does. Along the way, there are some eye-opening experiences, and not just with her eyebrows.<br />This is just a fun book--not memorable, but very enjoyable indeed, and very good for someone who is in between heavy reads and just wants an enjoyable piece of well-written fluff.	2004-03-01

I felt I was there in the first spring thaw with Kate and her wonderful half-wolf dog (a bona fide character in her own right) as they stretch their winter-weary limbs. Kate has spring fever, and her very female dog, Mutt, is mesmerized by a giant and gorgeous he-wolf who can't seem to keep away from Kate's cabin.<br />This serenity is shattered very quickly, however, by the doings of a crazy-mad serial killer who, in one short span of a few hours, goes on a murder spree so deadly and so accurate that almost nobody in the tight-knit communty is spared outrage, shock or unbearable grief. After the dust settles, however, the real shocker sets in: One of the dead was not shot with the same gun. Somebody has used a crazy man's murder spree to cover up a real and nasty additional killing--and it's up to Kate to find out who.<br />I found the mystery less than the story telling, which kept my interest all the way through. This is a good, solid series, one that I am reading from the beginning, and I see no reason at all not to move on quickly and with pleasurable anticipation to the next!	2004-02-28

Even her lesser efforts tend to leave the reader gasping for air at the end--and &quot;All He Ever Wanted,&quot; one of her best, in my opinion, is breathtaking in the same shocking way.<br />Written entirely from the point of view of a stodgy male college professor circa 1900, this is the story of a passion so intense, so unlike the writer himself, that it is scarcely believable, especially when related in the stilted flowery language of the day.<br />Nicholas Van Tassel, a rather ordinary pedantic with nothing particularly unusual about him, happens to be in a hotel restaurant when it catches fire. This single pivotal episode in his otherwise unremarkable life changes him forever--it is during the rescue effort that he encounters Miss Etna Bliss, and falls head over heels into a passion that borders on, indeed IS, an obsession.<br />Hampered by the extreme rules of etiquette governing proper men and women of the day, Van Tassel nevertheless pursues Miss Bliss, finally persuading her to marry him despite her the fact that, as she honestly tells him, she does not love him. Love will come, thinks Van Tassel, hardly able to believe his luck in winning his prize. And that hope, that fantasy, that overwhelming obsession of his entire being, eventually destroys the narrator, his wife, and his entire family.<br />Shreve stays in character completely and thoroughly, managing to evoke the failings of the man himself, the restrictions of the society in which he lives, and the hopelessness of his obsession without ever once betraying herself. It is safe to say that the author stays well in the background while letting Van Tassel tell his own tragic story.<br />I consider this book a minor masterpiece. Shreve is an acquired taste, I know--but truly innovative and absolutely original in every book she writes. &quot;All He Ever Wanted&quot; is no exception.	2004-02-25

Such was the case with the delightful \\"Sushi for Beginners,\\" Marian Keyes' hilarious but deeper-than-it-seems tale about thirty-somethings in modern Dublin.<br />The main character of sorts (although there are really several) is Ashling, the type of person who carries band-aids, headache remedy, sewing kits, and just about everything else in her handbag, and is good at dispensing same to anyone who needs it. \\"Little Miss Fix-It\\" (as she is snidely called by her pompous boss) is in need of a new job when the book opens, and finds it in the editorial offices of a proposed new Irish woman's magazine, Colleen.<br />Colleen's staff is an assorted crew of truly funny people--and for those of us who actually have worked on a magazine, only too true! The editor-in-chief is the formidable and horrible Lisa, who prides herself on being rotten to her employees and upon having no friends whatsoever. She has a sterling journalistic reputation in London, but considers this Dublin assignment too beneath her to stand. Nevertheless, she gives it her witchy all...backed up by the disheveled but sexy boss Jack, whose equally sexy girlfriend Mai shows up from time to time to have loud, screaming fights with him--complete with snarling bites (good thing Ashling as band-aids in her purse)!<br />There is a supporting cast of characters, both men and women, who are in equal parts selfish, self-centered, sad, needy, and--with very few exceptions--loveable. Despite the humor, there is a true story beneath--a story of ordinary people trying to make their way in life with a bit of love thrown in to sooth the loneliness. In some ways, the reader is reminded of \\"Sex and the City\\"--with an Irish twist.<br />This is a perfect book to make one laugh and even cry while waiting for spring to arrive and the flowers to bloom. Try it!	2004-02-23

Hence the ridiculous title--after her last book, renamed &quot;Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman,&quot; do I detect a pattern here? Are American readers too lowbrow to choose a book unless it has a soap-opera title?<br />No matter. The book is lovely anyway, and more than it seems. It is the careful and often heart-tugging story of a marriage that is not exactly ordinary: Will is a British MP, and his wife Fanny, once a free spirit who ran a wine company with her father, is now the dutiful, adoring wife. Only it doesn't quite work out that way.<br />Over a series of years and overlapping time periods, we see how the marriage evolves from a crazy-in-love-at-first-sight honeymoon into a real relationship, with all the attendant baggage that comes with it. Will, to my mind, is the most self-centered human being one could imagine, I suppose like all politicians, and it is in his character that Buchan lets us down--I simply could not see why a strong, vibrant woman like Fanny would put up with him. This is explained to us in various months and years of Fanny's adaption to her political life, but it never quite makes sense.<br />Will's alcholic sister Meg moves in with the young couple almost immediately, and is horribly intrusive throughout the book, and yet the two woman have some strange and yet unmistakable bond. Meg's son Sacha appears at age 16, choosing to live with his mother, and so joins the household that already contains Will and Fanny's only daughter Chloe.<br />Fanny's father, a wonderful, robust, full-of-life transplanted Italian who loves his vineyard and his daughter with equal gusto, represents the other side of Fanny's character--and so we learn a great deal about her--if not her choices.<br />I notice that in this version of the book, the publisher took care to change Brit phrases like &quot;jumper&quot; into &quot;sweater,&quot; but left &quot;tights&quot; alone. So for those readers who do not know, tights are pantyhose in Britain--it's impossible to imagine Fanny on one of her deadly boring political tea-drinking outings wearing American tights!<br />Another good book from Buchan--not her best, but well worth reading. Just put a brown paper bag over the title.nge Brit phrases like &quot;jumper&quot; into &quot;sweater,&quot; but left &quot;tights&quot; alone.

I never ever review diet books, said I never would. Now I am breaking my own rule, because I bought this book, started Phase I of the diet on January 5, and I am melting before my very eyes.<br />I even read the entire text of the book, which I never do, and it made sense to me. I have more energy, more get-up-and-go, a feelings of general overall health, and best of all, with very few exceptions, I AM NOT HUNGRY.<br />I am now on Phase II, and losing steadily, although only a pound or so a week, which Dr. Agatston says is best. I believe him. What I do NOT know is if his diet lowers cholesterol or blood sugar levels. They must lower sugar levels, because until the maintenance phase, all sugar is verboten. I have never been off sugar in my entire life, and I find that, surprise, surprise, I am OK without it.<br />The drawback to the book is the many discrepancies, which might have been corrected in later editions, as they have been on the South Beach Web site. For instance, the text might say that is is OK to have a certain food in Phase I, but it won't be listed on the foods that are OK list. Or vice versa. But the recipes I've tried are great (I've made many variations to suit my own tastes) and my mirror and my well-being tell me it's working.<br />The only person I know who is unhappy with this diet is a coworker who is regularly sneaking pizza and chocolate--and is angry that she has not lost as much as she should. I say, give it a try. It is not as drastic as Atkins, and seems to me to be a much healthier way to lose weight.	2004-02-12

Robb, to create a two-books-in-one surprise.<br />This is one of those Nora blockbusters that you simply can't put down, and that you love every step of the way. The first story, which takes place in the present day, follows Laine Tavish, owner of an antiques store in Angels Gap, MD, and sexy hunk Max Gannon, who has been sent to Angels Gap on the trail of missing diamonds worth countless millions.<br />Good at his job, Max has already found out Laine's deep, dark secret: She is the daughter of a well-known thief who has eluded police for years. What Max doesn't know, however, is if Laine knows about the diamond heist--or knows that a major, cold-blooded killer is after her and the booty he thinks she has. Forced to investigate further, Max meets Laine, and in true Nora Roberts fashion, sparks fly. Next thing you know, Max and Laine are embroiled in a hot-hot love affair and a quest that now threatens both their lives.<br />Fast-forward over 50 years. Now J.D. Robb (Nora) takes up the story with our favorite New York cop, Eve Dallas. When a series of brutal murders of innocent young women grips the city, Dallas becomes embroiled in the case--and uncovers a strange connection to a diamond heist that happened many decades before. It seems that Samantha Gannon, granddaughter of the very same Max and Laine, has written a best-seller about her grandparents' one-time involvement with the famous heist. Her book states that a quarter of the booty was never recovered...and with that information, the book sets off a crime spree that can only be solved by delving into the past.<br />Perfect Nora--perfect Robb.

Peter is reluctant to get involved. He has no police jurisdiction in New York, he is without his usual sources and backup, and the entire Lieber family, grieving for their lost relative--and, coincidentally, Ephraim's teenaged niece, Shayndie, is treating Peter like dirt.<br />Peter is all for turning right around and going home, but like always, becomes deeply entwined in the mystery, which involves more twists and turns, more mysteries, than anyone shoud have to face. In addition to the missing girl and the murdered uncle, something is very strange about the surviving brother, Chaim, father of the girl--who all but kicks Decker out with his boot while nevertheless garbed in the pious garb of the ultra-orthodox.<br />It's strange alright--and gets even stranger when the mystery drops Decker right in the lap of mobster Chris Donatti, with whom Decker has a long and complicated history.<br />The mystery continues almost right up to the last page, and as always, there is no ends-tightly-sewn-together, pat ending. This is a good read, another Faye Kellerman winner, and I highly recommend it.	2004-02-08

The plot concerns a small group of very likeable people whose lives and problems intertwine in the most interesting ways...<br />Bridget is the very attractive, 50-something owner of a bed-and-breakfast business just on the edge of England's moor country. The business consists of a number of cottages on an estate she has inherited from her late father. Bridget's husband of 30 years, Humphrey, is an officer in the navy, and so away for many months at a time--and Bridget values her privacy as much as she loves her husband.<br />Into this serene and lovely mix comes Bridget's gadabout mother, Frummie (short for Freda), well into her 70s, but still the young flirt she used to be--at least in her mind. Frummie needs a place to live, and Bridget, who has never gotten along with her mother, has grudgingly given her one of the cottages. The issue between Bridget and her mother is Jemima, the daughter born to Frummie after she left a young Bridget and her father to flee with a lover.<br />Bridget's mixed feelings about her younger sister Jemima (who is a wonderfully portrayed free spirit and just irresistable) and her mother, combined with a secret she cannot reveal, make up a large part of the book--but not all.<br />We also meet Louise, a regular boarder at the bed and breakfast who has become friends with Bridget--and who seems dangerously near to a breakdown over a secret of her own. We don't know what it is, but we start to worry about Louise as much as the rest of the characters do.<br />Hilarious comic relief to the sometimes heavy plot is provided by Frummie and her equally old but equally vampish longtime friend, Margo. The interplay between the two old harridans is truly inspired.<br />In short, this is a simply delicious book--the second wonderful surprise from Willett.

In the last book, we saw Sam slowly and painfully come to terms with the limitations in his life until he could somehow squelch his dreams of finding something better (eg, relocating to Australia, a recurrent dream). The book was basically Sam's story, poignant and memorable.<br />In this followup, young Joe is the protagonist, as we see his parents' lives--and his own--from his point of view. When the book opens, Sam is still restless, but Ellen is content and happy for the first time when they move into a brand new Council house (tract houses that were offered at very cheap rates to returning servicemen and others). And young Joe begins to bloom.<br />Unfortunately, this is short-lived. Sam makes a move that profoundly changes the lives of Ellen and Joe, in ways he could never predict. Joe's intensely personal encounters with his inner demons make up the exqusitely poignant story as we follow him from young childhood to his early teens.<br />I can only hope that Melvyn Bragg plans to continue this brilliant series. The first two books have taken a place in this reviewer's mind as some of the finest contemporary novels written in the last few decades. I hope for more to come.	2004-01-23

There, as he has dreamed of for months and years, he is reunited with his pretty young wife Ellen, and his young son Joe, a baby when his father went off to war.<br />Soon enough, it becomes apparent that the happy reunion was only the tip of the iceberg. A tangled web of emotions, frightening to both Ellen and Sam, and unspoken by both, threatens to destroy the relationship they both want so badly to keep. Sam is haunted by the atrocities and death he has seen in the war, and can hardly keep in his own skin as he dreams of escaping to far-off lands to make a new start. Ellen, used to being on her own, is frightened by this stranger with her husband's face, and clings even more desperately to the village of her birth and the way of life she is accustomed to. And in between them is little Joe, accustomed to having his &quot;mammy&quot; all to himself, and now misplaced by a stranger he must call &quot;daddy.&quot;<br />Alongside this very private drama of three very private people is the larger story of the village of Wigton, which suffered all manner of privations during the war--but whose people are still clinging strongly to village ways.<br />Bragg, who grew up in the Wigton area, has created a masterpiece, in my opinion. It is followed by &quot;A Son of War,&quot; a continuation of the Richardson saga, and something I intend to read immediately.	2004-01-12

The third in Roberts' new &quot;Key&quot; trilogy, &quot;Key of Valor&quot; tells the story of Zoe, the last of the three seemingly ordinary Pennsylvania women who must find a magic key as part of a Celtic quest.<br />As I mentioned in my reviews of the two earlier books, &quot;Key of Light&quot; and &quot;Key of Knowledge,&quot; only Nora Roberts could make such an outlandish plot completely believeable. You've got your basic gods and goddesses--stuck in our world for over 3000 years. You've got a nasty evil sorcerer. You've got your magic spells, your swirling fogs, your not-so-coincidental coincidences. Sigh. And it all makes a perfect whole.<br />Zoe, a highly self-sufficient woman who had a son out of wedlock at the age of 16, has fought every day since to make a good life for her beloved child and for herself. And by taking on odd jobs, pinching pennies, and becoming a master at do-it-yourself projects, she has succeeded beyond her wildest dreams. Only Zoe cannot see the gift she has brought to others--she is too busy raising her son and fighting like a tigress against anyone who wants to help her. But she must have help if she is to find the final key to unlock the captive souls of three half-human, half-goddesses.<br />That would mean she needs a male in the picture, perhaps one Bradley Vane IV, man of privilege and family. And that is the very last thing she wants or needs, even though he attracts her like no other.<br />A perfect Nora plot, a perfect Nora ending. Read it and treat yourself to some mindless bliss.	2004-01-06

But that would be a big mistake, as I soon found out!<br />Because this is not only the story of a truly unique PI, hardboiled and independent Aleut native Kate Shugak, but also the story of an entire subculture that lives in temperatures and conditions that would probably kill the rest of us. I speak of rural Alaska--and if you didn't know much about it before reading this book, you sure will by the time you are done.<br />Although there is a mystery and a crime to be solved in this book, the star is Alaska itself and the very independent characters who populate its sparse and frozen countryside. The story itself concerns the disappearance of an overeager park ranger who just happens to be the son of a U.S. Senator back on the mainland. And the FBI agent originally sent to find the ranger is missing as well. Kate is asked to step in, which she does very reluctantly. But this reader was much more fascinated with Kate's living conditions than the plot.<br />Perhaps later in the series, the plot and description of the countryside even out. It's enough to make me want to keep reading!	2004-01-05

Marcia is not Rosamunde, but close enough to make one sigh with contentment.<br />Long a popular writer in her native UK, Marcia Willett has not been available to us in the United States before this wonderful book. As the Brits would say: Why ever not? This is simply a lovely, wonderful book, the type you pick up and instantly find yourself involved--in this case, by &quot;walking into&quot; an agreeable farmhouse in Cornwall on almost the very first page. But beware: &quot;A Week in Winter&quot; is so perfect for wallowing, that you may find yourself forgetting to get off the commuter train (as I did), or reading right past an important appointment (as I almost did).<br />The plot opens in the kitchen of Maudie Todhunter, a no-nonsense widow who is eating her egg and opening her mail. As we read her mail with her, we are drawn immediately and totally into her world. Her beloved late husband, Hector, had been married once before, to the saintly and perfect Hilda, who died before Hector met Maudie. The children from that marriage, all grown, have largely scattered, leaving one daughter, the embittered and nasty Selena, still in London--and still loathing &quot;mummy's replacement&quot; after all these years.<br />Selena, too, has children, and one of them, Posy, has formed a strong and lifelong attachment to Maudie, whom she calls &quot;Babe&quot; and regards as her grandmother. Posy stops by Maudie's farmhouse to deliver her dog, Polonius, a giant mastiff who is forbidden to enter Selena's perfect house. And no wonder. Polonius has a mind of his own, as Maudie, who has secretly fallen in love with him, soon finds out. (Like so many British writers, Willett treats Polonius as a character in his own right, and we get many insights into his tricky doggy mind!)<br />Of course the intertwining of characters, simply living their outwardly ordinary lives, becomes anything but ordinary. We get to know Posy very quickly, and to love her; we learn about Maudie and her secret heartbreaks, Selena and her impossible demands, Selena's long-suffering husband Patrick and his secrets, and wonderful Rob, the bachelor estate agent for Moorgate, a huge estate right on the edge of the moor that Maudie must now sell.<br />It is around Moorgate that many spells are wound, hearts are broken and mended, and the reader is simply and irrevocably enchanted.<br />What can I say. I adored this book. Anybody who loves Rosamund Pilcher, Maeve Binchy and the like will be sure to enjoy it too. But make no mistake--Marcia Willett is no imitator. She is a strong and wonderful writer and I cannot wait to read the next book, just released in the U.S., &quot;A Summer in the Country.&quot; I have a feeling it will get this reader through some cold winter months with complete joy.heartbreaks, Selena and her impossible demands, Selena's long-suffering husband Patrick and his secrets, and wonderful Rob, the bachelor estate agent for Moorgate, a huge estate right on the edge of the moor that Maudie must now sell.<br />It is around Moorgate that many spells are wound, hearts are broken and mended, and the reader is simply and irrevocably enchanted.<br />What can I say.

If I did not have a &quot;thing&quot; about reading every single entry in any series I like, I would never have finished the book. The good news is, since I read it out of sequence, I know that the slowness of the plot is an anomoly...the only one in the series to be just about impossible to finish. But finish it I did.<br />The plot concerns the sudden appearance of an unpublished manuscript by Thea Janis, a teenaged prodigy who wrote a shocking blockbuster hit, &quot;Nightmare's Dawn,&quot; a couple of decades earlier, before apparently killing herself at the tender age of 15.<br />Carlotta is hired by a Dr. Manley, a &quot;friend of the family&quot; who is now convinced that Thea is alive, and who wants Carlotta to--very discreetly--find her. Manley is absolutely firm in his belief that Thea is still alive, and although Carlotta strongly doubts it, her subsequent sleuthing brings her closer and closer to one of the most prominent Boston families, one of whom is running a close race for governor.<br />Sounds tailor-made for a great read, right? Wrong. There are so many red herrings, side stories, wrong turns, threads that go nowhere and endless musings, I had to stop reading for days at a time. Several times, I thought to myself, &quot;Now THIS is a perfect ending for the book.&quot; But nooo.....it went on and on and on and on into many such endings, until it finally limped to a disappointing conclusion.<br />I forgive Linda Barnes, because I love her writing and I love her series. I'm going to put this down to panic over a printing deadline and forget all about it. My suggestion: If you have read the entire series and you are a purist about reading every last page (like I am), go ahead, but be warned. If you are an occasional Linda Barnes reader, and you like what you have read, skip this one, by all means.	2003-12-27

His unspeakable crimes went on for years and years, while at home, he was the model husband, father and grandfather, a pillar of his community and his church.<br />How could this happen? All too easily, as former FBI profiler John Robinson, the author of many other such books, describes in painstaking detail. Think you couldn't be roped into such a scheme? Think again. Robinson was brilliant at what he did; he fooled not just naive &quot;prey,&quot; but thinking women who knew the perils of the Internet, including at least one psychologist who walked right into his horrible web (no pun intended).<br />The chilling story ends with a series of warnings for parents about supervising their children's activity on the Net, and also reminds adults to be careful. It's a worthwhile book for that alone. For those of us who like true crime stories, it's probably a C plus due to the stilted writing. But the story in itself is grade A...well worth the read.	2003-12-10

Sound corny? Yes...but not when Nora writes it! That is her great gift, as her fans know all too well. So along we go with Dana, and talk about pressure: She's about to lose her job; she's fighting unwanted romantic feelings about an old lover; and she has only 28 days to find the key or let down three goddesses and two women who have become her best friends overnight.<br />I could not put this book down, anymore than I could the first, and am horrified to see I have to wait several weeks for the final book in the trilogy! This is the perfect read for the holiday season; put your feet up, pour a lovely cup of something warm, and enjoy. Ten stars!	2003-12-05

Three celtic goddesses had their separate souls stolen several millenia ago, and their three human Pennsylvanian counterparts, Mallory, Dana and Zoe, must find the keys or the curse will last forever. Yeah, right--that's the initial reaction of the woman AND the reader--until, after tons of research and the help of three incredibly sexy and gorgeous men (necesary to any Roberts novel), they start to believe. And so does the reader. Only Nora Roberts could pull off such a ridiculous plot and make it not only believeable, not only perfectly normal, but make the reader stay on the edge of her seat unable to put down the book. Perhaps that is the key to HER magic. I often wonder if there is more than a bit of the fey in Nora!<br />At any rate, \\"Key of Light\\" is Mallory's story, as she is the first who is chosen to find her key. Does she do it? And, more importantly, is there even such a thing as this key? Read and find out--and prepare, as always, to be enchanted.	2003-11-24

This reviewer is a bit late to the game--I had not read any Julie Smith novels until somebody recommended this book. And NOW, I want to read everything she has written, &quot;82 Desire&quot; in particular, since it introduced the incomparable Talba Wallis, aka the Baroness Pontalba, and heroine of &quot;Louisiana Hotshot.&quot;<br />How to describe Talba? Sassy, smart as a whip, clever, by turns super strong and super sensitive, hurting inside, snarling outside...a woman to contend with. And her alter ego, the Baroness? A poet dressed in the wildest, most outrageous, most beautiful finery she can find to complement her incredible poetry and her African-American heritage.<br />This story has Talba finding a job in a detective agency after reading the most unusual want-ad ever. With nothing but moxie and fabulous computer skills, she worms her way into Eddie Valentino's small, gritty agency, and nothing will ever be the same again.<br />If you have not read this book, do yourself a favor and do it! You are in for an incredible treat. As for myself, I have some major book ordering to do...	2003-11-19

Cindy is not a likeable character--in fact, through most of the book, I could not stand her. But she is compeltely believable--an obnoxious, loudmouth, arrogant young woman with a huge chip on her shoulder--who also happens to be a marshmallow about her family and her secret self.<br />During a fairly routine hostage situation, Cindy the rookie upstages her own sergeant, not the best of all situations. Although she solves the hostage problem with no blood spilled, she becomes something of a pariah in the tight-knit cop brotherhood. It's not enough that her daddy is a homicide lieutenant, but she is college educated, mouthy, and doesn't know her own place. Or so they think. But is that enough to make HER a hostage? It seems that way, as a mysterious stalker starts to make her life intolerable...and dangerous.<br />I stand by my opinion of this story, even though Cindy is not a likeable character--and I give it a solid five stars.	2003-11-06

And going. And going. It felt like the book grew a chapter or two every day, it was that difficult to plough through.<br />The main plot (and there are several confusing subplots as well) concerns the discovery of a young woman's amazingly well preserved body in a sarcophagus belonging to the Natural History Museum in New York. Or it is the Met? The description of the museums, their histories, their methods of operation, their hidden labyrinthian nooks and crannies, and above all, their rivalries, was somewhat interesting for a while, but halfway into the book, I no longer cared if I ever set foot in a museum again, New York's or otherwise.<br />At any rate, while investigating this murder, Alex and her cohorts, Chapman and Mercer, uncover a lot more than they bargained for. Surprise, surprise. There are plenty of loose ends that are never discussed again...but lucky us, we also get a highly annoying visit to Martha's Vineyard again, for another &quot;girls' weekend out&quot; at Alex's beach house, so we can all feel bad that we are not rich enough to enjoy same--from the perfect food, to the masseuse-for-three, to the luxe accommodations.<br />But what really sent me around the bend was the sidetrack into a soliloquy about September 11. With all due respect for the author's very real feelings about this event, the rest of America has them too. Somehow, the way she described her own real horror (and I certainly do not question her feelings or degrade them in any way), she managed to convey that she and others in her immediate circle were somehow more privy to the grief and horror of that day. I found it gratuitous, and it made me very angry. It had nothing whatsoever to do with the plot, even peripherally, and it rubbed me very much the wrong way.<br />The plot finally wends its weary way to the end, and not a moment too soon, as this reader would willingly have taken the body's place in the sarcophagus just to get away from a character who has become a parody of herself.<br />Perhaps it's time for Fairstein to give Alex Cooper et al. a rest?d me very much the wrong way.<br />The plot finally wends its weary way to the end, and not a moment too soon, as this reader would willingly have taken the body's place in the sarcophagus just to get away from a character who has become a parody of herself.<br />Perhaps it's time for Fairstein to give Alex Cooper et al. a rest?	2003-11-03

She thinks nothing of purchasing a thousand-dollar violin for her 3-year-old, but dresses her daughters in hand-me-downs to save money; she serves truffles and caviar at her dinner parties, but refuses to take a cab. One should hate such people, but the very subtle way in which each is portrayed makes the reader (at least this reader) love them instead.<br />Then there is Merritt, an internationally known writer who can't keep a man to save her life, and Morris, a curmudgeonly scientist who thinks it might be time to get married. Both dear friends of Anne and Charles, they hate each other mightily, but can't seem to find anybody else they like better.<br />Add to the mix a very odd and hilarious assortment of highbrow intellectuals who take themselves oh-so-seriously, and you have a modern-day comedy of manners that reminds one of Henry James.<br />I loved this book. It's not for everybody, but I found it refreshingly different and look forward to the next by this interesting author!	2003-10-30

All that comes afterwards is merely living...not life. Thus, when a married insurance broker, Charles, comes across a newspaper photo of his first love, Sian, his already tense life falls apart.<br />Facing the loss of his business and his home because of the recession in his seaside Rhode Island town, Charles becomes obsessed with reconnecting with his lost love--whom he knew for one week only at a summer camp when he and she were 14 years old. Sian, a poet, is also married with one child--but their connection is so strong that it overwhelms all other reality until it causes ripples that destroy them both.<br />Could this have been avoided? Shreve seems to think not--and the reader is left wondering what possible connection a relationship forged at 14 years old could have on two seemingly intelligent and connected adults. A strange, disturbing story, one that hints at Shreve's later brilliance, but certainly does not contain it.	2003-10-20

Unlike the often boring preachiness of authors like, say, Linda Fairstein in her Alexandra Cooper series, Barnes manages to pack a lot of interesting background and information into this book without once distracting the reader from the plot.<br />And what a plot it is: Carlotta is working two jobs at once, one as an undercover secretary on one of the Dig sites; the other a mysterious missing persons case for a wealthy Boston blueblood. Add in a lot of dogs, a hot new love interest, some spooky rats, and a murder or two, and you've got a fast-paced mystery.<br />I missed some of the regulars in this book: Mooney (mentioned only in passing), Gloria, Sam (some surprises about him, but I won't say what) and--believe it or not--Paolina, although she has not been easy in the last few books. For die-hard readers like me, there is a hidden piece of information about Carlotta's past that completely blew me away--it occurs in a single sentence, and provides a great clue into Carlotta's makeup. If it has been mentioned in earlier books, I certainly missed it. And I have read every one.<br />New readers: This is a good place to start, although you will miss some of the regular characters who make the series tick. Regular readers: Grab this one. You'll love it.	2003-10-17

And &quot;Highland Fling&quot; s the best she has written in years.<br />As always, the plot is pure fluff, and we know from page one that the lead character, a gritty Brit, will save the day. In this book, our heroine is particularly likeable: a thirtysomething, thoroughly modern Londoner who, after being dumped from her dot-com job, has become a &quot;virtual assisant.&quot; In that role, she uses her accounting and business skills to analyze weak businesses for her Internet boss, whom she has never met in person. The job suits her, and apparently suits him too, as she is well paid for her efforts.<br />As the book opens, Jenny is leaving her impossibly boring and stodgy live-in boyfriend, Henry, for the North country--the Scottish Highlands, where she is being sent to investigate a failing family-owned woollen mill. Secretly glad to get out from under Henry's patronizing wing, Jenny rides up north to tackle what she thinks will be a quick and dirty assignment--prove that the books are hopeless, report back to her boss, and drive home  before he closes the mill out from under the family and local employees.<br />But it doesn't qute work out that way. Jenny is drawn into the bosom, so to speak, of the Dalmain family--owners of the mill--whose dowager mother lives very much in the 19th century, whose &quot;laird,&quot; the eldest son, is dating a barmaid, and whose daughter, a spinster in her domineering mother's eyes, is a psychological mess. Jenny gets drawn into the drama, and in no time, is up to her eyeballs in llamas and alpacas as she tries to save the mill.<br />Oh--there's also a tall, handsome, and impossibly rude stranger who brings out all the worst in Jenny...what is Ross Grant doing in Scotland, and why does he make her want to jump out of her skin? I can say no more.<br />As the Brits would say, &quot;Well done, Katie!&quot; This is great fun, and a great read. Pick it up and see for yourself.e for yourself.	2003-10-12

It looks like a cut-and-dried suicide, and only the man's former prestige requires a pro forma police presence to verify the fact. But of course nothing is as it seems.<br />What seems to be the suicide of an aging patriarch, albeit a cult leader, turns out to be much, much more. And the disciples in this particular cult, most notably Venus, Pluto and Bob (yes, Bob!), are not exactly the godly unworldly beings they appear to be before their followers. Amid the white robes, robot-like followers, and spartan cells exists an undercurrent of intense evil that threatens to boil over at any moment.<br />Kellerman freely borrows some of her plot from real-life cult situations like Jonestown, and says so (as Peter Decker frequently compares various situations within the cult to others from the past), so there is no attempt on her part to con the reader, something I greatly appreciated.<br />While Decker tiptoes around the increasingly volatile cult situation, there is also a situation at home, one I found annoying because it had no resolution. The younger son, Jacob, is straining against the bonds of his very orthodox religion, and is starting to rebel. The way Decker and Rina handle this situation went against the grain with me--I find the two boys too good for the real world, and it bothers me as a reader. Rina's religion is a given, and makes her what she is, but it is also completely rigid where her boys are concerned. This is probably true to life, but does not make for a good plot line, because it is very hard to understand unless one lives within the world of the very religious. The worst part, though, is that the situation, which is very grave, is solved in one sentence at the very end of the book, or at least seems to be solved. Because of that, I took a point off what should have been a five-star story.<br />On the other hand, the last 50 pages of this book had me completely mesmerized, unable to turn the pages fast enough. The ending was masterful, and left this reader, at least, questioning just how human the human race is. This is a good, solid read and I recommend it highly.the situation, which is very grave, is solved in one sentence at the very end of the book, or at least seems to be solved.

If, however, you are an Alex Cross groupie like me and you'll read all about him no matter what, this book will entertain you despite the flaws in the plot.<br />As the book opens, Alex is still pondering his future. Does he remain as a homicide cop? Does he join the FBI? Does he quit the crime game and become a straight psychologist? All of this soul-searching is very familiar to regular readers of the series--and it's getting a tad old at this point. No matter, though. Alex is such a likeable person, we're rooting for him anyway. So when his dear friend Sampson shows up with just &quot;one more case&quot; for Alex, we nod knowingly.<br />Soon, Alex and Sampson are embroiled in a series of ghastly murders that are seemingly unconnected--except that innocent men, most notably one of Sampson's dearest army buddies--are taking the heat and going to Death Row. Each has been set up--or says he has--complete with planted murder weapon and DNA! The reader knows almost immediately who is really doing the murders, but Sampson and Alex and nonplussed. Hence the story.<br />Before long, we learn more than we ever wanted to about long-ago atrocities in Vietnamese villages; the vagaries of some members of the U.S. military; and the secret underground that can't let go of the past. Does it all make sense? No. Does the conclusion solve all the loose ends? No. But we have plenty of Nana Mama, the kids, new love interests for both Sampson and Alex--and a need to read still more about Alex Cross, loose plot or not. Definitely three and a half stars, and a fun read.	2003-09-30

As I mentioned in reviews of Barnes' earlier works in the series, she has attained maturity and depth, both in her characters and her plots, and it all comes together in this book.<br />As those who follow the series know, PI and part-time cab driver Carlotta is a volleyball fanatic as well, playing at the local Y whenever she can. So when one of her team members, a woman she knows only from the games and casually at that, asks for her professional help, Carlotta accepts. In no time, she is drawn into the cruel murder of Gwen's nursing charge: a seemingly harmless elderly woman. Carlotta being Carlotta, she cannot let the murder go, even though her police pals, notably her mentor Mooney, are on the case. And what she discovers leads into a labyrinth of the art world, the music industry and more.<br />Tied in with this interesting plot is the ongoing story of Paolina, Carlotta's Little Sister. For those reviewers who cannot understand Paolinia in her present highly obnoxious condition, I say go to the mall and take a look at the typical 14-year-old girl! Not the best age in any circumstances for the average female, and certainly not for one whose mother has suddenly abandoned her completely. Is she a rotten brat throughout the book? YES! Will Carlotta be able to get her through this phase and see her to adulthood? That's every mother's question and fear--and I found it completely believable. What was not so believable was the transformation of the mother, Marta, from a very sick woman disabled by arthritis to a sexy vamp on the prowl for men. This transformation was explained in a sentence or two, and sat badly with me throughout the rest of the book. But it did not ruin the story.<br />There is very little of the wonderful Gloria in this book, and not enough Mooney or Sam Gianelli (all regulars throughout the series), but there is more than enough of Roz, the impossibly erotic free spirit who inhabits Carlotta's rental roooms.<br />All in all, a simply great addition to the series.

I'd now like to go back and read her entire Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series, mainly because I could not put this book down, and secondly because I'm curious about their relationship--which has to be the mark of a good storyteller!<br />The plot is one of those that grabs you by the throat on the very first page, and never lets go. It begins in a tony upscale Los Angeles restaurant where suddenly, and without warning, a gunman sprays the diners with bullets, killing 13 and wounding 33 others. It's a horrible scene of mindless carnage, and LAPD homicide detective Peter Decker is beside himself with rage--and flashbacks to his own experiences in Vietnam years before.<br />As the police begin their routine investigation, they turn up some clues that are far from routine. Was this horrible atrocity part of a murder for hire scheme? Who of the many patrons that night was the intended target? Decker, obsessed with the situation, begins to doggedly investigate--and finds himself accused of sexual harassment in a situation that might cost him his badge and his marriage.<br />Great story, great characters---I want more!	2003-09-20

In addition, I find some of the APA's requirements (particularly in the references, which have their own unique style quite unlike most others) incomprehensible.<br />That having been said, this book is a must for those who want to be published by the APA, and those who are editing for same. Once it has been read many times, and key passages put to memory, it is not as hard to understand--but it shouldn't be so hard. The section on figures and tables, however, is a truly excellent primer, for any professional writer, not just those in the health care professions.<br />My grade: C plus.	2003-09-16

And not just painters--It seems the murderer is targeting anybody who has just had a break. Thus, longtime bluesman Baby Boy, in obscurity for decades and suddenly once again in the spotlight, is found gutted in a filthy alleyway. A promising young pianist who finally makes his public debut is found seemingly dispatched. An up-and-coming ballet dancer in Boston is given the same treatment: Is she part of the same picture? And what is going on in the head of the perp?<br />Figuring that out is where Alex comes in, as always. He struggles to put together a viable profile as the murders keep on coming. And in the process, he meets with a whole collection of bizarre people who could only live in Los Angeles.<br />Adding to the pleasure of the read is the return of Petra Connor, Milo's sometime colleague and a primary on this case. Petra's been given a new partner, the silent, spooky &quot;man in black,&quot; Eric Stahl. This guy is so weird I spent half the book thinking HE was the murderer. Alex's ex Robin is also part of the plot--she knew Baby Boy--enough to be mentioned on the liner notes of one of his CDs. And then there's Alex's new love interest, the lovely shrink Allison, who has to used all her skills to overcome the feelings Alex still has for his former love.<br />All in all, a satisfying book. I recommend it!	2003-09-14

Scott Fitzgerald, one of the premiere authors in American Literature. But, having recently read an eye-opening biography of Zelda Fitzgerald, wherein I learned that F. Scott had purloined many of Zelda's writings verbatim to use in his own novels, I felt compelled to reread this work.<br />I always considered \\"Tender Is the Night\\" to be Fitzgerald's finest work, unlike most Fitzgerald scholars, who lean toward \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" I am no scholar, nor do I pretend to be, but to me, \\"Tender Is the Night\\" was always the most mature and most tragic--and showed a greater insight into Fitzgerald's psyche than perhaps he meant to show.<br />The thinly veiled story of his tragic marriage to Zelda, the story takes place in all their real-life stomping grounds, from the Riviera to Paris to Switzerland--with a few side trips to the United States. In the story, Dick Diver, a prominent psychiatrist, is the protagonist. His wife, the beautiful, fey and often mad Nicole, is Zelda. As they aimlessly flit from place to place (the Fitzgeralds, and thus the fictional Divers, were the original \\"beautiful people\\"), the scholarly and noble (oh, so noble!) Dr. Diver begins to disintegrate under the weight of caring for a mentally ill but outwardly quite normal wife. In the end,it is he, not her, who is destroyed.<br />There is a lot of anger in this book, and still more, almost unbearable pathos. I still think it is brilliant--a work of art in words. And I found, as I was reading, that I didn't really care which words were Zelda's and which were Scott's. As in real life, they formed a tragic whole--bent on destroying themselves and each other--and this book shows Scott's clear-eyed insight into that fact.<br />The art is the tragedy--and the tragedy is the art. My admiration of F. Scott Fitzerald, and the lovely and lost Zelda, remains intact.	2003-09-11

Meanwhile, down on the home front, Eve and Roarke's relationship is better than ever (this is one of the main draws of the series, to my mind) as Eve savors the last days without her hated adversary Summerset, the major domo (butler!) of Roarke's estate, who was sent on vacation in the last book.<br />Peabody and McNab have made a &quot;mag&quot; and major decision, which has Peabody in a tizzy as she studies for her detective's exam. Will she make it? And Mavis and Leonardo are busy garbing Mavis in outrageous maternity clothes that only she could wear--and only he could design.<br />Absolutely a winner.

But she has a strange house guest, a native Japanese student, to contend with--as well as the ardent courtship of her long-time boyfriend, the sexy Scots lawyer Hugh Glendinning.<br />While contending with the usual East-West contradictions of her everyday life, Rei is contenting herself with researching and writing her family's history. But she uncovers more than she bargained for when it turns out that her grandfather actually tutored Emperor Hirohito--and may have been part of a right-wing Japanese political group that fostered the ultimate events of World War II. Now Rei has to face the Japan of the War, and contrast it with the modern-day Japan, her much-beloved adopted country--and the country of her father.<br />Add to that the top-secret case that Hugh is working on, which concerns reparations for Japanese war crimes, and one gets an idea of Rei's state of mind. For the first time, she becomes distant from her father and her family as she searches her soul for who she really is.<br />The answer is there, and always has been, for the enchanted reader to see--and when Rei ultimately finds herself, there is a wonderful treat in store for her and for us.	2003-09-04

It has been six years since proper upper-class housewife Vanessa, maverick Jamie, who has emigrated to the U.S., and much-younger, dumpy and silent Phil have been together. They find they have inherited their beloved family home, Calder, but are horrified to find the ugly and disfiguring changes to the fine old estate that their late stepmother has wrought.<br />Now they must make some heavy decisions about what to do with the house, how to divide the spoils, whether or not to sell, and all kinds of other practical and emotional matters. The problem is that each of the sisters is at a personal crisis in her life, and none of them is able or willing to share these crises with the others.<br />The most well-rounded of the sisters is Jaime, who escaped her unhappy childhood to build a successful PR business in Seattle. But something big is troubling her--and the reader learns her problems before she can bring herself to share with her sisters. Vanessa, so brittle and shallow on the outside, is in an equally desperate situation, one that she cannot even admit to herself. And Phil, the &quot;baby&quot; who is nevertheless in her thirties, will not let either of her two sisters even close to her own secret.<br />This book is lovely--a solid read and a good story. It's not great literature, nor was it meant to be--but it's a heartwarmer nevertheless. Recommended.	2003-09-02

The home base is Drumveyn, a family seat fairly crumbling under the moldy tapestry of its ancient past--and the borderline cruel rules and regulations of the domineering father, Sir Charles Napier, who has just died when the book opens. Charles' widow, Madeleine, is a forty-something attractive woman whose true nature has been beaten down over the years not only by her husband, but by her horrid (and thankfully dead) mother-in-law, Lady Napier, and even the servants.<br />Madeleine's life is stifling, which is why her two married children have long-ago escaped the home front. But suddenly, everything changes, as circumstances bring first an orphaned aristocratic South American child, and then a surprisingly refreshing cast of characters, to Drumveyn. Madeleine begins to come alive--and the resulting story is wonderful. I was sad when the book ended, and glad to know that Raife has written a sequel, which I missed, and plan to order immediately!	2003-09-02

Scott Fitzgerald, most particularly \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"Tender Is the Night.\\" And like many others of my ilk, I fell madly in love with the legend that was the Fitzgeralds. I went on to read everything I could get my hands on, from Scott's collected short stories to \\"The Beautiful and the Damned\\" to \\"This Side of Paradise\\" to the tragically unfinished \\"The Last Tycoon.\\"<br />Through all of my Fitzgerald worship, I viewed Zelda as an \\"also-ran\\"--the madcap flapper, the passionate spouse and lover, the quintessential \\"roaring 20s girl,\\" the great beauty who was her husband's muse-until she went crazy. I never took her seriously as an artist in her own right, and why should I have done so? Certainly until recent years, no biography of Fitzgerald painted her that way, and I found the few biographies of Zelda opinionated and suspect.<br />Now, with a fascinating work that took author Kendall Taylor 30 years (!!) to write, the tragedy that was Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald finally comes to light as never before. And for the first time, I realize that the incredibly brilliant prose that made up Scott's novels was often lifted VERBATIM from Zelda's most intimate and personal diaries, which Scott viewed as his own property, to be purloined at will. I find that some of his most cunning and original turn of phrase was taken VERBATIM from Zelda's unique, brilliant, colorful, and wholly her own way of speaking (probably, in fact, a precurser of the schizophrenia that was to overtake her). I find that Scott was so possessive of Zelda as his SOURCE that he actively forbade her to write on her own, although she showed great talent. He went so far as to write long letters to her various doctors forbidding them to allow her to write, and they agreed to do so! A highly creative, completely unique human being, Zelda was thwarted at every turn, whether her painting (which Scott ridiculed) her sad attempts to become a prima ballerina (equally ridiculed and the final step to her first breakdown) to anything else she attempted to do.<br />Scott, a difficult, vain, selfish and jealous human being, viewed Zelda as more than his lover and wife, as more than his helpmate and muse. He felt he owned the very words that fell from her mouth, and strongly resisted any attempt on her part to express herself apart from him, feeling that their mutual story belonged to him and him alone, as the novelist and breadwinner.<br />We all know the end of the story. Scott died much too young of heart disease and TB brought on by acute alcoholism. Zelda, in and out of mental hospitals from her late twenties on, died in a horrible fire at the institution where she was housed.

I simply could not imagine such a topic holding my interest for more than five seconds, Trollope or not.<br />But it did.<br />Far from being the dismal plot described above, it turns out to be probably one of Joanna Trollope's very best, both in the writing and the plotting. Yes, it does take place in a boys' school, which is closely affiliated  with the town's cathedral. The main characters are all quite Britishly normal, thank you, and not a bit precious. On the contrary. We have a runaway wife who always returns, a bored-stiff housewife (mother of a choir boy) who begins a torrid affair, four utterly horrid teenaged and twenty-ish offspring of the cathedral's long-suffering dean, and much, much more.<br />When a group of disaffected socialist (seriously) townspeople decides that the choir is antiquated and must go, that the headmaster's house must be sold out from him and his family and made into a town social hall, and that the catherdral, the deanery, and everything in between is a haven for the rich, the close-knit and relatively peaceful community is torn apart. Trollope's skill, as always, is in somehow effortlessly drawing us into the real feelings and anguish of very ordinary people who become less ordinary as they face the crises of their lives. In that, she is like her ancestor, the great English novelist of the 19th century, Anthony Trollope. Unlike any other of Joanna Trollope's books, this one most closely reminds this reviewer of the senior novelist's brilliant works.<br />As always, the end is not a happily ever after, but, as the British say, a &quot;sorting out&quot; of feelings, personalities, and lives. Some come out the better--others collapse.<br />&quot;The Choir&quot; is simply a wonderfully written work of art, and I am glad to have read it, and doubly glad to be able to recommend it to any reader who loves a finely drawn novel.e to recommend it to any reader who loves a finely drawn novel.	2003-07-19

Seth, the youngest brother in the popular Chesapeake Bay trilogy, was about 14 years old when the series ended, and everybody (including this reviewer) wanted to know what happened to him when he grew up.<br />Nora obliges us diehards in this wonderful novel, which takes up where the others left off. We meet Seth as a gorgeous, sexy (what else?) and famous artist, who has returned home to his roots on the Chesapeake Bay to join his brothers and family--and also to try to escape a terrible secret.<br />No sooner does Seth set foot on his old stomping grounds than he meets the lovely Drusilla, proprietor of a new flower shop--and a blueblood escaping her own little secrets. As in all Roberts novels, their eyes meet--sparks fly--and the reader is drawn into a hot, steamy love affair with just enough conflict to make it truly interesting.<br />\\"Chesapeake Blue\\" is true to the Roberts format her fans have come to know and love. It uncovers no new ground, and is not particularly imaginative or breathtaking, as some of her other works can be. But it tells the story of Seth, and tells it well enough for all of Nora's fans to turn the last page with a smile and a sigh.<br />Dear Nora: Now can we have a sequel about Seth's as-yet unborn children?	2003-07-14

The parents are so much fun, they almost detract from the story at hand: Rei has been chosen to accompany a priceless collection of kimono from Japan to a prestigious museum in Washington, D.C. It's a job that not only pays well, but will ensure Rei's reputation in the rarified world of antiques in which she works.<br />But--Rei being Rei--she is no sooner on American soil than things go from bad to worse, from a murder to a shocking theft to her own horrible encounter with the Washington police--where they accuse her of being a prostitute!<br />As Rei tries to solve the murder, retrieve the stolen artifact, deal with her overprotective parents and complete her lectures at the museum, she also finds herself overcome by a love interest she thought she had forgotten. All of this makes for fascinating reading, especially the detailed explanation of the ritual adornment of the kimono, whose every fold and tie holds a deep meaning.<br />As with the other four books in this series, I could hardly put &quot;The Bride's Kimono&quot; down, and felt a keen sense of loss when I finished the last page. I sincerely hope that Ms. Massey continues this series for some time to come!	2003-07-10

Since I grew up in Los Angeles, I find the endless mention of street names fascinating. I can see, however, that the ploy, if it is one, could become incredibly annoying incredibly fast for the general reader.<br />The fast-paced plot concerns the brutal murder of a gorgeous young woman whom psychologist/amateur detective Alex Delaware had treated briefly in her teenaged years. When his good friend, homicide detective Milo, asks Alex to assist on the case, Alex finds himself moved to tears. The murder was particularly ugly, and the girl was memorably smart and beautiful. Alex becomes obsessed with the case, and soon finds himself embroiled in a string of murderous events that lead straight to the mansion of a Hugh Hefner-type playboy.<br />It is the Hefner-type character that, frankly, really bothered me and led me to bestow only three stars on the book. I don't know how Kellerman got away with his thinly disguised portrait of a soft-porn magazine publisher who lives in a huge Malibu mansion that hosts high-profile parties with lots of pretty girls on the premises. Not only that, the publisher of \\"Duke Enterprises\\" has put his adult daughter in place as CEO, and has divorced his young and beautiful wife, who still lives on the Duke estate with their two young children. Ohhhkayyyyyy....Um...who is kidding whom here? Although Kellerman gives a nodding mention of the \\"real\\" Hugh Hefner as a separate entity, there is no mistaking the in-your-face coincidence. It makes for a more interesting story, but it's kind of a cheap shot, at least in this reviewer's eyes.<br />Nevertheless, the murder gets solved in the end, with all the customary twists and turns along the way--even though Delaware severely strains his relationship with his significant other, the lovely artist Robin.<br />I won't stop reading Kellerman after finishing this book, but I do not expect a true mind-bending mystery either. Like I said--the book is lighweight. But fun.along the way--even though Delaware severely strains his relationship with his significant other, the lovely artist Robin.<br />I won't stop reading Kellerman after finishing this book, but I do not expect a true mind-bending mystery either.

It is so completely different, so calming and yet so very interesting at the same time, that at last I can use the word \\"unique\\" without spouting a cliche.<br />In this, the fourth book in the Rei Shimura series, our heroine, half Japanese, half American, is up to her kimono in trouble, as usual. Deciding to supplement her antiques business by writing a monthly column in The Gaijin, a newspaper largely read by foreigners in Japan, she learns to her dismay that the publisher is about to change the format. Instead of Rei's usual scholarly works, he wants her (and the others on the staff) to write in the form of a \\"manga,\\" the wildly popular Japanese comic books.<br />Rei, who doesn't even know what a manga is, is quickly drawn into the fascinating, almost cultish world of Japanese animation and comic books--where obsessive fans think nothing of walking the streets dressed as their favorite character(s), and where would-be comic book artists are encouraged to draw their own versions of their favorites with no fear of reprisal from the publishing companies.<br />Rei's submersion into this sub-world leads her, of course, straight to a murder. With her tenacious American side battling  her demure Japanese side, Rei throws herself into the mystery in typical fashion--and winds up embroiled in the feared Japanese underworld.<br />Simply a delight from start to finish...this series is perfect for summertime reading!	2003-06-30

Not that anything she writes is bad, but this one is simply classic Nora, along the lines of \\"Sanctuary\\" and others of her best works.<br />Simply put (there are lots of satisfying plot lines to sort out), feisty and beautiful Callie Dunbrook, a thirty-something archaeologist, begins work on what promises to be one of the decade's major finds--smack in the middle of the Civil War town of Antietam Creek--and discovers much more than bones and artifacts. A shocking truth about her past, combined with the equally shocking appearance at the dig of her ex-husband, anthropologist Jake Graystone, has her in a turmoil.<br />As Callie and Jake struggle to work together without letting their equally hot tempers explode in the stifling heat, the mystery of Callie's past threatens to surround and destroy everything they are working for and everything they are. And they are only two of a group of equally engrossing people, both on the dig and off.<br />Absolutely first-rate Nora, and the perfect beach book. Buy it and give yourself a real summer treat.	2003-06-23

With this third, and best, addition to the series, I think I have found one, although it hardly describes the talent of the writer: delicate.<br />Exquisite delicacy, akin to the ikebana arrangements described in this book, is the hallmark of Massey's wonderful mysteries. Imagine murder, mayhem, forensics, and all the rest of the usual crime-novel/mystery genre told in a setting of kimono, cherry blossoms, the aforementioned ikebana and the constant east-west conflict of the heroine, and you have a slight idea of just how different these books are--and just how delightful.<br />This story finds half Japanese-half American Rei Shimura thriving as an antiques dealer, despite the end of her tumultuous relationship with Scotsman Hugh Glendinning. Dragged to her aunt's ikebana school for lessons (as part of her aunt's ongoing project--making Rei comfortable with her Japanese side), Rei soon stumbles on a murder. And not just any murder. This is as bloody as any samurai killing--but in place of the sword, the fatal weapon is a pair of ikebana scissors. Who among the genteel, proper women at the school could have committed such an atrocity? And most of all, why?<br />As Rei sets out to solve the mystery, she is threatened by all sorts of hostile influences, from a radical pro-environmentalist organization to a sinister and unseen writer of threatening haiku--to her own treacherous heart, as she finds herself drawn to the handsome son of the school's chairman.<br />It all makes for a fascinating and utterly wonderful mystery. This is a series not to be missed!	2003-06-17

This man, who murders with impunity, has been nicknamed \\"The Conjurer\\" for good reason. He seems to be able to change his looks, his identity (down to the fingerprints), his methods of murder, his vehicles, and his residences faster than Rhyme--something of a magician himself in the forensic world--can keep up with him.<br />Logic is a religion with Rhyme, as regular readers of the series well know. And his frustration level becomes almost as unbearable as his paraplegic condition as he pits his keen mind against a man who seems literally ephemeral. The Conjurer is always one step ahead, one fiendish trick at a time. By the time Rhyme figures out the method behind the murderous madness, the Conjurer is up to another trick.<br />At the same time, Sachs, equally frustrated with the case, is trying to earn her detective's license. Has her typically impatient behavior on the Conjurer case lost her the coveted badge? Is Rhyme in mortal danger from his unseen foe? And most of all...can the Conjurer be stopped?<br />The plot barrels along at top speed, with loose ends being tied together equally quickly toward the end. My only small criticism of the book is that well-worn device...when a narrator solves the puzzle...\\"and so you see, my friends, the crime was committed THIS way.\\" Nevertheless, all is not as it seems. Deaver is much too clever to bow to cliche. And so is the Conjurer. Not to mention Rhyme.<br />Another winner in the series. I hope Deaver keeps this up for a long, long time!	2003-06-11

We meet him as a young man, we see him (via flashbacks) as a teenager, and we follow him all the way to his late 40s, and the bemusement never changes, never alters, and frankly my dear, grows VERY OLD very quickly. Gosh, people, Larry is a person on this earth! Everything causes him wonder...from his choice of words to his hair, to his brain, to his penis. Nevermind that this sweet naif has a very successful life as a landscape artist who specializes in intricate mazes (oooh! a metaphor!). He is simply a bewildered soul.&lt;P[...].<br />My third strong objection to the book is in its style. At first, I liked it. As Shields starts each new chapter of Larry's life, she explains, as though we do not already know it, who the main characters are, and where Larry has come from. By the middle of the book, this was annoying in the extreme. By the end, it was hard to take...but was only one of the things I couldn't stand.<br />My final objection is Larry's constant minute attention to the aging process, which begins long before he even reaches his thirties. Show me a man in his sixties, who perhaps has real problems with aging, and I might pay attention. This just got on my nerves.<br />I rarely react this strongly to a book, but the only reason I finished it was so I could write an honest review, and because Carol Shields is so very highly regarded. I guess I simply missed the point.	2003-06-02

So I had very little expectation level when a friend at work begged me to read this book.<br />I found it well-written, fun to read, riveting, and intelligent--albeit a tad confusing (I kept having to look back to make sure the suspects were who I remembered they were). I read it in a couple of days, and came away intent on reading the next in Kellerman's Alex Delaware series. Therefore, I was very surprised to see that this offering only earned an overall three-star rating from other reviewers. Yes, it's fast-paced, and therefore, the relationships Alex has with his wife Robin and even his friend Milo seem superficial, but that did not bother me overmuch. Some of the characters were fairly improbable, but these days, all I have to do is turn on Court TV to see the same types.<br />Having read so many, many books in this genre, some of them real stinkers, I think that's a low rating. But, as admitted above, I have not read any OTHER Kellermans, so compared with himself, he may not have done his best work here. I'll know when I read more of his work--and I definitely want to read more.	2003-06-01

She now lives in luxury with her lover, Hugh Glendenning, the Scots lawyer--but as always, her simple Japanese side is at war with her American side over the opulence of their apartment. She has given up her lowly job, and is now selling antiques, her lifelong dream. Her Japanese side allows her entree into the most conservative of Japanese homes, while her American side allows her to bargan cannily for the best price.<br />Such is the situation when we happily meet Ms. Shimura again in \\"Zen Attitude.\\" She has been hired on consignment by a major player in the antiques world, the formidable Nana Mihori. One antiquing coup with Mihori can set Shimura up for life. Therefore, when she finds the quintessential \\"tansu,\\" a ceremonial chest of drawers worth millions of yen, Ms. Shimura is overjoyed. She spends way too much on behalf of her client, has the priceless piece delivered to her own apartment--and then finds out to her horror that it is a fake.<br />And that's just the beginning. Throw in Hugh's majorly cool but spoiled rotten brother Angus, who will smoke anything and everything in sight; a hip young car salesman who may or may not be a serial killer; a buddhist temple run by the Mihoris but seemingly fraught with evil; and the overly macho, very scary daughter of the Mihori clan, and you have but a taste of the adventures to come. All I will say here is...all is NOT what it seems.<br />This series is a find. An absolute treasure. I cannot wait to ready the next, and recommend Ms. Massey's unique, deceptively zenlike series to anybody who likes the truly different.	2003-05-24

Impatient and haughty Rhyme must learn whole new ways of facing life as he is unwillingly drawn into the &quot;tao of life&quot; by a Chinese cop, one of the few survivors of the fatal voyage. And Sachs must do her usual job while hiding a sad secret.<br />What gives the story its depth is the constant &quot;yin and yang&quot;--Rhyme needing to absorb and work with the very different Asian way of solving crimes while still using his New York moxie (all in a wheelchair); Sachs and Rhyme juggling their relationship against dual personal problems (Rhyme's upcoming operation and Sach's secret); and Eastern justice meted out secretly--and horribly--on U.S. shores.<br />This is a fascinating and fast-paced book, not to be missed for fans of the series.	2003-05-15

It opens, however, in Paris, where the beautiful, fey, and slightly muddled Emma Litton awaits her plane back to England. Having spent many years in France as a nanny, Emma now yearns for her homeland--and the fulfillment of a desire that has obviously been with her all her life: She wishes to bond with her famous artist father, Ben.<br />Emma's sudden and unexpected meeting at the airport with her step-brother Cristo, whom she knew during one of Ben's brief marriages, but has not seen in many years, allows us to see her needy and sensitive side, even as others observe only a hip young Sixties mod.<br />The remainder of the brief book takes place in her father's studio-cum-cottage on the seaside, as Emma settles in as daughter, housekeeper, muse, and, eerily, almost as a wife to her elusive father. Will it work? Can Emma get over her childlike fantasy of being Daddy's Little Girl and get on with her life? Will she notice the worthy young man whose heart she has captured? Or will she lose him too in her fruitless desire to create the family she never had?<br />Without the deep substance of her later books, nevertheless, this sweet Pilcher offering is well worth reading--especially when narrated by Sian Thomas, who captures the quiet, brooding tone just right.<br />I recommend this lovely tale to all Pilcher fans.	2003-05-11

The first in the Rei Shimura series, it is entirely original--something akin to a traditional Japanese tea ceremony with some good old American moxie thrown in.<br />Rei Shimura is the cherished twentysomething daughter of mixed-heritage wealthy parents. Her father is Japanese, her mother is American, and Rei is an uneasy mixture of both. She has stubbornly chosen to make her own way in Tokyo as a teacher of English to Japanese businessmen in a corporation. Rei, however, is far from the corporate type. She lives by choice in a dicey neighborhood with an openly gay male companion, the delightful Richard. Her passion is antiques, but she can afford very few. Her clothes are shabby, but not chic. And her hair is unfashionably short, which causes quite a bit of comment, most of it negative, among conservative Japanese.<br />When Rei takes a much-needed vacation to a ski resort, her warring sensibilities are even more heightened. She loves the ritual of the bath, she loves the zen-like meals and atmosphere of the hotel at which she is staying--but when the beautiful wife of a Japanese businessman is found mysteriously dead on the premises, Rei's impatient American nature leaps to the fore. Convinced it was murder, Rei feels compelled to solve it, at her own considerable risk and that of her unlikely \\"partner in crime,\\" a Scottish lawyer named Hugh Glendenning.<br />Even as she is increasingly attracted to the Scotsman, Rei wonders: Did he have something to do with the death of the woman? Was he her lover? Is he friend or is he foe--and what in the world can she do to squelch her growing desire for this highly unsuitable man?<br />All the answers come in good time...to the great delight of this reader, who has already ordered the next in the series. Very highly recommended!	2003-05-07

Young and beautiful, she saves lives on a daily basis with a cool efficiency in the operating room that belies her inner, carefully controlled compassion. But her nerves are about to be tested to the max. For Rennie was the forewoman on the jury at the trial of the cold and spooky Lozada, a hitman par excellence. And the jury acquitted. Now, Lozada is stalking Rennie in the vile belief that she is his soulmate.<br />Maverick ex-copy Wick Threadgill (Brown is always so good with names--where does she get them?) has had his own brush with Lozada, more than once. When we meet him, he's lost in Margaritaville--in this case, a seedy apartment on the Gulf in Galveston, Texas. Sexy Wick is one moody, volatile guy. He's lost his only brother to Lozada, and it has thrown him into a tailspin that has forced his temporary suspension from the force.<br />When Wick is asked by his close friend and fellow cop Oren Wesley to investigate the murder of a surgeon who practiced at Rennie's hospital, the stage is set for a deadly triangle: Bad boy Wick, Rennie, who may or may not have murdered her colleague, and Lozada--who definitely may have had something to do with it.<br />The sparks fly, the sexual tension strains to the breaking point, and distrust abounds as Wick and Rennie, polar opposites in every way, reluctantly join forces to trap Lozada. And the reader is along for every step of the way.	2003-04-20

This has been going on since the Seventies. Some of the books, like Anne Tyler's \\"Ladder of Years,\\" are better than others. \\"The Pull of the Moon\\" belongs at the very bottom of the heap.<br />Nan is 50. She's having a mid-life crisis. So she runs away to \\"find herself\\" (ACK!), which means taking her very healthy credit cards and leaving her cushy suburban life. Along the way, as she \\"discovers life\\" on the road, she narrates her self-discoveries to her husband, Martin, in a series of increasingly cloying letters. About halfway through the book, the mere words \\"Dear Martin\\" had me in a frenzy of anticipated boredom. My sympathies were with Martin through and through.<br />So, you are wondering, what's so terrible? Maybe it's a cliched plot, but so what? Well Nan's little \\"adventures\\" are so unbelievable as to be beyond laughable. She storms into a strange beauty parlor and demands to have her long, beautiful hair stripped of color back to its original grey. She strikes up truly bizarre (in my opinion) conversations with every weirdo she can find. She knocks on strangers' doors and gets invited in to tea (yeah, right). She meets a young man who has lost his young wife, and, although they are complete strangers, he sobs in her arms and asks to brush her hair (I won't even mention what happens in between). She takes her sleeping bag into the woods, strips naked, and then decides to lie spread-eagled in the dirt to \\"experience the earth.\\" Luckily for Nan, the stalkers, rapists and other nice people of the evening weren't interested that night.<br />Along the way, rarely, there are some pithy comments about motherhood, wifehood, and growing older. But they were buried in this ridiculous plot. By the end, I was talking back to the book. Nan, we knew ye all too well. Yuck!l too well. Yuck!	2003-04-16

So it is for me will ALL of Shreve's books. She is a fine and talented writer with enormous skill with the written word.<br />But this book has so much more than skill with words. Like all Shreve's books, it draws the reader in so deeply and completely that all of the characters, all of the moods, the essences, and the time and place, become part of one's shared experience until the book is finished. In this case, the time is the 20s, just before the Stock Market Crash. It's a time of highs and lows in every aspect of life: from the New England mining families living under unspeakable poverty (and powerless to fight the mine owners who are in effect starving them) to the extremely rich who are riding on the tremendous highs of the Stock Market. In one case, it's wearing one's sister's ruffled sweater when one is a boy--and trying to hide it under a too-small jacket with a broken zipper. On the other hand, it is speakeasies, &quot;Sidecars&quot; (the popular drink of the day), gin out of silver flasks, and endless parties.<br />The Crash levels the playing field. And profound changes occur, both in the world at large, and in the personalities and livelihoods of our main characters, from a newlywed living with her typewriter-salesman husband in a fixed-up old house on the beach, to the wealthy party girl who watches her friends and her lover go belly-up overnight.<br />Behind this already fascinating story is another one--the story of an attempt to create a union of miners, and to effect a great strike--one that will net the poor mining workers a decent wage and let them live like humans instead of dogs (a phrase used more than once in the book).<br />The portent of frightening things to come hovers like the beach fog over the entire story. The reader knows, with growing anxiety, that something bad is going to happen. But what? When? And above all, why? The denoument comes as a complete shock, as most of Shreve's novels do...and this is not a book to be lightly tossed aside while we start a fun mystery. It is haunting and will not leave the reader long after it is finished. Another Shreve masterpiece.pen. But what? When? And above all, why?

She considered it the finest book ever written. While I might quarrel with that hyperbole, I do in fact list it in my own personal top ten. I, too, re-read it, in my case, every few years. And of course I was riveted to the brilliant BBC production starring Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder.<br />Imagine my delight, then, when I found this unabridged reading by Irons himself! My delight was rewarded. Irons' perfect reading of this book opened up a whole new world for me. This time, I heard and felt the absolute poetry of Waugh's words--his ability to take his reader from sultry ... summertime to the slums of the Casbah to a storm at sea that is the perfect metaphor for the turmoil to come. Waugh never wasted a word. Never said more than he had to say. Never helped the reader by sugarcoating the story. And the result was breathtaking.<br />Maybe because I was listening this time rather than reading, I paid much more attention this time to the book's main theme, religion versus humanity. Can one exist without the other? Does one destroy the other? How far can one stray when bound by the \\"invisible thread\\"? Waugh's very personal and moving tale of upper-class Catholics in a Protestant country is a brilliant affirmation of faith, and at the same time, a bitter acknowledgement of the price that faith can exact.<br />I cannot say enough about this recording, which brings all the best of Waugh to the fore even more so than the written word.	2003-04-04

There were times when I had to put it down, only to snatch it up again because the tension of leaving the story was too great. Now THAT'S a book!<br />The story begins with the unlikely duo traveling to North Carolina, where Rhyme is scheduled to undergo a risky and largely experimental surgical procedure that may restore some of his ability to move. As a paraplegic who can only move his head and one finger, it's worth the risk. To Sachs, who loves him just the way he is, it's folly.<br />Before their separate views on the subject can explode, however, the two are asked into a local case involving a very strange teenaged murderer/kidnapper known as \\"Insect Boy\\" for very good reason. Where are the two women he has kidnapped? Are they alive, and if so, for how long? How deadly is the boy whose best friends live in hornets' nests?<br />Rhyme, as usual, cannot forego a good forensic mystery. And, as usual, Sachs acts as his \\"legs\\" at the various crime scenes. But Sachs sees more to the Insect Boy than anybody else--enough to uncharacteristically drop her guard. Can Rhyme save her in time? Or is his own life in danger? Those near and dear to him are in terribly grave danger (no pun intended) and only his brilliant mind can save them--and himself.<br />I gave this book four stars after much thought, because I thought it was a bit slower to build. But once it did--whew! Another fabulous page-turner from Deaver.	2003-04-04

Don't let the slow beginning fool you. \\"Flashback\\" is the best Nevada Barr book since \\"Deep South.\\" This time around, Anna, sans dog and erstwhile fiancee Paul, is stationed for a brief time on the Dry Tortugas--the southernmost point of the Florida Keys, and therefore of the United States.<br />It should be a quiet, sleepy respite for Anna, who is filling in for the regular ranger--a man who has gone inexplicably mad. But then--where Anna goes, trouble follows, and this outing is no exception. In very short order, Anna, too, begins to fear she is losing her mind. There are ghosts that appear and disappear, flashing lights that cannot be, noises that may or may not be real, and the reality of the spooky Civil War fort that makes up the national park may just serve to take Anna's sanity away for good.<br />Told against this very interesting backdrop is another story entirely--that of Anna's ancestor Raffia Coleman, wife of the Civil War Union commander of the fort, which in those days housed Confederate prisoners, not the least of whom was the notorious Dr. Mudd, accused of helping to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. Through a series of letters written by Raffia (and sent to Anna by her sister Molly), a dark and brooding mystery unfolds. Although this device has been used by other others, most notably by Anita Shreve (in \\"The Color of Water\\"), it in no way detracts from the interesting juxtaposition between Civil War times and the all-too-frightening present.<br />As Anna hallucinates between dreams of her great great aunt's letters and the strange goings-on of the present, the reader becomes rivited. When Barr is on, she is really on--and this book proves the point. A tragic murder of the past, and a deeping mystering of the present all entertwine to make Anna struggle for her wits and her sanity.<br />A good, solid yarn. Welcome back, Nevada Barr and Anna!	2003-03-24

By now even I, a Philadelphia gardener who visits Houston every 6 weeks or so, know that Dale Groom is a genius--Texas style. In &quot;Month-by-Month Gardening in Texas,&quot; he and his equally wonderful cowriter, Dan Gill, provide a treasure trove of information for everything from roses to houseplants in the easiest-to-use format I've ever encountered.<br />You want to know what you need to do in March? Turn to the large, easy-to-read, illustrated (but not too much) calendar-type March pages. You'll find out how much water your houseplants need, if and when you need to prune your bushes, if it is too early or too late to plant your annuals, and so forth. The at-a-glance style of the book provides quick and easy answers that anyone can understand.<br />Very serious gardeners, who are interested in the details of propogation and grafting, for instance, will not find the depth of information they need in this book. This is exactly what it says it is: a month-to-month guide. This was a gift to me from a near-and-dear Texan, and I cherish it. You will too.	2003-03-12

An unattractive teenager, she had no dates, few friends, and could only stand on the sidelines, watching life go by--and nurturing a secret and intense crush on the school's most popular boy--dashing, handsome, all-around perfect Chip Reardon.<br />As this book begins, Myra is in her early fifties, a highly competent and successful nurse who has retired from Intensive Care nursing to the quieter and more manageable job of traveling nurse. Working through an agency, she comes across a wide variety of people and circumstances, from an impossibly endearing (believe it or not) drug dealer to a teenaged mother desperate to keep her newborn son. Myra loves all of her patients, and they her--but at her core, she is the same lonely onlooker she was as a teenager.<br />And then, after all these years, Chip Reardon comes back into her life (not that he was ever really in it)--dying of an incurable and particularly vicious brain tumor. Myra is placed as Chip's traveling nurse by her agency, and after one look at the adult and still-handsome dying man, Myra falls deeply and painfully in love.<br />But is she really in love with the man who is now, after decades of loneliness, part of her most private life? Or is she really in love with all the possibiities that never came true? It becomes more and more clear, as we see Myra through her own eyes, and those of Chip, his friends and family, and Myra's other patients, that Myra's glass is \\"half-full,\\" an analogy Chip uses to good effect in one earnest conversation with her.<br />Aside from her beloved dog, Myra has never given her heart--in real life--to a single soul, and yet she is deeply beloved by just about everyone. Except herself. As Chip struggles with his last months of life, he tries to make Myra see the life she can have...as his is waning, he tries to give her the power to truly live. But it's an uphill and seemingly impossible task to break through Myra's armor--even for the man she loves so much.<br />A deeply sad but inspiring book, \\"Never Change\\" is not something to read in a depressed state of mind. It is truly a joyous affirmation of life, but packaged in a well of sadness. The readers has to come to see the message just as Myra must do.

Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, a truly inspired pairing if there ever was one, return in a thriller that never stops thrilling.<br />It seems that one of the cagiest and deadliest serial killers of all time, nicknamed the Coffin Dancer because of a distinctive and chilling tattoo on his arm, is on the loose once more. Rhyme, the brilliant criminalist who is now a quadriplegic, has had run-ins with \\"The Dancer\\" before--and it's one of the very few times in his career that the perp has won. And managed to take a few of Rhyme's cherished colleagues with him.<br />So Rhyme, surrounded by his lab-within-a-home and the highest-of-the-highest high-tech equipment, begins a deadly game of wits that may end not only in his own death, but that of his partner, gorgeous redheaded cop Amelia Sachs. Speaking of Sachs...just what is going on in her supposedly professional relationship with Rhyme? And why does she hate the woman she and Rhyme are trying to protect?<br />From the dankest of unused subway tunnels under Manhattan, to a sleek and sexy Lear Jet, to a series of FBI-run safe houses, the chess game between Rhyme and the Dancer continues with agonizing suspense.

In this case, the characters are so likeable and so believable, that the tried-and-true formula works just fine. And then some.<br />Single mother Maggy O'Brien, 35, working part time at the church and full time as mom to her 15-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son, is sent to Atlantic City for a \\"wild weekend\\" as a birthday present from her two younger and very single sisters. Like this reader, also a single mother, Maggy's idea of heaven is a hot bath and a night alone with the remote control. She doesn't want to go, especially in a limo (arranged by her sisters) to a flashy hotel-cum-casino. But she can't hurt her sisters' feelings, and so the adventure begins.<br />Hunky Conor Riley, a seen-it-all divorced cop who's struggling to overcome horrible guilt over his partner's death, is also at the flashy hotel, and equally out of place. He's a guest of his younger brother, who works at the hotel. Conor is uninterested in the sexy young woman his brother wants him to meet--and equally uninterested in getting involved with anyone else ... and then he spies the woman across the room.<br />The scene is set. Maggy and Conor are destined to be together. Forget her very difficult daughter, who's bent on being as obnoxious as possible. Forget his temporary suspension from the police force while the trial of his partner's murderer ensues. Forget their respective overprotective families, neither of which approves of this seemingly outrageous fling. Things will work out, right? Read the book and find out.<br />Sensuality level: 8!!!

In this novel, we meet all our old friends, women of various ages and circumstances, who make up the Elm Creek Quilters, formed at the end of the last book.<br />As a surprise for matriarch Sylvia, whose mansion now houses a quilt camp for paying guests, her fellow Elm Creek Quilters decide to gift her with a round robin--a quilt of many designs and colors, each design personal to the woman who creates and sews it. As each woman works on her design, we are allowed into her most private life, and we see--instead of the fairly one-dimensional people we met in the last book--gifted, creative people with richly interwoven lives, just like the quilt. We are privy to their secrets, their sorrows and their joys as each of their quilt sections is created to mirror their most personal selves.<br />In the end, the quilt is a varied collection of interweaving but highly individual sections that--when sewn together--make an exquisite and unbreakable whole. Just like the women themselves and their strong and unbreakable friendship.<br />Like the creation of a quilt itself (which I have never done, but want to do more than ever, courtesy of this book and its predecessor), the story is told quietly, slowly, and in a methodical rhythm that should be boring--but is decidedly not. If you are looking for a fast-paced, hard-hitting story, this is not your book. But if you like a truly &quot;good&quot; book, in every sense of the word, with good old-fashioned values set in a 21st-century world, this is a treasure.<br />I am so glad to have discovered Jennifer Chiaverini and her joy of quilting, and I am so glad to be given the chance to share it with her, even though my quilting talents are nil. A beautiful, highly recommended book for young and old alike. Give it a try!	2003-03-01

Team him with a gorgeous redheaded cop with a chip on her shoulder and a propensity for biting her nails to the quick. Present them with a serial killer to end all serial killers. And then hang on tight, because this plot has more twists and turns than the most sophisticated roller coaster.<br />As the book opens, a despairing Rhyme is methodically planning his own suicide, with the help of a Kevorkian-type doctor. Trapped in his useless body, the former criminalist feels he simply cannot go on. Then he is asked to help solve one more case--and his brilliant mind simply cannot resist the tantalizing and baffling clues.<br />With a slew of high-tech gadgets (fascinating) in his bedroom, and the unwilling Amelia Sachs acting as his stand-in at the various crime scenes, Rhyme tracks a killer whose twisted mind jumps back and forth from the real world to that of Old New York. This is one heck of a perp: He thinks he's living 100 years ago, and his murders have everything to do with that delusion.<br />No way can the reader guess the end; no way is the reader going to be satisfied with only one Rhyme-Sachs novel.

As one who has read all of her books, I admit I had a bit of apprehension about the change of locale...I expected a false American accent, if you will.<br />To my surprise and delight, &quot;Girl from the South&quot; proved to be one of Trollope's best works to date. In a story that switches from London to Charleston, South Carolina, and back again, the author introduces us to a number of disaffected people in their 30s--none of whom seem to be able to make a commitment. It is only Tilly, the beautiful but conventional Londoner, who seeks a settled way of life. But her boyfriend, Henry, cannot buy into her view of domesticity, despite years of living together. Tilly and Henry's roommate, attractive and feckless William, is even worse--he has a blonde bombshell girlfriend, Susie, with whom he shares a bed and a quasi relationship, but his true feelings are elsewhere.<br />Into this interesting mix comes Gillon, the &quot;girl from the South.&quot; Stifled by the demands of her very proper southern family, bohemian Gillon, an art historian, flees to London to seek some sense of self. She provides the unwitting catalyst for a whole series of profound life changes among her newfound friends--and yet, seems powerless to make any changes herself.<br />The story's denoument is at once a disappointment and a revelation, as the main characters find fulfillment in the most unexpected of ways. As always, Trollope remains true to her characters and her story. This is no happily-ever-after romance, as none of her novels are--but it is life-affirming and positive, nevertheless. Highly recommended!	2003-02-23

Never married (although certainly not without her lovers), chidless, and used to the nomadic life of a cultural observer, Stella thinks she will retire to the countryside, settle in a cottage, and maybe even acquire a dog--another stab at planting herself in a firm location.<br />Accordingly, she moves to a pleasant village recommended by Richard, the widower of Stella's lifelong (but rarely seen) friend Nadine. She acquires the requisite dog--which embarrasses her with its canine devotion--and sets about forming a life for herself in the same detached role of observer that she has used among tribespeople in New Guinea.<br />What Stella cannot see, and what therefore forms the ultimate sadness of her life, is that the village seethes with emotions of all kinds, from sexual to violent. Many of these emotions are directed at her. But Stella, as the author subtly but brilliantly points out in a series of flashbacks, has never really been a participant in her own life. Hence, she fails to see or experience reality--until it rears up and metaphorically attacks her. And by then, it's too late.<br />A deep, disturbing book, \\"Spiderweb\\" is a quick read--a fascinating character study that leaves the reader thinking long after the last page is read. And it poses an interesting question: Is it better to live a full life with all its messiness and emotional baggage? Or is it better to keep oneself always separate--thereby truly experiencing none of the depths of pain or joy?<br />Stella, in the end, can do neither.	2003-02-15

I think it must be the former.<br />Nina, the stubborn, beautiful, competent and courageous Lake Tahoe attorney who is central to every book, is a very different woman as this one begins. First of all, she is inexplicably in love with Paul, the private eye who helps her with each case, and who has been her on-again, off-again lover as Nina's mood and marital circumstances dictate. In the last book, &quot;Writ of Execution,&quot; they were on again. But nothing prepared this reader for the romantic, almost desperate intensity with which Nina now loves Paul. Where did this come from? For those of us who have been rooting for Paul all along, it's a happy circumstance, but the one-sentence explanation for this turn of events doesn't quite make it.<br />The plot, however, is a good one. Nina finds herself on the other side of the law as she is called before the California State Bar in a disciplinary action that could cost her everything she holds dear. One careless but very human action--leaving her keys behind in the courtroom--has led to a series of nightmarish disasters. Her car is stolen, and so are the three highly confidential client files she carelessly left in the back seat. Each of the files contains materials that could prove extremely damaging to Nina's clients, and as the plot unfolds, that's exactly what happens.<br />Struggling to clear her good name, hold on to her career, and also undo the terrible damage done to her clients, Nina enlists not only the help of the stalwart Paul, but also her ex-husband Jack, whom we've heard about but never met. A high-powered California attorney, Jack specalizes in defending his fellow attorneys before the Bar. Can he save Nina? Or will his still-personal feelings for her get in the way?<br />Throughout the tense ordeal, Nina still has to deal with her son Bob, who, now 14, has turned from the sweet child of previous books to an all-too-typical sullen teenager. I won't give away the truly surprising end of the book, but I will say that Nina, and therefore the series, will never be the same again.<br />I don't think this book quite pulled it off for regular readers like me, since the major changes in Nina constantly had me thinking about previous books, diverting me from the plot-at-hand.

I adored it. I want more. Urges to reread book immediately, 8 million, four thousand. Cigarettes: Nil. Alcohol units: Nil. Chocolate: 4000 ounces, but only because there isn't another Bridget book to read.<br />It isn't often that a sequel can grab a reader as thoroughly as the first book, especially when that first is such a blockbuster, as was \\"Bridget Jones' Diary.\\" But in my mind, this one was just as wonderful--simply a continuation of where \\"Book 1\\" left off! All of our favorites are here, and a few new ones too, like Gary the Builder, who creates a giant hole in the wall of Bridget's flat--and leaves it there for 8 months. Not much of the horrid Daniel, thank goodness, but PLENTY of Marc Darcy, unfortunately caught in the clutches of the evil Rebecca (she of the insect-thin legs).<br />Will Mister Darcy come back to Bridget? Will the hole in the wall ever get fixed? And what of the drug-running charges in Thailand? Read it and fine out, and be prepared to laugh yourself sick.

I didn't even know what a stylebook was, but I quickly learned--it literally saved my young editing life on many an occasion.<P>Now, many years and many other stylebooks later, I have had the extreme pleasure of renewing my friendship with this fabulous tool. And I find it better than ever. Some examples: What's the difference between arbitrate and mediate? The Stylebook will tell you in a quick, concise paragraph that will let you get it right the first time--and make your deadline. What's the difference between &quot;which&quot; and &quot;that&quot;? The Stylebook will tell you. What does &quot;oyez&quot; mean, and is it ever proper to use in print? Look under &quot;O.&quot; Need to know what time it is in Arkansas? Refer to the United States time zone map.<P>I could go on and on, but I must first declare my heartfelt appreciation for the updated appendix entitled &quot;Briefing on Media Law,&quot; which clearly explains what libel is, and then painstakingly describes just about any situation a writer/editor/reporter could ever encounter in the increasingly dicey world of media law. It even lists recent Supreme Court decisions, making them easy to understand, and lists many contingencies that can trap the libel-ignorant (and considering the many changes in libel law, that includes me and many others).<P>I love this book. I always have, I always will. I recommend it, not only to my fellow professionals, but to students and others who want to communicate in clear, correct, but readable English.	2003-02-04

In Trollope's own trademark way, we learn that Caro profoundly affected everyone in her extended circle--and not always for the good.<br />Who was Caro? Did she love her silent, taciturn farmer husband Robin, who bears a weight of responsibility that would break most people? And what about Robin's charming, but ultimately feckless brother Joe? What was between him and Caro, and why can he not find solace in his young family?<br />Solace is not to be had for Judy either: The twentysomething adopted daughter of Caro and Robin is beside herself with grief, and deeply angry at her father for seemingly neglecting his perfect wife.<br />As Trollope does so brilliantly, she lets us view the re-shifting and uncomfortable emotions of Caro's family from a child's eye point of view, in this case, the sensitive, 3-year-Hughie, Joe's son. There are only two people in the book who grab life to the fullest, as Caro is purported to have done. One is little Hughie's baby sister, Rose, whose sturdy little soul brooks no interference. She is, simply, a force to be reckoned with. Her adult counterpart is the hippie-ish Zoe, flatmate of the self-pitying Judy, and the ultimate, unlikely catalyst for the family to come to terms with its grief and see Caro for what she really was, warts and all.<br />This is one of the darker of Trollope's books, but as always, well-written and, in my case, hard to put down. It makes the reader think hard about perception and reality, and the intangible nature of love--both romantic and family.	2003-01-29

It's a bit tired, a bit confusing, and its tone is ever so slightly cynical. I hope this is not a reflection of Binchy's state of mind, but merely the subject matter of the plot. The heroine, Ella, a strangely one-dimensional character when compared with Binchy's usual, sails through an exemplary early life only to fall madly, obsessively in love with the wrong man.<br />Ella's story is told with Quentins, a fictional upscale Dublin restaurant, as the backdrop. Through this popular eatery, we meet lots of interesting people, whose stories we learn--and we have the return, however briefly, of some previous Binchy characters as well. But even they do not have the life they had in the original books--they seem somehow two-dimensional. I don't know whether that was the fault of this reader, who had a lot of trouble keeping all the names straight, or of Binchy herself, who is practically sacred in my eyes!<br />I would never recommend reading this book as a first taste of Maeve Binchy. But for those of us who have followed her wonderful literary career through the years, and who have read her entire collection, it's a joy just to be reading another offering when we thought that Binchy had retired from writing. If this were any other author, I would rate the book a 3. But I just can't do that; the book captured and kept my interest, and although its odd tone made me uneasy, I'm not at all sorry I read it. Binchy fans: Go for it, but don't expect &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; or its ilk. Binchy newcomers: pick another book, such as the aforementioned, before tackling this one.	2003-01-22

Had I not suddenly and with no particular reason changed my mind, I would have been the loser.<br />Everybody knows by now that this is the story of a ditzy,30-something young Brit--and that the tale is told in a clever, sometimes side-splitting update of Pride and Prejudice, complete with a haughty but sexy Mister Darcy!! Bridget's outrageously inappropriate mother is the 90s version of Jane Austen's Mrs. Bennett; her horrible sleazoid boss Daniel is a perfect Mister Wickham; and Bridget? Well Bridget stands alone as just about the most enjoyable, funny, and good-hearted character we've seen in a long time.<br />What can I say?

Countless coworkers have come by to exclaim over the beautiful juxtaposition of cats and flowers, and it makes everybody smile.<br />My only tiny comment is that the calendar does not reflect the seasons--for instance, January shows a sunny garden full of gorgeous cosmos (and a cat to match). On the other hand, maybe that's a good thing, since January on the East Coast is no picnic!<br />I recommend this calendar to all cat lovers.

But I had high hopes, after &quot;Second Thyme Around,&quot; that Fforde was prepared to add some meaning to her tales. Not so with &quot;Artistic License,&quot; a pleasant little romp that's as easy to digest as vanilla pudding.<br />I find all of Fforde's heroines endearing, and Thea, the subject of this particular book, is the typical Fforde protagonist: a thirtysomething single Brit with a sweet temperament and a &quot;let's get on with it&quot; disposition. She's a bit muddled around the edges, and a bit of a Bridget Jones, but she is so endearing that the reader really wants to see her succeed in her hairbrained scheme to open an art gallery in the English countryside.<br />Along the way, Thea encounters her share of male scoundrels and sweetiepies, and everything turns out alright in the end. There is the usual cast of supporting characters, from the overbearing friend, Molly, to the dithering teenager, Petal, to the rich, upscale London friends. Fforde has explored this territory many times before, and I'm not going to say that it isn't enjoyable. But with the exception of &quot;Second Thyme Around,&quot; in which she explored serious topics with great success, all of Fforde's books seem exactly the same. Not bad, by any means, but nothing special either. It's a shame, because Fforde is capable of more.	2003-01-13

Her talent is very evident in \\"Heat Wave.\\" A deceptively simple story with very dark undertones, the book is a masterpiece of \\"novel-as-understatement.\\"<br />Long-divorced Pauline, a freelance book editor, is spending the summer at her country cottage, World's End, with her daughter Theresa and her family--husband Morris, baby son Luke. Theresa and family occupy one half of the duplex, and Pauline the other. It's an agreeable relationship that allows each household the privacy it needs as well as the companionship, as the entire family gathers for dinner and other outings.<br />All is seemingly serene in both houses, but as the weather turns hotter in an unusually strong heat wave, the civilized overlay between the adults gradually melts away. For in an almost obscene coincidence, as far as Pauline is concerned, her daughter's husband Morris is engaged in an affair that is destined to break Theresa's heart--the same as Pauline's was broken many years ago by her husband (and Theresa's father) Harry.<br />The similarities between Morris and Harry are chilling. Both are authors. Both are self-centered, charming, and careless of their women. Both have affairs with young women who are \\"editorial groupies.\\" As Pauline watches Morris become increasingly involved with Carol, the vacuous girlfriend of his own editor, Jack, she begins to relive (and re-feel) the horrible emotions she encountered as a young wife betrayed by her own cheating husband. The novel moves effortlessly between the present and the past as Pauline watches her own daughter's betrayal and is helpless to stop it. As her emotions churn, so does the weather. Only Luke, the innocent baby, is unaware of the terrible events unfolding all around him, and only Luke is unscathed in the end.<br />Similar in tone to the works of Joanna Trollope, \\"Heat Wave\\" is just about as good as it gets. It is beautifully written, spare and to-the-point, and it ensnares the reader completely in its seemingly simple story of love and loss.n, spare and to-the-point, and it ensnares the reader completely in its seemingly simple story of love and loss.	2003-01-08

As Matt works to restore the gardens and grounds at Elm Creek, a dilapidated old mansion, Sarah, struggling to find a job in her field, finds herself instead as paid helper to the mansion's acerbic owner, Mrs. Compson.<br />At first thorny and uncomfortable, the relationship between Mrs. Compson and Sarah slowly unfolds as the two women create a quilt--Sarah's first. The metaphor of the quilt's patches creating a whole, just as Mrs. Compson's snippets of stories create a picture of her life, is nothing new, and perhaps a bit awkwardly handled in this first novel. It is noticeable in dialogue that nobody in real life would speak--and of the coincidences that probably would never occur.<br />Nevertheless, this book is a keeper, and I look forward to the next in the series. I personally love quilts, although I have never quilted. I found the slow creation of the story's (and Sarah's) quilt fascinating, easy to read, and just simply charming.<br />This is not a fast-paced book, and it is not a work of literary genuis. It is simply a sweet, old-fashioned story, and--I am happy to say--it works.	2003-01-07

It was that boring. Something has happened--and I'm not sure what. The only cogent thing I can think of to say is that this book reads as though from a great distance. Yes, Anna Pigeon is the heroine, although, as in \\"Blood Lure,\\" she has become almost a parody of herself. Yes, Anna's fellow ranger Randy Thigpen is still a mysogonist. Yawn. Yes, Anna's sister Molly is still around, mentioned once or twice in passing, I assume in order to keep her in the reader's memory. Thus, Anna, who in every other book phones her sister at least once a day, barely gives her a passing thought.<br />The sheriff with whom Anna had begun a romantic relationship in the last book is now a very serious boyfriend, but all we see of their relationship is Anna's usual (and by now exceedingly annoying) prickly self. Yes, she cares, but no, she's not going to let him know in case she gets hurt. Yada yada yada.<br />The plot, which held my interest not at all, concerns a murdered hunter, brother of the local undertaker, who is found in circumstances that suggest a sex crime, thereby causing quite a stir. Anna noses around, breaks the rules, solves the crime, as usual tells nobody what she should, and as usual gets in a life-threatening situation. Yada yada redux. What has happened to Nevada Barr's fabulous storytelling skills? I hope this is just a slump--but I must say one thing. Nevada, get rid of your terrible editor. In my review of \\"Blood Lure\\" (a much better book than this one, by the way), I mentioned that Anna's inherited dog, Taco, had mysteriously morphed from a golden retriever into a black lab. Well, surprise, surprise....Taco is now a golden retriever again--for half the book. And then...can you say Harry Potter? Taco becomes a black lab again. Along with the many typos (courtesy of a spell-check that doesn't know the difference between words, and an \\"editor\\" too lazy to doublecheck), this is simply not acceptable. Does Barr not read her own galleys before her books go to press? Am I harping on a tiny detail? Maybe--but that detail grated on my nerves so badly I had to put the book away for a while. I figured: Well, if Barr doesn't care about her own book, why should I?<br />There's more, but I don't want to be a spoiler. Suffice to say that the known personalities of certain people in Anna's life have taken a sudden and unexplained turn that makes no sense at all. I can't give a Nevada Barr book less than three stars, because I have read everything she has written, and this is the first time she has disappointed me like this.

Her crossover into the mystery/thriller genre has been seemingly effortless, and &quot;Envy,&quot; really two books in one, proves it beyond a doubt. It grips the reader on page one, and doesn't let go until the very last word of the very last sentence. And in my case, even though I had figured out quite a bit, it still had a few hot-punching surprises.<br />Maris Matherly-Reed, the brilliant, sweet, and pampered daughter of the scion of Matherly Press, one of New York's most prestigious publishing houses, becomes obsessed with an anonymous manuscript sent to her offices. From the first word of &quot;Envy&quot; (which we get to read along with her), she is so hooked, she sets out to find the author. Her quest leads her to a tiny island off the Georgia coast, where she meets the impossibly cantankerous and outright rude Parker Evans. His rudeness is matched only by his incredible talent, and Maris vows to ignore his personality and help him through what she sees as the next great American novel.<br />Meanwhile, back in New York, Maris's smooth, urbane husband, Noah Reed, is revealing himself to be the worst kind of snake as he plots to sell the publishing house out from under his wife and his father-in-law.<br />It soon becomes apparent that there is some sort of mysterious connection between the so-called fictional characters of &quot;Envy&quot; and Maris herself. But what is it? And who IS this Parker Evans? Is he friend or foe? Why has he lured Maris to his island in what turns out to be an almost diabolical plot?<br />The answers are slowly revealed as the two books, Sandra Brown's &quot;Envy&quot; and Parker Evans' &quot;Envy,&quot; intertwine. What a terrific plot device, and how cleverly Brown makes it happen! In the unabridged tape version, Victor Slezak does a masterful job of capturing the essence of Evans--and his rendering of the slick and slimy Noah is simply perfect.

The plot concerns an unspeakable cadre of pedophiles who have wormed their way into the town where pediatrician/medical examiner Sara Linton, her ex-husband Jeffrey, the police chief, and Jeffrey's assistant, Lena, all live and work.<br />Sara is a bit more likeable in this book, although I still have trouble believing in her double career (...). Jeffrey has become a great deal softer in this book, and Lena,..., has turned from tough to terrorized. Now the three protagonists are drawn into the equally graphic and gruesome doings of the pedophiles, part of a seemingly nationwide group of child molesters and rapists.<br />The reader is not spared any of the hideously gruesome tortures inflicted on some of the child victims--and in my view, as in the first book, this aspect of the story is way overdone... The perpetraors in \\"Kisscut\\" are not that hard to figure out, but the story of how they are found out and investigated makes for a fairly good read.<br />The worst problem that Karen Slaughter has as a writer is not her plots, but her thoroughly unbelievable characters. None of the protagonists--or the villains, for that matter--rings true. There is not enough characterization or explanation to make their kneejerk reactions believable, and that's what keeps me as a reader at arm's length from the story. As in \\"Blindsighted,\\" I never became personally involved in \\"Kisscut.\\" It's a fairly interesting story, with more than its share of violence, and less than its share of any meaning.	2002-12-14

Having read the reviews written by law students and attorneys, I bow to their judgment of this book. But I am neither, and I need a tool I can use quickly and well.

I loved it as a girl, I loved it as a teenager, and I love it now. Even though it was written in Victorian times, it has a truth and honesty to it that survives into today--and the problems that Rose encounters as a young woman will be familiar to any modern reader.<br />Why are women fascinated by--and drawn to--the bad boys of this world? That question did not originate with James Dean or \\"The Leader of the Pack.\\" It is very much alive in this book, as Rose returns from Europe to find her eight cousins very much grown up--and very, very interesting. In particular, her wild and handsome cousin Charlie, now grown into a wild and handsome man, captures Rose's heart. But Charlie is on a dangerous path to alcoholism and self-destruction. Will Rose see this in time, and will she turn to the man who really loves her with all his heart and soul? And what of her dear friend Phoebe, whose ethnic background might keep her from the man she loves?<br />Sounds like a 2002 soap opera. But it isn't--and it is written with such depth, such love, and such talent that it has survived over a century. Alcott was so much more than \\"Little Women\\" and this book, among others, proves it.	2002-12-12

I kept thinking I was reading Truman Capote in his later years, when his secret-spilling and indiscrete name-dropping made him persona non grata in upper-class society.<br />In this \\"fiction memoir,\\" Gus Bailey, aka Dominick Dunne, covers the OJ Simpson trial in Los Angeles by day, and parties with just about every known celebrity at night. Dunne himself covered the trial and wrote about it extensively for Vanity Fair magazine. So does his fictional character. In fact, the book contains many excerpts from Dunne's columns, as \\"written by\\" Gus Bailey. Dunne appeared as a talking head on just about every known TV show of the 90s, from Larry King on down. So does Bailey. The in-your-face name-dropping, braggadocio (\\"I was seated between Princess Margaret and...\\") and sheer unadulterated dish never stops.<br />I would like to say that the book is shallow and boring. It may be shallow, but it certainly isn't boring--the gossip is irresistible and mind-boggling. Dunne's extraordinary conclusion to this book has to be read to be believed--it might be the ULTIMATE in name-dropping.<br />I have been a fan of Dominick Dunne for some time, beginning with \\"The Two Mrs. Grenvilles,\\" which I thought was a worthwhile and well-written book. I felt the same about \\"A Season in Purgatory,\\" and I find the televised Dunne to be erudite and informative. But \\"Another City,\\" as fun to read as it is, is simply down and dirty dish, from page one to the end. That's what brought down Capote in the end--and I'm wondering if it will ultimately lead to Dunne's literary denoument as well. It will be interesting to watch.	2002-12-12

She is grieving for her recently dead parents, and she tends to get the vapors and other Victorian women's ailments. Nevertheless, this shy, frail and delicate creature is sent to live on the \\"Aunt Hill\\" to be raised by six very opinionated aunts.<br />And that's not all. She is also surrounded by seven male cousins, as boisterous and full of life as they come. Rose's initial reaction is to wish herself dead. Barely able to lift her head, she is frightened and overwhelmed by the presence of her mischievous clan. But deep inside, she is secretly envious. The boys get to climb trees and run and play, while Rose, as all young women in her day, is confined to the parlor, constricted by tight corsets and impossible petticoats.<br />Along comes Uncle Mac, the doctor uncle whose view of how to raise girls clashes with his day and time--and all six of his sisters, the formidable aunts. In the character of Doctor Mac, Louisa May Alcott was able to tout her own family's avant garde views on women's health, almost a century ahead of its time. The doctor forbids Rose to wear the constricting corsets, to the horror of all her aunts and the girl herself. He wonders how she can feel healthy when she cannot draw a decent breath? He encourages her to play outside with her cousins, to get fresh air and exercise. He demands that she eat good, hearty meals instead of womanly morsels. And under his tutelage, and with the friendship of her wonderful cousins, Rose starts to bloom. She turns from a shy, sickly little mouse into a strong, outgoing young woman.<br />I loved this book as a child; I love it now. It has the perfect message for any girl of any age: Be yourself, take care of yourself, and nothing and nobody can stop you. In my view, \\"Eight Cousins\\" is Alcott's true masterpiece.	2002-11-28

This story involves the Mob, a possible hit that targets someone near and dear to Carlotta, and a murder that affects the Green and White Cab Company, and its wonderful proprietor, Gloria.<br />Carlotta's on-again, off-again lover, Sam Gianelli, may not be able to escape his heritage this time around--his father is head of a major Mob Family. And Sam, like it or not, is trapped in some nefarious goings-on. Only Carlotta can save him, and she is facing the wrath of two Families, not to mention the usual cast of characters, from her pre-teen and increasingly difficult \\"little sister,\\" Paolina, to her raunchy roommate, Roz, to a possible new lover.<br />All in all, the story is a good one, and Carlotta's solution to the puzzle that has threatened so many lives is brilliant. Carlotta still plays killer volleyball, still drives like a maniac (in and out of the cab), and still keeps her cool under pressure. But she has changed a great deal since the earlier books, and is a much more serious--and believeable--person than she ever was before.<br />A good read, and a strong key to what makes Carlotta tick.	2002-11-27

The plot concerns three small silver statues of mythology's three Fates. Alone, they are fairly valuable pieces. Together, as they were intended to be, they are priceless. So priceless that at least one antiques dealer, the nefarious Anita Gaye, is willing to kill to get her hands on them.<br />Enter our heroes: A fine, Irish family named Sullivan, that inherited one of the statues, only to have it stolen by the horrible Ms. Gaye. Malachai, Gideon, and their sister Rebecca, all gorgeous, smart, and irresistible, want their statue back. And they want the other two as well, so they can, along with their mother Eileen, pump up their small boat-tour company, and expand in style.<br />Roberts always tells a good story when the characters are Irish, and this is no exception. Each of the formidable siblings meets his or her match in the race for the statues: Malachai teams with shy, withdrawn Tia Marsh, an art historian and heir to one of New York's finest antiques houses; Gideon finds himself entwined (in more ways than one) with fiercely independent stripper Cleo Tolliver, who just happens to own one of the three statues, and Rebecca loses her heart to collector and security expert Jack Burdett.<br />Will the Sullivans et al. retrieve the Fates? Will Anita Gaye self-destruct on her murderous quest? Will the three sets of lovers find out they were made for each other? Pick up the book and find out--it's a good, fast read.	2002-11-25

And this time the murderer may or may not be the same ferocious bear that has torn up the camp and almost eaten Anna and crew.<br />Joan, the French-Canadian woman who heads up the Bear DNA project, is passionate about her ursine charges, but even she is terrified by the display of violence on the part of the bear. And Rory, Joan and Anna's teenaged apprentice, is nearly catatonic with fear after the attack. It is Rory's stepmother, camping nearby in the park, who is found murdered, her face mauled. Did the bear do it? It would not be characteristic behavior if he did. Or was the murderer all too human? Did Rory, whose strange disappearance after the attack provokes a parkwide search, kill his stepmom in a fit of rage? What about Rory's meek and mild dad? Did Joan herself do it, and if so, why?<br />Anna sets out to solve the mystery, but the story is slow and often ponderous, even though it contains all the elements that usually grab readers of this series. The Bear DNA project is very interesting, but gets old after a while. The murder victim is uninteresting, and probably deserved what she got. Joan is a wonderful new character, and I hope to see more of her in subsequent books, but Anna is strangely one-dimensional in this book. Piedmont and Taco, her cat and dog, have been left behind in her home park, and her new lover, the sheriff, is only referred to in passing. This is disappointing, since the relationship was starting to heat up big time in \\"Deep South.\\"<br />Anna herself is more than a bit cantankeous in this outing, almost a parody of herself. The unabridged reading saves the novel from a two-star rating, however, due to the talent and exuberance of reader Barbara Rosenblat, who \\"does\\" Anna to a tee. As a regular reader of this series, I wouldn't skip this book. But I think a newcomer should definitely bypass this for now and seek out another in the series, most of which is simply wonderful.or now and seek out another in the series, most of which is simply wonderful.	2002-11-16

In fact, I have never been particularly attracted to the breed, other than including them in my love of dogs in general. But there is something about this calendar that so captivated me, I couldn't get it off my mind. Every dog in this magnificent collection is so compelling, so beautiful, and so--doggish, for lack of a better word--that I found myself yearning for a Rottie of my own. I have rarely been this moved by a dog calendar whose breed does not match my own dog's. This is the big exception. I have this calendar on my list, and I have found myself looking at Rottweilers in a whole new way. What a noble and beautiful breed! I would be proud to hang this calendar, and be thrilled with the dogs each month.	2002-11-13

Hello Kitty is perhaps the most well-known character from this Japanese company, and her sweet, appealing face draws more than little children. I know a certain college student who is dying for this calendar--as are several of her friends.<br />For small children, the color cues (Hello, Gold!), different for each month, are wonderful learning aids. For older children, Hello Kitty's different and delightful outfits will be sure to please. For college kids--who knows? The calendar is a dorm-room phenomenon. The only slight criticism I have is that Hello Kitty looks exactly the same month after month, other than her clothes. But then our pal doesn't have a lot of expressions at the best of times.

The reader, too, is drawn into Brianna's all-too-brief life, and is there with her in Skeleton Canyon as she joyously awaits the arrival of her secret lover, Ignacio Ybarra, equally young, beautiful, and deeply in love. Brianna does not live to meet her lover--but who killed her? And why? It's up to Joanna to find out, and her job is much hampered by the arrogance of Brianna's father, whose distrust of the local law enforcement community is matched only by his racial hatred of Mexican-Americans.<br />Brianna and Ignacio were involved in a forbidden love affair, at least by the senior O'Brian's lights. Did he find out and have his own daughter killed? It seems highly unlikely, since Ignacio is very much alive--and a suspect. But why would he murder his beloved? What secrets in the O'Brian family coalesced to cause this inevitable tragedy?<br />While Joanna and her crew struggle to find the answers, the reader is treated to magnificent descriptions of the rugged Southwest, whose beauty masks murderous dangers such as killer flash floods. Equally interesting is the supporting cast: Joanna's friend Angie, a former hooker turned straight; two old and entertaining drunks in the bar where Angie works; Joanna's indomitable mother, who has a secret of her own; and more.<br />This is the 5th in the Joanna Brady series, and the first I have read. It stands alone beautifully, but got me so hooked that I must get my hands on the next book immediately! Highly recommended for mystery lovers looking for a good, strong, read.	2002-11-06

Having struggled to finish it, I was left with the strong sense that Patterson wrote it in one long night, rushing to meet a deadline--and trusted in his co-writer to clean it up. He must have emailed it to Andrew Gross hoping that the latter would add some gloss to the story. But nothing of the sort is evident in this--I'm sorry--terrible book.<br />The plot centers on a series of racially motivaated killings that are shocking San Francisco and creating a political firestorm. Lindsay, who has been promoted to homicide lieutenant (a thoroughly unbelievable state of affairs, in my opinion--she's promoted to head homicide because of one great case?), is facing pressure from the mayor, the press, and the black community to solve the crime and bring the heinous perpetrator to justice. But it isn't so easy.<br />Self-named The Chimera (a favorite word of Patterson's--it's used more than once in the Alex Cross series), the perp is smart and thorough. It quickly becomes clear that he is not only targeting the black community, but the law enforcement community as well. Lindsay herself may be in deep danger--not to mention everyone from the Chief of Police on down. Lindsay needs help, so she turns to her pals: Claire, the brilliant medical examiner; Cindy, the equally brilliant journalist; and the superstar assistant District Attorney whose name suddenly escapes me (the book was so boring, it's hard to remember).<br />The sprightly comeraderie of the Women's Murder Club, so delightful in \\"1st to Die,\\" is a parody of itself in this book. Each woman, while helping Lindsay to solve the case, is facing a personal crisis of her own, from pregnancy to a love affair to the return of a long-lost father who may or may not be a criminal himself.<br />Sigh. It all sounds like such a good idea. And maybe it could have made a good book if Patterson had given it some time. I hate to see a truly good author become so entwined in obligations that he is forced to sacrifice the thing he does best--write!

It provides a great deal of insight into the character of Thomas, the melancholy and ultimately doomed hero of the latter. And it also poses, I believe, an interesting question: Is tragedy predestined?<br />It certainly seems so in the two intertwined stories told in this book. The first, based on dual murders that actually took place in the 1800s, is the story of a Norwegian woman who is transplanted to a desolate and uninhabited New England island by her fisherman husband, there to live for many years with little or no human companionship under the harshest of circumstances. Her life is so rigid, so devoid of any tenderness or care, so barren (the fact that she cannot conceive a child is a metaphor for her entire existence) that her ultimate tragedy seems inevitable.<br />The second story is that of Thomas, a poet whose entire ouvre is limited to one collection of brilliant poems, an outpouring of grief and emotion about his first love, tragically killed in a car accident. Married to a photojournalist, Jean, Thomas seems half a person--desperately trying to regain his art, but in his way as barren as Maren, the lonely Norwegian wife. His only real joy is his and Jean's precocious and adorable 5-year-old daughter, Billie, whose mere existence has kept her parents in their difficult marriage. As Thomas and Billie accompany Jean on a photo assignment that will document the historic facts of the murders that changed a small group of Norwegian immigrants forever, Thomas seems to be unraveling. Situated with the others on a schooner piloted by his brother, Rich, Thomas seems to be a cypher, only alive in brief spurts punctuated by interactions with Billie and Rich's flirtatious girlfriend.<br />The steady unraveling of Thomas's sanity (and thus his marriage), juxtaposed against the story of Maren's own unraveling, makes for a heavy reading experience. And yet the book is so well written, and so insightful, that it moves along very quickly toward its inevitable and tragic ending.<br />Highly recommended, especially when paired with &quot;The Last Time They Met,&quot; which should be read second, although I inadvertently reversed the order.and so insightful, that it moves along very quickly toward its inevitable and tragic ending.<br />Highly recommended, especially when paired with &quot;The Last Time They Met,&quot; which should be read second, although I inadvertently reversed the order.	2002-11-04

When the book opens, Anna is on her way to the Natchez Trace Parkway, which runs from Jackson to Natchez, Mississippi. There, she will assume the reins of district ranger in a land still fraught will male chauvinism and general distrust of females.<br />Nothing daunted (but secretly afraid of the very different flora and fauna--eg, gigantic spiders), Anna makes her way to her new job, along with her complaining cat Piedmont, and her dog Taco, a golden retriever in previous books who has suddenly morphed into a black lab (Barr's editor apparently doesn't know the difference). No matter. Once on the Trace, Anna is hit full force with two disgruntled male subordinates who refuse to accept her authority, a handsome sheriff who makes her hard heart flutter, a group of Civil War buffs who stage re-enactments in Anna's territory--and a murder.<br />Barely able to unload her Rambler (which has mysteriously morphed from her much-loved Honda--another editorial boo boo) of her worldly possessions, Anna finds herself immersed in the particularly nasty murder of Danielle Posey, a popular high school senior, whose beaten body is found in the wilderness tied to a tree and draped in a crudely makeshift Ku Klux Klan hood. Anna is thrown into the tangled web of the murdered girl's life and a mystery as thick as the fast-growing kudzu that blankets the region.<br />There are plenty of suspects from which to choose, from the high school's star quarterback, who was Danielle's prom date, to a mysterious and possibly mythical lover, to Danielle's own brother, an avowed racist who would love nothing better than to create an issue where none exists. The deeper the mystery, the more suspects. Anna struggles to make sense of the murder while also trying to settle in to her new cottage, her new life, her hostile office--and an alligator in her carport.<br />There is not a false step in this intriguing, fast-paced mystery. The thicker the plot, the more the reader is rooting for Anna to solve the case. I did not guess the murderer OR the motive until Anna did. It all made sense when the pieces were put together, but I had no clue beforehand, and that's the best kind of mystery.<br />As always, Barr's description of Anna's habitat is mesmerizing. In this case, since Barr herself was (and possibly still is) a ranger on the Natchez Trace, the descriptions are particularly evocative. I found myself smelling the hot, sultry, lazy Mississippi air along with Anna, and reaching for the air-conditioner for relief along with her. Anna Pigeon remains a thoroughly likeable and all-too-human heroine, and I look forward to reading the next in the series.se of the murder while also trying to settle in to her new cottage, her new life, her hostile office--and an alligator in her carport.<br />There is not a false step in this intriguing, fast-paced mystery.

And the next thing I did was to acquire &quot;The Weight of Water,&quot; hoping to find further clues.<br />This is the first Shreve novel I have read, and I have been left in a state of questioning disbelief. Was that her intent? Is the reader meant to untangle the twisted paths of a tortured mind and discover the truth within? I'm not really sure.<br />What I can say with certainty is that I found the story of Thomas and Linda, high school sweethearts who meet again at age 26 and 52, touching and troubled. Through the lyrical if spare prose of the author, one can feel the almost palpable yearning of the two lovers. And because the book travels backward in time instead of forward, one gets a unique perspective on the two people involved. Is it intentional that the beginning section, where they meet at age 52, is slow and almost staid? I found Linda one-dimensional in this section, which may be a clue in itself.<br />The middle section, which takes place in Kenya, is bright and beautiful, full of sumptuous descriptions of places, colors, foods, and people. The sensuous meeting of Thomas and Linda at this stage in their lives, their mid-twenties, is breathtaking, even when their separation is inevitable.<br />But it is in the last section, where the lovers are 17, that the reader finally begins to know them in all their youth just ready to flower. I found the tone of each section distinctly different, and my reactions to the characters different as well. This made me even more unprepared for the ending. I don't know whether I am confused, or whether the book bewitched me, or both--but I will say that this is an extraordinary piece of writing, and will stay with me for a long, long, time.	2002-10-23

He takes one look at her, and in the way of many MacGregors to come, he knows she is the one for him. But Anna is no easy catch. At a time when women were expected to be quiet and acquiescent, Anna is attending medical school, one of the few of her gender to do so. And she had no time for the brash, very outspoken, often embarrassing Daniel MacGregor. Or so she thinks. Anna and Daniel's courtship changes them both. He learns to be more humble. She learns to be more giving. And so a great dynasty is born.<br />The second story harkens back to a stalwart and brave MacGregor ancestor, Ian, who is fighting for the survival of his beloved Scotland against England in the bloody Culloden wars. This segment is written in the way of all good historical romances, with plenty of adventure thrown in. The battle scenes are particularly good, and we learn just what drove Ian and his beloved bride Serena to America, where the MacGregor clan took permanent root. Along the way, there is plenty of danger for Ian, Serena, their newborn child, and all their family. A good, dashing romance.<br />I would characterize this story as the weakest in the MacGregor series, but very important to those afficionadoes, like me, who want every single tidbit of information about the clan that Roberts is willing to provide.	2002-10-23

Although she still has a wry sense of humor, a self-deprecating streak, and daily contact with a cast of outrageous characters, this story is a serious one.<br />Carlotta is approached by a distraught woman, Emily, who is accompanied on the visit by her young and handsome psychiatrist. It seems that Emily's young daughter, who was being treated for a curable form of leukemia, suddenly took a violent turn for the worse and died. Emily is certain that it was due to gross negligence on the part of the hospital, one of the most prestigious in Boston. Her psychiatrist does not agree, but wishes to soothe his patient by letting her hire Anna.<br />Anna finds the case daunting and more than a little confusing, especially when her first forays into information-gathering result in the death or disappearance of several key players, including Emily herself. Is Anna in over her head? What exactly DID happen to Emily's 6-year-old daughter? Is there a conspiracy of silence at the hospital, and if so, which of the pompous, well-known doctors is taking part? As Anna digs deeper, she finds herself involved in a dangerous web of intrigue that threatens not only the patients in the hospital, but her own life as well.<br />Although this story has much more meat than the previous books in the series, it is not without its own special brand of humor and quirky characters. Carlotta's insanely nutty roommate, Roz, is her usual outrageous self, as is Diane, the impossibly huge proprietess of the Green and White cab company. Carlotta is still involved with Sam, the offspring of a well-known mobster, and no-nonsense cop Mooney, her friend, mentor, and would-be lover, still disapproves. There are also some plot-thickening incidents with Carlotta's beloved \\"little sister\\" Paolina, and her immoveable mother Marta, who has become very ill.<br />All in all, this book promises a new twist in the series, and bodes well for the future of Carlotta's career as an offbeat, but successful, private eye.twist in the series, and bodes well for the future of Carlotta's career as an offbeat, but successful, private eye.	2002-10-23

Sometimes it's hard to review Joanna Trollope's books for fear of putting off a potential reader. Such is the case with \\"Other People's Children,\\" which is a brilliant look at what step- families are really like. I know that I, reading the above sentence, would think, \\"Oh, not again, it's been done to death, yuck.\\" And then I would have missed one of Trollope's best works, one that is not boring in the least, and that has such insight, such truth, that it can enrich any reader.<br />So. That having been said, please bear with me as I try to explain this book, which is slight on plot and heavy on insight. It involves a number of very nice people of all ages, from young Rufus, just 7 when the book begins, to a 20-something engaged couple, to a 30-something newly married pair who are blending their respective families, to a May-September relationship between a single woman in her early 40s, Elizabeth, and a twice-married architect with two adult children from his first marriage, and Rufus from his second. This man's name is Tom. It is his adult son, Lucas, who is engaged (to Amy), and his second wife, Josie, mother of Rufus, whose recent remarriage has blended two families. Her husband, Matthew, has his hands full with his teenaged girl and boy, and a younger girl as well, all of them products of a highly dysfunctional mother whose sick dependence on them makes it nearly impossible for Matthew and Josie to have a normal life, especially with Lucas added to the mix.<br />It is Tom's adult daughter Dale, however, who causes the most destruction in this story, once again illustrating Trollope's favorite \\"no man is an island\\" theme. Having lost her mother at the tender age of 4, Dale, now a successful businesswoman in her 30s, cannot let go of her clinging (and cloying) attachment to her father Tom or her brother Lucas. She retains a key to her childhood home and barges in whenever she feels like it, despite the fact that Elizabeth, Tom's fianc&eacute;e, now lives there, and that Dale's young step-brother Lucas spends some weekends there as well.<br />Dale is the catalyst for the eventual destruction of some relationships, and the triumph of others. The rippling effect of her neurotic behavior is catastrophic, even though she consciously means no harm. Does love conquer all? Not in this book--and not in real life, either. Kudos to Trollope for pointing this out, and for having the courage to resist a pat ending.t Dale's young step-brother Lucas spends some weekends there as well. <br />Dale is the catalyst for the eventual destruction of some relationships, and the triumph of others.

I HAD to see how, when, or if Cross would figure it out. Patterson kept me on tenterhooks for a good long time, and that gave an extra element of suspense to the book. That's the lure of \\"Book 1,\\" if you will.<br />But for those who might have picked up Violets Are Blue out of order, or as a quick airport read, \\"Book 2\\" is just as good, and the revelation of the Mastermind's true identity as shocking as it was the first time. There are major flaws in the plot, however. The continued behavior of Christine, who has given up her own child, is annoying at best, mind-boggling at worst. The vampire cult is simply not believeable because of the extreme (blood drinking) lengths of the behavior of its members. I found myself wondering how John Samson could give up his day job as a cop at will and go off to spend weeks at a time guarding Cross's family. The connection of the Mastermind with the vampires is never entirely clear, and his after-the-fact link with former criminals such as Casanova and the Gentleman Caller made no sense at all, because it was not explained enough to make sense.<br />Hence, the three stars. But it must be stressed that as a reader, I loved this book anyway, and am impatiently awaiting the next one in the series.	2002-10-18

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did NOT see the end coming, and I DID perceive a reason for the serial killer to be doing his unspeakable thing.<br />The Mastermind is as horrible as they come, and God knows, Alex Cross has faced some of the very worst of \\"humanity.\\" This killer is no more diabolical or even more smart than the rest, but he is harder to catch, because he is always one step ahead of the law enforcement community. And of Alex. And his psychotic pleasure in the deaths of his victims, up to and including sexual release with the dead, is, in my opinion, the reason he murders.<br />Patterson's choppy chapters never bother me. I feel that they heighten the pace, heighten the excitement, and give the reader the feel of the chase as it is really happening. Real-life detectives do not go smoothly from clue to clue until they catch the perpetrator(s), and neither do the ones in Patterson's books. Rather, they are sometimes distracted, misinformed, impatient, and, pun notwithstanding, clueless. Therefore, the choppy chapters reflect in particular Alex Cross's inner self as he tries so hard to nail down the killer while his personal life unravels at his feet.<br />Alex is unable to solve the Mastermind murders, and he is equally unable to stop the disintegration of his relationship with Christine. It is that secondary plot that caused me to remove a star from this book's rating. I simply could not believe the situation, even with the halfhearted explanation of post-traumatic stress disorder, fear of being with a homicide detective, fear of the killer returning, and so forth. I will not be a spoiler and detail everything that bothered me, but Christine's behavior was out of character and unworthy of her as the woman she is supposed to be, trauma or no trauma. And the totally predictable demise of Alex's budding relationship with his female FBI partner was much too pat. This reader saw it coming from a mile away.<br />Nevertheless, I found \\"Roses Are Red\\" intensely suspenseful, high quality, and well worth my time. I recommend it as highly as I do all the others in this terrific series.udding relationship with his female FBI partner was much too pat.

These stories, first published in the Eighties, are as lovely to read as any of her recent best-sellers, and every bit as riveting.<br />I first read this collection years ago, but I had forgotten the stories, forgotten how Pilcher can describe a bedroom, a drawing room, a beach, a sunny day, a cloudy day, an aging spaniel in its basket. When I am deep into a Pilcher story, I can taste the soothing cups of tea. In each story, I am there, as I imagine every reader must be as well. I am simply transported, just as I am when reading her books.<br />I simply marvel at the sheer simplicity of Pilcher's writing. It is so deceptive. Her stories seem to be mere pieces of fluff, but in fact, they are so much more. I already knew that, of course, but I had to be reminded how wonderful her short stories are to read. I cherish this small paperback, and will never let it go.	2002-10-09

Alex Cross is drawn into a diabolical computer game similar to Dungeons and Dragons, but on a much more sinister and sophisticated level. The Four Horsemen play their increasingly ingenious game on encrypted computers around the world. The stakes are very high and rising daily, as one of the players, the self-named Death, spirals out of control.<br />Death, in the person of minor British diplomat Geoffrey Shafer, has crossed the line between fantasy and reality, and his madness has intruded on Cross's life just at a most wonderful and happy time for Alex and his family--his beloved Christine has consented to be his wife.<br />There's not much time for merrymaking, however, before Cross is inexorably drawn into the game, accused of a murder he did not commit, and derided in the media as an out-of-control, murdering cop. Cross would be able to fight with a cool head in just about any circumstance, but Christine has disappeared, perhaps taken by one of the Four Horsemen, and she is presumed dead. It's more than Cross can deal with, despite the help of his family and his dear friend John Samson.<br />There is no time, however, for normal grieving or even self-pity. The game has heated up to a point of excruciating finesse, all at the hands of one of the most dangerous killers ever. And now that killer, the seemingly mild-mannered Geoffrey Shafer, has focused on Alex as an opponent worthy of being part of the game.<br />I read this book in one large gulp. To my mind, it was the best yet in the wonderful Alex Cross series, and I'm sticking to my opinion, even though I know that some reviewers do not agree. I recommend it to anyone who wants a great, suspenseful read. I'm glad there are more books in the series, because I'm hooked and I cannot stop!	2002-10-05

Kienzle's popular Father Koesler series. I found it a bit dated in parts, and a bit shocking in others, but on the whole, it's a good mystery, fun and easy to read.<br />Father Frank Koesler is the editor of the Detroit Catholic, a modest but well-read periodical aimed at Detroit's large Catholic community. Koesler is a good priest and a good man, but realistic about the state of his church in the post-Vatican II era. Like priests nationwide, he and his fellow Detroit priests note with wry despair the dwindling church attendance in their respective parishes.<br />Suddenly, everything changes. An apparent serial killer is targeting priests and nuns, murdering them with professional and cold-blooded efficiency. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the killings, and the police are helpless to stop him. Detective Sergeant Koznicki, himself raised in a rigidly conventional Catholic household, is put in charge of the task force assigned to find and stop the killer. As part of his methodical and excellent police work, he asks Father Koesler, a devotee of paperback murder mysteries, to add his own clerical expertise to the problem at hand.<br />As interesting as the mystery is the behind-the-scenes interplay between the community of priests, who are not above a game of poker, a stiff drink, and heavy smoking when off-duty. As a non-Catholic, I found some of this private look into clerical life a bit disturbing, but interesting, nonetheless. Of special interest was the priests' ongoing and friendly debate on the havoc Vatican II wreaked upon their church, and the endless, corny, and often risque jokes of Father Joe Farmer, who cracks himself up every time upon reaching the punchline, leaving his friends annoyed and bemused.<br />A subplot involving two young reporters at the Detroit Free Press adds real humor to this tale of a tortured murderer and his crazed and deadly mission. A good read, good enough to make the reader want to pick up another Father Koesler mystery.reader want to pick up another Father Koesler mystery.	2002-10-02

Alex Cross is as close to a superhero as a mortal man can be, but even the self-proclaimed Dragon Slayer is in danger from two fiends at once: The psychopathic madman Gary Soneji, his arch rival from \\"Along Came the Spider\\"--and a new, even more psycho murderer named \\"Mr. Smith,\\" who is cutting a wide swathe (literally) all over Europe and the United States.<br />Soneji is, incredibly, out of prison, and he has a mighty score to settle with Cross. So he drops a few hints--like sniper shootings at New York's Grand Central Station. Just for starters. We know that Soneji has Cross's house under surveillance, and that he knows way way too much about Cross's loved ones--his young son and daughter, and his beloved grandmother, Nana Mama. It's only a matter of time before his insane vengeance reaches Cross himself. Cross knows it too, but Soneji is a genius, and even Cross can't find him.<br />Juxtaposed against this mystery is the parallel one of the diabolical Mr. Smith, who has thus far eluded Interpol, Scotland Yard, the FBI, and hundreds of police from Europe and the US. He makes Soneji look like an amateur, and Cross very much does NOT want to get involved in the case, despite pleas from his FBI friends. Yeah, right. When you're the Dragon Slayer, you gotta slay the dragons! Cross is pulled in to the Smith case as well, and it's too much even for him.<br />While all this is going on, Cross is falling head over heels in love with teacher/school principal Christine, who we met in \\"Jack and Jill.\\" Recently widowed, Christine isn't ready for a relationship. And Cross is so involved with the two murder cases, he can't give her all the time he wants. Worse--BOTH murderers know about her too...everyone Alex loves is in danger.<br />My only small criticism with the book is that it suddenly changes from one case to the other right in the middle of the story. And while it makes sense, since one situation has been solved, it is much too abrupt for this reader's comfort. We leave a key player (I won't do a spoiler here) near death--and suddenly that person is recovered and back in action. There's an explanation, but it was a bit too pat for my taste.<br />No matter, though. \\"Cat and Mouse\\" gallops along just like its predecessors, and made me love Alex Cross even more than before.

It starts out as expected...the wolf, huffing and puffing, blowing the first pig's house down--but the poor wolf does NOT get the bacon. These pigs are blown off the pages, tear up the book itself (you'll have to see how), make pages into paper airplanes, invade other fairy tales, and lead the poor old wolf to a veritable nervous breakdown.<br />I'm not sure if a very young child will get the humor, but certainly he or she will love the incredible pictures of the pigs and the wolf, and the unexpected look of the pages upon which the pigs wreak their mayhem. Older children and adults alike will not be able to keep a straight face. What a wonderful, fabulous, ultra-imaginative adventure! I recommend it highly.	2002-09-24

Was I the last person on the planet who did not know how incredibly good you are? No matter...I'm zipping through your books as fast as I can go.<br />\\"1st to Die\\" is not of the calibre of the Alex Cross series, but no matter. Like my introduction to the Cross series, I idly picked up this book (in a beauty parlor, no less), and read the first chapter or so while waiting for my turn under the scissors. Hmmm....bad analogy. Because the killer in this thriller, centered in San Francisco and environs, often uses a knife to dispatch his victims--brand new brides and grooms. Each couple is gruesomely murdered during the honeymoon, and each bride is sexually violated. The case couldn't be worse, and ace homicide inspector Lindsay Boxer is dying to solve it--literally. Young and beautiful, she has just been given devastating medical news about her own state of health.<br />Unable to face her own mortality, Lindsay obsesses about catching the vicious person who is committing the heinous crimes. She races against time in two areas--the murderer's timetable is heating up, and her own health is failing. Enter the Women's Murder Club--what an ingenious plot device! The \\"club\\" consists of Lindsay and three contemporaries who are as smart, strong, and determined as she. One is a reporter (Cindy), one is a medical examiner (Claire) and the last is an up-and-coming superstar in the DA's office (Jill).<br />Lindsay takes strength from her friends, and for the first time in her life, is actually willing to accept help, as each woman uses her particular area of expertise to find and solve clues. There's a love interest as well: a hunky fellow cop who's been assigned to replace Lindsay's regular partner.<br />What makes an otherwise interesting read totally compelling is Patterson's genius with the plot. Think you know who the murderer is? So did I. Think you know why the horrible crimes are being committed? So did I. Think you can predict the ending? Fugeddaboudit. Patterson is three steps ahead of you.<br />I'm ordering the sequel, 2nd Chance, immediately; can't wait to see what new case stymies the Women's Murder Club.ict the ending? Fugeddaboudit.

I felt like I had to stop and breathe every now and then; the plot twists, suspense, surprises, and sheer horror of the plot had me so mesmerized, I almost forgot to do so!<br />Like other Patterson novels, this one, the third in the Alex Cross series, features two parallel horrors, both of which involve the detective in a very personal way. First, a crazed killer is murdering young black children in Cross's own neighborhood, children from his own son's school. The sheer brutality of the murders bespeaks a rage that strikes terror in Cross's heart. But the Washington, D.C. powers that be don't seem to be overly concerned with the horrible happenings in the black neighborhood--they're much more involved with the high-profile, equally mysterious Jack and Jill murders that have captured all the headlines.<br />Jack and Jill are assassins. We're in on their nefarious doings from the beginning, but we don't know who they really are. And neither does the FBI, the CIA, the Secret Service, or the police. They are on a murderous timetable, assassinating increasingly well-known people as part of a single-minded, and seemingly unstoppable, track that leads to the assassination of the President of the United States. Can Cross et al. catch these fiends in time? And what of the child killer? He's got Cross's own children in his crosshairs. Will he strike at Cross's very heart and soul?<br />The sheer humanity and decency of Alex Cross--his intelligence, his love of his family and friends, the piano he plays on the porch to soothe his soul, the grief he still feels for his dead wife--all serve as a counterpoint to the inhumanity of the killers. Cross despairs of the human race as he encounters the horribly murdered bodies of the killers--but any world with Alex Cross in it can't be all bad. Cross sardonically refers to himself as \\"The Dragon Killer,\\" and indeed he is. But this time, he just may be up against a force more evil than anything or anyone he has ever encountered before.<br />As I stated in a previous review, I am new to the Patterson bandwagon, and now I have no intention of getting off! On to the next book in the Cross series.

Launched by a self-righteous terrorist organization (aren't they all?), this baby seeps into the brains of its victims, causing paranoia, extreme violence, unbearable pain, and unspeakable death. The victims are not stellar human beings--most are drug dealers and/or child molesters--but in the throes of the virus, each has murdered an innocent victim, including a cop. Besides, thinks Eve Dallas, who is primary on the case, vigilante justice is never warranted.<br />The story of the terrorist organization, Absolute Purity, and Eve's desperate fight to bring it down, is one of the best JD Robb/Nora Roberts has written in this series. It's fast, it's furious, it's interesting, and not entirely predictable. The deep introspection that has so plagued the last few books in the series is gone, as is the endless back-and-forth battle Eve wages to accept that she is loved. MacNab and Peabody are back, and their relationship has, just in the nick of time (for the reader, anyway), deepened. Roarke is his usual inhumanly gorgeous and brilliant self, Feeney is aboard with his omnipresent bag of candied almonds, and Eve's \\"rad\\" friend Mavis has a surprise that far surpasses her purple hair.<br />All in all, this is one fun read. Unlike the last few in the series, it left me wanting more, and I'm looking forward to the next In-Death release.	2002-09-15

Never really wanted to. So when I idly picked up \\"Kiss the Girls\\" while browsing a local bookstore, I didn't expect much; it was on a table of \\"fun beach reads\\" or some such thing.<br />I read the first page or two. I bought the book. And I can't remember much after that, except that, heart pounding, palms sweating, I entered the obscenely diabolical world of two serial killers: The Gentleman Caller, and Casanova, terrorizing both Coasts at once. With skill and his own brand of genius, Patterson takes the reader into the crazed yet terrifyingly logical minds of each killer. We are there while they stalk their victims: young women who are smart, educated, self-assured, and perfectly beautiful. At least in the eyes of their killers. We are there during some of the most gruesome and terrifying murders. We are there as Casanova sexually tortures his live victims in his House of Horrors, in which one infraction of the \\"house rules\\" results in horrible death.<br />What is the connection between these two killers? What is their sick purpose? It falls to police detective/psychologist Alex Cross to solve the mystery. But Alex has more than a professional interest in the case. His beloved niece Naomi is one of the missing women.<br />I challenge anyone to put this book down once begun. I was absolutely amazed at the hold it had on me--and still does.

Number four in the Carlotta Carlyle mystery series, it offers a great deal of interesting background into Carlotta's life, none of which has been discussed in any depth in the previous three books.<br />The plot centers around an old friend/enemy, Dee Willis, now a blues/rock superstar. In Boston for a major gig, Dee looks up her old pal Carlotta, not for old times' sake, but to help find a missing mutual friend from long ago, a fine blues guitarist who fell into a life of drugs and booze. There's a serious reason why Dee wants Carlotta to find Davey--but doing so unlocks emotions for Carlotta that she'd rather keep buried. Emotions due to the fact that, way back when she and Dee were in the same band, Dee stole Carlotta's husband, bass guitarist Cal.<br />Carlotta agrees to find Davey, but in doing so, she has to slog through old business and old feelings--and confront Cal, something she has never been able to do since he left her.

Many of us who live in the area experienced this crime on a visceral level--it became personal.<br />Therefore, I welcomed the slant of this book, which is the heretofore untold story of the inner workings of the case--how police, prosecutors, and the media overturned the slimy rock under which Craig Rabinowitz lived his sorry life. I found it absolutely fascinating, and read the entire book in one quick sitting, barely able to turn the pages fast enough, even though I know quite well what happened in the end.<br />There are, however, many problems with this book, several of which have been pounced upon by other reviewers. Yes, it's an obvious rush-to-the-publisher mishmash of facts and suppositions. It looked to me as if the author gave himself a quick (and inaccurate, in many cases) lesson on Philadelphia and environs, an equally quick introduction to Judaism, and a day on the Net downloading newspaper articles about the case. There are some ridiculous errors about Philadelphia, one being the name of the suburban railroad, which the author refers to as the Pennsylvania Railroad. That name hasn't been in use for almost 30 years; the local railroad in question is run by a much-maligned but still beloved company that is known to everybody within a 25-mile radius of Center City. The author further states that Merion, where the murder took place, is so terribly exclusive that it doesn't even have a train stop. Wrong...the train stops in Merion, and not all of Merion is wealthy or exclusive, although it is predominantly upscale. The author's description of the Delaware River as viewed from Penn's Landing made me wonder if there is another river somewhere that I might have missed?<br />The same obtains for the quick, presumptive statements on Judaism; there is a yiddish word for mothers-in-law cited in the text, but it's misspelled and misrepresented. Had I written the book, I would have cut way down on the ethnic information. Yes, Jewish people bury their dead as soon as possible, not because they aren't embalmed, but because of respect for the dead and the desire to return dust to dust. For that reason, yes, autopsies are frowned upon, but of course they are conducted if needed. And so forth.<br />AND...I agree that the \\"haunting photos\\" are a joke. Not only are just about all of them shots of the legal teams and police, but they are stock photos, not even candids from the trial or its aftermath. Sheesh, people, do not lie to me! That did make me furious. On the other hand, I have to say that the desire by some reviewers to get comments and aftermath from the close friends of the Rabinowitz family belies these people's very real, and so stated in the book, intense desire for privacy. These people have never granted any interviews of which I am aware, and I don't blame them. It's not easy to live with the fact that your best friend murdered his wife and bilked your family out of a small fortune. As for Rabinowitz's childhood, who cares? I get so sick of books that claim that because so-and-so's puppy died, he grew up to be a mass murderer.<br />The simple fact was--and is--that Craig Rabinowitz was the worst kind of sleaze, and that he got caught. Thank God. Had the author only waited a bit to complete his research, I think he might have written a truly good book. This one isn't bad if you want a quick and dirty read.

I get so sick of books that claim that because so-and-so's puppy died, he grew up to be a mass murderer.<br />The simple fact was--and is--that Craig Rabinowitz was the worst kind of sleaze, and that he got caught. Thank God. Had the author only waited a bit to complete his research, I think he might have written a truly good book. This one isn't bad if you want a quick and dirty read.

Perhaps responding to earlier comments that her works were a tad too academic, brilliant forensic anthropologist/writer Kathy Reichs went the other way in this latest addition to her collection of novels. And the result is a mixed bag.<br />In a complete change of tone from her earlier books, Reichs spikes this fast-moving tale with one-liners, groaners, bon mots, and some hard-bitten detective talk straight out of \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\" It certainly moves the plot along, but I miss the ultra-serious, and yes, sometimes boring Tempe Brennan, the forensic-anthropologist heroine of Reichs' mysteries.<br />In this outing, Brennan is in Guatemala to help a human-rights team unearth and account for the horribly massacred bodies in a mass grave--legacy of the last junta. That in itself is fascinating, but the plot suddenly widens to include a possible serial killer who is murdering the twenty-something daughters of the Guatemalan affluent. The Canadian ambassador to Guatemala is somehow mixed into the plot via his wayward teenaged daughter, and there are enough characters, plots, and subplots in the two parallel stories (mass graves and serial killer) to seriously confuse the reader if one is not paying close attention.<br />Tempe's love interest, Canadian cop Andrew Ryan, has some competition in the form of sexy Special Crimes investigator Bartolome Galiano, who just happens to be a former college roommate of Ryan's. But Tempe has no time for sex, what with her nauseatingly described foray into a teeming cesspool to find human body parts, and her dangerous and probably illegal trip into Guatemala's underbelly to unearth the killer or killers.  The ends all tied together nicely, but there was quite a bit of information to digest, and this reader, for one, was left in a slight muddle.<br />No matter. The book is still worth four stars for the sheer energy and intelligence of the writing. I'm hoping the next book in the series brings back the didactic and frustrating Tempe Brennan her fans have come to know and love.rennan her fans have come to know and love.	2002-09-04

One of you is a surgical resident, one is a brand-new lawyer, and one is a successful real-estate agent. Do you need your 90-year-old grandfather to pick your boyfriends?<br />Yes! Or so thinks irrascible MacGregor patriarch Daniel MacGregor, who meddled in his children's lives, and is now at it again. He wants his three granddaughters married and producing babies for his \\"dear Anna,\\" a successful doctor in her own right who has made no such request. So The MacGregor gets to work...<br />First on his list is Laura, impossibly beautiful and smart, who has joined her parents' law firm after passing the Bar. She doesn't need a man, thank you, and she certainly doesn't need the gorgeous, sexy, smart and tough ex-cop sent by Grandpa to install a security system at Laura's (and her cousins') home. Royce Cameron is a major pain in the neck, and Laura wants nothing to do with him...except that for some inexplicable reason, she can't get the hunky ex-cop off her mind.<br />Gwen, a cool-under-pressure, classically beautiful blonde, is in her second year as a surgical resident. She doesn't need any more pressure, especially from a successful author who is researching his next mystery novel and needs input from a practicing physician. It seems that deep and sexy Bran was recommended by a certain Daniel MacGregor, and shows up at the hospital just as Gwen is saving a life in the ER. Exhausted and disheveled, Gwen wants nothing to do with this guy...who begins to woo her, literally, with wine and roses.<br />Feisty Julia, Laura and Gwen's cousin and former First Daughter, relishes her freedom, especially after years growing up in the White House. What she loves most is to buy property, have it rehabbed, and sell it for huge profits. And she's great at it. She has a contractor she works with, and the last thing she needs is a substitute--the contractor's impossibly hunky son, Cullum. Neither Julia nor Cullum are looking for a relationship, especially with each other, and the intense attraction they feel for one another is just an itch. Right? Ask The MacGregor, who happens to be best buds with Cullum's father.<br />This is a sheer delight from start to finish, Nora Roberts at her very best.

And it educates in such a subtle way that even the most recalcitrant child will come away with a strong sense of who lives in the rain forests and why they must be preserved.<br />Every page features not only the sloth, but another animal as well, illustrated in the most enchanting of collage pictures. At the end of the book, each of these \\"extra\\" animals is listed by its special picture, and identified. And each is native to the rain forest.<br />What more can I say?

In this frank, unembellished, and painfully honest account of her life, from her earliest days as a sensitive child abused by an older sister to her rise to fame to her terribly painful relationships and subsequent breakups, Etheridge simply opens her heart for all to see.<br />The result is a book that is often painful to read. I frequently got the sense that I was a peeping Tom, peering in at secrets and feelings that should not be shared with anyone. Some of Etheridge's experiences, such as her early attempts at heterosexual dating, her dysfunctional early relationships, her love of music, and her dogged determination to be recognized in the world, are not that different from any other celebrity bio. What makes the book different is the pain that Etheridge does not, or cannot, hide.<br />What emerges is an unflinching portrait of a woman whose sensitive inner soul belies her tough public persona. Yes, we've seen it all a hundred times before, but something about the extreme honesty of this tale gets under your skin. I came away with a strong and almost protective admiration for Etheridge, a desire to own all of her CDs, and a prayer that she have inner peace. She certainly deserves it.	2002-09-02

In her world, no man is an island, and everybody is ultimately responsible for the effects of his or her life decisions on those who are near and dear.<br />That's the premise behind \\"Marrying the Mistress,\\" the story of a dignified and esteemed judge, Guy Stockwell, who announces out of the blue that he intends to divorce his wife of 40 years, Laura, and marry his heretofore secret mistress of  7 years, Merrian. The shockwaves from this decision, which the judge and Merrian had considered very private and personal, affect everyone in their lives, whether they want it to or not.<br />Thus, Laura, the self-centered, clinging, deliberately obtuse \\"wronged wife,\\" becomes even more annoying, and drops all of her problems in the lap of her son Simon, a lawyer in his 30s with a wife and three children of his own. Laura plays the guilt card so successfully that Simon becomes hopelessly entwined in his parents' troubles. He cannot extricate himself, and this in turn puts dangerous pressure on his marriage. His wife, Carrie, feels that she now has to fight her mother-in-law for Simon's love and attention--and she is right. Carrie and Simon's older two children, teenaged Jack and Rachel, are terribly affected by their parents' unhappiness, and their younger sister starts to suffer from days-long headaches.<br />Simon's gay brother Alan, who has finally met the love of his life, just wants everybody to be happy so he can bask in the glow of his new relationship. His role is to continually smooth things over, only to have the \\"smoothing\\" rejected or ignored.<br />Merrion, the mistress, is much younger than Guy. A self-possessed woman in her 30s, she is an up-and-coming lawyer whose intense love for Guy never rings true, at least to this reader. Merrion is much too selfish to give herself to anybody. A supposedly brilliant woman, she is completely bemused by the effect her relationship with Guy is having on his family and on her own widowed mother, and she misses the exciting secrecy of being his clandestine lover rather than his bride-to-be.<br />At the center of this emotional maelstrom is Guy, whose career as a judge enables him to see all sides of the problem. He feels for his rejected wife, his uptight mistress, his beleagured sons, his grandchildren--even his dogs, who are bewildered by his disappearance from the family home.

In this Shel Silverstin sleeper (not one of his best-known books), the value of owning a rhinoceros is illustrated on each page in the most delightful black and white drawings. It seems a rhino can double as a table lamp, keep one warm at night (although a rhino lying on one's body at night can be a bit smothering), play jump rope, keep one's angry parents at bay if one has been naughty, and so many other things.<br />We also find out that rhinos are not partial to bathing, and although they will allow themselves to dress up as a girl for Halloween, it's not a favorite with the average male rhino.<br />By the time this book is over, your kids will be clamoring to go to the store and buy a rhinoceros--and who can blame them!

To the powers that be: Please re-release this wonderful book, one of the best by Linda Barnes, and certainly worthy of attention from readers new and old.<br />In this Carlotta Carlyle classic, a serial killer is stalking Hispanic women, all illegal aliens, in Carlotta's native Boston. The murders are grisly and vicious, and fear of being sent back to their equally grisly and vicious native lands are keeping the victims' friends from talking. Carlotta finds herself in the middle of the trouble after an anonymous woman asks for help--and it's soon Carlotta herself who needs the help.<br />As readers of these mysteries know, Carlotta has a beloved \\"little sister,\\" a Hispanic child named Paolina, whom the detective loves dearly. But with the dark mystery threatening the Hispanic community, Paolina changes overnight from a sunny, bright and loving child to one who is surly and uncommunicative. Is Paolina's mother Marta in danger from the serial killer? Is Paolina herself being threatened? What is the secret they will not reveal?<br />Even though this reader guessed the killer about halfway through the book, it in no way detracted from the great story, and chilling secrets revealed in the end.<br />A great read, and worth digging for.	2002-08-23

And when his beloved but meddling grandfather Daniel wheedles Duncan into accepting a singer for the boat's lounge, Duncan is highly displeased. Enter Cat Ferrell, a foxy, purring powerhouse of a singer with a flirtatious manner that hides a sensitive and hurt soul. No way is Cat getting involved with her gorgeous new boss. No way is Duncan getting involved with this pert and petite singer. So Daniel has to take the &quot;lovely Anna&quot; on a little riverboat holiday...<br />Stalwart, handsome, and brilliant attorney Ian MacGregor is the son of the former Attorney General, and nephew of the former President, D.C.'s father. But Ian rejects the media's supposition that he, too, is being groomed for politics. Quiet and polite, Ian is nevertheless very much his own man, and law is the life he has chosen.

That's what prompts her to reluctantly rent a room in her house to one of the &quot;movie people&quot; who have arrived en masse from Hollywood to make one of Quinn's books into a film. It is Quinn who rents the room.

I have always considered Wuthering Heights the best offering from the Bronte brood. It may be a soap opera, but WHAT a soap opera--and besides, the writing, dark and Victorian though it is, is superb and more than a little mad.<br />The two most over-used adjectives used to describe this book are \\"dark and brooding.\\" So I won't use them, but it will be hard. Because out of the ashes, almost literally, of a dark, dreary, oppressive estate on the English moors flames the love affair of all time: the daughter of the house, Catherine, and the wild foundling brought into the family as a child--Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff have a special bond, even as children, but when adulthood arrives, their bond flares into unbearable passion.<br />Tortured Heathcliff wandering the moors calling for Cathy; married Cathy dying in her bed for love of Heathcliff; ahhhh. Nothing better. One wonders, of course, what forbidden thoughts churned beneath the genteel breast of Emily Bronte as she wrote of this unmistakeably sexual and erotic relationship. I have also wondered more than once if Heathcliff was modeled on the Bronte Sisters' wild and untameable brother Bramwell. But I am no literary historian. I am only a lover of books, and this particular one resides on my all-time top ten. If you have never read it, or if you consider it one of those dreary required assignments you fled in high school, give it another chance. There is nothing else like it.	2002-08-14

Long and boring stints in the ICU (for both Anna and the reader) are interspersed with acute anxiety attacks, and a pressing need for space. Liberty Island, which is actually one of three islands, is--surprise--a national park, and Anna bunks with a ranger friend rather than stay at Molly's tony apartment in Manhattan. Of course, Anna being Anna, she stumbles onto some nefarious doings, not only in Lady Liberty herself, but in the decayed buildings of Ellis Island. Her snooping is not taken well by the resident staff--to the point where her life may be in danger.<br />I don't know why I found the detailed descriptions of the inner workings of the Statue of Liberty, and the endless visits to the decaying buildings of Ellis Island, so boring. Linda Fairstein described much the same thing in one of her books, and it slowed her plot considerably, in my opinion. Perhaps it was this sense of deja vu that annoyed me so much in \\"Liberty Falling.\\"<br />At any rate, I found the going very slow, to the point where I kept forgetting which character was which.<br />Added to the slow pace of the mystery is the intensely annoying courtship of Anna's sister by geeky G-man Frederick Stanton, who has become increasingly hard to take in each successive book. Why the fabulous Molly would respond to Stanton, even in her half-dead state, is beyond me. Anna has some problems with it as well, but for different reasons, as loyal readers of this series know.<br />A half-baked \\"romance\\" between Anna and Molly's doctor adds nothing to the plot for most of the book, except for the chance to \\"view\\" Anna in a sexy dress and high heels (a first). The mystery does come, at last, to a satisfying conclusion, but not soon enough. For devotees of the Anna Pigeon series, this book provides a necessary link in the ongoing story of Anna's life. For casual readers, this is one to skip. It falls far short of the previous six books in the series.the ongoing story of Anna's life. For casual readers, this is one to skip.

Those who have been editing medical books and journals a long time, like me, know it's a tool that is essential to our job. Those who are new to the profession find out quickly!<br />Every possible medical condition is described in this easy-to-read, easy-to-navigate treasure. Some of the peskiest problems in medical editing, knowing when to italicize a genus and/or species, and even identifying which IS a genus and/or species, is a quick page away with Dorlands. Therefore, I no longer fear the mention of pseudomonas (if I haven't spelled this right, forgive me...my Dorlands is back at the office!)<br />There are many other medical dictionaries, but most medical editors in the know use this one. And I imagine most medical students to as well. It's simply one of a kind.	2002-08-03

This is the REAL Bambi, the version where a terrible creature called MAN is the enemy, and where the cute and cuddly forest creatures die, and die horribly because of said MAN.<br />Like Black Beauty, Bambi is a plea for the rights of animals. The message was not lost on me as a young girl, nor is it lost on me now. The senselessness of hunting (my personal point of view) is described in terms an older child can understand--and remember. But a word to parents. Bambi's beloved, gentle, wonderful mother is shot and dies. That's enough to traumatize a young child right there (I didn't do so well with it either, and I was around 8 or 9). There is a vicious, graphically described forest fire. There is the death of the noble, revered (both by Bambi, the forest creatures, and the reader) Great Stag. In the end, Bambi comes into great stagdom himself, and we look to him to continue to try to save the forest and everybody in it.<br />This is a book, however innocent it seems, that can literally change a life. It did mine, and I know it did others whom I knew and have met since. My lifelong horror of hunting definitely came from this book, as did my reluctance to \\"cull\\" the deer that run wild in suburban Pennsylvania, eating one's roses. I don't want them to do it, and I see the logical reason for a \\"cull,\\" but I cannot abide the thought.<br />I think every older child should read this version of Bambi as part of one's coming of age. It's a masterpiece of its kind.	2002-08-03

Her dear friend Mooney is all over the Boston tabloids, accused of being a cop on the take. Her beloved Little Sister, a spunky hispanic child named Paolina, is stuck in Colombia with no way home. A missing persons case involving a teenaged rich girl is beginning to smell like big trouble at Boston's preppiest high school. And to top it off, Carlotta's bathroom is being remodeled in deep brown and day-glo orange by The Twins, shady brothers who divide their time between the job and Carlotta's roommate Roz.<br />All in all, Carlotta wants a long, hot, uninterrupted bath. But the only person she can think of who has the bathtub of her dreams is Sam Gianelli, her currently off-again passionate lover who also happens to be the son of Boston's Godfather.<br />The plot is fast and furious, and the mysteries are satisfying in this 1990 outing. Carlotta's real concern for Mooney, a stalwart and dedicated cop who's been framed, is shared by the reader. And her palpable disdain for the rich-kids' tony prep school is equally shared. But this doesn't mask the real essence of the book: Will Carlotta's bathroom ever be finished?<br />A fun read. Highly recommended.	2002-07-31

There is a baby daughter, Penelope, the apple of everyone's eye. The Goose Bar ranch is finally doing well, thanks in no small part to Ken and his wonderhorse, the racing champion Thunderhead. And Ken? Now a fine and handsome young man, he is head over heels in love with a headstrong young blueblood named Carey, whose aristocratic grandmother looks down on Ken and his entire family. And therein lies the plot. Will Ken win Carey the way he stubbornly won his first love, his horse Flicka? Will Carey break free from her domineering grandmother? Will they live happily ever after?<br />Juxtaposed to this wonderful romance is the story of Nell, who has changed dramatically from the previous books. She is now subject to sudden and debilitating anxiety attacks, and is convinced that she is going to die. Her enduring marriage and her love for her family cannot break her anxiety, and all who know and love her are worried--but unable to help.<br />This is a strong and wonderful book, and most definitely should be saved for the teenaged years, no younger than 12, to my mind. But why save it for the kids? This is a romance complete with horses, handsome heroes, and strong, heroic women. A perfect read for any time you want a good escape into a better time.	2002-07-28

The divine Angela Thirkell, to my mind a latter-day Jane Austen, wrote her simply wonderful novels about upper-class village life in pre-war England, in a series of 40 or so novels that are simply irresistable. Her plots captured a time, a mind-set, and a way of life that is long gone, and in fact, her later novels, set just after the war, already reflected a desperate nostalgia for a never-to-return past.<br />Never mind, though, because &quot;High Rising,&quot; one of the earliest of Thirkell's series, is a delight you won't soon forget. The plot centers, as always, on a blithering author whose high-piled hair is continually in disarray, often spewing hairpins at the most inappropriate of times. A widow, she has raised several strapping sons, and is now engaged in trying to educate her youngest, the irrepressible and impossibly boring 8-year-old, Tony. To do so, she must churn out novels, and to that end, she employs a secretary named Anne Todd. And so the plot begins.<br />Anne is a selfless creature who uncomplainingly cares for her ailing elderly mother, a task that is draining her almost to illness. But plucky pre-war Britishers of a certain class never complained, and neither does Anne. The plot thickens when a truly horrid gold-digger appears to become secretary to another author, and proceeds to wreak terrible havoc on this close-knit society. She is truly an &quot;incubus,&quot; which becomes her secret nickname.<br />So. What will become of the incubus? Will she succeed in her nefarious plot to marry wealthy Geoffrey, a scholarly author who doesn't have a clue? If so, what of Geoffrey's teenaged daughter? Who will mind the dogs? Will High Rising (Tony's prep school) survive yet another class of noxious boys? Will the good village doctor, besotted by Anne, be successful in his gentlemanly courtship?<br />And most of all...can anyone resist this book??	2002-07-27

This book is so much fun, and so perfect for very young children. As the letters chase each other up and down the tree, the inevitable happens...they all fall down! And then what happens? They start all over again.<br />Your kids will delight, as mine did, in the rapid pace, rhythmic wording (you just can't help swaying along with the words) and bright, bold, simple illustrations.

Like \\"My Friend Flicka,\\" it isn't a children's book per se. It's a dark book, really, reflecting a lot of harsh reality, from Rob McLaughlin's ongoing and desperate struggle to keep his Goose Bar Ranch from financial ruin, to the constant and sometimes overwhelming battle to survive against the harsh Wyoming wildnerness, to a son's increasingly rebellious need to prove himself as a man.<br />Ken McLaughlin has matured greatly in this book. He is no longer the quiet dreamer afraid of his own shadow, and particularly of his father. But his thoughtful sensitivity is still evident, and when his beloved mare Flicka gives birth to her first foal, Ken must strain all his inner resources to fight for her and her baby.<br />The foal, Thunderhead, is a throwback to a wild strain that Rob has tried for years to breed out of his thoroughbred stock. Pure white and headstrong, Thunderhead is a direct descendant of a renegade stallion that sired a line of untameable horses. Rob takes one look at the colt, and wants him sold, gelded, or worse. But Ken loves Flicka's son, and battles to train him as a racehorse. As father and son face off in love and fury, each refuses to budge. And gentle Nell, long the backbone of the family, cannot help this time. She is facing the first real crisis in her marriage--one that threatens to tear the family apart as much as the standoff over Thunderhead.<br />I highly recommend this book for adults who love a good, old-fashioned adventure with lots of action and scenery, and lots of good, meaty characterizations. In my view, the book is not appropriate for young children. It can be graphic and scary, but an older child will love the adventure.	2002-07-26

An indoor person myself, I was perfectly comfortable with the descriptions of the various and sundry caving gear, body positions necessary to squeeze through outrageously small openings formed of solid rock, and horrendously dangerous slithering over bottomless caverns. Never boring, these descriptions of caving are fascinating, as is the explanation of the otherworldly cave, Lechuguilla Cavern, only discovered in the mid-1980s, and estimated to extend for more than 300 miles.<br />Anna is a card-carrying claustrophobe, and has absolutely no intention of entering Lechuguilla or any other underground area, even the touristy parts of Carlsbad Caverns. But a caving accident leaves her dear friend Frieda severely injured, perhaps mortally, and Frieda has been calling for Anna. As the rescue team assembles and the painstaking plans are made to plumb the unspeakably dangerous depths of the cave, Anna is asked to join the team in order to calm and care for Frieda during the treacherous rescue operation. Quelling her fears, Anna agrees, and so the adventure begins.<br />As if the cave were not frightening enough, it soon becomes apparent to Anna, if not to anyone else, that a murderer is among them. If the team and their injured mate does not perish of natural causes in the dangerous cave, will they be murdered instead?<br />The plot as it unravels is absolutely riveting, and the sense of being beneath the surface of the earth for days at a time is palpable. Barr has done it again; she is a truly fine writer.	2002-07-23

This wonderful, wacky, delightful work might well be the perfect introduction to absurd humor on a child's level. In a lilting, rhythmic rhyme (just the type young children love), a little farm girl discovers some strange goings on...the horse is in the pigpen! And so it goes all through the farm, as each set of animals is in the wrong place...and the little girl punctuates each discovery with \\"Heeeeey Ma!\\"<br />The illustrations are simply perfect, thanks to the talents of the fabulous Megan Lloyd. My favorites have to be the cat in the duckpond (as if!!) and of course the last and funniest displacement...the cow in the little girl's bed! Even a very young child can laugh at the ridiculous, and this charming book is guaranteed to provide a belly laugh.<br />A wonderful addition to a child's library. I recommend it highly!	2002-07-22

I first read it at the age of 9, and have read it many, many more times throughout my life.<br />As a 9-year-old, I loved the story of the sensitive boy, Ken, and his filly Flicka, who has questionable bloodlines and does not meet with the approval of Ken's stern rancher father, Rob McLaughlin. Boy and horse must surmount that initial disapproval and all sorts of other challenges as they struggle and grow together.<br />But on another level entirely, My Friend Flicka is the story of a marriage that is so real, so adult, and so compelling, that any adult can appreciate the story. In a nutshell: Rob McLaughlin, a former captain in the Army (this was written shortly after World War II), is struggling to make a success of his Goose Bar Ranch, where he raises thoroughbreds in the rugged Wyoming countryside. His wife, Nell, is a blueblood from the East whose apparent fragility masks an inner strength that is Rob's lifeline. A delicate-looking beauty, Nell nevertheless can deliver foals at midnight, weather all the storms that ranching throws her way, and still feed a hungry crew of workers three times a day.<br />Rob and Nell's marriage is strong and passionate. But their one bone of contention is their second son, Ken, a daydreamer who simply does not fit the mold of Rob's ideal son. Older boy Howard is the perfect McLaughlin: athletic, strong, personable, talented, outgoing. Ken is slight, small, quiet, sickly, and above all, a creative dreamer. But when he sets his sights on a horse of which his father strongly disapproves, Nell fiercely backs his choice. And Ken begins to grow as a man--in his own way and in his own speed. And Rob learns some strong lessons about being a man, a father, and a husband.<br />If you have never read this book, or if it lives on your child's bookshelves, give yourself a treat. It's much more than you think.	2002-07-21

One is the anguish of infertility, and how it can tear apart the strongest of marriages, causing bitterness that can run rife through extended families. Another is the terror of teen suicide and its aftermath of copycat suicides among impressionable and troubled youths. The third issue is the destructive nature of gossip, and how it can harm the gossipers as well as those being talked about. And finally, there is the old standby--marital infidelity.<br />If all this sounds too heavy to stand, forgive me. There is a good story here, made all the more interesting because the main characters are facing and coping with real-life problems, and they do NOT respond to them with perfect solutions, but rather bumble along doing their best, like real people do.<br />Amanda and Graham, the infertile couple, react helplessly as their passionate and strong marriage all but disintegrates in the wake of prescribed sex and mood-altering fertility drugs. Karen and Lee, whose marriage has been strained to the breaking point by his infidelities, find their lives torn asunder in ways they could not have predicted. Georgia and Russ, seemingly the perfect 21st century couple (she runs a business, he's a house husband), are facing the strain of trying to keep a family going while remaining a successful upscale couple.<br />And then there is Gretchen. Beautiful Gretchen, young second wife of a much-beloved neighbor, Ben, who has died over a year ago when the book begins. Ben's first wife, June, had been friend and mentor to the three women, Amanda, Karen and Georgia--and her own death years earlier devastated them all. When Ben brought his new wife Gretchen into the picture, none of the three women could stomach her. And that is the only part of the book I found annoying--three highly intelligent, sensitive and thoughtful women are going to blackball a young woman and label her a trophy wife with no attempt to get to know her? Apparently so.<br />And when Gretchen shows up pregnant long after her now-deceased husband could have fathered the child, vicious tongues start to wag. Who is the father? That question, and Gretchen herself, becomes the catalyst for all that follows.<br />Despite the real annoyance the reader may feel about the neighbors' treatment of Gretchen, nevertheless, this is a good book and a satisfying read.found annoying--three highly intelligent, sensitive and thoughtful women are going to blackball a young woman and label her a trophy wife with no attempt to get to know her?

I imagined everything in black and white throughout my quick gallop through these wonderful pages.<br />Having never read a Linda Barnes mystery before, I was enthralled by the gritty language, the down-and-dirty description of the Boston streets, the no-nonsense tone, and above all, the main character, PI Carlotta Carlyle.<br />Written in the mid 80s, this book is not outdated in the least. The plot concerns a group of Irish-American cabbies, all over 50, who may be running money and guns for the now-severly-restricted IRA. Accidentally stumbling into their activities while investigating a missing persons case, Carlotta finds herself in very deep trouble--the kind that can easily end in murder.<br />This is a perfect book to devour one lazy afternoon while shutting the rest of the world out. I loved it, and intend to sample more Linda Barnes mysteries from now on.	2002-07-15

Never fear, though: Stephanieholics are still offered their fair share of the gun in the cookie jar, Grandma Mazur, the Plum Parents (better than ever), Rex the Hamster, Bob the Dog (complete with the barfing we have come to know and love with Bob), the irrepresible Lula the ex-ho, and of course the sexy combatants for Stephanie's hand (or whatever else they can touch): Ranger and Morelli.<br />Stephanie's sister Valerie, complete with her daughter-who-thinks-she's-a-horse, has come into her own in this book, revealing a Burg-worthy personality that is on its way to being as funny as Steph's. And we have a wonderful new character, Albert Kloughn (pronounced \\"Clown,\\" but don't tell Albert I said so), a lawyer without any cases, and the body of the Pillsbury Doughboy.<br />With all this, however, there is a story here. And it displays more reality than Stephanie has had to face in many a book. She is asked to find a missing woman and child, known to all in the tight-knit Burg, who are on the run from an abusive husband/father and a sadomasochistic, extremely dangerous, and not at all funny head of a gangster \\"family.\\" Evelyn, the missing woman, and her 7-year-old daughter Annie, are in real danger, and as hilarious as Stephanie can be, this part is not played for laughs.<br />The result is a perfect blend of laugh-aloud (and I did, many times) vintage Stephanie, and a new, welcome turn in the series that has probably saved its life. As a loyal reader, I'm thrilled with this serendipitous turn of events, especially since I can still count on at least one blown-up car no matter how serious the plot.<br />Oh...one other thing before I head off with Steph to grab some donuts...things with Ranger AND Morelli...heheheheh. I can say no more. Read the book!!!	2002-07-13

There's an equally creepy crawly and very surly biologist whose mission in life is to Save the Turtles (by helping them lay their eggs and get back to the sea safely), an impossibly pregnant and very weepy wife who may or may not be involved in nefarious deeds, two vintage WWII ladies who take no nonsense, and an adorable pet fawn named Flicka who thinks he's a dog.<br />It was only with Flicka that I took issue. Where was Barr's heretofore wonderful editor?

I wish I could have given it 3 and a half stars. It's not bad, just unnecessarily confusing.<br />The plot centers around a young woman who wins the ultimate jackpot on the aptly named Greed Machine, a slot machine at one of Lake Tahoe's casinos. Rather than jumping for joy, however, Jessie Potter seems terrified at her $7 million windfall. And the casino is not that anxious to award her prize either. In no time, Jessie is plucked out of her very private life and into real danger. By the time her case lands in Nina Reilly's lap, the young woman is in danger of losing the money--and possibly her life. And she's not the only one in jeopardy. A pudgy Chinese-American computer geek named Kenny, who happened to be sitting next to Jessie when she won the jackpot, becomes inextricably entwined in her problems.<br />And OUR problem at this point in the book is that neither Jessie nor Kenny are particularly likeable. It took me quite some time to care about either of them--a necessity in this plot-heavy novel. I was more concentrated on the sub-plot involving a compulsive gambler with a Glock and a murderous obsession with the jackpot he believes is his, not Jessie's.<br />A further subplot is the ongoing and at this point annoyingly frustrating relationship between Paul, Nina's indispensable private eye and sometime lover, and Nina, still mourning the loss of her husband. Paul loves Nina, Paul wants Nina, but as in all the other books, Nina isn't sure, and Paul can't take much more rejection. He's in for it, though--from Nina arriving in his hotel room, stark naked under her full-length coat--and then at the critical moment changing her mind, to a blithering series of coitus interruptus that began to take on the aura of the Keystone Kops. I found the whole thing annoying and insulting to both characters. This is NOT a Stephanie Plum novel, where that kind of thing happens all the time. t doesn't belong in the Nina Reilly series, and this reader, for one, is tired of it.<br />The book does pick up speed, however, as we become more involved with Jessie and Kenny, learn their secrets, worry about the danger they are in, and root for Nina to help them both. Near the very end of the book, a triumphant courtroom scene reveals a hidden secret that changes the course of several lives. It's a great ending, a thoroughly enjoyable and believable climax. Unfortunately...the book does not end there. It goes on for several more chapters as we follow the original murderer, still bent on claiming his jackpot. There is so much happening in this quasi-epilogue, it is intensely confusing. Then finally, in two pages, everything is wrapped up in a neat red bow, happily ever after. Except for Nina and Paul and the various murdered people and the murderer himself and the slimy despicable opposing lawyer, the hated Jeff Reisner.<br />Whew! It's exhausting just writing the review.

As spike camp medic, Anna is deep in the fray. But her security officer side doesn't get called into play until later in the book--after a terrifying firestorm that traps Anna and her colleagues in an inferno from which there is no escape. Barr's description of the firestorm is so realistic, and so frightening, that I must believe she has lived through such an experience herself. As always with her books, I felt that I, too, was huddled beneath the fireproof foil the firefighters call \\"Shake and Bake,\\" desperately trying to breathe while intense flames roared over the top of the flimsy little shelter. I won't be a spoiler and say who survives and who does not--but I will say that murder rears its ugly head even as Anna and crew are struggling to survive the flames' holocaust.<br />Those who have read the three previous books will be glad to see the return of FBI agent Frederick Stanton, whose interest in Anna has gained much momentum. Feisty southern ranger-in-training Jennifer Short is also in this book, fighting a personal tragedy that threatens her survival even more than the aftermath of the firestorm--when she, Anna, and several others are trapped in the burned-out forest with no food, no medical facilities for the badly burned, and the knowledge that whoever committed the murder is among them.<br />The mystery, as usual with Barr's novels, is secondary to the fascinating venue of Anna Pigeon's world. I will never watch TV footage of a forest fire, as I did while I was reading this book, in the same way again. I feel like I have been on the front lines as well, which is Nevada Barr's great talent as a writer. This is a terrific read!e front lines as well, which is Nevada Barr's great talent as a writer.

I was entranced from the very first sentence: \\"Celia del Pino, equipped with binoculars and wearing her best housedress and drop pearl earrings, sits in her wicker swing guarding the north coast of Cuba.\\"<br />From that moment on, I was drawn as surely into this book as the tides in the sea that Celia is guarding. \\"Dreaming in Cuban\\" tells the story of the Cuban Revolution from the point of view of three generations of women: the above-mentioned Celia, the grandmother; her daughters, Felicia and Lourdes; and Lourdes' own daughter, Pilar. Each of the three older women, and perhaps Pilar, a 20-ish New York artist, is quite totally mad. Thus we see and hear and feel the revolution from the hallucinatory perceptions of Celia, who worships El Lider (Castro) with ferocity; Felicia, who is torn between old Cuba--its superstitions, its voodoo, its passion--and the modern Cuba, where she is sentenced to a work camp; and Lourdes, who has escaped to Brooklyn and proudly owns the Yankee Doodle Bakery.<br />There is violence, murder, passion, birth and death in this book, but all told in a sort of lyrical mist, so that the reader feels the torpid heat of the Cuban day, the gentle warmth of the sea, and the breezes that stir the palms. All is dreamlike, which makes the reality of modern Cuba almost impossible to grasp. As one of the main characters says toward the end of the book: \\"Cuba is a peculiar exile...an island-colony. We can reach it by a thirty-minute charter flight from Miami, yet never reach it at all.\\"<br />And yet, after reading this incredible book, I feel for the first time that I have some understanding of that small island nation. Or maybe it is all a dream.	2002-06-20

And yet, the Pepper house is full of love. The five children, Ben, Polly, Davie, Joel and Phronsie, all help their mother in the day-to-day chores that make up their rough existence.<br />True to the mores of the time, Polly helps her mother sew so she can earn her pitiful pennies as a seamstress. The older boys do odd jobs and their chores. They frequently have nothing to eat but a cold potato, and when measles strikes the house, the almost deadly consequences just about tear the family apart. But their strength and love pulls them through--just in time to meet a family that will change their lives forever.<br />If you want your child to learn true family values, and to see and value the true spirit of giving, this is the book. Without preaching, without being cloying, without hammering the point home, \\"The Five Little Peppers\\" is a lasting testament to all that is good in people. Its charm is as strong today as it was generations ago.	2002-06-14

As in her other two books, Barr makes the reader experience the site. It is her great gift--reading about the kivas and mesas and the haunting spirits of the primitive Anasazi, who originally constructed the mesas, I felt I was there. I could feel the heat of the air, smell the surrounding vegetation, feel the sandstone. And, along with Anna, who is becoming more likeable with every book, I worried about seemingly nefarious activites in the park--of of which ends in the death of a fellow ranger. Anna knows the death is not accidental, but try as she might, she cannot put together the increasingly strange and seemingly unrelated clues.<br />Along comes \\"Fred the Fed,\\" whom we met  the last book. He and Anna team up to solve the mystery, and the interplay between them is a true delight.<br />I find this series a true delight as well; the concept of a park ranger as law-enforcement detective is so different, and so perfect, as are the descriptions of the incredible national parks. I am getting a real education, here! This is the perfect book to take to the beachl or the pool or the park--easy, fun, gently suspenseful, and perfect.	2002-06-14

And \\"A Season in Purgatory\\" is, in this reviewer's opinion, the best of the lot.<br />It is particularly worth reading in mid-2002, when the almost 30-year-old case it is based on has come to trial, with spectacular results. Dunne himself, who wrote this novel based on sketchy information, has said he was surprised at how close he came in his story to the facts as they were revealed in the real-life trial of Michael Skakel, accused of bludgeoning to death his beautiful, 15-year-old neighbor, Martha Moxley, when he too was a teenager.<br />\\"A Season in Purgatory\\" is Dunne's chilling, unvarnished version of what must have happened that long-ago night of October 30, in the affluent town of Greenwich, CT, involving the most celebrated and affluent family of them all. Himself the father of a murdered daughter, Dunne spares no sympathy for the perpetrator in the novel. Rather, he paints a murky psychological portrait of a young man who not only commits a heinous crime, but whose family and friends help cover it up. Fact or fiction? In lieu of recent events, a re-read of this fine novel is in order, if only to compare the fictional to the real. But either way, this is a beautifully written mystery drama that hooks the reader from the first page to the last.<br />For those who enjoy crime novels, this is a must-read classic.	2002-06-13

Nell and Ripley and their husbands are in the story as well, and it is a pleasure to read about them again, but this is definitely Mia's story. It is up to her to turn back an ancient curse that threatens to send the entire island of Three Sisters (loosely based on Martha's Vineyard, I believe) back into the sea. The curse is deadly--and very strong. Both Nell and Ripley, in the two previous books, did their parts to weaken the curse, and now Mia must complete it.<br />But it isn't that easy. As a sinister fog surrounds Mia and all that she loves, she must gather her power to fight not only the curse, but her own heart. For Mia's old lover, Sam Logan, has returned to the island after 11 years away. Is it her destiny to take him back? And if it is, can she overlook the terrible hurt he caused when he left her the first time?<br />In the end, all is resolved in the most satisfying of ways. This is one of Nora's trilogies that has the reader begging for more, hoping against hope that Nora will continue the story into the second generation. She's done it before--I hope she does it again, because I hate to leave the Three Sisters behind!	2002-06-10

Buck)	Books	5	163	167	N	N	A Masterpiece	Imperial Woman tells the story of Tzu-Hsi, the last Empress of China. It is well known that she was a formidable, fierce and cruelly efficient leader, but this story begins when she is a beautiful young teenager, vibrant, full of life, and deeply in love with her cousin, a handsome and stalwart guard at the Imperial Palace.<br />As was the custom in the day (as I learned from this book), the Emperor yearly picked a new crop of concubines from the daughters of the wealthy of China. It was considered a great honor to send one's daughter into whoredom at the palace, and the shocking details of how they were chosen and used make up the first part of the book. Our heroine, who is still known by her childhood name, Yehonala, is sent, along with her cousin Sakota--both are picked. On one inevitable night, Yehonala is sent to the Emperor's bedroom, and there loses her innocence forever, in more ways than one.<br />Swiftly becoming the Emperor's favorite, our heroine learns the intrigues of the palace, learning to trust nobody but to rely on only those closest to her. She consolidates her position by giving birth to the Emperor's only son, thus receiving the new name of &quot;fortunate mother&quot;--and a place of power higher than any woman in the palace.<br />But was the Emperor's son really his son? Can the formerly innocent concubine, fast becoming a political player worthy of anybody in today's world, stay alive to see her son crowned? Or will she be murdered in the truly baroque but terribly dangerous palace in-wars?<br />All is told in this fascinating book, written in Buck's simple but elegant style. This is one of her best, and well worth finding and reading.	2002-06-08

In this second of the delightful Anna Pigeon series, our intrepid Park Ranger is stationed at Lake Superior, probably the most unforgiving and treacherous of all the Great Lakes.<br />Just like her first book in the series, \\"Track of the Cat,\\" Barr draws the reader quickly and completely into the medium--in this case, the cold, eerie and wicked Lake Superior. In no time, I was suited up with Anna, ready to make a life-threatening dive down to a well-known shipwreck that houses five ghostly bodies--and one very new one.<br />Who killed fellow ranger Denny Castle, himself a skilled and \\"superior\\" diver? How did his body, dressed in macabre costume, become lodged in the engine room of the wreck? Anna and her fellow Rangers, an eclectic and motley crew if there ever was one, set out in their various ways to solve the mystery. They are aided, whether they like it or not, by a brash young FBI operative who is certain that the murder is drug-related.<br />The identity of the murderer and the motive behind the murder take a back seat to the truly unique and wonderful descriptions of the place, the people, and especially Anna, who is one tough cookie. Almost.<br />A great, quick, summer read. I recommend \\"A Superior Death\\" to anybody who enjoys a well-written, if not a psychologically challenging, mystery. Anna Pigeon, in my mind, is one of the great characters, and well worth this reader's time.	2002-06-06

She has chosen probably one of the most hackneyed, overdone venues and has come up with nothing new.<br />In a story that kept reminding me of Sandra Brown and Nora Roberts, Ross tells the tale of star-crossed lovers Jack Callahan, once the bayou bad boy, now an ex-DEA agent and best-selling author, and his former sweetheart. Jack has returned to his roots and bought the decaying mansion that belonged to his first and only love: Danielle Dupree (what a name!). But guess what: After losing her cheating husband, a senator, Danielle has ALSO returned home, along with her young son. She has accepted a job as a librarian, and is unaware that her former lover has purchased the house in which she grew up.<br />Jack and Danielle inevitably meet. Desire blooms. They clash. They argue. They give in to the inevitable. Then, just as it looks like they will have a happy ending at last, a plot twist shows up in the form of a long-lost relative (I will say no more for fear of spoiling the plot).<br />Jack is a likeable cliche. When we meet him at the beginning of the book, he is an interesting, intellectual, erudite, been-around type of guy. But when he's with Danielle, he lapses into the most annoying Cajun patois. We know he is sexy and gorgeous...Ross describes him as having the face of a fallen angel, which I could swear is how Nora Roberts (aka JD Robb) describes her hero Roarke in one of her books. Perhaps not. But it's not an original description.<br />The sensual scenes, however, are great. I found myself, during boring passages (and there are a lot of them) paging through to the next electric meeting between Jack and Danielle. Then I would have to go back to pick up some confusing plot threads.<br />This is not Ross's best work. The second in the trilogy will be called \\"River Road,\\" the title of one of Nora Roberts' best-sellers. I think Ross would be well to return to her own niche, where she has shown talent and insight, and leave the steamy bayou romances to others.called \\"River Road,\\" the title of one of Nora Roberts' best-sellers.

And I was hooked on \\"Track of the Cat,\\" the first in Barr's Anna Pigeon series, within one page.<br />The fascinating plot revolves around the intrigue and in-fighting among the park rangers on the border between Texas and New Mexico. Who knew? Even among diehard environmentalists such as Anna and her coworkers, political pettiness exists. That's why, when a fellow ranger is found supposedly murdered by one of the park's protected cougars, Anna goes from 1 to 10 on the rage meter. She doesn't believe it's a lion kill--and she knows that the intricate politics and age-old fighting between ranchers and rangers will result in a sanctified lion kill.<br />Racing against time, Anna sets out to solve a murder that only she believes is a murder. The more she finds out, the more sinister the seemingly beautiful and pristine canyons and mountains become. Two more rangers disappear...and are ultimately found dead. Just what is going on, and how can Anna stop it? The solution, which comes at the very end of the book, is completely unexpected, and quite satisfying.<br />Barr's talent does not stop with the mystery, however. Her unique ability to draw the reader completely into Pigeon's milieu is seemingly effortless. I could feel the intense heat of the Texas desert, feel the rocks under my feet, feel the need for water as Anna and I hiked miles and miles through wild and achingly beautiful country. I felt that I was there alongside her, sweating with the heat and the knowledge that a crazed murderer was stalking us.<br />Take this book with you to the beach, to the mountains, to the pool, or just sit under a tree and sip some iced tea. It's a quick, fun, and fascinating read for any mystery lover!	2002-05-28

Scott Fitzgerald in his alcoholic decline, when life had overtaken him to the point that his genius could no longer be expressed in the only way he knew how: his writing.<br />When Budd Schulberg was at Dartmouth College, he was assigned to accompany the fabled Fitzgerald while the great man made a stab at writing a screenplay for Hollywood. As Fitzgerald afficionados well know, this humiliating attempt at regaining his literary glory was a disaster for Fitzerald, and, as we see in this fictionalized account, quite an eye-opener for the impressionable young Schulberg.<br />What struck me most about the book was the purity of the writing, and the intensity with which the author expresses the two stories within: one about the young man's hero worship that turns to pity; the other about the disintegration of a genius. I have never again read such a moving account of the tragic relationship between Zelda and F. Scott, or the impact their relationship had on themselves and others.<br />Because of &quot;The Disenchanted,&quot; which I first read as a preteen, I turned to F. Scott Fitzgerald and read everything he had ever written. I believe that my understanding of his works and his life were and are rooted in Budd Schulberg's moving and brilliant book, and if I could have thanked him in person, I would have done so, a thousand times over.	2002-05-26

How does it affect their lives? Is social change something palpable, or only something one can see in retrospect?<br /><br />These questions are addressed in Pearl Buck's moving and exquisitely written Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel, \\"The Good Earth.\\" It is the story of a simple Chinese peasant, Wang Lung. We first meet him as a young man on his way to pick up his bride, whom he has purchased from the estate of a wealthy landowner.<br />Wang Lung is a farmer, barely able to survive, but it is time for him to marry and produce a grandchild for his aged father, who lives in his simple farm hut and is shown great reverence, as was the way in China at the time.<br />The only way that Wang Lung could afford a wife at all, and a virgin, which was highly desired, was to purchase an ugly female slave from the great house. All of the pretty slave women were defiled by the master and his sons early on; O-lan was so ugly that she was spared. Harsh? Evil? Yes. But the story is told with such simplicity, from the viewpoint of Wang Lung, who knows no other life. Which is one of Buck's points: the simple Chinese peasant, struggling to survive, had no wherewithal to stand back and say, \\"I should not be buying an undefiled slave from a corrupt landowner who keeps me in virtual slavery as well.\\" It just didn't happen that way.<br /><br />O-Lan turns out to be the perfect farmer's wife, hardworking, efficient, and, it turns out, wonderfully fertile. The scene where the young woman painfully gives birth in the field during harvest time and then goes back to work without missing a beat is almost a cliche by now. But in the book, it gives great insight into the strength of character that the silent O-Lan possesses, a strength that will save her family time and again, during good years and famine times, when she is forced to murder a newborn daughter so that the rest of her children might survive.<br /><br />Against the framework of tremendous social change, the simple story of this one family gives us a framework within which we can observe its effect on ordinary people. The tremendous difference between the innocent and humble Wang Lung of the beginning of the book, and the prosperous and slightly corrupt elderly man at the end, is simply astoundingly written.<br />This book is Pearl Buck's single greatest work. She went on to become a prolific writer, and many of her books were brilliant, but none ever touched the simple genius of \\"The Good Earth.\\"e framework of tremendous social change, the simple story of this one family gives us a framework within which we can observe its effect on ordinary people.

In this fabulous Trollope story, the answer is a resounding no, and it echoes from generation to generation.<br />William and Barbara, staunch, middle-class, and proper, astonish themselves when they conceive twins. Barbara is not at all pleased, somehow embarrassed by this quite excessive show of pregnancy and birth. William, however, is enchanted. Imagine, he thinks, a conservative schoolteacher, nothing to recommend himself, really, and he has begotten twins! It makes him feel very important, and that's a good thing, because when Elizabeth (Lizzie) and Frances finally make their appearance, Barbara is quite disgusted and repelled by the mere thought of any further mothering.<br />William becomes a house-husband of sorts, and Barbara, in her no-nonsense way, sees to her daughters' non-emotional needs. It works well until the girls are 10 years old, at which time comfortable, boring, predictable Barbara takes off for Marrakesh on a hippie trek (a truly hilarious plot twist). She is gone for some time, during which William begins a discreet love affair with the local artist, Juliet. Nevertheless, when Barbara comes back (not having succeeded in becoming a hippie or even a successful feminist, another hobby horse of hers), William takes her back as a natural course of events. He also keeps Juliet on the side; Barbara knows about this, and things continue, changed, but not really.<br />Fast forward 25 years. Lizzie, having had a fling at artsy life herself, is married to a fellow student, Rob, and the two have created a very successful art/antiques/crafts boutique.

Lizzie works away at the huge mouthful of life she has endeavored to swallow--boutique, children, house, dutiful daughter, loving wife, loyal twin. As much as she thinks of herself as more successful at life than Barbara, she is more like her mother (albeit more giving) than she would ever want to be.<br />It is only Frances, the gadfly, the unpredictable, the &quot;different,&quot; who seems to have a &quot;real&quot; life. She has remained unmarried, had a series of unsuccessful love affairs, and runs a highly successful travel agency. The rest of the family is constantly worried about her...almost like she must fit into the mold in order to be happy.

An ace private investigator, he helps Nina solve most of her seemingly unsolvable cases. And, whether he cares to admit it or not, he is deeply in love with Nina. At the end of \\"Acts of Malice,\\" Paul took a step that changed his life irrevocably. In \\"Move to Strike,\\" he is dealing with the aftermath of that act...and the knowledge that Nina will never love him back. His very real and complicated anguish is laid bare for the reader as we follow his thoughts, join in his nightmares, and sympathize for this very strong man who is at his weakest moment.<br />Meanwhile, Nina is struggling to defend a 16-year-old girl, Nikki, who stands accused of brutally murdering her wealthy uncle Bill Sykes, a prominent plastic surgeon in the Tahoe area. WE know that Nikki didn't do it, because WE were there when it happened. But nobody else does...including Nina herself, who is working half on conviction, half on pure hunch. The slimy district attorney, an old foe, is hell-bent on trying Nikki as an adult. And his vicious assistant Barbara, who has old issues with Nina, is helping him gain his way.<br />If Nikki didn't kill Uncle Bill, who did? Nina's desperate foray into the case involves Nikki's ultra-ditzy former-showgirl mother, Daria, Daria's sister Beth, who is Bill's widow, an older widow fond of concocting potent \\"herbal\\" elixirs, and a band of prospectors right out of the Wild West. Add in a questionable private plane crash and a couple of seemingly unrelated murders, and you have a story that just won't let you breathe until you finish.<br />I guessed the murderer toward the end--but once again the O'Shaugnessy sisters pulled one of their effortless plot twists. I may have been right about the murderer--but nothing could have prepared me for the truth of the crime.<br />Get this book and devour it!

Written in the 40s, its illustrations hark back to an earlier era, when children were allowed to be children, and when the values we taught them were couched in terms that a child could understand. Instead of violence and video games.<br />Mike Mulligan and his faithful steam shovel Mary Ann have been \\"downsized,\\" if you will, by the advent of gasoline-powered engines, and other \\"modern miracles\\" that have made poor, faithful Mary Ann obsolete overnight. In order to find work, Mike and Mary Ann travel over hill and dale until they come to the small town of Popperville. There, they find that the town mayor is taking bids to dig the basement for a brand-new skyscraper. Mike makes a bid, and is met with laughter. But instead of giving up...INSTEAD OF GIVING UP...he makes a deal. He and Mary Ann will dig the basement in one day. If they don't make it, they won't accept payment.<br />The valiant steamshovel and the equally valiant Mike set off to prove to the world that they are not obsolete, not worthless...just because they are old, just because they are now different, they still have value! And they dig, and they dig, and they dig. And soon they have attracted a large audience, all of whom are pulling for the team to win, even though it seems impossible.<br />In the end, Mike and Mary Ann have prevailed. They have dug the basement in one day! But just when they are being celebrated as heroes, a terrible problem arises. Mary Ann cannot get back out of the hole. What is to happen? Was it all for nothing?<br />The ingenious solution to the problem, and the sheer joy of the solution, warms my heart as much today as it ever did. This is a wonderful way of teaching children to persevere, to glory in their \\"otherness\\" and to grab life with both hands. It is a treasure, a classic becaue it deserves to be.	2002-05-18

She agrees to defend Jim Strong, a young and handsome champion skier accused of the brutal murder of his equally young and handsome brother, Alex. The brother supposedly died in a skiing accident, but the coroner uncovers what he thinks are signs of horrifically foul play. And the District Attorney's office believes him.<br />Nina is soon pitted against the man she was interested in a while back, but who had left Tahoe to mend from a personal tragedy. Assistant DA Collier Hallowell has returned, healed, happy--and eager to renew his budding interest in Nina. As a beautiful and meaningful romance develops between the two, they must somehow keep their personal lives out of their professional milieu, and it isn't easy. Collier is convinced that Jim Strong is a particularly violent and vicious murderer. Nina is ethically bent on defending Strong--but for the first time in her career, she has nagging, secret doubts about her client. And so does the reader.<br />Did Jim Strong really stomp his injured brother to death? Is he an evil psychopath, as the prosecution, including Nina's own boyfriend, believes? And if he is, is Nina in danger? Can she ethically drop a client, and even if she could, will she do so?<br />As she struggles with these doubts and fears, Nina's feelings for Collier deepen and blossom, so that the reader, like the principals themselves, bounces back and forth between the beauty of human love and the horror of human violence.<br />The last third of the book is almost painful in its suspense, as the mystery of who killed Alex and why begins to include Nina's loved ones in its terrifying grasp. \\"Acts of Malice\\" is the best of the three Nina Reilly mysteries I have read so far, and truly one of the best I have read by any other author. It has real depth, as deep as the unflagging snow that grasps Tahoe in its icy unreality all through the story. A good metaphor for what can only be called a chilling plot.<br />Again, I must strongly praise the O'Shaughnessy sisters, Mary and Pamela (\\"Perri\\"), who have shown a depth of brilliance and talent not often seen in this or any other genre.es I have read so far, and truly one of the best I have read by any other author.

Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.<br />Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...<br />Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.<br />Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.<br />Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.<br />All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.<br />This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so.ping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.<br />This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo).

A friend, Mmm. Peloux, herself an aging courtesan, sends Lea her only son Fred (affectionately known as Cheri) to be groomed in the ways of the world.<br />Cheri, a selfish, self-centered young man in his 20s, is almost excessively gorgeous. And Lea, a woman who is well beyond the infatuation stage and certainly well aware of all of his many frailties, is simply besotted with him. Under her care, Cheri is spoiled, pampered, gifted with expensive presents, and indulged in every possible way, from sexual to culinary delights. In his own pompously careless way, Cheri loves Lea as well, calling her \\"noun-noun,\\" and partaking of her generosity, in bed and out, like a child. And so goes the relationship--Lea, looking over her shoulder at approaching age and the subsequent loss of her looks; and Cheri, taking everything she has to offer with complete abandon. Until his mother declares him groomed quite enough--and arranges a suitable marriage for him with a beautiful young woman.<br />So ends Book I, \\"Cheri.\\" \\"The Last of Cheri\\" is quite a different matter, as chilling in its way as \\"Cheri\\" is sensual. The mood of the book is a type of frantic fear. Lea, ever the no-nonsense realist (in her line of work, she has to be) knows from her mirror that her time as a beauty is gone. Without Cheri, the spectre of aging begins to haunt her in a very real way, and with a kind of real terror, she contemplates her lonely and manless future. Money will not be a problem; Lea has invested the gifts from her many celebrated lovers with care and a clear head. But loneliness and the very real anguish over losing her young lover are overtaking her.<br />Cheri has changed too. He is no longer the eager young satyr, but, trapped in a loveless marriage, the gorgeous, greedy child has become a gorgeous, cynical man, almost overwhelmed by ennui. Cheri is in a dangerous depression, but nobody, including Colette herself, had a name for that condition in high-society Paris of the 1800s! Colette describes Cheri's state in unflinching terms. He needs Lea. Lea needs him. Is it possible? Can she still be his mistress?<br />The answer to that question provides the denoument to what really, in the end, is a human tragedy. This doomed couple cannot possibly survive as they are, and they do not. One dies. One survives. And the reader cannot help but sigh for Lea and Cheri, two lovers whose affair of the heart is overwhelmed by the realitis of life.o longer the eager young satyr, but, trapped in a loveless marriage, the gorgeous, greedy child has become a gorgeous, cynical man, almost overwhelmed by ennui.

Because it is a well-known classic and a children's perennial favorite, many people do not realize that \\"Black Beauty\\" is an impassioned plea for animal rights, written at a time when such a notion was dismissed as ridiculous. And because it is what it is, sensitive children may need a parent to explain that, thankfully, most of the abuses described in the book are long gone, thanks in part to crusaders like Anna Sewell.<br />In a story that takes place in 19th century England, a gorgeous glossy black colt, who comes to be known as Black Beauty, is born into a life of comfort and kindness. His life is a kind of horsey paradise, until the fortunes of his owners turn...and Black Beauty is sold.<br />Sold to a cruel owner as a cab horse, Beauty is now treated as so many hapless animals were in his day...he is virtually tortured. He is in constant pain. His knees are sore. He is made to wear a \\"check rein,\\" a device that no longer exists, but which scares me to this day because of the impression its description made upon me as a child. It was a type of rein that forced the horse to keep his head up extremely high at an unnatural angle, the more to look \\"elegant.\\" The pain that this rein inflicts upon Beauty is heartbreaking, and it did indeed break my heart to read it.<br />Along the way, Beauty meets other horses, and keeps a lifelong friend, Ginger, who also suffers. Everything comes out alright in the end, in a story that is so tender and yet meaningful at the same time, that it is a shame it is relegated by reputation to the backwaters of so-called \\"children's literature.\\" It was pure muckracking, in the style of the great American muckrakers who came shortly thereafter. Will a child realize this? It's hard to know, but I know that as a child I was simply haunted by the described cruelty to this horse. And of course heartened by the ending. But I have to say that, many decades later, some of the cruelty in this book still upsets me.<br />Therefore, I recommend the book with a caveat: If you have a particularly sensitive or thoughtful child, please warn him or her that Black Beauty is mistreated in the story, but that because of the book, and others like it, such mistreatment of animals no longer exists. And then let your child enjoy the sheer wealth of detail in what really is, in the end, a beautiful story.ook with a caveat: If you have a particularly sensitive or thoughtful child, please warn him or her that Black Beauty is mistreated in the story, but that because of the book, and others like it, such mistreatment of animals no longer exists.

What a ride!<br />The story begins fairly routinely, as Nina Reilly is hired to represent an incredibly wealthy woman, Lindy Markov, in a palimony suit. Knowing that such suits are notorious losers, but intrigued by the circumstances of the case--and by the money--Nina agrees to defend Lindy, and immediately finds herself in over her head.<br />In order to compete in such a visible, high-stakes trial, Nina is forced to compromise some of her deeply held values, and to hire a fancy LA jury consultant, the obnoxiously confident Genevieve Suchat. She also hires an equally fancy co-counsel, high-profile LA lawyer Winston Reynolds. When (or if) they win their case, all three stand to become multimillionaires. But in the meanwhile, small-town lawyer Nina is footing the bill and running close to bankruptcy.<br />The pretrial proceedings proceed apace, except that Nina is not in control, and not happy with everything her glossy compatriots are doing. She knows she needs Winston and Genevieve both--but she's not happy about it. Once the trial starts, Nina struggles to keep her sense of balance while trying to keep up not only with her new coworkers--but with Lindy Markov herself, who seems to be prone to lies and subterfuge, all of which emerge as scandalous surprises in court.<br />Nina is in too far to back down, especially as her opposing counsel is the feociously obnoxious and self-satisfied Jeff Reisner, who delights in any humiliation he can throw her way. Even Nina's lover and confidante Paul is becoming difficult, as he sees what he considers to be an erosion of Nina's usual values. It looks like Nina is about to lose the trial, her reputation, her lover, and all her money.<br />That's when a completely unforeseen twist changes the fortunes of everyone involved. And the spiraling, out-of-control incidents that follow this surprise continue to proliferate until the last sentence of the last page, leaving the reader literally gasping for air.<br />This is truly a five-star read. I'd give it ten stars if I could. You want a book you can't put down? A book that will keep you happily oblivious to your immediate surroundings and your normal life? \\"Breach of Promise\\" is definitely it.ing the reader literally gasping for air.<br />This is truly a five-star read.

I want them to make sense, I want the characters to be likeable and believable, I want a story I can sink my teeth into, and above all, I want (of course) a happy ending.<br />When I first picked up \\"A Soft Place to Fall,\\" it did not hold my interest. Try as I might, I could not get past the first chapter. But something kept me from putting it away permanently, and a few days ago, I was drawn to it again. This time, I was hooked. I'm not sure what put me off the first time, but this time around, I loved the story, the characters, the writing--everything.<br />Basically, the plot revolves around two lost souls. Annie Galloway, everybody's vision of a perfect bride, and a perfect wife in a perfect marriage, has lost her perfect husband when she is only in her 30s. Only she knows the truth behind the facade of her seemingly fairy-tale life, and she cannot reveal it to anybody. Her grieving mother-in-law, Claudia, looks to her as a remnant of her lost son. Her friends and family continue the myth. So Annie finds herself a cottage in her home town of Shelter Rock Cove, Maine, and tries to pick up the pieces of her ruined life. All of her dreams, of happiness, of motherhood, of everything--seem gone forever. She is a shell, but a strong shell, if that makes any sense.<br />Close by lives newly arrived Sam Butler, back home after a high-flying career in New York. Only he knows the terrible secret that haunts him and threatens his peace and security. He is in no better shape emotionally than Annie.<br />Sam and Annie meet, and, in the way of most romance novels, sparks fly. But this book is written with intelligence and dignity. They do not eye one another and then jump into bed. A great deal of hurt is contained in each of these people, and as in real life, each is afraid to reveal that hurt or to risk another one. When they finally do fall in love, they do not live happily ever after. Reality intrudes. Big-time.<br />How they solve their very real and very overwhelming problems while trying to save their budding relationship is the core of this wonderful story. I loved every word of it. And yes (sigh), it does have a happy ending..

The summer I was 15, between Junior High and High School, my mother recommended that I read this book. Of course I wasn't going to listen to HER...so I pouted around for a few days, and then one evening, afraid I was going to succumb to utter boredom, I picked it up.<br />For the next week, I did nothing but read Gone with the Wind. I read it every waking moment, far into the night, first thing in the morning. I remember having a perpetual headache from eyestrain. I simply could not stop until the last page, when I burst into tears, and sobbed for what seemed like hours.<br />The book has much the same effect on me now. Every few years, I read it cover to cover, even though I can quote key passages by heart by this time. So let me tell you a little bit about Gone with the Wind, the first thing being that it is not what you think it is. It's hard to compete with David O'Selznick here, even though he's dead, but I beg you to put the movie aside, and prepare yourself for sheer, satisfying, bosom-heaving pleasure. This was a thoroughly amazing book in the thirties, and it wears well. It is much more than the story of spoiled, willful Scarlet O'Hara and her deadly flirtations. Scarlet may have been the first feminist. Women in her day had no power whatsoever. Their entire lives were decided by convention: whom they should marry, what they should eat, where they should live, what they should wear. But Scarlet would have none of it. And the only way she could break free of convention was to use her wiles to flaunt it. She did--and it worked. She was and is my hero, selfish and vain as she was.<br />On quite another level, this is the heartbreaking story of the War Between the States from the Southern point of view. As a teen who was raised in California, I had no clue about how the South felt about the War, and no way to find out. This book, silly as some may find it, taught me that there are two sides to any conflict, two equally powerful and opposing points of view that are tragically at odds. Sound familiar? Not much different than the Middle East today.<br /><br />Now a word about the book's purported racism. Yes, there are slaves in this book, and I am not going to presume to tell you not to resent or be angry about that fact. But considering the time in which she lived, I think that Margaret Mitchell tried to deal with the issue of slavery as best she could. The slaves in the book are not the simpering fools of the movie. They are portrayed with as much dignity as I think Mitchell could manage when considering that there was no way she could condone OR ignore that slavery was a fact during the Civil War. Mammy is not a caricature in the book, Prissy is a much more sympathetic young woman, and the other slaves are portrayed as thinking, feeling, human beings.The Emancipation is not regretted, and is seen from the freed slaves' point of view as much as possible. That having been said, I am not advocating this book as something it is not. It is not an abolitionist work, and it is not anti-slavery per se. It is not anything more than phenomenally well-written story with a lot of truly interesting historical information about the 1860s and beyond.<br />Gone with the Wind is the story of a lifetime, not the caliber of War and Peace, but for its time, incredibly good reading. Summer is almost upon us. This is a perfect time to sit under a magnolia tree with a mint julep and treat yourself to an old-fashioned story you'll never forget.are tragically at odds.

Since this is the first Nina Reilly book I picked up, I have absolutely no complaints. I literally stumbled upon this book on a friend's bookcase, casually opened it up, and almost literally didn't put it down again until I had read the very last page.<br />My only question is: Where have I been? Why had I not heard of this wonderful series, and its equally wonderful authors, sisters Mary and Pamela (\\"Perri\\") O'Shaugnessy? If this is, as some of the reviewers say, the \\"weakest\\" in the series, will I survive the strongest?<br />The story takes place in scenic Lake Tahoe, where sleazy casinos vie with gorgeous mountains and stately pines for attention. The night are dark and starry, and the days...well it depends who you are. For struggling attorney Nina Reilly, who is living with her brother and sister-in-law when the book begins, the days are full of crime and conspiracy. So she decides to hike a nearby mountain with a man who interests her: deputy DA Collier Hallowell. Collier is still mourning his wife, killed a few years earlier by a hit-and-run driver who was never found. Nina has some vague idea of bringing him into the world of the living.<br />But before that can happen, the two encounter a family that puts the word \\"dysfunctional\\" to shame. It consists of blustering Ray DeBeers, given to abusive language, his fearful wife Sarah, his gorgeous twins Jason and Molly, and a family friend. A storm comes up, Ray is hit by lightening and killed--and the action begins, not to stop until the very last word of the very last sentence.<br />Was Ray's death really an accident? Is his death somehow connected with the death of Hallowell's wife? And what of the mysterious, ethereal artist Kim Voss, she of the indoor cactus garden? Add in a genuine grave-robbing, a mysterious gardeners, stolen cars, people who won't talk, people who talk too much, and a brilliant teen who may or may not be connected to the DeBeers family, and the action is fast and furious. Nina, her sidekick and sometime lover, PI Paul van Wagoner, Hallowell himself, Nina's Native American secretary and a host of lesser characters try to solve a mystery that simply compounds upon itself like a cancerous cell. In the end, nobody is untouched or unhurt by the actions that unwind at dizzying speed.<br />I loved this book so much, I purchased everything else in the series I could get my hands on. Now my problem is: Do I go back to the beginning, and patiently catch up? Or do I read the next book in the series (whose teaser appears at the end of the paperback version), \\"Breach of Promise\\"?  Stay tuned.

It really can teach a very young baby about textures and colors and the fact that the world is a varied and wonderful place.<br />When my first child (now almost 18) was less than 6 months old, I would take her tiny hand and place her chubby fingers on each different texture...the bunny, the cloth, and of course my favorite...Daddy's scratchy beard! (a piece of sandpaper). I don't know how much of the simple and sweet words my daughter absorbed, but she was cuddled in my arms, being rocked (our favorite place to read) and she definitely liked to touch the textures. Now the interesting thing is that the book remained special, and when she should have outgrown it, she did not. It remained in the collection. I think that's because it is just so peaceful and simple, remnants of a former time.<br />If you are expecting, if one of your friends has a new baby, if you are a grandparent or a loving aunt or uncle, you cannot give a better book for a new baby. It will be that baby's cherished book in short order. Guaranteed. One word of warning, though. Make sure that you are buying the original, with all the textures. I saw one oversized board book version the other day, and its only texture was the cotton of the bunny, which carried through to each page. No no!! We need everything right for this book of a lifetime.	2002-04-20

Laurence and his wife Hilary run a charming inn and have three teenaged sons; Gina and Fergus live a highly upscale life mostly devoted to Fergus' antiques business. They have a teenager as well, their only child, Sophy. The book begins with Sophy in some sort of crisis. As only Trollope can do, we gauge the depth of Sophy's adolescent pain by watching her, almost literally, childishly suck on a blue bead she wears on a leather thong around her neck. It is these tiny details, almost too subtle to notice, with which Trollope captures the reader's attention and heart.<br />It turns out that Fergus has suddenly and cruelly decided to leave Gina. Sophy and her mother are devastated, each in her own way. Sophy acts out in increasingly childish and pouting behavior; the reader doesn't know whether to slap her or hug her (and anyone who has teenagers can relate to this feeling!) Gina simply falls apart. And in her crumbling state, she turns, of course, to her best friends Laurence and Hilary.<br />The domino effect of one person's selfish decision to leave his wife causes anguish and pain he could not have anticipated. Trollope's message is clear, although she does not judge--nobody lives in a vacuum, and one IS accountable for one's actions.<br />This theme is further played out in the subplot: the story of Gina's elderly mother Vi (who had Gina after an impulsive fling with a boy who deserted her upon finding she was pregnant) and her dear friend and neighbor Dan. Again, the smallest of details bring these people to life. Vi is an exuberant soul, full of strong color, both in her clothing and in her garden and home. She has a parakeet (of course!) and her messy house matches her divine personality. Dan is her polar opposite. We come to love him for his meticulous tidiness, his strict ways (learned many years previously in the military) and his total adoration of Vi. They are so happy together, and it is so lovely...until the actions of a busybody who righteously feels she is \\"doing the right thing\\" destroys the elderly couple's lives completely.<br />The ending of this book, as always, is true and real. I won't give it away, but suffice to say that as in real life, nothing in the end is \\"clean and perfect.\\" But it all makes perfect sense. This is one of Trollope's more depressing novels, but so worth the read, if only to cherish the wonderful characters she creates so very well.ouse matches her divine personality.

Being Nora, of course, she still can tell a story, and she still avoids the wincing cliches and horrible grammar of some other writers in the genre. But this is, I am afraid to say, something of a \\"quick and dirty\\" effort that she must have written to meet contractual obligations while working on something she found more interesting.<br />Basically, the tale is a shameless spinoff of that marvelous movie of the 50s, \\"Roman Holiday,\\" starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. In the movie, a princess escapes for a day, hooks up (nonsexually, of course...this was the 50s) with rugged, taciturn journalist Gregory Peck, who doesn't know who she is, and has a day as a \\"normal\\" person.<br />In \\"Cordina's Crown Jewel,\\" burned-out princess Camilla de Cordina escapes for a few weeks, hooks up with rugged, taciturn archeologist Delaney Caine, who doesn't know who she is, and has some time as a \\"normal\\" person. This being the 2000s, their relationship is not celibate. They fall in love. And then the hapless princess returns home...and the ending? Don't ask. It's just too silly.<br />When one thinks of Nora's fantastic collection of books, it seems understandable that she should falter once in a blue moon. But I didn't take this book as a misstep--more as something done in a tearing hurry by somebody who has the talent to pull it off. Almost.	2002-04-11

It certainly will be so from now on.<br />In the most beautiful and spiritual wording imaginable, this book tells a child in no uncertain terms that his or her birth was a celebration--a cosmic event that changed the world for the better. Although it has some New Age aspects to it, it transcends any religion or dogma, and is, quite simply, completely beautiful.<br />I want to buy it now, for my two teenaged children to cherish and keep. I want them to know that even though I often want to wring their respective teenaged necks, this is what they mean to me--every single word in this glorious book. I have never felt so moved over a baby gift as I am over this one. It is truly a gift of the heart, not only for me, but for anyone who is, or who has just become, a parent.<br />Sometimes we forget just how much of a celebration the arrival of a new child can be. \\"On the Day You Were Born\\" is meant to remind us, and our children, now and forever.

It follows the story of urbane, charming, and gorgeous wunderkind Hammond Cross, whose Charleston, South Carolina family is one of the oldest and most respected in the tight-knit upper-class world he calls his own. He's in line to be the next DA, and rightly so. Then, in one fateful night, his world falls apart.<br />A woman he knows intimately may or may not have murdered the town's wealthiest and most hated citizen, Lute Pettijohn. Even the reader is not sure whether sophisticated psychologist Alex Ladd has done the deed. There are so many other suspects: the un-grieving widow Davee, whose friendship with Cross goes back to their privileged childhoods; most of Pettijohn's business associates, all of whom hated him--and Cross's own upper-class father.<br />Cross is in this murder up to his neck. If he successfully prosecutes the cops' key suspect, he is a shoe-in for the DA spot. If he doesn't, he may be brought up on charges of obstruction of justice. Along the way, he has to contend with his own tangled and uncharacteristically personal feelings about the case; his jealous and ambitious partner, the acerbic and unlikeable Steffi Mundell; his longtime nemesis, supercop Rory Smilow; and his own cold, judgmental father.<br />I thought I guessed the murderer after the first 100 pages. After the next 100, I was positive I was right, and had a smug \\"I knew it\\" attitude, just wondering how Brown was going to unravel the plot. Then I wasn't so sure. Then I was turning pages almost faster than I could read. Then I was positively racing to the end. I was wrong about the murderer, wrong about the end, and blown away by the ingenious plot twists that all came about effortlessly in the end. And it even ended with a cliff-hanger that made total and perfect sense.<br />You want a good read? You want a book that keeps you off the computer and the TV and has you walking into walls?

Forget Mickey Rooney. \\"National Velvet\\" has nothing to do with Hollywood, and everything to do with a microcosm of time, England between the Wars, in a working-class society that no longer exists.<br />The Brown family, staunchly working class, gets by on a pittance. The hugely obese mother, who misses nothing through her \\"hooded eyes,\\" was once a world champion swimmer, the first woman to swim the English Channel. It is her spirit, her sense of competition and the right of women to step out of their structured lives, that has been passed down to her youngest daughter Velvet. And THAT is what this story is about: the strength of one young girl to rise above every restriction of her class and society, and to excel where no woman has ever excelled before.<br />So in one sense, yes, this is the story of a young girl and her love of a horse. And it is thrilling on that level. It is also the story of a society that cannot ever exist again, but that, for all its restrictions, was ruled by love of family and a strong sense of right and wrong. And third, it is the triumphant story, long before feminism was in vogue, of one small woman who overcomes centuries of prejudice to become a champion. What else does one need?<br />There are other characters in this book who are as interesting as Velvet: Her older, beautiful but vacuous sister Edwina, who slithers out at night to meet her boyfriend; her second oldest sister Malvolia, another \\"thoroughbred beauty,\\" her impossible baby brother Donald, who collects his own spit in a bottle he keeps on a cord around his neck; her staunch, but mostly silent working-class father; and of course, Mi, the groom whose love of horses and fierce loyalty to the Brown clan hides some terrible secrets he refuses to reveal.<br />Add the Piebald, the most wonderful fictional horse ever, and you have a story for the ages: the story of a young girl who finds and trains a wayward horse, and takes him all the way to England's famed Grand National, where she dresses as a boy (no female was allowed to ride) and takes her horse--and hersef--to glory., and takes him all the way to England's famed Grand National, where she dresses as a boy (no female was allowed to ride) and takes her horse--and hersef--to glory.	2002-04-06

I came across this book by recommendation, and I'm so glad I did! In an easy-to-use, easy-to-read format, Groom divides his book into logical sequences, from Annuals through Native Trees to Perennials, Roses, Shrubs and more. For this impatient gardener, the book format couldn't be more perfect. Every question I have has an answer, and every answer is readily available.<br />The nice, sturdy thickness of this paperback is a plus as well. I can see propping it up in my Texas friend's Houston garden as I struggle to turn a pig's ear (his over-run, sadly neglected, crying-out-for-attention flowerbeds) into a silk purse (Oh I have so many ideas!!!!)<br />As a Pennsylvanian, I recommend this book to anybody and everybody who has ever gardened in Texas, from the seasoned gardener to the amateur. There is something in here for everybody, and the only thing missing is a big smear of Texas mud on the cover. I plan to see it gets there soon!	2002-04-05

My significant other lives in Houston, and I, a Californian by birth, have lived in Philadelphia most of my life. An avid gardener at home here in PA, I felt uncharacteristically unsure about tackling the long-neglected flower beds in Houston.<br />Then I read the reviews for Howard Garrett's charming and fabulous &quot;Plants for Texas,&quot; and ordered it immediately. It arrived yesterday and I could not put it down until I had read it cover to cover.<br />Every single question I have had is answered in this book in a format so clear, so concise, and so heartwarming to any gardener, that I found I was smiling ear to ear. From the beginning pages, where Garrett presents his no-nonsense advice on design, maintenance, and care of everything from trees to turf grasses to annuals, to his staunch anti-chemical point of view (YES!), I gained a wealth of information.<br />By the time I got to the alphabetical pages with the full-color pictures of everything a Texas gardener could ever want to plant, I was thoroughly and totally delighted. Already I have made a rudimentary list (way too ambitious, of course). Already, I have page after page bookmarked and highlighted. Already, I have planted perfect gardens in my mind's eye.<br />Perhaps my favorite part of the entire book is the page on hackberry (celtis), which nastily eats up a major portion of my friend's flower beds, and which I secretly, and guiltily, hate. Garrett's take: &quot;Do not plant and cut down the ones that sprout up!&quot; Gotta love a man who shares my views on hackberry. I love this book. Plain and simple. I recommend it to anybody who gardens, or who plans to garden, in the Great State of Texas!	2002-04-03

I have never been big on poetry for children (don't ask why; I guess because I didn't like it as a child), and I almost didn't open this book. What a mistake that would have been.<br />Every single page of this wonderful, fanciful and subtly geographical collection is better than the one before. Here we have a poem that extolls the virtues of Indianapolis (one doesn't see too many Indianapolis poems!) in a ridiculous but so- sweet poem. There are elephants in trees, and frogs in suspenders, and all the other lovely ideas that children can accept and love without question.<br />The drawings by Petra Mathers make the book. I can't list a favorite; each one, so colorful, so fanciful, and so very endearing, compliments the poem it illustrates.<br />What I like best about this book, however, is that it encourages a love of the English language without ever letting the child know it is doing so. The wonderful tongue-rolling combination of words, the silly (but not really) images the words evoke, and the simple joy in every poem are tailor-made to enchant a child and encourage him or her to read more.<br />Highly recommended!!	2002-04-03

Savannah and her late husband had run a famous catering business in California. But now, Savannah is on her own, and although she is shaky inside, she is also determined to make a go of her new life.<br />Accordingly, she purchases a Coldwater Cove landmark, the Far Harbor Lighthouse. In her mind's eye, Savannah can see the enchanting bed and breakfast inn it will become, but in reality, the place is a dump, and will take back-breaking work to restore. But Savannah isn't Ida Lindstrom's granddaughter for nothing. She feels equal to the challenge--as long as her woman's heart is not involved. For Samantha is convinced that love, and particularly marriage, are off limits for her now, and she wants nothing to do with any man who might challenge that belief.<br />Daniel O'Halloran, a rugged, gorgeous lawyer and cousin to Raine's new husband Jack, once dated Savannah in high school. He has returned to Coldwater Cove as well, after the tragic death of his sister and her husband left him guardian to their mentally challenged son. Daniel too has had a failed marriage. But when he sees Savannah...well, enough said.<br />Subplots involve troubled teenager Gwen, whom we met in Homeplace, who is struggling to forget the baby girl she put up for adoption; Ida, whose health may not be what it was; the cranky former owner of the lighthouse, Henry, who has no family of his own; and Savannah's biological father, a British rock star who sounds just like Mick Jagger.<br />Sound good? It is. A good, solid read in the old-fashioned vein. I enjoyed this book very much, and derived much satisfaction from the ending, which of course I will not reveal.

This is a simply wonderful book for stimulating young minds. Not only are the illustrations large and friendly (the giant looks more stupid than scary), but the \\"pages\\" are tough, easy-to-clean boards, ensuring a long-lasting favorite without torn pages.<br />The puppets are tailor-made (excuse the pun) for little fingers, and can lead to hours of fun as toddlers can act out the story, make up their own dialogue, and of course use the puppets for other creative play. The only criticism I have (and it's admittedly from an adult point of view) is that all the puppets are the same size, and none looks like the giant in the book. Is this good or bad? I don't know for sure. Highly creative children will decide for themselves and probably never give it a thought. Less creative children (or very precise ones, like my son was as a young toddler) may take issue with the fact that there isn't a readily visible giant. Also, on my copy of the book, two of the puppets have faces that look mean due to the positioning of the thread that makes their mouths. I don't know, again, whether it's only my copy, or whether it's on purpose.<br />On the whole, however, I find this concept and the book itself absolutely perfect for stimulating creative play. AND...there are four puppets, so two children can play without arguing (very important in my house, let me tell you!)	2002-03-25

How does she churn out book after book of such quality when others in the genre eventually sink into repetitive junk? Whatever it is, it's worked again: \\"Reunion in Death,\\" although deceptively slow for the first half of the book, picks up in the middle and holds the pace until the very last word.<br />This time, futuristic super-cop Eve Dallas faces serial killer Julianna Dunne, whose recent time in the slammer has done nothing to help her personality. She is out for payback against the one person in the world she respects (and loathes): Eve. And the payback involves the murderous Julianna playing hardball on Eve's New York City turf...stalking Eve's man, the gorgeous and brilliant Roarke.<br />As in the last few books, Eve's vulnerabilities are allowed to show--at least to Roarke and the reader. I found this to be the only boring (to me) part of the book. I think that Eve's horrible childhood has been well explored by now, and it's getting a bit repetitive to relive Eve's nightmares in every book. Even though she supposedly has new revelations about her past in this book, I found nothing really new in this particular set of Eve's flashback horrors, which is not to say that I am bored with Eve herself (a fabulous character), or that I do not sympathize with her fight against her personal demons. But...been there, done that. Nora/Robb needs to come at this from another perspective if she feels there is more to reveal; otherwise, I, for one, have had enough.<br />Same goes for the endlessly fascinating, but now also repetitive, relationship between Eve and Roarke. It's now established that they each have their personal weaknesses, and that their considerable strengths complement their spectacular (in every way) relationship. It's not that their erotic pas de deux no longer interests me as a reader, but I feel that Nora/Robb is again covering old ground. On the other hand, maybe she is setting us up for a surprise? One never knows with her!<br />OK, back to the plot. Julianna Dunne is a brilliant adversary, and she has done her homework well. But she has picked the most formidable opponent on or off-planet... And so can her wonderful team: Peabody (who solves her first case on her own!), the ever-randy MacNab, the elegant psychologist/profiler Dr. Mira, hardbitten and loyal Feeney, and all the rest of the crew. But now Julianna has aimed at Eve's Achilles Heel: her love for Roarke. What better way to destroy Eve than to destroy her man?<br />The eventual standoff between Eve and Julianna is sort of like the Clash of the Titans, and no less exciting. Who wins?

When Gerritsen is at the top of her game, as she is in this novel, I think nobody can beat her. Not Robin Cook, not anybody.<br />It's hard to describe the plot without giving away vital information, and I don't intend to be a spoiler. But I can tell you that the action starts hard and fast on the very first page, when a world-renowned surgeon, elderly but revered in his field, attempts a simple appendectomy and winds up killing his young, healthy patient in the most gruesome of ways. Our glimpse into his mind while this is going on is almost scarier than the act itself...and that is the first chapter of the book! It doesn't get calmer from there.<br />It seems that a number of very fit elderly men, in full control of their faculties and all living in a very upscale retirement home, are showing strange mental symptoms, one after the other, and eventually dying horrible deaths. Dr. Toby Harper,who heads the ER rotation at a local hospital, encounters two of these patients, and is at a complete loss to diagnose the problem, let alone solve it. Her dogged determination to get to the bottom of the illness(es) lands her in a conspiracy so sinister that she can't even guess at the true nature of it, except to know that it is putting herself, her dear elderly mother who suffers from Alzheimers, and seemingly her entire medical reputation at stake.<br />A subplot, wherein innocent young runaway girls are captured on the streets and impregnanted with god knows what, forms a counterpoint to the main tale.<br />All I can tell you is that Toby, probably the one innocent in the drama, ends up wanted by the police for murder--and the bad guys, who are diabolical, seem to be getting away scott-free with their intensely fiendish plot.<br />Sound good? Try it. You may not sleep well at night, but it's worth it. Tess Gerritsen is without peer when she truly believes in what she is writing about, and this book proves it.

Is that why, in a recent review, I saw her described as &quot;cozy&quot;? I almost fainted!<br />Therefore, let me say it here and now: If you are looking for cozy and comforting romance (and there's nothing wrong with that!), Joanna Trollope is not your author. If, on the other hand, you enjoy reading about likeable, oh-so-human characters who try, in their own muddled way, to slog through the complexities of everyday life, you will love &quot;The Men and the Girls,&quot; another Trollope masterpiece.<br />The &quot;men,&quot; in this case, are James and Hugh, both successful, urbane friends who are now in their 60s, and who have known each other over 40 years. Theirs is a friendship made indescructible by time and understanding, even if there are times when each grates horribly on the other. Each man, as it happens, has chosen a companion very much younger than himself. James, an academic, has been living with Kate, a lovely and artless woman in her 30s who prefers menial jobs (such as waitressing) so she can pursue her true passions, such as helping out at a home for battered women. She has an impossible teenaged daughter, Joss, the product of a brief and hurtful romance gone wrong. Kate and James are very happy; their household is completed by James' elderly uncle, Leonard, whose cantankerous bellowing belies a tender heart. The heart of the house is Kate, who keeps everything going and who manages her horrible teenager and the equally horrible Leonard with love and aplomb.<br />Hugh, a minor TV personality, lives with the prim and proper Julia, also in her 30s, a lovely woman who has given birth to Hugh's only children, impeccable twin boys. Their picturebook life is lived in a beautifully decorated and spotless house with a gorgeous garden, all the work of Julia, who keeps her six-year-old twins equally clean and perfect. Julia also works in television, but devotes the majority of her time to Hugh, her boys, and her house and garden.<br />In both relationships, James' and Hughs', the men take wholeheartedly of their women's love and nurturing, and age seems to be no problem whatsoever. Enter a totally unlikely catalyst: a plain and elderly spinster names Beatrice, whom James has accidentally knocked off her bicycle on a dark and rainy night. Beatrice is unhurt, but James, understandably upset, becomes involved in her life, first out of guilt, and then out of real interest.<br />It is at this point that Kate suddenly and cruelly decides that she cannot live with James another minute, and uproots herself and her daughter with no thought to the consquences other than the need to escape. A similar situation occurs with Julia and Hugh (too complicated to describe in a review), and they, too, separate. And suddenly, our preconceived ideas about who are the givers and who are the takers are completely reversed, as the four protagonists must shift their lives and their expectations in completely unforeseen ways. In the end, all of our suppositions about James, Kate, Hugh and Julia are radically different, as we realize that none is truly a whole adult. And that Joss, the nasty, self-centered teen, is the most truly well-rounded of them all.<br />Interesting reading, fascinating to think about. Happy ending? Not exactly. A REAL ending is more to the point, as lives sort themselves out, not always for the better, but as they inevitably must. &quot;The Men and the Girls&quot; is another Trollope triumph, well worth reading and keeping on one's shelf of well-loved books.<br />--Calyndulaand perfect.

Well...I hated it. And I hated it so strongly, I never did read it to my children.<br />What exactly is the point of this story? That you give and give until you die while somebody else just takes and takes? That it's honorable and wonderful to give of yourself until you are nothing but a wounded stump, but the (male) person to whom you gave is happy so you are too?<br />I have a truly visceral dislike of this book, and I have never recommended it to anybody. I know this is not the popular view. I have never heard anybody else do anything but praise this book to the skies, but again, I have to ask, WHY? What exactly is so wonderful about this message for children...and what exactly is the message? It is certainly praiseworthy to give of oneself...but in my mind, there is nothing praiseworthy about this \\"giving tree.\\"<br />I remain glad that I did not read this book to my young children, and my view of the book today, when they are both teens, is the same as it was when they were toddlers.	2002-03-10

He bought me &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot; and told me that, along with a typewriter (this was the Dark Ages), it was all I would ever need.<br />He couldn't have known about the typewriter, but he was completely right about Strunk &amp; White's timeless classic. As a professional editor of long standing, it is one of my jobs to hire and train beginning writers and editors. It never ceases to appall me that bright young kids right out of some of the finest colleges have no sense of the written word--no sense of the most elemental grammar (one young hiree told me that my insistence on commas to set off dependent clauses was hopelessly old-fashioned; &quot;commas are out of style and are no longer used,&quot; he said).<br />I recommend &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; to these budding editors, and it never fails to help them. I also am not above dipping into it myself--OFTEN. It is probably the simplest, most elegant book on grammar and usage ever written, and it is as important today as it ever was, probably more so. I consider it a tool of the trade, and recommend it to anybody who uses language on a daily basis. And that's just about everybody!	2002-03-09

I didn't think it could still be as sweet, as heartwarming, as absolutely perfect in this modern day of bras at 8 and significant others at 12.<br />\\"Fifteen\\" was my hope when I was a gawky preteen girl, positive that I would never have a date in my life. So thinks Jane Purdy, our heroine, a nice, ordinary (in her eyes) babysitter who gets good grades and has a reasonable enough life--except at 15, she has yet to date, yet to be kissed, yet to unlock the mysteries of just what one is supposed to do on a date!<br />Along comes just about the most popular boy in the entire class, Stan, who not only asks her out, but who TAKES her out. Jane is excited beyond belief, but so nervous, she is sure she has flubbed her chances of every seening Stan--or any boy--again. I could relate completely when I was a preteen, and even now, Jane's anguish rings so true!<br />I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that it is absolutely perfect. If there is a young girl in your life, buy her this book. She might make noises about \\"old-fashioned\\" and \\"in YOUR day...\\" but I'll bet she reads it--and loves it.	2002-03-09

Mavis Cheek is to \\"women's fiction\\" (for lack of a better term) what Janet Evanovich is to mystery. This is one of the wittiest, brightest, funniest books I have read in a long, long time.<br />With quiet, droll but absolutely side-splitting humor, Cheeks, a shining star if there ever was one, tells the tired old cliched story of a first wife whose husband has left her for a younger, blonder, bimbette. And after all those years of devotion, too! Before you groan aloud and stop reading this review, believe me when I tell you that this is NOT the ordinary tale!<br />Angela Fytton, the spurned wife, is not one to take rejection quietly, and is not above casting aspersions on her (ex)-husbands er...manly equipment to wifey number two. Angela embarks on a diabolical plan to get her husband back. Part 1: Buy a huge, rambling house in the country that doubles as historic artifact. Start making one's own honey and talking to the hens (whom she threatens with coq au vin recipes if they don't behave). Part 2: Send one's obnoxious teenaged children (boy and girl) to live with Daddy and Bimbette and New Baby Brother. Part 3: Well...you have to read the book.<br />Does Angela get her husband back? Does Binnie the Bimbette (yes, Binnie) survive her predecessor's truly outrageous onslaught? Will the baby survive his teenaged siblings? Will Ian the ex-husband survive both wife number one and wife number two without resorting to bondage (one of the shortest but funniest paragraphs I have yet to read)?<br />Read it and find out...and rejoice that there is a wildly funny British wit on the loose!

Well I was wrong. &quot;Obsessive Love...&quot; is a gem of the genre, a truly insightful and helpful book for all ages.<br />In clear, thoughtful, and easy-to-read English, Susan Forward explains the difference between love--and obsession, quite a different animal altogether. Because it is written with a nonjudgmental attitude and the compassion comes through on every page, it allows the reader who may be caught up in such a relationship to take the first painful step: admitting that he/she is indeed caught up in this unhealthy situation.<br />The book then gives advice on how to break the attachment and to see the relationship for what it is--or is not. It is aimed at giving the obsessor his/her life back, and of course, the object of the obsession gains the same bonus. Those who are caught up in such a relationship often feel hopeless, helpless, and truly terrified at the prospect of ending a relationship that in fact may not even exist (or that exists no longer). Forward understands this, and does not try to explain it away. She simply guides the reader, quietly and firmly, if you will, through a series of steps that she says will help. And they do.<br />Letting go is never an easy process, and Forward does not pretend that it is. But her advice works, and leaves the obsessor with dignity and a sense of having come through a serious situation, and out to the other side.<br />I would imagine that this book would not help a truly psychotic stalker. I have recommended it repeatedly to friends who are locked into relationships that are obsessive and unhealthy, or that are over entirely. The advice has worked every time. I recommend this book to anyone who is grieving over a failed love affair, or a preoccupation with a person who does not reciprocate one's affections. If nothing else, this book will provide strong comfort.	2002-02-26

All of her books are full of people that are so real, so full of the layers of &quot;humanhood,&quot; if you will, that we can't help but feel we know everybody in her books. This is, of course, her very great talent.<br />&quot;A Village Affair&quot; is, on the surface, the story of a marriage grown slightly stale after 3 children and the predictable daily chores that accompany parenthood. Alice and Martin are settled into a comfortable, upwardly mobile, slightly boring lifestyle. Neither is particularly happy, but neither will acknowledge this fact to themselves or each other.<br />When Alice's third child, Charlie, is born, Alice, the quintessential latter-day flower child, falls into a deep depression that she cannot shake. As she tries to regain her equilibrium, we are taken back to her earlier years as a university student whose wretched homelife spurs her to seek the life she imagines she wants. Alice's great flaw then, and later, when we meet her several years into her marriage, is that she has no notion of herself whatsoever, but only sees herself as reflected in the mirror of others' approval or disapproval.<br />Thus, when Alice is a very young woman, the reflected glory of Cecily Jordan, a famous gardener/author, leads Alice to marry Cecily's son Martin, even though she is not in love with him. It is Cecily and her beautiful house that Alice loves--but she doesn't realize it for quite a while. After the marriage, Alice is happy as a young wife, artist (she paints quite well and has a small following to whom she sells her works), and quasi-hippie, her long braid and offbeat clothes advertising her &quot;otherness&quot; to her admiring circle of friends and neighbors.<br />When her first child, Natasha, is born, Alice is able to keep going in this mold. Natasha is an easy baby, Alice is even more admired as the perfect wife and mother, and things are easy. But with the birth of James, a much more difficult little person, Alice begins to unravel. And finally, the birth of Charlie destroys any illustions she may have had of a happy and fulfilled marriage.<br />Enter Clodagh, the youngest and very flamboyant daughter of the &quot;big house&quot; in the village. Clodagh has a secret...but Alice doesn't know it for quite a while. As Clodagh swiftly and surely takes over Alice's life and identity, the two begin a quite unorthodox relationship that shocks the village, destroys Alice's reputation, ruins her marriage, and makes her finally, at long last, take a look at herself as a woman and a human being.<br />The ending is not predictable, the characters are not one-dimensional. There is great pain in this book...and great love. As happens many times with Trollope, I felt that Alice was my dearest friend, as close to me as a sister would be. I could see her in my mind's eye, see her clothes, her beautiful hair, her children--see her paintings, her house, and her garden. I understood completely where she was coming from, even when I despaired of her destructive actions.<br />&quot;A Village Affair&quot; proves once again that life is not black and white--and that things are rarely what they seem. It is written with charm, humor, compassion and warmth, almost as if Trollope herself despairs of her naughty Alice, but wants her so much to be OK at the end, as does the reader.<br />This book kept my interest until the very last sentence, and haunted me for days. It brings up as many questions as it answers, and offers no pat solutions. It is just, plain and simple, a story of ordinary, and very likeable, people.tle person, Alice begins to unravel.

About halfway through this convoluted but somewhat interesting tale based in Scotland's golfing country, I wondered if it is really fair to compare Robin Pilcher, a man well into middle age, judging by the photo on the book jacket, to his brilliant and much older mother.<br />But I also wondered if this book would be getting the attention it has if he did not carry the famous name.<br />For the record, then: I think I, and many other reviewers and readers, have established rather firmly that the son is not the mother. Although \\"Starting Over\\" weaves a tale of many different types of people with all sorts of secrets and private heartbreaks, there the comparison ends. This is a slow-moving, not very believable story about two farms, joined by marriage, that fall privy to a monied consortium that wants to turn the land into a prize golf course to rival St. Andrews and the other famous links on Fife's East Coast. This set of events strongly affects Elizabeth, who is only 37, but who acts and speaks as if she were 20 years older (I actually had to turn back to the first pages to confirm her age); her 20-year-old college student son Alex; her recently bereaved father; and her estranged, cheating husband Gregor.<br />Gregor, who speaks in hip, up-to-date language on one page, and lapses into a wee bit of Scottish dialect on the next, also seems older than his 38 years. He has taken up with a bimbo, thus losing his loyal wife and loving son. The bimbo has moved into Gregor's farmhouse (yeah, right), and cooks dinner in her tight pink pants while he helps the sheep give birth out in the barn.<br />Elizabeth (Liz) and Alex have decamped from their bimboed family home and taken up residence with her father, who IS old, but who manages to scramble up and down hills, do the work of 12 men himself, and lug extremely heavy golf bags for 18 holes without breaking a sweat. I kept expecting him to have a heart attack!<br />Then there is Roberta, an Australian 60-ish spinster who arrives in the vicinity after the death of her beloved father, to whom she had a childlike and chilish attachment, precluding any serious relationship for herself. It is her clubs that Liz's dad (called Mr. Craig through most of the book) is hefting about the golf courses, acting as her erstwhile caddy, because he senses sorrow in her demeanor, and thinks he can help.<br />Rounding out this motley crew is a highly eccentric professor of German from Alex's college, who needs lodgings and winds up at the farmhouse. He is given to spouting German that is never translated or explained. In the same way, another character (I won't be a spoiler and reveal in this review who he is) is fluent in Spanish, which comes in handy during a trip to Spain, but which is not translated either (I know Spanish, even to the point of recognizing the misspelled word, but it must be terribly annoying to those who do not, because there is quite a lot of it in the middle of the book).<br />OK, I have to say it: If these characters were gathered together in a book by Rosamunde, it all would have made sense, we would have come away with a new depth of understanding and a heartwarming sense of a story well-told. That is not the case here. The characters never really quite meld, the story is quite awkward in places, and in the end, nothing at all makes any sense.<br />I love Scotland, and I generally like books with ensembles rather than one or two characters, but I will not make the mistake again of expecting more than Robin Pilcher can give. He is a pleasantly average writer, and that is not a bad thing. And certainly, with this second book, he deserves to be reviewed on his own merits. I hope I have done so, but I have to admit that I did not see this book as having star quality.rives in the vicinity after the death of her beloved father, to whom she had a childlike and chilish attachment, precluding any serious relationship for herself.

1653288:US	49248343	R2XWNHPIMYD2YA	0684849046	754969196	The Deadhouse	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Lots to Yawn At	In this slow-moving entry in the Alex Cooper series, Linda Fairstein gets badly bogged down in some fairly esoteric New York history as she tries to tell the tale of a murdered college professor named Lola Dakota.<br />It seems that Lola had an all-consuming interest in Blackwell Island, a corollary to Manhattan Island that once housed a horrific set of prisons and hospitals during the historic plague years. Fairstein gives us an exhaustive and confusing history of the place, including its famed smallpox hospital, long gone to ruins. It's not that the history is not interesting, but it bogs the story down time and again until the plot lines often becomea confusing maze.<br />There are many possible suspects in the murder of Lola, whose life was apparently as flamboyant as her name. Alex and Chapman are on the case, examining everyone from Lola's abusive and shady ex-husband, the prime suspect, to Lola's equally shady professorial colleagues at the university. Since the murder has taken place during the Christmas holidays, the investigation--and the story--frequently gets sytmied by a lack of momentum.<br />Never is the book more frustrating than when we get more-than-we-needed glimpses into Alex's private life, this time with new and serious beau Jake, a high-profile TV journalist. As in the first three books, Fairstein's descriptions of Alex's personal life never quite come to life. The scenes between Jake and Alex, from the bedroom to the elegant restaurants they frequent, are embarrassingly stilted and ring untrue. Contrast that with the high-energy relationship between Alex and her cohorts, Chapman and Mercer, and the lesser characters in Alex's world of cops and prosecutors, and it seems even more out of place.<br />In \\"The Deadhouse,\\" particularly, much more so than the first three novels, this juxtaposition between Alex's intriguing and gritty work life and her sophisticated, wealthy, and--yes, boring--personal life, gets in the way of the story. The first three novels moved along at such a fast and interesting pace that the reader almost welcomed the breaks. But this novel is so slow-moving in every way, that the breaks simply serve to deaden one's interest. By the end of the book, I didn't much care who killed Lola or why, and I found the revelation of the murderer as big a yawn as the story itself.<br />Fairstein is a fine writer, and usually weaves an interesting tale, which made \\"The Deadhouse\\" even more disappointing to read. It is worth reading for those who are Alex Cooper addicts, but I certainly would not recommend this as a first taste of Fairstein. She can do much, much better.ree novels moved along at such a fast and interesting pace that the reader almost welcomed the breaks.

1656182:US	49248343	R11XPUJKACPDG3	0345351525	589915655	The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles, No. 3)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The Purest Vampire Novel	This book may have been the pinnacle of Rice's genius. It is here that we meet Akasha, the ancient Egyptian goddess (similar to Isis) rumored to be the first vampire, and worshipped by all the undead for all the centuries that have followed.<br />How did this come about? Was Akasha really the first? And if so, how did she become eternal? What were and are her dark secrets? To find out the answers, the reader must come along with Anne to ancient Egypt, where every grain of sand is lovingly described as only she can do.<br />This book, more so than those that came before in the Chronicles, is deeply violent and intense, and not for the weak of heart or stomach. But for those who love the vampire genre, there is a satisfying depth, a wealth of detail, both historical and fanciful, that can satisfy any reader.<br />The most fearsome and mesmerizing characters in the book, in my opinion, are not Akasha and her male consort, not Lestat (although of course I remain madly in love with him), but the scary creatures named Maharet and Mekare, older even than Akasha, more frightening and potent than any of the undead, and absolutely terrifying.<br />It is impossible to describe the plot here, other than to say that Akasha has been in a smoldering rage for several centuries, and has come back to avenge her rage--on Lestat himself, and on all men in particular. Why? Read the book and find out. And watch out for the Telemasca Society. First introduced in the Witch novels, these guys are too curious for their own good.<br />&quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; provided a wealth of new information for devoted readers of the Vampire Chronicles, and still remains, in this reviewer's opinion, as one of the best--Anne Rice in top form. Read it and enjoy.	2002-02-13

It was her contention, so the story goes, that a women could contribute to this genre just as well, if not better.<br />And so, under the pen name A. N. Roquelaure, Anne created a trilogy of intense sado-masochistic erotic novels loosely based on the fairytale \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\"<br />To say that these books are overwhelmingly intense is not to state the case. It is possible to read them without having a predeliction toward the acts that are graphically described on almost every page, but be warned that Anne, aka Roquelaure, pulls no punches, and there is absolutely nothing subtle or hinted at in these books.<br />Like everything Anne wrote before \\"Memnoch the Devil,\\" the Beauty Chronicles are works of genius, in my opinion. They contain the same richness, the same historical detail, the same darkness as all of her later books to come, including her chronicles of the witches, and the vampires. I am not a regular reader of such novels, so I cannot compare them to others of the genre, but I venture to say that these books have to stand out as unique at the least, mind-blowing at the most.<br />It is easy to understand the deep eroticism of Rice's witch and vampire books after sampling the Beauty chronicles. For many many years, I imagined Rice as a veritable cauldron of bubbling thoughts, erotic and otherwise, sane and otherwise, struggling to break free. These three books seem to prove the point, which is why I can view them as more than trash.<br />Anne knew what she was doing, and she did it, as only she can, in a spectacular manner. Again, be warned: If you are going to read the Beauty Chronicles, expect pure, savage erotica, with nothing hidden or explained away. I read these novels to gain more insight into what makes Rice tick. I did not come away unshocked or unscathed, but I certainly read her later works with a new understanding.	2002-02-13

(Case in point: This is the only book ever for which I stood in line for hours to have the author inscribe her name.)<br />I won't belabor the plot here; it is simply too baroque to try to put into simple words. Suffice to say that, in the first person, we meet Lestat, the teenaged son of an impoverished 18th-century nobleman, whose life is at best cold and harsh, at worst, a constant battle with cruelty of every sort for one's mere survival. One particularly dark and fiercely cold night, Lestat, a beautiful young man despite all his hardships, is out with his beloved dogs, hunting wolves. Into the strange fog he rides...and when he first hears the deep, surreal, and otherworldly voice calling him...\\"Wolf killer, wolf killer,\\" we are there with him. And we are by his side as he becomes, in a strangely but riveting erotic passage, one of the undead. A vampire unto eternity.<br />All of Anne Rice's intensity, her eroticism, her love of history, her incredible sense of detail, and her dark view of the world is present in this book, much more so than \\"Interview with a Vampire.\\"<br />It is my suggestion that, if you want to sample Anne Rice, and have never read any of her works, this may be the book you want to read. And if you know Rice's works but not this particular novel, I urge you not to deny yourself another minute. This is truly one of the must-reads of one's life.	2002-02-13

At the beginning of the story, his room is still light. Bunny is protracting the bedtime like any self-respecting toddler--in his case, he is saying \\"goodnight\\" to every single object in his room.<br />My children and I read this in a cadence that became part of the book. They chanted it along with me, and never tired of finding the elusive mouse, whose whereabouts change from page to page. We all said goodnight to everything in the room together--the comb and the brush and the bowl of mush were huge favorites.<br />Finally, the room darkens, the bunny's eyes start to close, and hopefully, one's own children are in the same condition. I love this book, as do my children, and hopefully when the time comes, their children will as well.	2002-02-10

He loved it then...he missed the message, but adored the thought of his mommy rocking him in her lap forever and ever.<br />For those who insist on finding hidden agendas in every book on earth, and who must put a political twist on every simple thing, may I offer a suggestion? Give your child a warm bath, dress him in his jammies, and take him and his blankie or bear onto your lap. Hold him close and rock him while you read this book. I guarantee you, the message he'll get is that your love is utterly secure, unbreakable, and forever. Is that bad?<br />My son went through all the stages depicted in the book, predictably and not without angst for his mother! Now he is 16, he towers over me, he has dredlocks (don't ask) and a deep voice. Yesterday, apropos of nothing, he said, \\"Mom, remember that book you used to read to me about the mother rocking the son? I just want you to know when you are old like that, I will come and rock YOU, just like the book.\\" And he gave me an awkward half-man, half-boy hug.<br />Is that \\"creepy\\"? If it is, that's just the type of creepiness we need more of in this world. Children need to believe that they are loved no matter what they do and how \\"horrible\\" they get. This book says that in the most beautiful way. I'm glad I read it to him then, I'm glad I have it now, and I insist on taking it for what it is, a thoroughly beautiful and wonderful book.	2002-02-10

I have noticed that several BPD sufferers have great issue with this book, and I thoroughly respect that.<br />For me, however, it was an enormous help. I found it recommended on a website with information on Borderline Personality Disorder. I had just ended a very painful and confusing relationship with a person I suspected might have BPD, and I wanted more information as a layperson, to heal myself, not him (it was too late in our relationship for that). I had experienced the &quot;I hate you, don't leave me&quot; syndrome with him repeatedly, until finally it became simply &quot;I hate you.&quot; I was doubting myself, confused, angry, hurt--the works.<br />This book put things in perspective for me in a way I could understand. I am philosophically opposed to &quot;self-help&quot; books, but in this case, I used the book as a tool to help me heal from my failed relationship. My copy of this book is dogeared, underlined, there are my comments scribbled in the margins, and notes to myself are on the endflaps. Recently, I dug out the book and reread it. I still found it an enormous and enlightening help.<br />Therefore, I recommend the book highly to those who need a place to begin in understanding BPD. It is too simplistic to be exhaustive, but it provides enough information, for me at least, to know where to go to seek more depth.	2002-02-03

I found it heartwarming, simple and sweet, and although other readers objected to what they thought was a simplistic and cliched plot, I did not.<br />The story concerns upper-class Scotsman David Inchelvie, who has lost his beloved wife Rachel to cancer. The untimely death of his life's partner has thrown David into a deep and dangerous depression, and forced his elderly father, Lord Inchelvie, to go back to work at the family's renowned distillery. For David, wallowing in his own grief, has brought his children back to his parents' estate, literally dropped them into his parents' care, and taken to the garden, where he is knee-deep in mud all day long. Yes, of course the mud is a metaphor for David's state of mind, and of course it is obvious. But it works.<br />Although the estate has a perfectly good gardener, David is only sane when he can dig, weed, plant, and work with his hands, as hard as any laborer. Only when he is thoroughly exhausted can he get through his days. His parents are worried sick, and his children need him, but he cannot pull himself out of the mire, literally or figuratively.<br />But things at the brewery are in sorry shape, as the unscrupulous general manager, who now has the sharp and heretofore cutting-edge boss's son out of the way, is planning nefarious deeds. Duncan Caple is not worried about the old man, as the Lord is easy to fool. But he wants David far away as he schemes to sell out the family's old and elegant business. Therefore, he sends David to America on a largely phony business pretext, and David, barely able to pull himself together, reluctantly agrees.<br />America is where David starts to notice the sun again. In a lovely village on Cape Cod, he passes himself off as a day laborer, and gets a job with Jasmine, whose philandering husband is off doing what he does best. David finds a small cottage, a horribly smelly dog, an unpretentious seaside village quite unlike what he is used to in Scotland, and a small boy who needs a father figure. And so the plot winds along to its inevitable conclusion, predictable, but wonderful.<br />What saves this book from banality is Pilcher's utterly ingenuous style, his obvious sincerity, his total honesty and the fact that he cares for his characters very much. In addition, he is a good writer who keeps the plot moving along with good descriptions, interesting plot twists, and a story that holds one's interest.<br />Is the son as good as the mother?

Everything she is as a woman is channeled into the inn, which she perfects down to the last detail.<br />All is going perfectly. Sloane is able to successfully deny her more sensual needs, and take pleasure in her growing business. Until an incredible guest shows up--a man who literally takes her breath away, fight it as she will. Carter turns out to be a best-selling author who needs a hideaway to escape his hectic life and meet the looming deadline for his next book. Sloane is viscerally attracted to him, but fiercely fights it down. Not only is she afraid of involvement, this man is strictly off limits. He is her best friend's fiance.<br />As the attraction between Sloane and Carter grows despite their best efforts, so does their guilt. Carter is not a lothario, but he is engaged for all the wrong reasons: his fiancee and her two small children have been left behind by the death of his best friend. Lending support and assistance, he found himself offering more. Now that he has met Sloane, he sees the error he has made, but it is too late. He feels he must honor his commitment.<br />Sloane, now desperately in love, feels the same, and it is almost unbearable. When the two finally make love, having lost their battle to stay apart, the reader is torn as well. Obviously, Sloane and Carter belong together, but is that fair?<br />The reader is kept on tenterhooks until almost the last page, and the ending is not predictable. This is a lovely romance, one with a conscience, and I recommend it highly.	2002-01-30

Schuyler's hateful sister and ne'er-do-well husband live at Belle Terre, but seem unable to save either the business or the estate. More exasperating, when Schuyler rolls up her sleeves to get to work, her sister's envy and hatred threaten to keep her from succeeding.<br />Enter the aforementioned lover, Cash Boudreaux, a native Cajun whose chip on his shoulder is equal only to his irresistable fascination for women. And Schuyler, who has known him from childhood, is not immune, although she tries as hard as she can to keep her confusing feelings to herself.<br />Now imagine a hot sultry night, a possible snakebite, and Cash Boudreaux performing his mysterious medical magic learned at his late mother's knee. Imagine him sucking the venom from your wrist. Holding you close to examine your wounds. Lifting you in his manly arms as you swoon. Oh yessssss....but unlike lesser romance novels, Sandra never sinks to the banal. This is not a bodice ripper. It has a plot, and plenty of it. There is mystery. A jailhouse rape. An abused woman who escapes only after her abuser dies horribly in a revenge killing as scary as any I have read.<br />There is a shady banker and his shallow wife, who has been having an affair with Cash. There is the mysterious force that is keeping the logging business in the red by any means, including fire. Is Cash the good guy? Or is he the evil behind all the mysterious deaths and destruction?<br />Read it and find out...and find yourself lured into the humid, sultry warmth of a hot bayou night.

It is markedly different than her first two books--one expects Cary Grant to saunter onto the pages at any minute, resplendent in tuxedo and sporting his usual savoir faire.<br />Instead, we have hardboiled street cop/renaissance man Mike Chapman, Alex's fast-talking, down-to-earth and impossibly endearing sidekick. Whether it's questioning a recalcitrant sidekick, stuffing his mouth at a resplendent Italian-food restaurant, or betting Alex on the nightly Final Jeopardy question, Mike is always in top form. But this time, he may be in over his head.<br />When Deni Caxton, the estranged wife of an internationally renowned art dealer, is found raped and murdered, Alex, as New York's Assistant District Attorney for the Sex Crimes Unit (as is Linda Fairstein in real life), is called onto the case. Almost immediately, she, Mike, and Mike's able partner Mercer are caught in a confusing whirlpool of events that pulls them ever deeper into a well of murder. In short succession, several other bodies are found, and each seems to tie in some way with Deni Caxton's demise.<br />The more Alex and her friends try to unravel the clues, the more they are drawn into a seemingly endless web of shady art dealers, mysterious Mata-Hari-type women, jailhouse thugs, antique dealers, and a cast of characters that would put Hitchcock to shame. It's obvious that Fairstein had a lot of fun with this novel, and it shows. Over and above the very real and perplexing mystery is the author's own unique view of the art world her fictional characters are exploring. The result is suspenseful, fun, and easy to read.<br />The only negative to be said about this book is that there are so many characters, one almost needs a cast sheet to keep them straight. Several times, I found myself looking back 100 pages or so to verify who was whom. This slowed me down, but was certainly not annoying enough to stop reading.<br />There is enough suspense in this book, including the near-murder of a cop near and dear to Alex's heart and a chilling encounter with the man who may be the perpetrator, to keep the reader turning the pages. This time I did guess the murderer, but not until near the end of the book. Like Final Jeopardy, it was good to be right for once!<br />This is a fun and well-written series, and Linda Fairstein has joined my list of favorite writers.

I could't turn the pages fast enough to find out just when (not if) Rusty and Cooper would finally come together in body and mind. It takes quite a while, actually, and during that time, the two must learn to respect and accommodate each other's differences. Instead of a huge yawn and an &quot;oh no, not again,&quot; Brown manages to make this relationship truly interesting, and engages the reader so that one really cares what happens. And that is Brown's great talent, the one that pulls her above the usual cheap-romance drivel.<br />Yes, the couple is rescued, but there is no happily-ever-after the minute they hit civilization. In fact, if anything, the rescue seems to destroy the relationship they so carefully evolved when relying on only each other. Can their love survive the real world? Read it and see. This is a great, cuddly bathrobe-fuzzy slipper type of romance, one to savor and enjoy.	2002-01-21

This cookbook [...] commentary is worth its weight in gold for any WWF fan. I'm not sure the recipes rank up there in my top 50 favorites (in fact, I haven't tried most of them)...but the commentary is so hilarious, so absolutely right, that I can't stop smiling whenever I read it.<br />Thus, Chyna's (fairly ordinary) recipe for guacamole \\"explains why she is the ninth wonder of the world.\\" Even WWF head Vince McMahon is represented. He's got a really interesting recipe for \\"Grilled Grapefruit\\" that I haven't tried, but want to do so. It requires very large grapefruits--and the off-color commentary that accompanies the recipe--well--you have to read it.<br />Of course all of the WWF superstars are represented, from Stone Cold Steve Austin to Triple H et al. In addition to the raucous, ribald addenda to the recipes are pictures of the stars that you have to see to believe (check out Chyna's just-this-side-of-decent portrait on her guacamole page, for instance).<br />Open this book, and you can just hear Jim \\"J.R.\\" Ross touting the recipes in his overloud, overexcited way: \\"Did you see THAT? I can't BELIEVE IT!\\" Buy it for the sheer exuberance. You may like the recipes, you may not, but this book is a bowlful of fun.<br />Hey, Rock! Wait for me!

And that the joys of knowing one's self enough to indulge in such a relationship are one of the perks of getting older.<br />Oh, what a dear and lovely book, and what a good, old-fashioned story! What I love so about Ms. Pilcher is that she makes no apologies for her style. It is simple, direct, in-your-face story-telling, with absolutely no ulterior motives whatsoever.<br />The book is so rich is its characterisations and in its small things--a description of a dog, a bedroom, a small moment in a garden--that it is difficult to describe a &quot;plot&quot; per se, although of course there is one. Briefly, then, aging, eclectic former actress Elfrida (a delight in herself) moves (albeit reluctantly) to a village that she deems appropriate for those of advancing age, like herself. There, she sets up a lifestyle in a small cottage, and the highlight of this lifestyle is that, for once, she is able to do whatever she darn pleases, like it or not.<br />In time, she befriends former schoolteacher and musician Oscar Blundt and his domineering wife, neighbors who become comfortable companions for the very self-reliant Elfrida. Meanwhile, Carrie, Elfrida's second cousin, has returned to London from Austria, where, as a very successful travel agent, she has had her heart broken by a failed romance. Carrie, to her consternation (as she is not ready to take on any more responsibility and only wants to be &quot;mothered&quot;), finds her 14-year-old niece Lucy in dire straits, ignored by her horrible mother, and overly spoiled by her equally horrible grandmother. Carrie must, very reluctantly, do something to help Lucy--her conscience will not let her ignore that young girl's distress. What better thing, then, to go off and visit Counsin Elfrida?<br />To &quot;thicken the stew&quot; of these very dissimilar characters, along comes young, stalwart and attractive Sam, a successful businessman who is recalled from New York by his demanding company chairman to try to revitalize an ailing Scottish textile mill.<br />All of these separate and equally lonely (although all would deny it) souls come together during a cold and bleak winter...and each is warmed as his or her life becomes woven in a tapestry involving the others.<br />Sigh. This just may be the perfect book, one to read and savor, ideally on a snowy day, wrapped in an afghan with a dog at one's feet, a cat on one's lap, and a cup of something warm and wonderful to drink. But it works just as well sitting in an orthodontist's office waiting to take your preteen home and feed him/her pizza so you can have more time to read this fabulour book!off and visit Counsin Elfrida?<br />To &quot;thicken the stew&quot; of these very dissimilar characters, along comes young, stalwart and attractive Sam, a successful businessman who is recalled from New York by his demanding company chairman to try to revitalize an ailing Scottish textile mill. <br />All of these separate and equally lonely (although all would deny it) souls come together during a cold and bleak winter...and each is warmed as his or her life becomes woven in a tapestry involving the others.<br />Sigh.

First-novelist Karin Slaughter has a message: All Men Are Swine!!!! Yes, it's true. From Daddy to Big Brother to Uncle to cheating husbands to serial rapists...they all think with their genitalia. And no woman, no matter how strong, fierce, intelligent, worldwise, or saintly, can escape damage. If they are lucky, they might get away with a few scratches--like being blinded for life. If not, well, how about being carved to pieces during and after a rape (which the author, in the earnest voice of one of her characters, carefully explains to us is NOT a sexual crime, but one of anger, control, and hatred of women. Whew! Glad to know that.).<br />Because this is a first novel, I tried very hard as a reader to give Ms. Slaughter the benefit of the doubt. OK, some of her premises are not only unbelieveable, but hilarious. Case in point: a single young mother dies two weeks after giving birth to twin girls. Does the state give the babies to a loving, adoptive couple? Hell no...they go to an alcoholic bachelor uncle! Yeah, right...and does Uncle do well by his charges? Refer to paragraph one above. The book is riddled with equally ridiculous circumstances, which makes it very hard to take seriously. I will not name them here, because many of the worst offenses take place late in the book when the murderer is revealed. But trust me.<br />Let's move on to the flat, dull, and singularly unlikeable main character: Grant County, Georgia, pediatrician and coroner Dr. Sara Linton (yes, I said pediatrician and coroner. First you deal with a 12-year-old boy who has a fatal, incurable disease, then you hop-skip to the morgue to perform an autopsy on a friend who has had a fatal encounter with the most vicious rapist ever known [see first paragraph above]). Dr. Linton is, dare I say it? A SAINT. But she has a few problems, not the least of which is that her ex-husband, the love of her life, did something BAD to her from which she will never recover emotionally, no matter how much he slimes around and oozes guilt. Said ex-husband, Jeffrey, happens to double as the police chief, so he has lots of time to ooze, as he inexplicably must chat up Sara during each of the unspeakable autopsies of the victims. He is so sincere. But of course, being a man, so terribly insensitive. Case in point: Sara, having found the first victim's bloody, battered, defiled, mutilated body, which literally falls on her, must now perform the gruesome autopsy. Jeffrey's question: &quot;Sara, are you ok?&quot; MEN! Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. Sara is just bowled over by the stupidity of the question. Gosh, can you blame her, girls?<br />Let's move on now to hard-bitten, chip-on-her-shoulder Lena Adams, Jeffrey's hand-picked deputy, and the twin sister of the first victim. Lena is devastated, of course, by her sister's murder. So devastated that she easily escapes poor, ineffectual, solicitous Jeffrey, runs into the morgue, breaches all security, and bursts into the correct autopsy room in time to see every vicious wound on her sister before startled Sara has time to clean up the body for viewing. And whose fault is that, huh? Well Jeffrey's of course. Sara glares at him over the body and the grieving Lena, but Jeffy-boy is glad to see that at least Sara combed the blood out of the corpse's hair before her twin could see her.<br />OK, enough. I gave this book three stars because it is a first effort, and it is obvious that Ms. Slaughter made a herculean try at writing a really meaningful novel. What she meant to do, I think, was to transcend the average serial-rapist novel and try to give meaning to violence run amok. I recognize and applaud her earnest attempt. Supposedly, &quot;Blindsighted&quot; is the first in a trilogy. I'm sure it's too late, but I beg Ms. Slaughter to please step down from the soapbox, round out her very one-dimensional cliched characters, and just tell the story.limes around and oozes guilt.

Linda Fairstein's second foray into the world of New York Assistant DA Alex Cooper is even better than the first. Before you start it, though, lock yourself into a padded room, turn off the phones, the computer, the TV et al., send the kids off to grandma, and your significant other off to Zanzibar. Because, and yes it's been said before, you will NOT be able to put this one down.<br />The fast-paced story begins with the bloody murder of a brilliant neurosurgeon at a prestigious New York hospital. One of the few women in her field, Gemma Dogan has been a superstar all of her professional life. Her murder, occurring as it has within hospital walls and without apparent motive, becomes front-page news faster than you can say &quot;perpetrator.&quot;<br />And who IS the perp? Alex has been called into the case because the victim was found in a state suggesting sexual assault, and Alex heads the sex-crimes unit. She and her sidekick, homicide cop Mike Chapman, along with their good bud Mercer (also a homicide cop) are stumped. The more clues they gather, the more clueless they become--nothing adds up. The reader is in the same boat. Unlike the majority of crime novels, &quot;Likely to Die&quot; does not give the reader a single possibility  of who the murderer might be. This is absolutely NOT an &quot;aha!&quot; type of book!<br />When at last, through much detective work and personal danger, our team figures it all out, one of them is already in the hands of the murderer. And about to die.<br />I can say no more. But I can assure you that, unlike the tabloid press in the book, which suddenly bulges with witnesses who &quot;knew it all along,&quot; the reader is in the dark from start to finish. This is one heck of a good novel. If you are looking for an intelligent, nonstop, well-written, spine-tingling mystery, give this one a try. it is well worth the eyestrain you'll get from reading all night long!	2002-01-16

It is the basis of many phobias, from fear of flying to claustrophia. So imagine how it must feel for a strong, vibrant, very controlling professional woman--a successful columnist, renowned speaker, revered mother, grandmother, and friend--to know that she is inexorably succumbing to a disease that will leave her completely helpless.<br />That terror, faced by a woman in her prime who slowly suspects that she is suffering from Alzheimers Disease, is what is so finely captured in this book. The early symptoms, resultant anger and denial, fearful acceptance, and slow decline of Grace Dorian, a nationally famous advice columnist, is described in heartbreaking detail, first from her point of view, and then from the points of view of each of her subsequent caretakers, from her daughter Francine, who has always been eclipsed by her powerful mother's shadow, to Francine's daughter Sophia, a troubled young woman with problems of her own, to Father Jim, a priest and childhood friend who is Grace's closest friend and confidante.<br />There are many subplots as well, of course, and they could be considered the usual standard romance-novel fare except that the over-riding reality of Grace's illness and her family's response to it rings so true that it makes everything else in the novel interesting and believable.<br />Therefore, timid Francine, forced to ghostwrite her mother's syndicated columns, gains strength and insight. Handsome young doctor Davis Marcoux, who is compassion itself when it comes to treating Grace, provides a love interest for one of the main characters. Troubled Sophie, who idolizes her grandmother, is forced to grow up overnight. Father Jim, devastated by his close friend's interest, must finally reveal a terrible secret.<br />It sounds trite and contrived, but &quot;Shades of Grace&quot; is written with such compassion and humanity, such earnest honesty, that it is impossible to put down until the last heart-wrenching page. It is easy to identify with the characters, particularly Grace in the early stages of the disease, as she jeopardizes her life in her absolute need for denial. And for Francine, who must switch roles with her formerly domineering mother. And for Sophia, who must overcome her inner horror at her mother's and grandmother's role reversals.<br />I am not going to tell you that this is a fun, day-at-the-beach read. But it is well worth picking up, and in my opinion, remains in the top 5 of Delinsky's ouvre. Her later novels may be more sophisticated, but none equals the sheer heart of &quot;Shades of Grace.&quot;the last heart-wrenching page.

Linda Fairstein has served for many years as New York's Assistant District Attorney in charge of prosecuting sex crimes. And according to all accounts, she is brilliant at her job. Well, Fairstein can put another notch in her belt, because she is a fine writer as well--right up there with the best of the genre.<br />&quot;Final Jeopardy,&quot; her debut novel, introduces Alexandra Cooper, coincidentally an Assistant District Attorney in charge of prosecuting New York's sex crimes. Along with her very likeable sidekick, wisecracking but brilliant cop Mike Chapman, Alex works diligently to see that &quot;her&quot; victims, dead or alive, get justice. It's a grueling, wrenching task, but Alex thrives on it.<br />The book is off to a racing start as Alex, more than a little bit startled, reads her own obituary in the morning papers. And it never lets up from there. The confusion about Alex's &quot;death&quot; is solved quickly, but tragically. It seems that a good friend of hers, sexy bombshell actress Isabella Lascar, has been murdered while spending a supposedly incognito weekend at Alex's private Martha's Vineyard retreat. Was the murderer after Isabella? Or was it a case of mistaken identity--was the bullet really meant for Alex herself?<br />Those questions are only the beginning as Alex finds herself increasingly tangled in an incomprehensible web of intrigue. Who is the murderer? Try and guess. I did--and wasn't even close. There are enough colorful characters in the book, nefarious and otherwise, to make the reader keep turning the pages to find out who the &quot;perp&quot; is--and even more importantly, why the crime was committed in the first place.<br />From the first page to the breath-stopping last, this book has a ring of authenticity, and why not? Fairstein has lived what she writes, and it shows. Rumor has it that Ms. Fairstein has recently retired from her day job. Good! That means she can devote ALL her time to writing more juicy crime novels for those of us who are hooked!<br />I'm thrilled to have found her, and have already started the second in her Alexandra Cooper series. If you haven't treated yourself to Ms. Fairstein, give her a try.

Intent on a mission only he knows, Lucas kidnaps Aislin, the blonde, blue-eyed daughter of a prominent Arizona couple--and flees across Arizona with hostage in tow.<br />Danger, intrigue, and raw sexuality mark the desperate flight. What will happen to Aislin? She represents everything Anglo, whom Lucas loathes as oppressors of his people. He sees her as a symbol, not a woman. She, in turn, can't help being both awed and terrified by this dark and intense stranger whose motives she cannot guess.<br />Both Lucas and Aislin have to let go of their stereotypes as they enter the Navajo reservation where Lucas has been bound all along. And both have to fight hard to deny the growing attraction between them. As this fast-moving and sexy story moves toward its inevitable conclusion, there are plenty of surprises on the way--for Lucas, his family--and Aislin.<br />As improbable as the plot may be, this is nevertheless one of Sandra Brown's best. Lucas Greywolf is one of her most finely drawn male heroes, and Aislin is more than his match. A perfect read for a cold winter's day!	2002-01-01

And this book has it.<br />The plot is simple enough on the surface: Three generations of the Van Allen women are facing a major life phase, each coincidentally at the same time.<br />Grandmother Dana, about to turn 70, is facing the spectre of old age, and fighting it tooth and nail. She is afraid to grow old, afraid to become helpless (as who is not?), afraid of losing control. Healthy and vibrant still, she yearns to stay that way. But her coming milestone birthday has forced her to examine her life. Has it been what she expected? Did she do right by her husband, her daughter, her son-in-law, her granddaughter? Above all, did she do right by herself? There are no easy answers, of course, and no pat solutions, either.<br />Dana's daughter Carrie is suddenly thrust into single-womanhood after a car accident leads to her husband's untimely death. As with any woman in this situation, either by choice (divorce) or by fate, Carrie is forced to question her most deeply held values. And to examine a marriage ended by death, but still very much alive in her head. Like her mother, Carrie, in her early 40s, with a teenaged daughter, and facing the overwhelming spectre of pulling herself together and getting a job, is questioning her life choices. What exactly pulled her to this spot and this time? How will she ever begin again, and when she does, who will she be?<br />Carrie's daugher Ruth is 15, facing all the uncertainties of that age--along with mourning the loss of her father. Hovering between childhood and womanhood, she questions everything about herself--and her mother, who is appearing all too human as she copes with her grief and guilt over her husband's death.<br />Some truly ingenious subplots, one about a faux Noah's Ark, another about a health-food cum aromatherapy mecca, keep the story going. The lesser characters in the book, from a lecherous idiot who hits on Carrie on her worst day, to Jess, the man she loved before her marriage, are three dimensional and very real.<br />I loved this book. In my view, it has more depth than &quot;The Saving Graces,&quot; although, judging from other reviews, I seem to be in the minority. I'm going to stick by my opinion, though, and give this book a solid and strong 4 stars.

This one grabbed me by the throat, shook me to the core, and violated my sleep.<br />If one reviews the plot only, &quot;The Surgeon&quot; sounds like just another good offering in the serial-killer-stalks-victim genre. But it is so much more. The story follows Boston surgeon Catherine Cordell, a beautiful and brilliant doctor who fled her native South two years previously after a violent assault in which she murdered her rapist. Suddenly, the rapist seems to have risen from the dead--and is stalking Cordell relentlessly.<br />As he closes in on his prey, he commits a string of appallingly gruesome rape/mutilation murders on several women--again, the exact MO of the man Cordell murdered two years previously.<br />The cops are baffled. Is this a copycat murderer? If so, how can this man know the heretofore hidden details of the previous killer's style? Every detail, down to the last horrific display of the victims, is identical to that of the previous murderer. Police detective Moore, a decent and good man, still mourning his wife who died of cancer, and a hard-bitten female cop with an impossible chip on her shoulder, team up to stop the killer before he commits any more atrocities.<br />But therein lies the problem: The killer seems to be invisible. Despite the very bloody and unspeakable mayhem he wreaks, he leaves no trace of himself: no DNA, no fingerprints, nothing. He simply seems to vanish into thin air. But WE know this murderer. We don't know who he is, but we are privy to the chilling and insane entries into his private journal. And in this way we become part of his sick fantasies, as unwilling to do so as his intended prize: Catherine Cordell.<br />&quot;The Surgeon&quot; is the first and only book of its genre to ever give me nightmares. Like the victims in the story, I was drawn into the killer's horrible mind and could not escape until the last page was over. I recommend this book as a classic of its kind: superb writing, tense, nail-biting suspense, and a mystery that never falters.was over.

I'm at a loss to know what it is about this simple piece of fluff that is upsetting other reviewers so much. It isn't as though it is masquerading as anything else but what it is: a Christmas Card of a short story. Nora Roberts did something similar for her readers, providing two such stories, but they were available only on her website, not as a commercial enterprise.<br />It doesn't bother me that this little story is a tie-in to Hallmark snowmen. I thought it was a cute idea, and could be appealing to a certain type of audience. The fact that the tie-in exists is no worse than many others on the market at this time of year, eg, stuffed bunnies as companions to &quot;Pat the Bunny,&quot; a classic children's book.<br />Certainly, the story is completely harmless, albeit &quot;quick and dirty.&quot; It has nothing offensive in it, the book is very sweet, children will love it, and Mitfordholics, I think, should take it for what it is. I don't think that Jan Karon meant this little offering to be compared with a full-blown Mitford novel. Are there other, better books in this genre? Yes, of course. Too many to name here. Does that make this particular item so horrible? I don't think so.	2001-12-15

The gritty realism of the crash site, combined with Reichs' usual unflinching descriptions of the victims' remains, forms the backdrop for a mystery that begins when Brennan finds a human foot she suspects is not part of the accident.<br />Suddenly, Brennan is yanked from the case, her name smeared across the press, and her professional reputation put in serious jeopardy as she is accused of &quot;tampering with a crash site.&quot; Of course she has done no such thing--as followers of this series know, Brennan is a straight-arrow forensic anthropologist whose work ethic is scrupulous. So what's going on? That question forms the rest of the story, as Brennan struggles to solve the mystery of the foot and to save her good name. She has some powerful enemies bent on stopping her, not the least of whom is the state's attorney general.<br />There are some satisfying plot twists to this story as well: Brennan's cop friend Ryan is part of the investigation. Ryan's long-time partner was a passenger on the doomed airliner, and his remains cannot be found. The partner was escorting a well-known prisoner back to Canada for trial. Did the crash have something to do with freeing the criminal? Was he even on the plane? What caused the plane to go down? The theories are rife, and Brennan is itching to get back on the scene. Dogged by the press, in danger of losing her job at the university, humiliated and angry, she throws herself into the parallel mystery of the foot--and uncovers more than she bargained for.<br />&quot;Fatal Voyage&quot; is a strong and satisfying mystery, and Tempe Brennan is back in form as the strong, no-nonsense, and likeable woman we came to know in &quot;Deja Dead.&quot; Yes, she is vulnerable, especially in the scenes with her ex-husband Pete, whom she still loves, and in her acerbic courtship dance with Ryan, to whom she is deeply attracted. It's good to see Reich finally get control of Brennan's personal side, describing her interactions with the two men in her life in a sympathetic and believeable manner. Brennan's incredible strength in the face of professional adversity, her dogged determination to do right by the victims whose remains she must identify, and her tenacity in solving the mystery that is somehow connected with her banishment from the crash scene juxtapose nicely with her vulnerable side. And her interactions with a brand-new character, an irrascible dog who has become her simultaneous bane and companion, adds some much-needed humor to this very grim tale.<br />It's good to see Reichs AND Brennan back in form. If the rest of the series is as strong and well-written as &quot;Fatal Voyage,&quot; Reichs will definitely remain a formidable contender in the forensic mystery genre.uot;Deja Dead.&quot; Yes, she is vulnerable, especially in the scenes with her ex-husband Pete, whom she still loves, and in her acerbic courtship dance with Ryan, to whom she is deeply attracted.

Well...possibly, but I'll settle for the idea that, in some weird way, she became my role model. And that has to be a tribute to Herman Wouk, who tells a tale like no other. I had nothing in common with Marjorie, whose story takes place in the Thirties, and who is the product of a rigidly structured conservative Jewish life in New York City. I, on the other hand, grew up in California several decades later, Jewish in name only. But I too felt that I was chafing at the bit to get out and be &quot;free.&quot;<br />Marjorie, who is 17 when we meet her, is a spoiled-rotten beauty whose hard-working parents have lifted themselves from their Orthodox roots and become &quot;upwardly mobile&quot; in a time when that phrase was unknown. Uncomfortable in their new world, the parents enforce the same rigid rules upon Marjorie that they grew up with themselves. Paramount to this mind-set is the implacable requirement that a girl remain a strict virgin until marriage. And the corollary: marriage and a family are the only things to which a girl should aspire--all else is superfluous.<br />But Marjorie wants to be an actress, and in her naivete, believes that she will become the diva of her dreams. As she sets out on her quest, she meets a number of people from what would later be known as the counterculture. And she sees life as it is outside her very structured and safe world, falls in love with it, and with the highly unsuitable man who represents all of her hopes and dreams: a bipolar song writer named Noel Airman.<br />Marjorie's genuine and deep struggle to adopt her new world while unable to shed the old forms the crux of the story. I was rooting for her--every time I read the book, I wanted her to conquer Broadway, run away with Noel, and leave her upbringing behind. At the time, I was bitterly disappointed in the ending. In fact, I used to skip it! But now, with many years of some Marjorie-like adventures behind me, I see that Wouk could have ended it no other way. He remained true to his character, and true to his voice.<br />I re-read this book with the idea of writing a glowing review. But time has worked its changes on my psyche. And what I considered perfectly normal in the days when I was a teen under the same sexual and marital restrictions as Marjorie, I now see from a modern perspective. There is a part in the book where the loss of a woman's virginity outside of marriage is described as a &quot;deformity,&quot; never to be healed or overcome. That's strong stuff. It scared me to death as a girl, and angers me now. But that does not take away from Wouk's talent. Read it as a period piece, and rejoice that Marjorie turns out alright in the end., I used to skip it!

The story takes place on a wagon train to Texas, and whether or not Brown researched her facts, it all rings perfectly true. In fact it is mesmerizing.<br />The book begins as a young girl gives birth alone and in agony, in the woods. Rather than hoping for herself and the baby to live, she prays for death for them both. Half her wish comes true: the baby is stillborn, and Lydia, the young mother, falls into unconsciousness.<br />Before the wolves can find her, Lydia, still unconscious, is found by the Langtry family, and is saved by Ma Langtry, who happens to be the midwife-cum-earth mother for a wagon train heading west. Lydia awakes in Ma's wagon, in a clean bed, wearing a clean nightgown, and lovingly tended by Ma and her daughter Anabeth. We soon realize that Lydia is woefully innocent of female matters, to the point where she hardly realizes how she got pregnant in the first place. But even in her pain and weakness, she refuses to divulge the name of the baby's father.<br />Meanwhile, in another wagon, one of the group's handsome and stalwart leaders, Ross Coleman, has just lost his dainty blueblood wife in childbirth. The baby survives, but will soon die if it cannot be nourished, and in his grief, Coleman barely spares his new son a glance. Enter Ma Coleman. She has a girl without a baby, and a baby without a mother. Voila! Lydia will serve as wet-nurse to the infant. Despite Coleman's strong objections, Lydia is moved to his wagon, is helped by Ma to put the baby to her breast, and baby and girl form an instant bond.<br />Not so Lydia and the girl's father. Ross is convinced that Lydia, an unmarried mother, is a tramp. Lydia's pride will not let her dispute that point. The animosity between the two is somewhat tempered by the infant's obvious health and contentment in Lydia's care, and her willingness to work as hard as any of the other women in the pioneer group. Of course, an attraction arises and grows between Ross and Lydia, and that is the heart of the book.<br />But their relationship is as bumpy as the dangerous trail they are traveling. Not only do they have to contend with the hardships and dangers that any wagon train would face, but they are also being stalked by a murderous madman intent on rape and murder. Will Ross ever acknowledge his love for Lydia? Will she be able to overcome her fear of men enough to be in his arms? Will the baby survive? Will the madman destroy the wagon train?<br />Read the book and find out...it will be impossible to put down until the explosive conclusion.the pioneer group.

Nora Roberts, in my opinion, is always at her best when she gives in to pure fantasy and indulges herself in a tale as warm and satisfying as a cup of hot chocolate.<br />&quot;Heaven and Earth,&quot; the second in her Three Sisters trilogy, is just such a book. It's about witchcraft, an ancient spell, a mysterious stranger, and the age-old struggle of good against evil. But being Nora, storyteller extraordinaire, she doesn't make it quite that simple. &quot;Good&quot; in this book is represented by thorny, difficult Ripley Todd, deputy sheriff of the small island, and an unwilling witch. Her struggles to deny her own powers lead her to frequent rudeness and sometimes downright nastiness. Even her growing feelings for MacAllister Booke, a newcomer to the island with a scholarly interest in the paranormal, must be ruthlessly held at bay. It is Ripley who is chosen by forces she cannot control to face and conquer the evil.<br />But &quot;evil,&quot; in this case, is a poor shnook of a middle-aged man, a wanna-be superstar author--in reality a third-rate journalist.  Just as it is impossible to see Ripley as all good, since her flaws are so apparent, so it is impossible to see this guy as all bad. It is this contradiction in the expected that makes Nora Roberts the best-selling author she is.<br />All of the characters from the first book, &quot;Dancing on Air,&quot; are here, and the reader greets them like old friends. The witchcraft is fascinating, entirely fantastical, and not to be taken too seriously by those who are offended by wiccan dogma. This is just a story. And one that will leave you with a sigh, a big smile, and the need to hug somebody.<br />Read it!	2001-12-08
1742880:US	49248343	RD7ZESITCH6QQ	0425155293	626699567	The Rector's Wife	Books	5	34	35	N	N	Still Her Best	Having read just about all of Joanna Trollope's wonderful books, I have come to regard \\"The Rector's Wife\\" as her very best, for so many reasons.<br />For those of us who have ever felt the despair of knowing that love alone cannot save a marriage; for those of us who have been drawn into a loved-one's depression and cannot break free; and for any mother alive who has had a hurting, unpopular child--this book describes feelings that are impossible to put into words.<br />Anna Bouverie (yes, I see the parallel to Madame Bovary, but Anna has more soul) is the wife of a village rector. Her life is rigidly circumscribed by the expectations of her husband's parisioners. Thus, it is important that she head certain \\"rotas\\" (I love that word; British for \\"rotations,\\" meaning committee members who take turns doing church chores). It is imperative that she appear impeccable in her clothing, her behavior, her mothering, and just about everything else. This is not easy, as her stolid, dogmatic husband Peter makes such a paltry living that their children have to wear parishioners' second-hand giveaways. In fact, the Bouveries are living in a kind of static hell, although nobody but poor, miserable schoolgirl Flora seems to realize it, and her perceptions are all about being a misfit in her horrid school.<br />Peter and Anna are sustained by a bright vision of the future: Peter hopes to be named archdeacon, which will change their circumstances considerably. The bitter loss of this hope is the catalyst that eventually destroys Peter--and sets Anna free.<br />As Peter sinks inexorably into a deep, surly depression, Anna's attempts to reach him, to connect as they did when their marriage was young, are angrily rebuffed. On her own, metaphorically at least, Anna, desperate to remove Flora from the hated school and place her in another where she can thrive, takes a practical step. She gets a job stacking shelves in a supermarket, so she can earn enough money to pay for the new school.<br />The outraged gossip from a secretly delighted parish (not only is the rector's wife working; but she is placing their child in a Catholic school! Horrors!) Peter's icy, enraged reaction, and Anna's rebirth as a woman form the crux of the rest of the story. Events simply evolve, unstoppable and unpreventable, even as they race to their (...)conclusion.<br />I love this book. I love the truth of it. I love Trollope's eye for rural British life; I love her characterizations; I love her understated and measured style of writing. If you only read one Joanna Trollope book, make this the one.l.<br />The outraged gossip from a secretly delighted parish (not only is the rector's wife working; but she is placing their child in a Catholic school!

Lest the reader forget that fact, she unceasingly uses every nonhuman metaphor she can think up (and she thinks up MANY; this is one of her talents) to describe the ungodly bikers who engage in a turf war in Montreal, slaying themselves and innocent victims caught in the crossfire.<br />The result is a hodgepodge of cliches and unbelievable plot threads, interspersed with the interminable lectures we have come to expect from this author. (In the first book, it was pages of explanation on how stab wounds on bones can be differentiated; in the second book it was a nauseating treatise on maggots feeding upon dead human bodies; in this book, it is a lengthy discourse on the physics of blood splatters.)<br />And thereby lies the crux of Reich's problem: Obviously a brilliant forensic anthropologist herself, she cannot decide whether to write textbooks or fiction. This book is an uneasy blend of both.<br />As a result, her characterizations not only lack believability, they are beginning to vary seriously from book to book. Case in point: the heroine (Tempe Brennan) has morphed from a sharp-as-nails tough guy to a self-doubting, over-eating mess. If Reichs is trying to tell us that the job is getting to Brennan, she has not done so in any way I can accept or believe.<br />Then there is Brennan's impossibly callow jerk of a nephew, Kit. In &quot;Death du Jour,&quot; Kit appears briefly as an intelligent, well-spoken and mature kid (he's 19). In this book, he is whiny, selfish, more than a little stupid, and displays a vocabulary purported to be Texan, but which, I am fairly sure, no young man, Texan or otherwise, has ever used. It's embarrassing. Kit bumbles straight into a next of biker trouble because of his worship of Harley cycles. The new Dr. Brennan, so strong and forceful in the other books, is powerless to help him, so she has lots of nightmares.<br />Even Brennan's arch rival, the nasty detective Claudel, now sports a more-than-passing knowledge of rock music, a new, hip, vocabulary, and the inability to remember that Brennan is a doctor. He now calls her &quot;Ms.&quot; Brennan, quite a departure.<br />I could go on, but I won't. People tell me that the next book in this series, &quot;Fatal Voyage,&quot; is much better, and I hope so. Reichs burst on the scene in a wave of genius, and has deteriorated with each succeeding book. I hope this one is the nadir. I gave it 3 stars because the last 50 pages pick up enormously, and actually provide an interesting ending. I would not tell anyone not to read it, but be warned: it's a tedious undertaking.han-passing knowledge of rock music, a new, hip, vocabulary, and the inability to remember that Brennan is a doctor.

All through his early toddler years, it was his bedtime favorite, his naptime favorite, a comfort when he was tearful, and his best friend. How many times did he curl up on my lap with his blankie and his thumb while I rocked him and read this book?<br />The &quot;plot&quot; concerns a baby bird who hatches while the mother bird is out of the nest. Baby sets out to find his mother, and asks everything and everyone he sees, &quot;Are You My Mother?&quot; The &quot;Snort&quot; reference comes when the baby bird asks a huge piece of digging equipment, and...&quot;The big thing just said SNORT!&quot; This is what my son waited for throughout the book...he laughed every single time. And still does.<br />In the end, the birdie finds his mommy. The perfect, secure ending for a small child who wants reassurance before bed, or any time. This book is a classic. My son still has it, and I know he will read it to his own children some day. I hope I am there to see it.	2001-11-25

The plot is not as taut, the writing not as spare, and the characters less finely drawn than in her debut novel, &quot;Deja Dead.&quot; Nevertheless, this is still a fun, fast read. If not as suspenseful as the first book, it still weaves a scary tale of a shady cult whose members, including infants, keep turning up dead.<br />Temperance is a fascinating character and a welcome change from her fictional counterpart, Kay Scarpetta. Unlike Scarpetta, however, Temperance (Tempe), whose duties include teaching at the university level, is fond of lecturing. In Book 1, there was a highly technical and interesting discussion of all the different cuts that can be made to human bones, and why their differences matter. In this book, there is an informative but truly nauseating discussion of maggots and blowflies and their lifecycles on human cadavers. Strong stuff; not really necessary to the plot, but hey, I'll never look at a fly in the same way again.<br />The problem with this book is that, at this early stage in the series at least, Reichs seems very uncomfortable with the human side of her characters. She can write about maggots devouring dead human flesh for pages at a time, but give her a love scene and she falls apart. Her stilted description of a sexy encounter between Tempe and her &quot;partner in crime,&quot; hunky police detective Andy Ryan, had me laughing aloud--not the intended response. Equally unbelievable are Reichs' descriptions of Tempe's flighty sister Harry, and Harry's son Kit.<br />That having been said, I still strongly recommend this book as a good, fast-paced read, and a welcome addition to the crime genre. I'm more than willing to let Reichs get her sea legs, especially when I can also enjoy vivid descriptions of Montreal during a brutal winter, and North Carolina at its balmy best.est.	2001-11-25

Lucky is hot-tempered, incredibly good looking, popular with his cronies, and adored by any woman who comes within striking distance. Except one.<br />Mysterious Devon Haines  has an agenda all her own, and her first encounter with Lucky Tyler in a seedy cowboy bar does nothing to cure her apparent hatred of men. Having rescued her from a couple of drunken louts, Lucky is not treated to the usual melting, eye-batting Texas charm he is used to. Devon storms out of the bar, and out of his life.<br />But Lucky cannot forget her. And, it turns out, he needs her in more ways than one, when he is falsely accused of a serious crime and she is his only alibi. A steamy night in a seedy motel has Lucky wanting this woman more than he has ever wanted anyone. But his sentiments are not returned. Or are they? What is the dark secret that keeps Devon from loving? How will Lucky win her trust, when he has already violated it?<br />The plot has enough twists and sexy subplots to keep the reader scampering through the pages until the very last, very satisfying page. The Texas! trilogy is my very favorite of Sandra Brown's romances, and when nothing else will do, I still reach for my well-worn copy of &quot;Lucky,&quot; and dream a little dream of romance under the Texas sky.	2001-11-24

The oldest brother of the tight-knit Tyler clan, Chase becomes dark and brooding after the tragic loss of his pregnant wife in a horrible car accident. In fact he is SO dark and brooding that he gives Bronte's Heathcliff a run for the money. Only this time, the setting is Texas, not the English moors. No matter.<br />Bent on self-destruction, Chase is now a hard-drinking, self-pitying rodeo rider, oblivious of the family who loves him and needs him to help save the Tyler business.<br />Along comes Marcie, who has known and loved Chase since childhood. It was she who was driving the doomed car; she survived her injuries, but not her guilt or her secret love for Chase. Knowing he will never love her back, but desperate to redeem him, she makes him an offer he could well refuse: She will become his wife in return for the cash to save the family business. Chase eventually accepts, but this is no happily-ever-after tale. In a word: Chase treats Marcie like dirt. And it is hard to read.<br />Throughout most of the book, the big, brooding cowboy (who of course is gorgeous like all the Tylers) greats his devoted, shy wife with barely concealed contempt. In bed, he uses her for his own pleasure. Out of bed, he ignores her, is rude and curt, and in every way lets her know that she is not the love of his life, and never will be. Of course WE know that he secretly loves her. And it takes a harrowing near-tragedy to make him see that fact.<br />Has Chase waited too long to realize that he loves Marcie as much as she loves him? Is he, through his own stupidity, about to suffer unspeakable tragedy twice in a lifetime? Read it and find out. You might want to kick him a few times, and Marcie too, for loving such a jerk, but of course in the end....well, no more hints. This is a great book for a long, cold night, written with talent and insight. I recommend it.	2001-11-24

I think I must have read these thoroughly imaginative and wonderful books hundreds of times each...snuggled under the covers with my purloined cookies and a flashlight.<br />Beginning with &quot;Half Magic,&quot; which takes place in the 20s, these books are timeless. They are stories about intelligent, thoughtful children who come across something magic (in &quot;Half Magic,&quot; it's a nickel-like coin; in &quot;The Thyme Garden,&quot; it's a magical toad) and go on to have incredibly fanciful adventures. The joy of the books is that the children react, not with wide-eyed wonder, but with a great deal of skepticism. They quickly find out that they must learn the rules of the magic to make it work properly, and that is no easy thing. Along the way, they need to adopt a form of teamwork and discipline--especially when fighting dragons (&quot;Knight's Castle&quot;)!<br />The children in these books, both those of the 1920s and those of &quot;modern life&quot; (probably the 50s, when the books were written) are highly literate. As a child, I loved the bon mots from &quot;Little Women,&quot; &quot;Ivanhoe,&quot; and &quot;King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.&quot; Will today's computerized kids get the inferences? And if they don't, will they want to find out more about these classics?<br />All I know is that even today I can vividly remember the scene where the kids, stuck inside a summer cabin on a hot, rainy day, make hot cocoa and pack winter provisions as they sit around a bucket of water waiting to be transported to the South Pole (&quot;Magic by the Lake&quot;). I still love these books, and am thrilled that they are still available.<br />A must for bookish children; a must for parents who yearn for a simpler time.	2001-11-24

His dogs and his women are priceless...drawn in a style that nobody has ever been able to duplicate or capture.<br />It was only later, as I grew older, that I could appreciate Thurber's written humor. The &quot;Thurber Carnival&quot; (and it is) is a compilation of essays and excerpts from &quot;My World--and Welcome to It,&quot; &quot;The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze,&quot; and others. These were Thurber's earlier works that were very much a product of their times, but oh, so funny! Thurber was one of the great commentators on the vagaries of everyday life. Along with Robert Benchly et al., he set the tone for an entire generation. I still have this book, and I absolutely cherish it. It's hard to do Thurber justice in a review. All I can say is--buy this book and wallow in it. You'll be glad you did.	2001-11-24

Tyler Family Saga)	Books	5	20	23	N	N	Better Than Chocolate	There was a time when I sneered at Romance novels, although I had never read one. Then one dark and stormy night, alone in an Outer Banks beach house, I picked up a well-tattered paperback of Sandra Brown's &quot;Sage,&quot; and I simply devoured it.<br />Although I didn't know it at the time, &quot;Sage&quot; is Book Three of Brown's Texas! trilogy, but I'm glad I read it first. The story opens as spoiled, beautiful and headstrong Sage Tyler is dumped by her mama's-boy fiance. Pouting out on the porch of the fiance's mansion, she looks up to find tall, gorgeous, cowboy Harlan Boyd, who has been sent by the Tylers to fetch her home. The sparks fly, and the action begins.<br />The sexual tension between Harlan and Sage expresses itself in outward animosity, and the sparring between the two forms a humerous backdrop to the rest of the story, which involves Sage's two protective brothers, Lucky and Chase, their wives, Mama Tyler and her Sheriff boyfriend, and a threat to the family business. Like all Brown stories, this one is well plotted, believable, and very, very sexy.<br />The inevitable and explosive meeting of Sage and Harlan, which begins with a furious and physical fight, and ends with the steamiest love scene I've read in quite a while, will have you fanning yourself. But naturally, the course of true love is never smooth, and with two strong-minded, stubborn, ornery Texans like Sage and Harlan, it gets so bumpy that the reader wonders if this is one romance that will not have a happy ending. I won't give it away. But I will say that for pure, luscious escapism and a really good story, this book remains in my top ten of all time.	2001-11-24

I finally caved in, began with &quot;Deja Dead,&quot; her debut novel, and was swept away by her incredible brilliance.<br />This is a book that simply cannot be put down. I read it before work, I read it on the train, I snuck it in between tasks at work, I read it at lunch, I read it far into the night when my eyes were hanging on stalks. And still I had to race to the finish.<br />Temperance Brennan is a fortyish American forensic anthropologist from the South, who is working in French-speaking Montreal. A recovering alcoholic, she is divorced, mother of a college-age daughter, troubled--and incredibly good at what she does. In a tight story heavily interspersed with fascinating scenarios of Montreal, Temperance (called &quot;Tempe&quot;) is called upon to autopsy a young female victim of a pathologically gruesome murder. This leads to a foray into the Dark Side as Tempe, convinced that she has seen the work of a vicious serial killer, sets out to prove it to her skeptical (and often chauvinistic) male colleagues.<br />The exquisitely insane nature of the killer, made all too clear by the havoc he wreaks on his victims, forces Tempe to face her own demons and she tries to stop one from real life. But he may be impossible to stop.<br />Perhaps &quot;Deja Dead&quot; is to brilliant because in real life, Reichs IS a forensic anthropologist who has lived and worked in the South and in Montreal. Whatever the cause, it is obvious that she is a born writer. I gave this book five stars because it is impossible to give ten. Needless to say, I am already on Book Two of the Temperance Brennan series, and won't be able to stop until I have read them all.	2001-11-21

If you are a busy working mom like me and you have a million daily things to do, this engagement calendar is a pleasure. Each page features an exquisite floral treat for the eyes, and what I like best is that the spaces provided for notation of appointments are unlined (I need that) and big enough to see what I have written.<br />I keep it at the office, so that I don't confuse my personal appointments with my business deadlines. Each Monday I walk into my work space, turn the page to the new week, behold a gorgeous picture, and invariably mouth the words, &quot;oh no,&quot; as I realize I have to take my son to the orthodontist and the cat to the vet right after work!<br />Nevertheless, one of my tiny pleasures is to deliberately keep from turning the page until the new week begins. I never look ahead, so that each picture is a treat. Try it!	2001-11-17

Even Grandma Mazur, fresh from an all-night date with an elderly beau, describes her evening out in a way that had this reader crossing herself along with Mrs. Plum. And I am not a Catholic!<br />Nevertheless, I found plenty to howl at in this silly cartoon of a story. From Bob the dog (who loses a battle with some chicken chow mein) to Rex the hamster, to far-out Mooner (dude!)and his equally spaced-out pal Dougie to Lula, all my favorites are back and in fine fettle. Add to that mix the loathsome Joyce, Stephanie's arch rival, and Steph's newly separated sister, the perfect Valerie, and things get really interesting. Especially when quintessential housewife Valerie decides to...um...well, date a gender other than that of her husband.<br />The bad guys are equally hilarious. First there is Eddie DeChooch, half dead, almost blind, hard of hearing--and armed. (The scene where he accidentally &quot;murders&quot; an icon in the church had me in hysterics.) Stephanie is trying to nab DeChooch as part of her bounty hunter job, but frail as he is, DeChooch manages to escape her clutches. Eddie's younger cousin Ronald lusts after Stephanie...and anybody else he can find. A pair of fifth-rate mobsters, Vinnie and Benny, are tailing Stephanie for no reason that anyone can see. But they're great with the grape jelly. And Stephanie? Well, she's still trying to decide between Morelli and Ranger--while trying on wedding dresses.<br />All this makes for another side-splitting romp, complete with a mud-wrestling scene that can't be missed. However, if you are offended by profanity and bedroom humor, it may be best to skip this one. I found this one of the funniest yet, and am positively frothing at the mouth (like Bob the dog when he's eaten several pizzas) in anticipation of Book Number Eight.<br />Hurry up, Steph!	2001-11-13

One is a fast and saucy bit of fluff a la Taming of the Shrew. Will Perdita and the loathed-ex Lucas ever stop fighting long enough to acknowledge the strong attraction between them? Will Lucas stop making fun of Perdita's beloved vegetables? Will Perdita stop sneering at Lucas's beloved kitchen? Will they remarry and live happily ever after? In typical Katie Fforde style, the story is told with such charm that it merrily zips along to its fairly obvious and very satisfying ending.<br />But there is another story here, and that is where the dedication comes in. Much deeper and more meaningful, it is the story of two dear friends, one of whom (Perdita) is just under 30 years old, and the other of whom (Kitty) is 87. Kitty, who is godmother to Perdita's gadabout mother, was mother/nurse/confidante/mentor and friend to the younger woman all through her childhood and formative years, as Perdita's parents dumped her with Kitty throughout her childhood so that they could pursue a lifetime of exotic travel. The relationship, which suited both child and mentor, deepened over the years into one of two soulmates, no matter how different in age.<br />While Perdita is pursuing her saucy relationship with Lucas, she is also facing possible tragedy when the whiskey-swilling, pipe-smoking, fiercely independent Kitty suffers a serious stroke. Perdita must face the inevitable loss of her dearest friend, if not from this stroke, then from another cause; after all, Kitty is almost 90.<br />The realization of one's mortality, of the importance of friendship, and of the impact of the very few but very treasured friends of the heart provides the counterpoint to the comedy. And it is so subtle that it is only when the book ends that the reader absorbs the deeper meaning.<br />Bravo, Katie, for this lovely tale. Bravo for making us laugh and smile while reminding us in your own unique way about what is important in life--and what is not.iends of the heart provides the counterpoint to the comedy.

As the story opens, she is at loose ends, still grieving over the end of a long-term relationship. She is forced to focus, however, when the local police call her into a case involving a highly disturbed young man named Michael Doll. Kit's first encounter with Doll is memorable, as is the description of his terrible, squalid existence. As Kit recoils from Doll's peculiar, unwashed odor, the reader does too...and as she struggles to learn whether he is indeed the psychopathic serial killer the police think he is, we also feel her pity for this pathetic lost soul.<br />Pity, however, will not solve the string of brutal murders, nor will it render Kit safe from harm. As she goes through her days, shared by a rollicking and impossibly fey friend called Julia who has showed up on her doorstep looking for a place to stay, we become increasingly concerned for her well-being (and Julia's). Only later do we realize that Kit is beautiful, brilliant, and interesting. The very type of woman to attract a psychopath. Or two. Or...as the authors subtly but inexorably imply...perhaps more. Perhaps the very man with whom Kit eventually shares her bed...<br />The suspense in &quot;The Red Room&quot; is much more subtle than in &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; and &quot;Beneath the Skin,&quot; the authors' most recent offerings. But it is there. And palpable. Is the repulsive but pathetic Michael Doll the murderer? Kit's instincts tell her no. But if he is not bludgeoning women to death, who is? The enigmatic Will Pavic, a former businessman who now runs a halfway house for disturbed teenagers? Or even, as this reader wonderered, a rogue cop? Whoever it is, it is inevitable that he will strike out at Kit. And there lies the suspense.<br />Suddenly, as this brilliant story builds to its peak, the book ends. The killer is revealed, various plot lines are swiftly and unsatisfactorily pulled together, and there is a truly ridiculous and unnecessary epilogue that provides the final clue. One gets the feeling that the authors suddenly realized it was deadline time, finished the book in record time, and at the last minute, felt they needed to tie up the final loose end. What a terrible disappointment, after such a well-written, taut, and yes, elegant, thriller! The sloppiness of the last few chapters is so unlike the authors that one feels betrayed.<br />Would I still recommend this book? Absolutely, if only for the pure pleasure of the writing style, which does endure until the very last page. But don't expect the brilliance of &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; and &quot;Beneath the Skin,&quot; because it simply isn't there.as this brilliant story builds to its peak, the book ends.

With chilling brilliance, the impostor then begins to murder Quincy's nearest and dearest--one by one.<br />A desperate battle of wits ensues as Quincy, nearly undone by horror and grief, and suspected by his own comrades as a possible suspect, strains to end the game before the predator murders his final quarry: Quincy's only surviving daughter Kimberly.<br />Quincy's love interest, the enigmatic, hard-as-nails private investigator Raine Connor, tries to help while battling her own demons, which are hitting much too close to home for her own comfort.<br />All of this makes for a fast-paced, well-plotted page turner--a book that is almost impossible to put down. The suspense lasts until the last pages, and to this reader, at least, the identity of the killer came as a complete surprise.<br />My only criticism of the book, the first I have read by Lisa Gardner, is that it seemed to have been written at breakneck speed. I found myself distracted and annoyed from time to time by grammatical mistakes that urbane Pierce Quincy would never make, for instance. The writing at times is sloppy, almost as if Gardner could not type fast enough to keep up with her own thoughts. The end is a good example, as Gardner ties up all the loose ends in one incoherent chapter that has so much information, I had to read it twice.<br />That having been said, I still recommend this book. The killer's game is finely rendered and absolutely believable, and Raine and Quincy make a dynamic team.	2001-10-21

I had a pre-conceived notion: OK, this is going to be a really interesting biography of Ted Bundy, with the added attraction of having been written by a former dear friend. Fast, easy crime reading, I thought.<br />I was wrong. This story is so chilling, so frightening, it grips you in the gut. Ann Rule has simply stated the facts. No sensationalism, no gratuitous gore, no psychobabble. Just the facts. As they happend. And even though the reader might think of Ted Bundy as &quot;old news,&quot; and even though he was executed in 1989, this book makes one check to see that the doors and windows are locked.<br />There are actually two stories here: one describes the gradual disintegration of a seemingly normal, affable, brilliant man into a sexual psychopath so evil, so methodical in his vicious killings, that one wonders if he was at all human. The other story is that of Ann Rule herself, a decent, hard-working, middle-aged mother of four who meets and befriends a nice young man working beside her in a crisis clinic. A man she regards as a younger brother; a man she views as a close and trusted friend. The slow but inexorable realization on Rule's part that this man is in fact an unspeakably violent serial killer is as painful to read as it was for her to experience.<br />Each victim is described in terms of such respect and such anguish that even a family member, I think, can feel that his or her daughter has been given a chance to shine, a chance to be more than a victim, more than a nameless number (8th girl killed, and so forth). The poignancy of these girls' very human preoccupations and lives serves to outline the contrasting horror in even more detail. That is why Rule does not have to defile the victims with intricate detail. The contrast between their young lives and their terrible deaths is enough in itself.<br />Rule's new Afterward, written in 2000, is fascinating. She has not &quot;recovered and moved on&quot;; there is no real &quot;closure.&quot; She has come to accept that the incomprehensible contrast between Ted the Dear Friend and Ted the Monster will never leave her, and will never be fully explained, no matter how many facts she sifts, no matter how much progress has been made in understanding the sexual psychopath. It is her fate to have known Bundy in all his skins; it is our privilege to read her account of it.Rule's new Afterward, written in 2000, is fascinating.

Almost immediately, she encounters the town's sheriff, Jack O'Halloran, who she views as a small-town cliche. Raine's problem is that she is so self-protective, she views almost everyone as a cliche, rather than opening her heart enough to see their humanity.<br />Thus, we meet Raine's flightly wiccan mother, Lilith, who does things like conducting a pagan ceremony in the nude (to Raine's horror); grandmother Ida, a feisty physician who refuses to get old; three troubled teenaged girls, one of whom is pregnant; all from Raine's initial rigid point of view.<br />The gradual melting of that rigidity, combined with the inevitable (and very sexy) romance between Raine and Jack, makes for a satisfying, heartwarming read. I recommend it to anyone who needs to take a break from stress, and wants to read a truly nice love story.<br />The end of the book contains a preview of an apparent sequel, \\"Far Harbor,\\" which is a favorite among... reviewers. I definitely will read that too, and am glad to have discovered JoAnn Ross!	2001-09-28

OK, let's do some serious character analysis here. We all know Rex, the hamster with deep thoughts and an outstanding soup can. He has been integral to every plot, sometimes putting himself in true danger for Stephanie's sake. But in this book, the heroic, taciturn Rex is eclipsed by a new animal: Bob the dog, who is given to eating everything in sight, including Grandma Mazur's two boxes of prunes (with some truly spectacular results). What does this mean for Rex? Is the author trying to tell us that dogs are better than rodents?  We shall have to wait and see...<br />Bob, of course, belongs (sort of) to Stephanie, she of the bad hair days, and in this outing, a pimple the size of Cleveland (which doesn't help her mood). Stephanie is bunking down with Rex, Bob and her new roommate: Grandma Mazur, 75-going-on-16, a hot mama if there ever was one. Unfortunately, Grandma's presence deep-sixes Steph's on-again, off-again sex life but good.<br />Did I mention sex life? Hot and sexy Morelli and hot and dangerous Ranger both want Stephanie, only there is a glitch or two: Ranger is wanted for murder. And Morelli is seeing more of Grandma Mazur than he ever wanted.<br />Of course, ex-ho Lula is back in fine form, all 250 luscious pounds of her, as is Stephanie's arch-rival Joyce, and some new people as well: The Mooner, a definitely way-mellow dude; his sidekick The Dealer (don't ask); and some inept goodfellas who are tailing Stephanie. (PC alert here: Written well before the events of September 11, 2001, this book contains a caricature of a Pakistani villager who has joined his American counterparts in crime. Many of his bon mots would have been hilarious if not for recent events. Be warned, and take it as no more than the comic relief it was meant to be.)<br />The plot itself is a bit loosey-goosey, even for a Plum novel. But who cares? These books are so rich in humor and priceless characterizations, the plot is always secondary. In this case, it's probably tertiary. It involves two crime factions who have trod on each other's turf. Ranger may or may not be a player in this war, and Stephanie, of course, is up to her teased-up hair in trouble. There are as many laughs as ever. A hint: Grandma comes in at 2 a.m. from a heavy date.

Or is it one man with multiple personalities? Tough homicide lieutenant Eve Dallas must solve the mystery quickly, before any more women are brutally raped and killed.<br />In perhaps her toughest assignment yet, Eve must unravel clue upon clue to get to the core of the case. And it won't be easy. As she peels away each false identity of the murderers, another even more clever identity emerges. Each victim has been lured to her death by a so-called &quot;poet,&quot; who just happens to share a love of art, poetry, the classics, and other intellectual pursuits with his online &quot;soulmate. It is chillingly easy to disguise one's identity on email, especially if, in the case of this murderer, he has multiple accounts that lead to nowhere.<br />Surveillance tapes and first-hand sightings of the possible suspect or suspects only compound the puzzle, as the killers are adept at face putty and other disguises, and so appear completely different each time they kill. In 2059, such appearance enhancers are all too available, as Eve well knows. When she needs a disguise of her own, she has to be almost literally hogtied as she submits to the &quot;beautification&quot; efforts of her dear friend, &quot;mag&quot; rock star Mavis, and Mavis's sidekick Trina. Those of us who know Eve et al. from the previous &quot;In Death&quot; novels tend to root for Mavis and Trina, as Eve's idea of beauty is primitive at best.<br />This insertion of comic relief is a Robb trademark, and only serves to intensify the mystery beneath. The genius of it, however, is that with each little interlude such as the beauty session, we learn more about what makes the &quot;In-Death&quot; regulars tick, just as we would in a real-life relationship. Thus we are privy to the on-again, off-again, often hilarious romance between Eve's stalwart aide Peabody and her peacock-dressing boyfriend, detective MacNab. There is more nasty verbal byplay between Eve and her husband's stiff and unyielding butler, Sommerset. And we get to see Eve's onetime mentor and dear friend Feeney in some unforgettable pajamas. As always, new readers will enjoy these characters, who only serve to add color and depth to the story. But regulars such as I feel we KNOW these people, and while we follow the mystery, we are also treated to the ongoing saga of each of their lives. MOST satisfying!<br />Nowhere is this more evident, of course, than in the deep and complicated relationship between Eve and her husband of one year, the brilliant and impossibly gorgeous billionaire Roarke. I have referred to their relationship before as fascinating, and it is...two strong, forceful people, each of whom have overcome unspeakable childhood horrors and emerged winners, must accommodate themselves to each other. We have watched as, in book after book, both Eve and Roarke, but especially Eve, have allowed layers of self-protection to fall away as they each learn to trust in the love they share. Theirs is not an easy relationship, but at its core is an intense bond that reveals itself more and more.<br />Robb skillfully weaves the many threads of her plot together with great skill, making it seem easy. In the end, the murdered women are avenged, and Eve has survived yet another attack on her character by a jealous rogue cop; queasily accepted the very physical relationship of Peabody and swain; seen her mentor in shocking pajamas; glimpsed a side of her Commander (Whitney) that she has never seen before; and, most importantly, let down another barrier in her erotic and high-energy marriage.<br />I strongly recommend this book. Regular readers will be thrilled to see Robb back in the groove after a somewhat disappointing (but still worth reading) &quot;Betrayal in Death.&quot; Those new to the series will be tantalized enough to want to read all 12 previous efforts.

But seriously, folks...forget about what Grandma Mazur did at the all-male strip club (she put the dollar bill WHERE?). This book marks a change in this hilarious series that bodes well for the future.<br />Every book in this side-splitting series has been a treasure. But this outing goes for less laughs and more plot, and the result is stunning (hehehe, an in joke). Not that I didn't find myself howling with laughter, once again in public, not that Evanovich's incredible bon mots don't grab you when you're not looking, but this time, there is actually a mystery with several subplots, and some real suspense.<br />In this adventure, Stephanie's bounty-hunting activities are somewhat sidelined by her search for her missing Uncle Fred, a nasty miser whose possible widow, Aunt Mabel, is planning a Caribbean Cruise within 2 weeks of his disappearance. Nevertheless, the Code of the Burg is strict, and when one's relative is missing, one must do the right thing and bring him/her home. At her family's urging, Stephanie reluctantly accepts the task.<br />But this is Stephanie Plum we are talking about here. And lest we think that things will run smoothly, there is the small matter of the angry dwarf. Then we have the exploding Porsche (NEVER let Stephanie drive anything other than her indestructible 1950s-model Buick!!!), more exciting viewings at Stiva's Funeral Home, the stolen Beemer, the psychotic homicidal rapist Ramirez, fresh out of prison and Eager to Stalk (we met this dude in Book 1, and he is not a nice person), and at least one serious stun gun mishap (I'm not telling, but watch out the next time you eat potroast at the Plum residence). I won't even talk about the spoiled son of the Arab Sheik, or what he wants Stephanie to do for $5.<br />While Stephanie is handling all the above with her usual Burgish aplomb, there is a true mystery unfolding. What has happened to Uncle Fred, and why is there a string of chilling and possibly connected murders, all centering around a trash-collection company? Who wants Stephanie dead? Whose chopped-up body was in the trash bags? What is going to happen with Ramirez, who wants to &quot;lead Stephanie to God&quot;?<br />All of these questions are answered in the most satisfying way, and the mystery is just as good as the humor. As for romance? Well...let's just say that Stephanie had better avoid Grandma Bella Morelli's Evil Eye, because her deepening &quot;friendship&quot; with Ranger has taken some interesting turns. Even Lula is taken aback. I can say no more.<br />Rex the Hamster, move over. I'm joining you in that soup can while I read Book 6. It seems the only safe place to be!ound a trash-collection company?

The four are very cleverly packaged by the publisher: J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) guarantees instant sales, as Eve and Roarke fanatics like me are severely addicted and cannot pass up ANY new book that offers more of these characters. Therefore, hers is the first story in the book.<br />&quot;Interlude in Death&quot; is a quick hit of Robb's futuristic world of murder, mystery, on-the-edge business dealings, and the always intriguing, always sensual marriage of hardboiled cop Eve Dallas and equally hardboiled (and gorgeous) billionaire businessman Roarke. There is method to the publisher's madness, and Robb's as well. For hard-core fans, Robb offers an intriguing, heretofore unmentioned secret from Roarke's past. For Eve-and-Roarke newbies, there is enough standard fare to lead them straight to Robb's &quot;In-Death&quot; series.<br /><br />&quot;Kinsman,&quot; by Susan Krinard, is an equally brief but interesting tale about telepaths in a very structured futuristic society. Because I do not read many novels in this genre, I was amazed by the attention to detail, and the author's ability to bring the reader easily and deeply into the world of Kinsmen, shaauri, and humans. The story itself, which involves a deception that threatens the entire society, was a bit slow, but the glimpse into the author's imagination was fascinating. &quot;Kinsman&quot; did not hook me into reading more Krinard, because the slowness of her style would not suit this impatient reader. Nevertheless, it was fun to sample her work.<br />&quot;Immortality,&quot; by Maggie Shayne, is a quick read with a pat and improbable ending, again, entertaining but not a grabber. It's the story of an ancient witch whose human form is that of a beautiful and sexy young woman. The story features a fire, a drowning, a hurricane and more--all in this brief novelette. One can hardly, therefore, call the story slow or boring, but--I didn't like the witch. When Nora Roberts writes about witches, I am completely absorbed into their worlds. I believe every word, every spell, every bit of magic. With Shayne, I was well aware that I was reading a creative piece of fluff. I was never engaged.<br />That's OK, however, because OH MY the Laurell K. Hamilton vignette was worth the price of the book and then some. I had never heard of Ms. Hamilton before a few weeks ago. Now I am a fanatic. She drew me effortlessly into the world of vampire hunter Anita Blake. &quot;Magic Like Heat Across My Skin&quot; is a dark, dangerous, deeply erotic tale of vampires, werewolves, wereLEOPARDS (an idea of which I heartily approve)--and in this story, a werehyena or two. Reading this small Hamilton offering is like dressing in black velvet and drinking a smoky dark wine. It feels dangerous. It definitely stirs one's senses.

In this fourth outing of the so-far-fabulous Stephanie Plum series, Janet Evanovich is in perfect form--and so is her dippy bounty-hunting heroine.<br />Why do these books work so well? The mysteries are entertaining, but certainly not edge-of-the-seat suspense. The endings are more or less foregone conclusions. The plot twists and turns can only be called improbable, if not impossible. Put them all together, and you have the most entertaining, well-written, often hilarious, always amusing set of silliness. I challenge anybody to read this book, for instance, without at least one loud, inappropriate, uncontrollable guffaw!<br />On to the plot: Stephanie takes on what looks to be a simple, straightforward case, the apprehension of a first-time offender named Maxine. But of course Stephanie's cases are NEVER straightfoward, and Stephanie is soon embroiled in a mystery that features chopped-off fingers, a grisly scalping, counterfeit money, several fire-bombings, and some new characters who are funny enough to do serious damage to your insides as you laugh yourself sick.<br />In addition to the much beloved regulars: Lula the ex-hooker (in fine form as always), the taciturn Mr. Plum (who actually has a speech that lasts more than a sentence in this book!), Grandma Mazur (who should be declared a national treasure), and the gorgeous, sexy, Morelli (not much of Ranger in this book), we now have Sally, a hefty transvestite who stands almost 7 feet tall when decked out in full regalia (including stiletto heels). Sally has a problem, though: he refuses to shave his ultra-hairy legs, arms, and chest, and often has trouble with his mascara. Need I say that Grandma Mazur just loves him?<br />Then we have Sugar, Sally's gay roommate, who buries his anxieties in frenzies of baking. All-night baking. Cover-the-counter with 8 million cakes and cookies baking. Sugar has an unrequited crush on his straight but cross-dressing roommate. Hence the baking.<br />I could go on and on....but I don't want to introduce any spoilers. Here's a hint, though: We see much more of Morelli than we have in the three previous books. hehehehehehehehhe<br />Wait up, Lula! Keep your pleated plaid skirt on, Candy!

I said to myself, &quot;Self, you are not going to laugh aloud and make a fool of yourself. After all, this is the third book in the series already.&quot; And I almost made it. For about 10 pages at least. Then I fell apart.<br />In this outing, La Stephanie is after a much-revered Burg icon: Mo, the long-time owner of the neighborhood's candy store. &quot;Mo would never do anything wrong,&quot; Stephanie is told by just about three-quarters of the Burg, most of whom are calling her mother to complain. But Stephanie, intrepid bounty hunter that she is, perseveres.<br />With her trusty pocketbook in tow (handcuffs, pepper spray, stun gun, a revolver if she remembers to take it from its hiding place in the cookie jar--and of course, every Burg Girl's must-have: a huge can of hairspray), Stephanie is off and running. Her trusty sidekicks in this outing include the hefty Lula, ex-hooker extraordinaire; the incredibly sexy and mysterious Ranger; and the equally sexy Morelli. (Readers of Book 2 will remember that Morelli and Steph experienced &quot;Buick Interruptus&quot; during their adventures; I am sorry to report that this time it's &quot;kitchen floor interruptus&quot;).<br />Eight bodies and several incredibly hilarious mishaps later, Stephanie manages to get her man. I think. I was laughing so hard by the end of the book I had a coughing fit--and NOT from Stephanie's pepper spray, either!<br />On to Book 4. And for that one, I am NOT GOING TO LAUGH.

It is not profound, and it doesn't pretend to be, but neither is it full of typical summer-at-the-beach cliches. It captures the lives of several different people, of all ages and backgrounds, who happen to congregate at a beach resort in neighboring houses during one summer in California. With skill and understanding, the author drops us into lives already full of history...and lets us share a small slice of time. It is to her credit that we get so involved with each of the characters that we feel we know them well...from a 17-year-old in the agonies of first love, to a devoted elderly couple facing the spectre of inevitable separation. Even the couple's cat is lovingly described. It has feelings! (As a cat lover, I couldn't help relating.) I recommend this charming book to anyone who wants a cozy read without the need to analyze every word. Just sit back, put your feet up, and enjoy.	2001-08-04

No longer is she merely a chronicler of a certain genre of British country life...although all of her books thus far have been enjoyable, insightful, funny and delightful.<br />&quot;Off Balance&quot; is all those things as well--but it also explores a subject of serious intensity: can a family whose catalyst is a handicapped, possibly autistic child survive an intrustion that upsets its very center?<br />Giles and Isobel Grant, a loving and devoted couple, belong to Scotland's upper-crust country community that Sheepshanks describes so well. They have two preadolescent twin children: Amy, precocious, musical (she and her father are both enrolled in a rigorous Suzuki violin class), outgoing and loveable--and Edward, an enigmatic, sickly little boy who marches to his own drummer, and whose heartbreaking handicap is described in an unblinking and yet totally sympathetic manner by the author.<br />Despite Edward's illness, which necesarily dictates the family's daily routine, life at the country estate is a happy one, full of the eccentric and sometimes outrageously funny characters that populate all of Sheepshanks' novels. Case in point: Lord Dunbarnock, who has not cut his hair or beard in several decades, and who, clad always in proper tartan gear, carries antibacterial handwipes in his sporran (the Lord has a dreadful fear of germs, due to an overzealous nanny in his youth). Then there are Mick and Joss, two New Zealand giants who act as handymen/babysitters/cooks for the Grants...and whose relationship with each other is, well...loving. And, Flavia the flautist, heroine of Sheepshanks' &quot;Facing the Music,&quot; returns, much more likeable in this book, as she has settled into motherhood, marriage, and the resumption of her brilliant musical career.<br />Enter Lorna, Isobel's beautiful, bitchy and self-centered older sister, who has divorced her South African husband and who begs shelter with the Grants until she can get her life together. The fact that this rehabilitation includes a plan to steal away Isobel's husband, with whom Lorna had a brief affair before Isobel was in the picture, is lost on nobody except Giles.<br />Lorna's entrance on the scene upsets the balance in the Grant household almost immediately, starting with her cruel treatment of Edward, whom she insists on regarding as a spoiled brat; and her aggressive foray into Isobel's daily life. Isobel, whose happy-go-lucky personality has always been her strong suit, is trying to hold on to her own balance, already knocked severely askew by Edward's unending physical and emotional problems. Amy and Edward, with the clear insight that children so often have, loathe their aunt, and she is regarded with strong distrust by Mick and Joss as well.<br />As if this were not enough, a sexy young male artist, Daniel, arrives at the estate to paint the backdrops for the property's theater, a pet Grant project. Although Daniel's arrival has been planned and anticipated with pleasure, his visit further complicates the precarious relationship between the sisters, both of whom are aware of his charms, and adds new stress to the now shaky Grant marriage.<br />Will the Grants survive the onslaught? Is their marriage really built on a solid foundation that can withstand all crises? Will sweet Isobel ever be the same? Will Giles open his eyes and see what is happening before it is too late? Will the children be harmed by the sudden tension in their daily lives? Like real life, there are no simple answers, and Sheepshanks does not offer a pat ending. Instead, she has shown us a slice of real life: poignant, tense, tragic, funny, loving, and ridiculous.

Speaking of whom...let me just get a word of appreciation in for the long-suffering man of few words, Mr. Plum, Stephanie's father. His eloquent sighs, one-word epithets, and vain attempts to hide in front of a blasting TV are priceless. The plot is much the same as the first book: Stephanie seeks bad guy, aided by the sexy Morelli. Not as much of Ranger in this book, but Morelli makes up for it. A great deal of the action transpires in a slimy (the only word I could think of) funeral parlor run by an equally slimy rat-like creature named Spiro. He has managed to misplace two dozen caskets...along with various body parts of those in his...um....eternal care. You MUST read this book!!!!

I had to force myself to pick it up; finally I gave up. This is a demented &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; on a drug trip gone bad. I am not squeamish when it comes to graphic descriptions in a murder novel, but there is something about the descriptions in this book that turned my stomach, starting in the first pages with the description of a disembowling of a mouse. I simply could not go on; I felt sick.<br />I skipped to the end, because I did have some curiosity about what finally happened, so I guess Brown had me hooked on some level.

I laughed so much on the commuter train, ALOUD, that people were staring at me...and trust me, I'm not the type to make a scene. The book got me through a dreary, stressful week at work, and I cannot wait to get the next in the series. This is a fun, fast, silly but somehow ridiculously believeable romp, perfect for summer or any time. The mixture of really funny double entendres and hilarious situations with mystery, violence and eroticism is just too much to ignore.

Having read just about all of Sandra Brown's romance novels (in fact, she was the first romance novelist I ever read who was literate and knew how to create a plot), I got a bit miffed when she turned to mysteries. My thought was: You are great at what you do, but what makes you think you can compete with the &quot;big boys&quot;? Oh, how wrong I was. I picked up &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot; in a collection of older paperbacks, and took it with me on a trip from Philadelphia to Houston. I figured it would be mindless enough to distract me from my fear of flying. Again, I was wrong. It not only distracted me, I FORGOT I was flying.<br />This fast-paced, finely plotted, zingy trip through the seamier side of New Orleans is one of the better police dramas I have read. The villain, Duvall, is as chillingly evil as any mafia chieftain (the scene where he crushes a collection of rare and beautiful orchids beneath his heel because of an imagined imperfection says it all). The hero, Burke Basile, is gritty, brilliant, hard-boiled--and vulnerable, a tough-as-nails cop who can't forgive himself for accidentally shooting his partner to death in a drug raid gone wrong.<br />The showdown between the two men, which comprises most of the book, makes it impossible to stop reading. There are enough plot twists and interesting side characters to keep the story barreling along, and yet, even though you know what has to happen, it comes as a complete surprise anyway.<br />This is a great summer read, and I now plan on reading Brown's other mysteries straightaway.	2001-07-02

If, on the other hand, you are apt to lose patience and sympathy for a group of Scarsdale, NY, snobs--mother and three hateful daughters--skip it. There are times during this book where you want to strangle all or one of them with the strap of their oh-so-perfect Coach bags!<br />Nevertheless, it's a fun read for the most part. The plot is improbable, and often silly, but it moves along if one is willing to suspend belief. And what better time to do it than summertime?<br />Ms. Shyer is not a bad writer. She expresses herself well, she does not go off on tangents, the plot, while unbelievable in parts, has a beginning, a middle, and an end--and she sustains one's interest (at least mine) enough to keep the pages turning.<br />This is not a Nora Roberts gobble-it-up-like chocolate novel, but neither is it horrible. Take it to the beach, take it to the pool, read it in the bathtub while escaping the kids. If you don't expect too much, you will enjoy this book.	2001-06-21

Within a few pages, I felt drawn into another world. When Nora is at her best, as she is in this novel, one can see, smell, and become part of the world she is creating. I'm not on the noisy commuter train...I'm in New England, on a picturesque island created by magic, with wonderful characters like Nell, our heroine. I can see her. I know all about her past. I am already deeply involved with her future. I am hooked.<br />Like she did in &quot;The Donovans,&quot; Nora manages to combine reality with fantasy in a totally believable and matter-of-fact way that makes one yearn to run out and buy crystal dragons.

I want to swallow it whole.<br />Thank you, Nora, for giving this reader so much pleasure! My recommendation: Do not pass up this book! Summer reads don't get more perfect than this.	2001-06-07
1975982:US	49248343	R2GBUZC05941PW	0446609781	332779254	Beneath the Skin	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Scary from Start to Finish	Husband-and-wife team Nicci Gerrard and Sean French have outdone themselves in this really scary psychological thriller, which gives a whole new dimension to the crime of stalking.<br />As we follow three seemingly disparate women, each of whom is taunted by a sexually sadistic letter-writer, we begin to almost literally crawl beneath THEIR skin. We feel their initial annoyance, their reluctant acceptance that they have some kind of problem--and eventually, their bone-melting terror.<br />The novel works on several levels, as the authors carefully and concisely unravel the plot in the same way that the stalker psychologically unravels his victims. Our emotions are torn between disgust and anger at the inept police, to pity for the women, to almost unbearable suspense. This is the book you can't put down...the one you read until your eyes scream for mercy.<br />The authors' previous book, &quot;Killing Me Softly,&quot; was a superb thriller; this one is better. And one of the things that makes it so is the lack of hyperbole. They write in such a carefully controlled way that it only serves to heighten the already unbearable suspense. Only once do they indulge themselves, in what has to be a self-mocking tribute to the 40s and 50s crime genre: &quot;The heat was like a big old fat smelly mangy greasy farty dying dog...&quot; That sentence is on page one, and made me laugh out loud. It was the last time I laughed...and the last time I could put the book down.	2001-06-01

There is not one word that is wasted, there is not one thought that is not so pure, so well described, and so TRUE, that it causes the reader to stop breathing for a moment. O'Faolain's great talent is the way she draws the reader in to worlds that should be alien, but somehow feel familiar, eg, Ireland during the Famine. This talent was evident in her memoirs, and is equally strong in this fictional narrative that I suspect is drawn straight out of her own life. Indeed, it matches her memoirs in many aspects, and it is hard to remember that this is only a story. O'Faolain skillfully weaves together two narratives in this book--one tragic love story from the time of the Famine, and one very modern tale of a woman trying to come to grips with aging and all that implies, from the terror of losing her sexuality to the fear, felt for the first time, of being alone. The plot is secondary to the inner thoughts of this incredibly strong and independent woman, Kathleen, as she faces her own inner weaknesses. This is a book well worth reading, and keeping. It is one that I read very slowly, in order to savor every word.	2001-05-03

And, I am sorry to say, &quot;Mountain Heather&quot; is fairly horrid, from start to finish. The main character, Sally Buchanan, is a one-dimensional, self-centered, clueless birdbrain with a penchant for married men and an astounding disregard for the feelings of everybody around her. She is so unlikeable that I found it impossible to sympathise with her problems, or care what was going to happen next--which made finishing the book at all a real chore. The other characters-- from her nasty-but-supposed-to-be-wonderful Aunt Janey, to the hippie caricature Piers (complete with organic food and flute), to the younger sister who turns up out of the blue and has a married lover of her own, to the love interest, whose tragic accident is used as a blatant and insensitive plot device--are basically as one-dimensional and incomprehensible as Sally. None of these people reacts in any way that is believable, and the plot is too weak and feckless to sustain such a large number of cardboard characters. I'm so glad that I read Raife's wonderful books, such as &quot;Wild Mountain Heather,&quot; before I picked up this one--or I never would have looked at another of her works. Read it at your own risk!	2001-04-25

And it was fascinating to see Trudy and Una at earlier stages as well; along with &quot;Belonging,&quot; this book made me want to pack up my earthly possessions and move to an isolated cottage in the Highlands at once. Like all of Raife's works, this novel is more than a romance. It's a true love letter to Scotland--its terrain, its people, its way of life. I have never been to the Highlands, but I've been in love with (and in) Scotland, and this novel gently conveys a sense of such peace and pleasure as we watch Clare mellow and grow from a spoiled city girl to a strong, loving woman whose eventual happiness is well deserved. I highly recommend this book!	2001-04-17

It is the story of sophisticated urbanite Rebecca Urquhart, who flees her Edinburgh home for the comforting Highlands and the family estate she had known and loved as a child. There, she manages to bury her heartache (we don't know what it is, but Raife, with her usual skill, lets us feel the anguish with Rebecca anyway) in a flurry of sensible and hard work as she struggles to help save the property from ruin. As the story deepens, it becomes even richer. Yes, there is a love interest, sexy as hell, but this is no lightweight romance, and the eventual ending is as satisfying as any fairy tale--but with a strong dose of reality. I loved this book, and highly recommend it.	2001-04-10

The heroine, Kate, has such a strong and interesting character, weak and timid though she appears in the beginning. Each person she encounters is equally interesting, and as the threads of each personality intertwine and blend, all against a truly breathtaking description of the Scottish highlands, the story becomes more wonderful. This is the first Raiff book I have read, and I can't wait to start the next.	2001-04-02

But it is SO evocative that I found myself depressed every time I entered the stark and dreary world that Buchan so skillfully creates. Even the gardening bits failed to offset the general miasma of gloom that permeates this book, at least for me. Buchan is a fine writer, but this book is hard going, albeit beautifully written. It has a Bronte-like feel, but without the passion. And the ghostly elements left me unmoved, which is unusual for me. Read it for the fine writing, but don't expect a quick or lighthearted experience.	2001-03-25

I don't know how she does it...time after time, Nora Roberts, aka JD Robb, manages to deliver spine tingling suspense, mystery, drama, and of course...sigh...the hot, sexy relationship between Eve and Roarke. In each book, their relationship grows and deepens, and this one is no exception, as Eve must give her husband help and support in a way that he can accept. This is a difficult undertaking for the hard-boiled but vulnerable cop, but she does it, as only she can. All our favorites are here: Peabody, MacNab, Feeney, et al. But as always, our focus is on Eve and Roarke, and their fascinating, erotic marriage. Will Eve find the serial killer in time to save her husband? What do you think...	2001-03-19

As another reviewer aptly observed, after &quot;Stately Pursuits&quot; and &quot;Wild Designs,&quot; I was expecting something wonderful. &quot;Life Skills&quot; is not wonderful. Still, it is a sweet, albeit slow, story of a woman in transition from a job and a dull fiance to something she hopes is better. Julia is often hard to like, especially when she is constantly boorish to the potential love interest, Fergus. One wonders what he sees in her; she is not at all nice to him until pratically the last page of the book! I admit I was disappointed in &quot;Life Skills,&quot; but not enough to put me off Fforde, and not enough to tell other readers not to try it themselves.	2001-03-16

Having read and loved &quot;A Price for Everything&quot; and &quot;Picking Up the Pieces,&quot; both superb, I can see the progression of Sheepshanks' talents. This is not a bad book, and it is certainly worth reading, but the characters are not as finely drawn as in her later novels. Our heroine, Flavia the Flautist, is not entirely a sympathetic character, as she flits mindlessly from one wrong situation to another to avoid facing reality. I found the juxtoposition of her brilliant musical career with her extreme naivete very hard to believe. Likewise, the hapless Gervaise, her schoolmaster husband, falls in love with her for no apparent reason, and is somewhat one-dimensional as well, so we really do not know what makes him tick. The &quot;lover-from-hell,&quot; the famous conductor Antoine, is a swine for no particular reason, and the later love interest, Alistair, is a saint. Nevertheless, this is a fast, rather entertaining read, and we can see glimmers of the author's subtle and outrageous humor so evident in later works. &quot;Facing the Music&quot; is nowhere near the beautifully crafted novels that came after it, but I'm glad I read it; it makes me appreciate Sheepshanks' later books even more.	2001-03-12

It must be the enchanting blend of reality and humor that gets me every time. Like her other heroines, Sheepshanks' Kate is a no-nonsense, &quot;let's get on with it and cope with life&quot; typical British character. But beneath that strength lies a vulnerability that grabs the reader's heart.<br />Kate's reactions to her lovely son and daughter-in-law, her strong-minded, bird-watching mother-in-law, her difficult and sometimes nasty daughter Joanna, and her enchanting granddaughter Harriet, all reveal different sides of her complicated personality.<br />Just when we think she's a typical dull countrywoman, Kate reveals her penchant for design, and a strong artistic talent that makes her needlework highly prized. Just when we think she's something of a prude, whose sexual feelings died with her philandering husband, she becomes strongly attacted to Jack, a newcomer with his own secrets.<br />The mixture of pathos, romance, good old British common sense, and sometimes uproarious humor (I found myself laughing aloud on the commuter train home one night) make this a good, comforting, and delightful read, especially if one is feeling too beleagured to tackle something heavier.	2001-01-29

She still paints, but in a vague sort of way. Her real life encompasses four children, a stale marriage to a dull but nice man, and an incomprehensible but fierce devotion to her husband's crumbling manor, Duntan. All of Sonia's passions and hopes revolve around saving the house, which needs extensive and costly repairs. She has, however, no firm plan to save it, and dreamily drifts through her days hoping for a miracle. She manages to do this despite an influx of the most hilarious and finely drawn characters: a part-time cook whose best efforts defy even the E. coli bug; a mother-in-law, Rosamunde, who is part grande dame, part hippy; Rosamunde's late-in-life teenaged daughter Martha, who is apt to go punk at the very worst times; and a shady erstwhile monk, who is described so well we can almost smell him. These creatures float in and out of Sonia's and Archie's life, as does Archie's buxom mistress, who is married to an irritating, French-spouting snob who is called &quot;Jolie Roger&quot; behind his back. Need I say more? This is a great read, charming, evocative, and well-written. It combines real insight with humor and charm.	2000-11-07

It has the same understated yet highly evocative approach that the best British female authors seem to employ with ease. I found myself subtly but firmly drawn into the life of our heroine, Prue, to the point where I could almost feel her thoughts. We meet her somewhat aloof older husband, Max, her lovely daughter Jane (whose reaction to her dying pet rat will wring the heart of any mother), her horrid stepdaughter Violet, who hates her own baby, and Violet's charming husband Jamie. There is also Violet's naive yet streetwise erstwhile nanny, Emmy. All of these people are woven into Prue's daily life whether she wants it or not, as she struggles to write a book on her obsession, Joan of Arc! The quiet, understated humor, pathos, sympathy and sheer fine writing of this book make me want to read everything Buchan has written. I highly recommend this book.	2000-10-19
