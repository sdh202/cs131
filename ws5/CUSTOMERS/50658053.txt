Those who do not have a voice need others to care and to speak out for them.  This is what our authors do in this outstanding work.<br /><br />What are they fighting for?  The minds, the health, the spirit of our beloved children.<br /><br />They show numerous areas where our child are under assault by Marketers that single them out by way of TV, advertisements and peer pressure for the profit. They discuss the impact that violence has on our children through television and video games and give statistics that are alarming of suicide among our youth.<br /><br />In this work we are taught how to recognize these assaults and given guidelines that we can implement to safe-guard our children.  I think what I liked about this book was that it was not a total bashing of  producers of entertainment for our children, but a work that one: shows there is a problem, two: gives solutions for parents and marketers as well that will benefit all.<br /><br />A very informative and helpful book that would be a worthwhile read for all parents.	2005-09-17

Lindsey Taylor is determined to live a normal life and that is not easy after the trauma she had just been through. Lindsey had witnessed a murder in New Orleans and had to testify against a dangerous crime family.  Her life had been in an upheaval, but now it was time to move forward.<br /><br />Lindsey is a writer and eager to complete her research on her next project; a writing about the \\"Bread & Roses\\" strike of 1912 in Lawrence, Massachusetts. As she travels to Lawrence to research she assures her husband that she will be fine, but she is almost dead wrong.<br /><br />Lindsey begins to dig into the death of one Millworker, Anna Lopizzo and in doing she uncovers the story of Jenna Waverly who is said to have drowned in the frozen Merrimack River.  How could that have happened and were these two women connected in someway?  As Lindsey's investigation becomes more intense she finds someone is determined to keep certain secrets hidden and will do anything in their power to stop her. What a great read!<br /><br />I have to tell you this is an exceptional book; taking us from the present and the happenings to Lindsey, to 1912 and emerging us into the lives of those deeply touched by the \\"Bread & Roses\\" strike.  I was glued to the pages as the author craft-fully created the world that both eras lived in, brought it to life like a full screen movie and charged your emotions to a full time high. Outstanding!  This work has history, well defined characters, sprinkled with the strength of God, suspense, romance and mystery. I simply cannot recommend this read highly enough.

Nikkie always knew she was different from other children and held that knowledge inside of her even into adulthood. She pushed her strange gift aside most of her life; that is until her three-year old son Michael began to show signs of the same supernatural insights.<br /><br />As the child began to have nightmares, ghostly visits and nearly lost his life, Nikki could not longer  ignore the supernatural in their lives. Afraid to confide in her husband, Nikki alarmed and frustrated calls upon her mother who reveals a long family secret of the power that works within them. This becomes  both disturbing and comforting to Nikkie<br /><br />as she battles to make sense of the warnings that her dreams are giving her.<br /><br />The storyline is very intriguing, the 'human' characters well defined, but I would have liked to know a few more details about the 'visitors not of this world', and a little more explanation of the gifting Nikki, her mom and her son walked in.<br /><br />However the story certainly keeps you interested with elements such as family interaction, the protection and love of a mother, suspense and supernatural, and has  a great ending. I believe you will enjoy this one.	2005-09-12

To me, dreams are important and tell us little secrets so I was excited to have another book about them.<br /><br />I love the cover and the illustrations in this work; they are beautifully done and give the work a mystic overall look.  Great job.<br /><br />The book is packed full of information on many subjects such as, people, events, places and objects. I like the way it gives meaning to one specific thing and depending on what is happening with that object or person the meaning of the dream will change,  here is an example.<br /><br />If you have a dream about wearing a cap, it is a good omen for your love life. If you buy a cap you could receive an inheritance,(I need to have this dream.) I found that very informative, interesting and helpful.<br /><br />The book can be a bit confusing at times and isn't one you can quickly find a meaning until you are familiar with the books layout , but it does have many useful explanations that are quite helpful. No book could possibly have every dream with every object, person or event listed and explained. However, this one does cover quite a bit of territory and I believe if you are patient it will be useful to understanding the dreams you dream.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2005-09-12

In this work, our author gives a concise explanation of what we ought to expect from those that we are entrusting our very lives to, and what we need to fear.<br /><br />He explains the dangers that await you in the hospital, the dangers that lurk in different medicines you take and the dangers of your doctors very care of you.<br /><br />Scary?  Maybe so, but this information could well save your life or the lives of those you love.<br /><br />He does not write this in a condemning way to our medical care people, but as in all things there are always dangers, accidents, neglect and this is so concerning your medical care. However, some of these can be avoided and  being informed is a safeguard; knowledge is a weapon that you can use. And in this work that is what you are given, information and knowledge, so you can see the pitfalls before you fall in them.<br /><br />I really liked this book and plan to keep it on hand because I know, as with all of us, there will be a time when I will need to refer to the knowledge it holds.

This work set in the city of Seattle  has a charm like none other that I have read in a considerable amount of time. In the beginning of the read we meet a very distasteful family comprising of a dad and three sons, who due to their wealth think the world must bow to their every whim. Thus we meet the Millers.  We are also introduced to a  delightful, moral family; Eleanor, her parents, brothers and sisters.  The warmth, commitment, loyalty, unity and love of this family shined through every page of this work. I fell in love with them and enjoyed reading about their lives.<br /><br /> Written in storytelling and journal style, this book stands above others. The story centers around Eleanor, the oldest of this family, who is thrust into service to the Millers to help pay for their home.  Eleanor is a strong young woman, struggling to walk in humility yet knowing the value a woman has.  We are taken along in her life as she pens the tale of her family and the Millers.  Nate, the son of Mr. Miller, who somehow just didn't seem to belong to that family, falls deeply in love with Eleanor. The truth about Nate will shock you, yet make you smile as Eleanor and Nate face their destiny.<br /><br />This is a book that totally kept my interest, had adventure, romance, and mystery, life and death, giving and greed; but somehow combined with all of this, it  brought a quietness and a calming effect when reading.  It's hard to describe, but was a welcome change to the many works that I review.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It's a lovely story of a lovely woman, her life, her family, her destiny. Recommended.	2005-09-07

Will the children be returned safely and will this couple cling to each other and the God to whom they belong? Or will they lose each other and children they love?<br /><br />The author does a good job in character development bringing them clearly into the minds eye. She centers the book around the disappearance of the children, but clearly brings into play different emotional aspects of the family, the kidnappers and a surprise player that definitely adds a twist you will not expect.<br /><br />Ms Blevins carefully melts the concepts and truths of God into this compelling read.

He shares experiences from his own past which helps to enlighten this in your minds eye.<br /><br />Gently, but with great purpose, he shares the love our God has for us, our importance to Him and the future He sees is ours. You begin to realize how special you are and how much you are loved.<br /><br />The one important factor this work will leave you with is that YOU do matter to the one who made you.  Once you understand that, embrace it and begin to live it your life will change. You need not be afraid that you will fall into an attitude of, 'it's all about me,' because finally you will realize that it's all about HIM and what He has put in you to be a productive part of the world we live in.

For the Believer it is an affirmation of their faith, a building block to draw upon and a salve for their soul. To the un-believer it should certainly be an eye-opener and if nothing more leave them with some thought provoking material.

Mattson	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Interesting	In this work a Lutheran pastor, A.D.Mattson died in 1970. During his life-time he was very interested in the paranormal and according to this book in 1971 he began to give messages from beyond the grave to his daughter Ruth Mattson Taylor.<br /><br />Pastor A.D. Mattson discusses many subject concerning the here-after.  He tells of animals waiting for their beloved masters to die so they maybe reunited; and if they had no one to love them how they are absorbed in a universal force for animals; one for dogs, one for cats, etc. He tells of children that have died growing up and waiting for their parents and he speaks of the importance of prayer, love and worship, all told to those whom are clairvoyant and are interrupting his messages.<br /><br />I believe this is an excellent New-Age book and would be of great interest to those who wish to study more on subjects such as reincarnation and are interested in physic powers and those who are clairvoyant.  I hold a different Christian belief concerning the here-after, so although many of the subjects were interesting I did not agree with what was being told. However, for those who hold to these beliefs this work would be a real page-turner. Again, very well written but only recommended for those interested in the paranormal.	2005-09-03

Looking around us in stores, schools, parks, we certainly can see that we are a country that is well fed. Not only are adults well above their recommended weight, but unfortunately our children are following their lead. In this work the authors point out that one in four American children is overweight. That is alarming! How can we sit back knowing that their future holds many problems and do nothing about it?<br /><br />The authors pen this work in what I call down to earth talk.  They lay the facts on the line, give the true outcome if the problem is not corrected and then give solutions to turn things around. They give an overall pattern of recovery that the entire family can easily live with and benefit from.<br /><br />Their advice is medically sound and easy to follow and may at times step on a few parents toes, but the pain is well worth the child being healthy again.<br /><br />Anyone who is concerned about the future of their child, their health and well-being,  should read this book.

I began this book with apprehension as I try very hard not to read works that leave me sad. However this work, although it involved death, was written in a way that it cradled me with the renewed sight that life still goes on, and with it the spirit of the one who has left us.  This book reminds us of the many ways the departed one  has  enriched and fulfilled our own lives, and it is a tender reminder how important we are one to another.<br /><br />Paige Matthew did not know how much her life would change that day a pregnant woman appeared on her doorstep crying for help.

Right off I am going to say this is an outstanding, exceptional work; from the first page to the last I was totally consumed by the read. In the beginning we are confronted by the mysterious disappearance of a very lovable Priest, what could have happened to him and why? We are jetted off  in the read and meet Police Officer Timothy Comstock and his soon to be wife Martie who will become major players in this story. Again moving forward in time we are taken to St. Lukes where something unusual is happening.<br /><br />It seems a beautiful crucifix of Jesus seems to be shedding tears and the adventure begins as Priests, police officers and Scientists scramble to find out if this is a true miracle or an exceptional hoax.<br /><br />The story darkens however when those who get too close to the investigation either end up dead, are terrified to the point of stopping their involvement, or are seriously injured. Is this a hoax or a real miracle from God? And why are so many people ending up dead?  Great mystery element.<br /><br />The author does an outstanding job of his character and story  development, skillfully weaving and twisting events and characters until it is impossible to know if this is a real miracle or a hoax during the read.  And so well hidden was a certain character's background, I never would have suspected they were behind the evil and killings at St. Lukes. The ending was absolutely heart- thrilling and spell bounding;  I loved it. Was this a true miracle? You decide!  What a read; one you do not want to miss. I highly recommend this book.	2005-08-13

It is said that a poet speaks from their heart, allowing their inward man to release the very essence of their soul.

I sensed at time anger,yet compassion;  at other times confusion and again at times deep love and understanding.<br /><br />This work is one of traveling through life and revealing the inward scent of the people met, the emotions felt, and the impressions left.

In this outstanding work author Tommy Tenney takes us on a journey, that if followed could change our lives and bring us to a place with the Lord that is breathtaking.<br /><br />He shares with us the story of Esther in the Bible and how she won favor with the King during her time. Using this as an example, Mr. Tenney challenges us to take the steps as Esther did to receive favor from our King, the Lord Jesus.<br /><br />His leading in instructions to achieve this goal are practical, Scriptural, and profoundly spiritual as you soon see that Esther was a true example for us to follow; and you  realize you actually can obtain favor with the Lord if you are willing to pay the price that it will require. It really is not a hard price to pay, but a joy to do to achieve the favor of the One we love. To give an additional help, our author has a page at the end of the book that we may use as a reminder of what these protocols are. On this page are the, \\"Twelve Protocols of the Palace,\\" Esther's secrets of finding favor with the King. I agree with my fellow reviewer; I'm hanging this on the wall as well.

Some call this weird but for me it is a way of life.<br /><br />When I first started this book I felt it would be a simple book with the concept of how 'human' animals could be; this was not so. Written by Raimond Gaita; a professor of moral philosophy in London, I found this was not a fluff work but one written with thought provoking material.<br /><br />The author shares stories of some animals he has encountered in his life, such as his dog Gypsy, and Jack, a cockatoo. Often heartbreaking, sometimes light-hearted, these stories showed  their behavior in this world we share with them. He gives us some conclusions from others who have studies animals and also his own thoughts on the subject matter.<br /><br />Although I didn't agree with every conclusion in some mattes the author did; I felt the he was giving us an opportunity to come to mull them over and make our own decisions about animals and I liked that. A very interesting read that will definitely give opportunity for thought.	2005-07-25

I have read and reviewed several of Richard's works, but I have to say Toshomee is probably my favorite one so far. Set in Canada, this novel is packed with suspense and thrills that I never would have dreamed could be found in a novel about moose. I immediately felt a liking for Bob Cole, one of the main characters in this novel. Bob is a sergeant with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and is assigned to a very strange case. It seems people are turning up with their heads missing. Yes, you read that right. What or who could be doing this, Bob had to find out.<br /><br />The plot thickens, as Bob Cole finds out the first victims were a US congressman and his family. Cole is surprised when Special Agent Hooks from the FBI, shows up to join in the investigation. Cole wonders what else is hidden that has yet to be revealed concerning the congressman. He knows he will find out soon enough. This adds more mystery to the read. Cole and Hooks team up nicely for this job and I was glad. Sometimes you don't want to go through pages of authority figures battling out who is in charge, and in this read you don't have to lose your thought of the true storyline because of it.<br /><br />I loved the character Naam, the local native, and his telling of the Legend of the Toshomee, the great white killer moose. I read with excitement as Naam told the legend to Hooks and Cole. What a story! I knew I was in for an exciting read as these two investigators traveled into the wild, to find and kill the legendary moose, taking Naam and several others with them. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I know the plot may sound silly to you, after all, how thrilling could a read be about a killer moose; but believe me, the author leads you into suspense that will make your hair stand on end. Excellent! If you want a story about a legend that comes to life before your eyes, you will love this one.<br /><br />Suspense, excitement, fears, all rolled up in a roller coaster read of a lifetime.

There are some books that grab your attention from the first word, such is the case with this outstanding work, Predators & Prayers.  Priests in New York City are being brutally killed, mutilated, degraded and the pressure is on to find this madman. That was the job set before Captain Tony Flynn, a man who has seen more than his fair share of murders, but this case would run into deep un-charted waters, waters he didn't like being in as they stirred memories that he had tried to forget. This one would be personal.<br /><br />As for our killer, he  has his reasons for what appears to be senseless death, and as the author details the deep-seated pain of his past you must rebuke the urge to cheer him on, knowing within yourself murder is never the answer, two wrongs do not make a right.  Yet, the author takes you so deep into the pain  in the soul of this man that you bleed within for the sorrow that was his life.<br /><br />We are introduced to Carole Cunningham, a hard nose attorney from the DA's office, who is carefully working another angle of the case. The author worked this side of the investigation in allowing  you to know facts that otherwise would be left by the wayside.  That was a good move and really enhanced the read.<br /><br />The story is quick paced as the killer travels to Rome, his quest, the death of the Pope. We are introduced to Nino Maranzano, the Italian Chief of police who merges forces with Flynn to stop this killer. Mr. Carlo builds character upon charter, defining each one so vividly that they nicely layer the story and pull you into the core of this book, the lives of these people.<br /><br />There are many emotional surges throughout this work and some surprising twists, such as the first true feeling of love our killer experiences for a wonderful woman named Diane, and the final chapter that brings closure to a life wracked in pain. As details are revealed you want to laugh, you want to cry and your emotions spiral within you.<br /><br />I really can't say enough good things about this work. Philip Carlo brings out a hidden truth of sexual abuse that plagues the very institution that should be a haven of safety, the Catholic church.  Yet, understand this, he makes it plain that it is not the belief in God, nor the soundness of such a belief that is to fault, but the concept that predators always find openings to feed upon their prey. He opens our eyes to a problem that is sweeping our country, infiltrating many sacred institutions and touching those who cannot defend themselves.<br /><br />This read is one of pain, revenge, love, hate, forgiveness and frank honesty that you will never forget. This is a must read that you will not be able to put down.  Highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Reviewsay enough good things about this work.

Now, he is an emotionless assassin, a killing machine that has no feelings besides getting the job done that is set before him. He was to kill Ismail Talawi, who stirred the anger of a Nation with the writing of his book \\"Lunch with the Prophet.\\"<br /><br />Our list of charcters include Meg Davidson, Sandy Flett and Jimmy Douglas, all super secret anti IRA agents that must stop the plot of evil that is spreading on several continents and could cause great disaster for the world. The web begins to weave as the author plunges you into the lives and motives of his characters.<br /><br />Ah, but this author does not leave out the human element as he weaves in Anne Flett, the Vancouver trauma room surgeon, who happens to be the brother of Sandy Flett. Anne, who is plagued with a successful husband who likes the ways of women, is the tender element that adds warmth to this story. She was my favorite character.<br /><br />It is a novel of mystery and intrique, adventure and deep sorrow. Yet, in the midst of it all you find friendship and courage, love and loyality. Sometimes in places you would never think to look. If you want to read a great spy adventure with sophistication, this is the book for you. Not your run of the mill read, even the details that often can be boring in a work keep your interest. A winding adventure, traveling up hill and down, twisting this way and that awaits you.

As I sit and ponder Richard Paul Tanos novel, \\"The Home Child\\", it is very difficult to put in words what my heart is feeling. The Home Child, a novel based on actual events,has left a deep impression upon this reviewers mind and heart. The novel tells the story of young Henry Dewberry, 12 years old at the time, and orphaned in London, England. Being an orphan was the earliest memory Henry had of his life. One day Henry and a group of 36 other orphans were taken on a long journey, via wagon, ship and train to the new frontier of Canada. The boys did not know where they were traveling or why, but soon found out they were being sold into child slavery.<br /><br />The story takes you with Henry , and some of his close counterparts, on their journey of survival. I am sad to say that some did not fare as well as Henry. Not that Henry's life was one to be envied, it was not. The chance meeting of a young girl named Lizzy, and her close friend Clara, was perhaps the only reason Henry was able to survive. Lizzy gave Henry a reason to live, and as destiny would have it, they spent their lives together.<br /><br />As the author tells of the brutal ways these young boys were treated, this reviewer wiped tears from her eyes, and felt great sorrow in her heart. Being a protector of the innocent, I felt such rage over something that happened so long ago, to those so young and vulnerable. Verbal abuse, beatings, and being locked in solitude for days at a time were all part of these young boys lives. Many did not survive, and the memory of who they were, was locked in the evil hearts of those who murdered them.<br /><br />Mr. Tanos concludes his book with Henry as an old man, , and shows the marks that his past had on the life he had lived. Emotional scars that would never heal, despite his heart's anguish that they would. Henry never knew he was one of a hundred thousand other children who suffered the same sad fate. This is a wonderful heart-wrenching novel and one that will leave you a little sadder for the pain of those young ones, now long gone, that can never be washed away and should always be remembered.<br /><br />May Mr. Tanos's novel \\" The Home Child\\" stand as a testimony for them, so they will never be forgotten!

I want to say that this book was like a breath of fresh air to me.  What is it about? The truth. Here is a book written by a doctor who tells the health hazards of the chemicals that surround us and are found in everything from the food we eat to the cloths we wear.<br /><br />I found it shocking as Dr. Hamilton exposed the dangers of these chemicals to the point of causing cancer, diabetes and respiratory illnesses, just to name a few. I was not surprised as I myself have suffered from what I now know, from the information I found in this book, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. This is a disease caused by overexposure to chemicals where your body reacts strongly to smells and other chemical agents. What a blessing to finally have a name and a reason to what was happening to my body, and to know it isn't just all in my mind as so many people thought it was.  Thank you Dr. Hamilton.<br /><br />The good doctor goes into detail about certain agents and what they do to our bodies, but she does not stop there.  She also gives us some pointers on how we can counter-react these chemicals, what vitamins to take, which foods to eat that will flush chemicals out of our bodies and what to avoid, and  how to detoxify our homes, and cleanse our bodies. The author covers every area you will need to help you move to better health and avoid contamination in the future.  Excellent!<br /><br />I'll tell you the truth, this book was too long in coming and in my opinion should be read by every person on the face of the earth. The information will astound you and make you more aware of the  dangers in the world you live in. I strongly recommend this work, you won't be sorry.	2005-07-15

There are times when a book is so outstanding that you wonder how you will possibly write a review worthy of it; such is the case with Pedestals.<br /><br />As we begin our reading journey we met Jack Wilmont, a detective who just wants to take sometime off; get back in touch with life, but that was not about to happen.<br /><br />When a serial killer strikes Jack is asked to look at the evidence; Jack knew this was just the beginning.Through this, he becomes involved in the case of a missing nine-year old who had been abducted from her home.<br /><br />Jack knows this is a strange case. The young girl is being raised by her step-mother, unwanted by either her father or mother.  Jack is immediately drawn to the step-mother, and although she is the main suspect, Jack does not feel she is guilty.  He enlists the help of his ex-partner and the two of them begin an exciting investigation, just where it will lead, and if the child will be found alive is yet to be known.<br /><br />The author does an outstanding job of running two separate cases in this work, but keeping your interest peaked in each one, yet not causing any confusion. You wonder at first if the two are related, but soon find out they are not. The characters are well defined, extremely likeable and believable and the storyline flows without a flaw.  Well done!<br /><br />You are in for a treat when you see the twist and the strange reason for the serial killings.  I was shocked and surprised and I think considering the ending that we may have a reason for another book in the future, although I can't be sure of that.<br /><br />I don't want to give a lot away concerning this mystery, but I can tell you that this is certainly one book you do not want to miss reading.  It's suspenseful, has a tad of romance and some humor and is full of the wonderful question, who done it!<br /><br />This is one work I am proud to recommend, well worth your time.	2005-07-12

Author Ed Kostro shares his life and his passion for our fellow earth dwellers in his writing and does a very fine job of it.<br /><br />In this book we journey with the author from the days of his youth to the present. He shares with us touching stories of family life that always include the antics of wonderful pets and other animal encounters. He learns at an early age that he has a special relationship with nature's creatures.<br /><br />We share in the faithfulness of several beloved dogs, giggle at the humor of some and dab a tear at the loss of others. One of my favorite stories was\\"Guard Dog or Dinner For Two.\\"<br /><br />In this story Mr. Kostro is living in Southern Italy with his wife and dog Sport. Unfortunately, it seems the local people did not look at dogs as companions, but dinner.  Although I am sure I would have been just as upset about this as our author was; I could not help but stifle a giggle as he told the challenges he encountered in this new land with it's strange customs, keeping his beloved dog out of the cooking pot.<br /><br />All in all this was a very pleasant read and a great reminder that all life on this planet deserves our respect. Great book for animal lovers and for those who wonder why we love them so much.	2005-06-21

In the beginning of this outstanding read, we meet 12-year of Shelby Shodworth, who is orphaned after the death of her mother. Shelby is shipped off to live with her Uncle Leviticus, her father's brother. Shelby's father was presumed dead years ago after a fire ripped through the lab at a school where he was a professor.<br /><br />We are taken with Shelby as she tries desperately to adjust to life without her beloved mother, makes a great friend in a young boy named Casey, and just when she is feeling a little better, she is whisked off to a private school.<br /><br />Here, she befriends a young girl named Molly and through an amazing course of events, Shelby and Molly discover that this was the school that her father lost his life so many years before. What is the mystery behind it?<br /><br />As the girls investigate more, they find a hidden time travel portal underneath the school hidden in tunnels. It is when Shelby finds the courage to use the time travel portal that the answers to so many of her questions are finally answered.<br /><br />I have to say, this is one of the best young adult books that I have read in a long time.<br /><br />Right from the start you are deeply involved in the life of young Shelby and as her questions mount concerning her life, you can't wait to turn the page hoping she will find the answers.  The author brings into play many colorful characters that add mystery and draw mix emotions within you; and even though this story leans towards science fiction, the author does not leave out the problems a young girl could encounter beginning a new school. Making new friends, battling the school bully, and dealing with a teacher who appears to dislike her, all make for a realistic story.<br /><br />It is with great pleasure that I highly recommend this read.  The story moves along nicely, keeps your interest peaked with mystery and suspense, and makes you hunger for more.

I have to say the author did an outstanding job of drawing you into the storyline of this book from the beginning.  I probably would not have continued the read if he were to throw the physics at me right away, but he didn't.<br /><br />Instead he draws you into the life of a man, Steve,  who was chosen to be part of an experiment that he never volunteered for and introduces you to one of the men,  Mike,  who is working on finding the Higgs field. You see there are those working to find a particle that binds the universe together, if uncovered it will give whoever has the knowledge great power. Mike is an honest man, truly believing in his lives work but of course with anything like this, you always have the bad guys, and in this work believe me these guys are very bad and will stop at nothing to be successful in their quest.<br /><br />Our main character Steve seems to have had something implanted in his head that he knew nothing about after a bizarre accident in Zurich. Upon arriving back in the states he begins to experience some disturbing things and after much investigating realizes he was targeted as part of this experiment. In his attempt to find answers, he seeks out Mike. Thus, the lives of Steve and Mike are thrust together to fight the evil men that covet the God Particle.<br /><br />This was a very interesting story, strange in part, yet compelling and thought provoking as well. A little bit off the beaten track, this book will keep you guessing and leave you wondering. Nice piece of work.	2005-06-20

RAFTON, SOWING AND REAPING	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Don't Miss This One~	When I was asked to review this book I was excited,knowing first hand the abuse that occurs in nursing homes and to elderly; I knew this would be of interest to me.<br /><br />The story revolves around a woman named Sara, whose entire reason for living is money. Sara uses people, and circumstances to her advantage; her heart is cold and uncaring. Sara becomes involved in the business of one nursing home which she called, Mainstream. The promise was a home of loving and caring attendance that was never to be.  Sara cut corners everyway she could and the results were hideous to the trusting elderly in her care. Lying, cheating, abuse, death and destruction were the main players in this home and the elderly were their victims.<br /><br />We then have Mona Lockard; a feisty, wealthy, God-fearing elderly woman with a loving niece Melody. Through a series of circumstances Mona ends up at Mainstream and falls into the abuse nearly losing her life. Fortunately for her, her niece finds her in time to rescue her and save her life. It is because of the near loss of her aunt and the horrible conditions that Melody sees, she decides to go undercover and expose the abuse and corruption that is happening.<br /><br />The author does an outstanding job in building a great storyline  around this truth and weaving in the horrific crimes done to the elderly at the home; and also reminds us that although this is a story we are reading, it relates to what is happening across our country.  As you read her book, you realize these people are not just facts, but flesh and blood, feeling human beings, lost and relying upon the mercies of others.  Mercies they never received, their fears laid bare to see. You realize that even as you are reading, there are those who are being abused, living in fear and crying unheard for help in almost every nursing home across our nation. Shameful!<br /><br />Ms. Hardaway also brings to light the wonderful law of sowing and reaping. I do not want to give away the ending, but I'll tell you this; our Ms. Sara definitely gets exactly what she sowed; perhaps this should be a reminder to us all.<br /><br />Everyone one of us will have to deal with growing old in one form or another.<br /><br />Whether it be with a loved one, or ourselves, it is a fact that will not go away.<br /><br />I would advise every person in America to read this book, open their eyes to what is happening and join with others to make a difference for people who may not have a voice that will be heard.<br /><br />I want to take my hat off to author Lola C. Hardaway and thank her for having the courage to write such an outstanding work. I pray that it is kissed by God and touches lives all over our country.

No, we are not talking about the normal change of life that women experience, for Keira this change involves power. Keira is part of a clan, one that is full of supernatural powers, different powers.<br /><br />Some Clairvoyant, some healers, some shape-changers, but whatever it maybe, it was Keira's time to find out her gift.Keira lives in the small town of Rio Seco in Texas near her cousin Marty.  Marty does not have the family 'gift,' and is but a mere human outcast by the clan, but one entrusted into Keira's keeping until his mortal life is over.<br /><br />  The story begins as  animals turn up dead at a new resort called \\"The Wild Moon;\\" their heads cut off and Keira fears that it is not a natural hunter who is doing the killing, but one who works in the supernatural as she does.  It only worsens when Marty,  who held the job of the  local undertaker, turns up dead as well; his blood drained completely from his body. Gruesome!<br /><br />To complicate matters Keira's ex-boyfriend and now Sheriff is back in town to investigate the case and his feelings are still running deep for Keira. A relationship that could never continue, nor should it have ever begun.<br /><br />  All of a sudden Keira's  way too complicated life gets worse when she finds out the owner of the Wild Moon is none other than Adam Walker, a heartthrob of Keira's from years ago.<br /><br />  Adam has secrets as well; he is not what he appears to be, nor are the guests that are flooding into his new resort. I loved the way the author built on the suspense concerning these mystery guests  in this novel; it gave me a chill. Just what were 90% of the people in Rio Seco, could you even call them human? Creepy!<br /><br />  I really enjoyed this book. Our main character Keira is an extremely likeable woman, her spunk and strong nature add just the right amount of zest to the story.  The author does a suburb job in his description of each character that is introduced, from the obnoxious cousin Marty, to the love sick Sheriff, Keira's adorable brother Tucker, and best friend Bea.

They especially were against the Turanians, blue or green eyed people, their hatred ran deep for them, and there was a reason why although we are not fully aware of what it is in this first book of the series.<br /><br />In the beginning of this read we meet Helen, a doctor in the service of the military, and one of great knowledge, but one that has little respect in the world she lives. Although few can deny her ability in healing; her independent rebellious nature causes anger in some and fear in others.<br /><br />Helen Andros, daughter of Miriam Andros, a healer,  is considered a half-breed, a beautiful woman with green eyes.. A woman who at the beginning of the read does not know  who her father is,  nor if her mother is alive or dead, after being sent away from her at a young age.  The only thing she has is a necklace her mother gave her, one that has a green stone. This stone was given to her mother by Helen's father years ago, and has healing and protective powers, although Helen is not aware of that fact.<br /><br />Despite the dislike of Helen, her  abilities as a physician cannot be denied, and when the Prince falls ill, she is secretly ushered to his side. During this time she is arrested for entering the city without permission and her life begins to change due to one man, Lord Mordecai.<br /><br />Lord Mordecai holds the title of Lord Protector and is respected among his people, but seeing the green stone that is now the property of Helen and her striking resemblance to her mother he knows she must surely be his daughter. Although he was never aware she existed.  A confirmation is also given when a letter is read from Miriam naming him as the father.<br /><br /> A decision must be made by him; does he acknowledge that Helen is his daughter, for if he does it  may well be the end of his career or even his life. Yet, he is a man of honor and the love that he still holds for Miriam spills over to his daughter and he saves her from certain death.<br /><br /> In this book you begin to taste the start of the supernatural; powers that some seem to have yet also seem to be hidden. You are given the knowledge that people of different civilizations that are at odds with one another will soon have their lives altered, although you are not sure how; but you realize that good is desperately trying to override the evil that is present.<br /><br />I believe this first book is to introduce you to all the characters, their position in the series and their relationship one to another.  The author includes a glossary of who's who at the end of the book, and also information of the different areas you will be reading about. This is a great help, because the story is complex and the characters and locations can be confusing, however they all are needed and flow together to begin a somewhat mystic tale.<br /><br />Did you ever see a movie that has several parts and you have to wait until the next night to see what is going to happen?  You sigh, because you say within yourself, \\" Oh it was just getting good!\\" that is how I felt when this work ended.  The groundwork being laid,  the author begins to uncover some secrets, but the answers await you in book two.<br /><br />Those who love deep intricate stories, full of mystery and action, dripping with power struggles and battles for dominion, this work is for you.

Now, in their senior year of high school, they are about to embark on their true journey of life as they each prepare for their college years and their future.<br /><br />The story mainly focuses on Katie and her struggle to make sense of the many conflicting feelings she is having. Determined to eventually make her way to California to pursue a modeling career; she battles with loyalty to family and friends in her decision. Awakening one day to realize perhaps her feelings for her life-long friend Alan are deeper than platonic, she must face the reality that it might be a one way street.<br /><br />How will this revelation effect Katie and her future?<br /><br />The author does a very good job in bringing to light the complexity of those who are venturing out to make a life of their own; allowing the raw emotions that are stirring within them to be felt; as the reader  participates in the often roller coaster ride that challenges a young person's life in their decision making, and their romantic encounters. The characters are well defined and believable; and although the ending will probably not be what you hoped it would, it certainly shows the way life is.<br /><br />A very good read.	2005-05-23

For Quinn, he battles against authority, does not use the intellect that is his, but a man named Joe Toscano is about to make a mark on Quinn's life.<br /><br />Joe is a no-nonsense man, having fought in Korea and Vietnam, and also having made some foolish mistakes in his life; he extends wisdom in a way that young Quinn cannot refuse and in doing so changes both of their lives.<br /><br />In this work we see a boy coming to terms with life, with all of it's goodness and evil; we cheer, we cry, we shake our head and perhaps even remember or connect in someway to the raw emotions that we see.  We watch as a friendship bridges the gap and fills the voids in the lives it touches. And in the end we smile at the mark it has made in our world.<br /><br />A Dedication is a story of life, of taking and giving, loving and hating, living and dying, but most important of forgiveness of oneself and of others. A story of life, yesterday, today and tomorrow.	2005-05-21

Abuse and women have gone hand in hand throughout the centuries; the battle for liberty and freedom rages on even now in our modern times.  The subject matter of this book is not new, the stories told and the tears shed are not surprising, but what is, is the courage found within these women and the positive reflection their words leave with the reader.<br /><br />As author Jan Goff-LaFontaine shares the heart of these women with frank interviews, she somehow shatters the wall of secrecy that has been carefully laid, and takes you to the other side of their prison wall where liberty awaits them.<br /><br />At first I was surprised to see naked pictures of these women, but for them this too was a liberty, a breaking free of abuse and negative impressions of their inner-self; as they shared the parts of their body where healing began.<br /><br />Abuse in any form is not a pretty picture; the degrading of another human being must never be tolerated. This work, I believe, will give hope to thousands of women to take that first step to freedom.	2005-05-21

She is a middle-aged vibrant woman with much to give to others and her knowledge of poisonous plants is about to be put to good use in this outstanding mystery read.<br /><br />Peggy finds the body of a Mr.Mark Warner in her shop one morning upon arriving for work. The fact that she knows the man and that his body was found in her shop puts Peggy in a very hard position and plunges her into a quest to solve the murder. This is not appreciated by the detectives that are working on this case; however in time they will change their tune.<br /><br />Peggy, who has been content to live without a man in her life suddenly is thrown into the path of Steve, a local veterinarian. Despite him being a little younger than Peggy, the instant attraction to each other cannot be denied; yet Peggy fights the feelings she has long buried; but her struggle will be futile.<br /><br />We are taken on an enjoyable roller coaster ride as Peggy, Steve and her workers at the garden shop begin their investigation work to solve this murder. To add some spice, another woman dies in the same way in another city and Peggy is sure the two cases are related.  I don't want to give away the reason these poor souls died, but it certainly is not as it first appeared. A nice touch that the authors add at the beginning of each chapter is information about different plants. A perfect addition to the read, that blends well with the story.<br /><br />The authors introduce many colorful characters that add complete realism to this read.They interweave relationship turmoil's that top the cake with a little cream and also you are given a nice slice of humor in the form of a canine named, Shakespeare.<br /><br />I believe the fact that Peggy is a middle-aged woman caused me to enjoy this read all the more.  Not the norm for many mystery novels; this shows that adventure certainly can knock on the door at any age; and wisdom that comes with maturity can make a difference. I liked that.<br /><br />I have come to respect the writing of Joyce and Jim Lavene.  I know I am always going to be engrossed in any book they write.  They amaze me with their ability to write in so many different genres with such expertise, and this work is yet another reminder of that fact. I can truly say I loved this book and was sorry when it ended. And for a reviewer that is something we don't say very often.<br /><br />Adventure, romance, humor and mystery.

Our author separates women into four Milestone groups.<br /><br />Group One: Menstruation to First Pregnancy; Two: The Reproductive Years; Three: Perimenopause;<br /><br />Four: Beyond Menopause. I found this to be so interesting as she explains how a woman's body works in these different times and what will work for them in terms of improving their health and well-being.<br /><br />Excellent!<br /><br />As we move along she speaks to you of your mindset, having a motivation, or Bull's Eye. She asks you to think what gives you joy, what brings you stress.  She allows you the liberty to pick in your own mind, be truthful and re-examine yourself and your goals. She goes on to share with us about 'Smart Food,' foods that will help us achieve our goals and improve my health, and next we travel to exercise.<br /><br />I know....the hard part, but Ms. Peeke shares the perks  of exercising for each group and actually makes you feel pretty good about it.<br /><br />In this book you will find charts and pictures, contracts to make with yourself and just a bag full of helpful information.

I liked the way the author writes, as if you are right there with him, down to earth, in terms that can be understood and followed. Refreshing!<br /><br />He explains to you the workings of the body, what certain foods will and will not do for you and gives you some personal experience stories that bring what he is saying to life. He even understands that there are times you will cheat and gives you a cheat meal. How great is that?  He tells you about supplements and explains what is and is not needed. I liked this section because for me, that subject can be very confusing.<br /><br />Along with this, you have an entire section on exercising, with a host of black and white pictures to make sure you are positioning yourself correctly. I don't know about you, but for me that has been a problem in the past. It's nice to look at the pictures and at least hope I can get in that position and do the exercise correctly.<br /><br />You have a great nutrition plan, based on scientific and medical facts, a great exercise program and the backing of a doctor who lives what he writes.<br /><br />I think that makes a pretty good package and a great book.

There are times when as a reviewer and a Christian I know when God touches a  certain author to do His work in helping to reach his creation.  I sense this anointing in  author Niki Behrikis Shanahan, I sense the hand of God upon her words, within her life.<br /><br />Having had the privilege to read and review her first work, There Is Eternal Life For Animals, and acknowledging the spiritual workings within that book; I was anxious to read her new work,  Animal Prayer Guide. I knew that this work was done upon the inspiration of our Creator and I hungered to receive the guidance I knew would be forthcoming.<br /><br />Our author  begins this writing by sharing with the reader the workings of prayer. Ms. Shanahan carefully explains the right and authority we have as believers to pray, the importance of mixing our faith with prayer and the help our Heavenly Father gives to us; taking the time to show you why it is acceptable to God to pray for the animals we so love.  As always, she backs up her writing with Scripture and includes deep heartwarming testimonies of answered prayer, that will help increase your faith to use the mighty weapon of prayer that God has given to you. Certainly by the time you have finished reading this section, you are well versed in your authority and in the privilege to include any animal in your prayer requests.<br /><br />As we travel on Ms. Shanahan begins to break down the prayers for our animal companions.To name only a few of the prayers she shares with us, we have; Prayer For Healing, Prayer For Lost Pets to Return, Prayer For Emergencies, Praying For Pet Shelters and my favorite, Saying Grace Over Your Pet's Food.

Author Vanessa Denha delves into a topic that will surely be embraced by women near and far. When did you know you were truly a woman? Ah! Was it on a certain day, a certain occasion or perhaps a certain season of your life?<br /><br />In this work you will relish in the stories of many different women as they share the time or event they knew they had become a woman.  I laughed some and felt some tugs on my heartstrings as I read their words. I definitely could relate.<br /><br />I really liked the section, \\" Yes I Am a Woman NOW,\\" where our author asked her interviewees to answer the question, \\"How would you define being a woman today?\\"<br /><br /> In this section she  also gives little tid-bits of information about women.  Intriguing fun facts that you will enjoy.<br /><br />I really liked this book; I believe it is the personal touch that it presents to the reader. It truly is like you are sitting and talking with your sisters, your friends, and sharing their hearts. It was an interesting and fun read; I think all women will enjoy this work.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson	2005-04-29

I suppose, with all the sadness happening in the earth today, I just did not want to read a tear-jerker about the death of a child.<br /><br />However, as it sat in my reading pile I decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did.<br /><br />Author Yona McDonough's novel certainly touches on the death of 7-year  Dahlia in a freak accident, but the true essence of the story surrounds the grieving parents, Rick and Naomi, and the events that this tragic happening brought about in their lives.<br /><br />Rick, who is ridden with guilt since he was driving that day, feels separated from Naomi, who herself is struggling to cope with the emptiness inside.. Thrown further and further apart, both of these people seek solace in others.<br /><br />Naomi, who is volunteering at the hospital her daughter died , finds comfort in the very doctor who informed her that her daughter was dead.  Rick, a podiatrist turns to his helper Lillian, who herself desperately needs a man to lean on and is drawn to the wandering soul of Rick. So the drama begins, and lives are touched and changed in ways that neither Rick nor Naomi thought possible, including their own.<br /><br />The author does an outstanding job in examining the minds and hearts of each character. She brings forth raw emotions, the unbridled grief and anger, fear and frustration that burns inside of them;  and shows the often tragic consequences of being lead by these feelings and how far reaching they can become in all the lives they touch.<br /><br />I recommend this work, it reaches deep into the heart and soul of the grieving spirit, shows wisdom from unexpected sources and actually leaves you with a deep respect and understanding for those who have walked this road.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2005-04-29

Growing up in New Jersey, born to an Italian American father, this book was almost like going home. The story takes place in the 1950's in the city of Bloomfield,where we are introduced to the<br /><br />Bonaducci family; dad, Rocky, mom, Marietta, and their three children, Jo Jo, Frank and Donna.<br /><br /> In this wonderful novel, we share the journey of this family's life, the challenges of the times they live in, their commitment to each other and the extended family that all Italians have,  and the battle to keep the world from crashing in on their sanctity, yet allowing for the independence that each member  needs. I smiled at the wonderful stories of their family gatherings, the abundance of food, the talking, eating and body motion that was done all at the same time; it is indeed a wonder to behold. We travel along as the family matures, life complicates living, and the Bonaducci's grow together to meet the challenges. Never a dull moment, as is the case in most Italian households; and this is certainly true in the Bonaducci's as well.<br /><br />In this read, we have a dash of some mob temptations, a historical football game where a difficult decision was made , and even a splash of the world of entertainment, all touching this family and helping to  sculpture their lives in the decisions they make and their relationships one to another.<br /><br />The author does a wonderful job in bringing each character alive, allowing you to feel as if you have always known them.  You begin to care what happens to the family, their struggles become your struggles, their hurts, your hurts, their victories, your victories, their family, your family. Well done!<br /><br />The descriptions of the different locals that you travel to are vivid and add  much to the story, and Mr. Cervasio does an excellent job in portraying the mindset of the time; and the happenings of the era.<br /><br />If you want a truthful, heartwarming look inside the life of an Italian American family in the 1950's; a glimpse of their traditions, a taste of their strength and unity as a family, or just a read that delivers to you a wonderful story,  this book is for you.

Sometimes it is for the good, and sometimes it is not. Life often challenges us with circumstances concerning ourselves or our loved ones, and we desperately search for meaning and answers to questions and problems that seem to linger . But then, there are those who finally find the peace, learn the lesson, even though they may not have all the answers, they have learned what is important and how we all play a part in the lives of others.<br /><br />This is what I saw in the work, \\"Gertrude's Cupboard.<br /><br />As Cockey struggles with extreme challenges concerning the son she so loves, her life is also hampered with the ever present financial needs of mere existence.<br /><br />Through the life of a 90 year old woman, who herself is suffering from Dementia, she is shown that what is within her, her gift, her talent can touch and change lives; and in doing so can only enrich her own. A book that brings to light the true struggle of so many suffering people, and an encouragement that one person can make a difference.

This work I found to be very interesting and enlightened me in many ways. The author gives you some clear  revelations concerning conflicts that you will encounter in life; the emotions you will deal with and the why's of feeling as you feel.<br /><br />He explains the concept of the 'power struggles' that we have within ourselves, and how important it is to work to understand them and make the necessary changes.<br /><br />It is always hard to see ourselves as others see us, our flaws and weaknesses; but with understanding, comes the ability to change.<br /><br />I enjoyed this work and plan on doing a little more study with this book and some self-examining.  I think this book would profit all that take the time to read it and put into practice what is being told them.  An interesting spin, not boring, but very insightful.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson	2005-04-23

To me, this work left me with a smile and the realization that life often evens the score.<br /><br />Rick Page is a private eye in L.A. He is hired by a millionaire to find his missing wife.  He finds her, murdered and mutilated in the same fashion as another young women had been  before her. Seemingly the two murders were not related, nor were the killers of the first victim, Elizabeth Short, ever brought to justice, but Rick knew better.<br /><br />His investigation takes him into the depths of those who seem to have no soul, nor regard for the dignity of human life, only for their perverse pleasures and greed.<br /><br />Nearly losing his own life, Rick presses on determined to settle a burning desire to see the murderers of Laura Prendergast brought to justice.  Perhaps the justice is not the way some would have liked, but nevertheless it seemed to fit the occasion.<br /><br />I liked this book.  It took on a new twist in a mystery read and kept my interest.<br /><br />The characters were well thought out and the author interwove them nicely within the storyline. There was mystery, adventure and a tad of romance. Well done and recommended.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2005-04-23

There are times when I come across a book that is just pure pleasure to read, such was the case with \\"Too Many Secrets,\\" by Laura McClendon.<br /><br />We meet Cassandra Masters, a widowed mom of one child and a woman with an exciting career as a private investigator in upstate New York.  You soon find out that she is, as they say, 'one smart cookie,' and has never failed one of her clients, but this case is a tough one.<br /><br />Dr. Moorehouse is murdered and his wife Eleanor seems the perfect suspect, she desperately needs Cassandra's help to clear her name. The plot has a twist as well, as Eleanor seems to have some strings attached from her past to Cassandra's late husband and her close friend David.<br /><br />Cassandra accepts the challenge of this case and enlists the help of David and some other very colorful characters and they begin to unravel a not so pretty lifestyle of the late doctor, bringing more and more suspects into the picture around each corner.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  It was packed full of colorful, interesting characters, mystery and twists and turns. As soon as I thought I had everything figured out, our author threw a wrench in the works and I was back to square one.  Good job! I liked the way the author worked the characters, making you think for sure that one did the murder and then proving there was no way they could have. I never did quess who the real killer was right up to the end.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the way Ms. McClendon intertwined Cassandra's business life and her personal life, this gave an overall believable aspect to the story and made it much more personal, and enjoyable.<br /><br /> All in all a great mystery read with a wonderful, likeable, believable main character.  I hope there will be more books coming from this author; definitely one talented lady.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2005-04-16

What could be better than that?<br /><br />This book is packed full of information that you can use in daily living, information that gives you the inside scoop of just what is in certain products? How are animals really treated? Why does it help to drink organic coffee? Just to name a very few.<br /><br />The information in this  book is about our everyday living and understanding the responsibility that we have to live in unity with all of life on our planet.  It is not written in a condemning way, but instead brings great understanding as to why we should respect life in all forms. It is also filled with alternatives, meals that are made with healthy foods, that not only improve our bodies but are animal friendly.  Cleaning supplies that do the job but do not hurt the environment or those who live in it. I found that to be very refreshing and informative.<br /><br />The author also gives a very in-depth listing of animal ingredients that we can look for in products we eat and use and alternatives for them. She gives names and addresses of companies that sell products or foods that are friendly to our world.<br /><br />Great! I want you to understand that this is just not another book tearing you apart for eating animal flesh or using animal products.  No, it's a book of information, one that is a real eye opener; and it is written in a very easy to understand way.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.

Ely Stone is not your typical man, nor is the adventure he is about to undertake typical.<br /><br />An Indian by heritage, a warrior by nature, he begins a journey  that will tap his courage and shake his being. His past military life has been unique; death and the righting of wrongs had been paramount in his life. His job was one many men would find distasteful, yet a necessary part of the survival of decency in our world, despite the means to achieve it. Now retired, he finds himself caught up in the past of his heritage and finds, despite his objections, that he is the chosen one to lead his people to the next plateau of their existence. In traveling with him, you realize that his entire life has been training for the task before him as he is thrust into being a Special Agent for the Pukaskwa Tribal police and the Tribal pathfinder; a title and a job that Ely desperately wanted to run from, yet he could not escape the inward knowing that indeed this was his purpose for living.<br /><br />We meet Amos, the Tribal Spiritual leader, who helps to guide Ely on his journey; a colorful man, full of tradition and brimming with spirituality of life.  We also meet Annette, who wins the heart of our hero and adds just the right amount of tenderness and love to our story. One by one the author adds characters rich in secret identities, cloaked in mystery, each enhancing the already building suspense of the read.<br /><br />As the story goes, the Indians have an island in Lake Michigan, an island that must be used to better the financial situation of the people. However, unknown to them,  hidden on this island is something so important that nations have been seeking it for years. Now, the race is on for this object that is shrouded in mystery  and you hungrily read on to find out just what this maybe. An object of such importance that nothing or no one will stop those seeking it until it is found.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this is no small read, but don't let the 582 page work scare you. Each page draws you deeper and deeper into the world of those you will not soon forget, and a story that will be etched in your memory forever.<br /><br />The Murmurings, a novel of mystery, a novel of mystic-spiritual power, a novel of love, loyalty,friendship, betrayal, and murder; with a storyline woven so intricately together that is a masterpiece.

First, I would like to applaud the author for a book that holds a wonderful storyline yet is packed full of fascinating facts of the time era. Set in Kansas during the start of the Civil War, we are whisked into the reality of the happenings of that time.<br /><br />Taken into the life of a young woman named Jessica, her family and her adopted sister Nelle, who was the lost child of a slave woman, we are thrown into the murder of her parents and the abduction of Nelle by a man consumed with hatred. The war, beginning to touch the free state of Kansas will change all their lives forever.<br /><br /> We are immediately drawn into the hatred that is harbored in so many hearts for the black race at this time and we are drawn into the battle of not just slavery but deep seated emotions that are cresting in our beloved land.<br /><br />I loved the spiritual aspect that the author gently weaves in this work. The appearance of the Angel named Sissy that was the source of help and comfort  for our black girl Nelle was truly heart touching.  I think this novel touches on the aspect that even at that time in our nations history we clung to the words of the Bible.  They may not have been interpreted correctly in some instances, but still they were revered as an important factor in decisions made and opinions within people.<br /><br />To be honest with you I am not a big fan on Civil War novels, but the characters were so vivid that I felt as if I were a part of their life. The storyline was superb and the historical value of this book was exceptional..<br /><br />Sissy, a well crafted  book that has depth and meaning and would be enjoyed by all ages.

We are first introduced to Miranda Perry, a young woman with a 6 year old son, who has all ready tasted the agony life can bring when she suffered the death of her husband before the birth of her son. Her life is about to change once more.<br /><br />Miranda has worked hard to make her way in the world of culinary in San Francisco.  Close now to owning her own restaurant, again life gets in the way as her father dies and she must return to Oregon and  face the prospects of what to do with his winery, and the beautiful vineyards that have been in her family for years.

One was the rich characters and their true life struggles against immense odds. I love how the author showed the raw emotions in each one. She also added some slices of romance to a couple that you did not think would ever taste of it.  Very good.<br /><br />Ms. Kafka brought to life the world of wine making and the problems they face; I found that to be very interesting and I love the way she added the often hard living that the migrant workers endure day to day.<br /><br />This was a great read.

In her work, Liberty's Poet, Emma Lazarus, I was privileged to learn about a young Jewish girl living, in the 19th century in New York City, who had a true gift from God in penning words.<br /><br />The famous poem, \\"The New Colossus,\\" that is inscribed on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty was written by her hand.  I have loved those words since childhood, but not until now did I understand the deep conviction of the one who wrote them, Emma Lazarus. I had to smile as just the other day a commercial came on television quoting her words, never did they mean so much to me as they did at that moment.<br /><br />I thank the author for that understanding.<br /><br />Emma knew first hand the degrading humiliation of the Jewish people, those seeking refuge in the United States and the poor reaching out. Through this work I have learned what a wonderful visionary she was; I have gasped at her courage, applauded her compassion, and smiled at her victories.<br /><br />In this book history is brought to life in a way that is both entertaining and a pleasure to read as well as informative.<br /><br />Recommended for young and old that wish to partake of a slice of history that touched our country from shore to shore.

In this work author Robert Thurman takes the reader through steps to help rid themselves of negative effects in their lives and lead them to the positive. He talks on such subjects as, Wisdom, Generosity, Patience, and explains their  meaning and the effect they have on your life, which runs much deeper than you imagine. He shows the importance of releasing such emotions as anger and the damage it does to us personally.<br /><br />You will be surprised to find out how much your negative emotions are only hurting yourself.<br /><br />I have to say that all the principals  that he offers would certainly better mankind if they were followed and we would indeed live a much more peaceful existence with one another. He challenges the reader to do a self-examination of their life, and take a good hard look at where they are going and how they are getting there.<br /><br />I do not agree with some of his beliefs such as reincarnation, however I do applaud his deep conviction of  the same.<br /><br /> The work is very readable and easy to understand and  would be a great work for any Buddhist to help them in their walk and for those wishing to understand this belief .

What does it mean to be a male?  What exactly is required of our men and is it fair what we demand from them? How do they feel about the role they are made to take? These are some of the questions addressed in this work, and the responses may surprise you.<br /><br />In these essays you will find heart felt stories and honest raw emotions set before you. Perhaps for the first time you will understand the true heart of a man as he struggles to find his own identity, which is often suppressed by what he feels he should be, but is not. Or longs to be, but is not given the liberty to pursue his hearts desire.  Very sad.<br /><br />I found this work to be very refreshing and certainly made me stop and re-think of the pre-conceived ideas that have been handed down to me concerning the place men should have in our society. The essays kept my interest as I could feel through the words that were penned a true heart cry of the writer for others to understand the turmoil that they were experiencing.<br /><br />This work is truly one that would benefit all in bringing us more understanding of fears unspoken, goals not able to be achieved and dreams unfulfilled from those who have played the role for so long, men.	2005-02-27

For years I listened as my father reenacted account after account of the great war, but I never heard of the \\"Mountain Soldiers,\\" I stand  amazed at men such as these. Through this authors words I tasted their courage, skill and became aware of the  impact they had on the outcome of the time, certainly giving them a place  in the achieve of our nation's history.<br /><br /> The Last Ridge is a true account of these fearless men, their part in the victory over the Nazi's and the  challenges and sacrifices it took to achieve that.<br /><br />Well researched this work gives the reader knowledge of a group of fearless men and the vision they had and accomplished.

I was thrilled to be able to review \\"Murder Beyond Metropolis,\\" and again be reunited with the characters I had so enjoyed in the first book.<br /><br />\\"Murder Beyond Metropolis\\" introduces us to more of the Sheriffs family, making the storyline more personal, and takes us on the trail of a killer who seems to be targeting the elderly. We have not one murder, but a multitude as the plot thickens in this outstanding read. As always with Sheriff Dalton, once a murder is committed he is relentless until he finds the killer.<br /><br />This story was chock full of suspects, twisting motives and personal details of the main characters that keep them alive and real in your minds eye;  and it took a real turn when the Sheriff's own wife was put in danger. Who would have known?<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and could hardly make myself put it down. The ending was not what I expected and that's a good thing, as right to the end you were not sure what was going to happen.<br /><br />Lonnie Cruse is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  Her mystery novels are quick paced, interesting and full of surprises and suspense. Knowing the main characters lets you begin the work comfortable with the read.<br /><br />Murder Beyond Metropolis is an outstanding read.  One that keeps you guessing as the story twists and turns and more suspects are thrown before you in a whirl of 'who done it?'<br /><br />I think what I like most about the authors writing style is her ability to actually make you a part of the storyline.  Her character development is so good that the Sheriff becomes your friend, the townspeople,your town, and the killer your enemy.  That is a good writer.<br /><br />If you have not read any of this authors work you just don't know what you are missing.

Surely in the mysterious mountains many monstrosities must have been done without the world knowing, and my interest was peaked.<br /><br />As I began the read, I found myself whisked into the lives of two young friends, David and Linn. Raised on these mountains these boys knew the ways of the people, a commitment that outsiders could never understand.  One family survived by bootlegging while the other had a father who was only part of the mountain by marriage and never really joined or was accepted by its people. .<br /><br />Halfway through their friendship David and his family left the Appalachia terrain, but as fate would have it he was drawn back to his childhood home due to a government assignment that could destroy them all.<br /><br />Do not be confused with this work and pick it up thinking you are going to read solely about an insane killer, although that is part of the story, and one that certainly adds spice to the adventure.  It's main theme is the lives of these two young men, the part these mountains had in forming their future and an unspoken commitment to each other that few have ever experienced.<br /><br />The characters are well defined and the scenic  description and lifestyle of the area are exceptionally woven within the story adding authenticity.<br /><br />I have thought about this read on and off since completing it.

Although the hectic California lifestyle seems to be agreeing with him; PJ is still plagues with some inner turmoil's.<br /><br />  Things have changed for PJ.  His mother has remarried and he has a new stepbrother, that he is definitely jealous of, and a new girlfriend, who he seems to be obsessed with. His life is full and the last thing he needs is another quest, but lo and behold here it comes.<br /><br />  This time PJ is called by his old friend Hermes to complete Hercules Twelve Labors.  Why?

Forced to battle such mystical creatures as a lion, and a pig who becomes almost a friend and a host of other not so friendly characters, we are plunged into an adventurous read that is a real page turner. We also have a tad of mystery as Andi, PJ's former girlfriend, reappears on the scene. Just what part will she play in all of this?  To add spice, we have a riddle that surely must mean something, but what?<br /><br />  This is another delightful, action packed story for young and old. It's always nice to be familiar with the characters you have learned to love, and hate, from previous works as you begin the read.  I recommend this book.

I found this part of the read extremely interesting and truly enjoyed reading about experiences such as  'fly-in restaurtants,' I never knew they existed.  I loved all the little facts he told as he compared the past to the present concerning our living condictions, our health care and even the cars we drive. I felt it was very interesting, and very well constructed.<br /><br />It is true that the author does go off into how we should be helping the rest of the world, and surely that is true.  However, I feel much is being done to help and still more will be done in the future, nothing can be accomplished overnight. Many open their hearts and their pocketbooks to the best of their ability every single day.<br /><br />In my opinion, with most people, if they have they are more willing to give.  I know there are always those who are greedy no matter what, but basically I feel if one is comfortable in their life-style they are more open to help others.<br /><br />I felt this book was extremely interesting and I didn't feel any guilt trip concerning the 'haves' and the 'have-nots.' I believe the author was just sharing facts and options for the future as he sees them. I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson	2005-02-06

I was totally captivated by the third chapter and finished it in two days saddened that it was over.<br /><br />Curse The Darkness is a story of a mansion, one that was built by evil, for the work of evil. The author takes you from the past to the present and leads you through the lives of those who have encountered  the Kensington estate.<br /><br />We meet Robert and John, childhood friends who both have experienced the horror of the workings of this ungodly habitat.  Grown now, Robert is the local Preacher and John owns a small grocery.  They are introduced to Lawrence Tellcott, a self-made billionaire with great hurts from the past, who has now bought the Kensington mansion and is about to taste the nectar of darkness. We also meet a young boy who has become a prisoner as well of the blackness in the mansion. There is an evil presence in the mansion, one so dark that as you read this work you can feel the intense physical presence of evil and the hatred for human life and dignity that this entity  possesses. Chilling!<br /><br />The story takes you back in time to the birth of a witch who spins her evil web and continues her ungodly ways into the present. Now Robert and John are called upon by God to fight this evil that has shadowed them their entire lives. There can be no losing this battle, no running away, defeat is not an option as death awaits the loser.<br /><br />Philip James Medley has woven a story that has captured the very essence of evil and good. He has penned a work so exceptional  that through his words you are totally one with every action and emotion of the characters within the read. In this book you become aware of the evil that surely is within our world and you rally around those who are of the Light, knowing their victory is for all mankind.<br /><br />His characters are real, not candy coated goody two-shoes, but everyday people like you and me;  as he shows it is not their righteousness but their faith in a Creator whose power is above all that will enable them to conquer evil. This is not written in a  preachy way,  but gently woven into the storyline and whether you are a believer or not you simply must know who the victor will be.<br /><br />His descriptive power of the dark character is chilling and the dialog he allows this evil to bring forth to her victims is filled with truth concerning the deception that man is under.  What a read!<br /><br />Every so often I find a book that is so good I want every person that I know to read it.  I have found this pleasure in Curse the Darkness. If this were a movie I would be standing up and cheering at the end, my applause would be louder than all those within the room.  Very few works leave such an impression on me as this one has.<br /><br />It is a masterpiece and one that I will not soon forget.<br /><br />Hats off to you Mr. Medley for giving us such an exceptional work.  I look forward to more of your writings in the future. Readers, don't miss this one!<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Reviewhe loser. <br />  <br />Philip James Medley has woven a story that has captured the very essence of evil and good.

Saunders, is not just a man, but a piece of American history. You cannot truly understand that statement until you have feasted on his life's story and that of seven generations before in his newly released book, \\"Blessed, I'm So Damned Grateful.\\"<br /><br />As we begin the journey we are told of his great-grandparents immigration from England to America and the terrible violent murder suicide that occurred leaving six orphaned children. He then begins to share the different events  and encounters with some well known figures in history that family members had, their journey in America, and how it shaped the future of his family.<br /><br />We travel along to our author's life, share with him his hopes and dreams as a child, a young man and an adult, watching not just his life unfold, but also that of America.<br /><br />We rejoice in his victories, cheer him on in his battles through his lives journey, and sigh at the struggling growth of our wonderful country, as we are reminded of the great depression, several wars and the many growing pains she encounters. The pictures and personal family records that are included in the work add a very nice touch and help to bring the experience of the read to a more personal level.  Good job.<br /><br />Mr. Saunders is open and frank in his recollection of his lives memories. No life is free from pain, challenges or sorrows, yet the author has taken the very essence  of what living is all about and conveyed it to this work. It isn't how big a house you live in, or the model of the car you drive; it is the sharing of friends, family and God. There are many threads that make up the fiber of a man, and through his writing one realizes they have the choice of what threads they will allow to make up their fiber and to mold their character.<br /><br />Blessed: I'm So Damned Grateful,  is more than a book of someone's memoirs; it is a book on living' a book on being thankful for the very gift of life; a families journey that continues on.  Enjoy and be reminded what really is important.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Reviewa families journey that continues on.

Let me start this review by saying, \\"What a great book.\\"  In this story, Stormy Fall, we find Katie; a young girl who has moved to a new town.  Her families circumstances financially are not the best as they struggle to improve their standard of living.<br /><br />The character development of Katie and her family are excellent, well defined and extremely realistic; you immediately join with them as though you are part of the family, which causes you to actually care what happens to them.  Good job.<br /><br />Katie is involved in her church's homeless project, as at one time she and her family were in that situation, her compassion runs deep concerning them.  The author introduces you to the plight of the homeless and the often callous reactions those more fortunate have towards them. We are introduced to two very likeable homeless ladies Edith and Stella,  who now work for the church and one very unlikable Board Member of the church,Phoebe, who definitely is not sympathetic to the homeless plight.<br /><br />When money comes up missing at the church and the blame is put on our now two missing homeless ladies the adventures begin as Katie and her friends set out to prove Edith and Stella are not guilty.<br /><br />Ms. Barclift does an outstanding job in building the suspense in this mystery read, drawing you into the age old question, who done it?.  I loved the way she kept alive the compassion for others that you find in Katie's family even during times when it would seem that would be far from what should be felt.<br /><br />All in all this was an exceptional read that kept me glued to the pages. Mystery, suspense, adventure and moral teaching all wrapped up on a great story.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.	2005-01-21

In this work, The Jesus Habits,  we find author Jay Dennis laying the foundation for changing our lives in his unveiling of the habits of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Rev. Dennis looks deeply into the habits of Jesus; things that he practiced daily and<br /><br />incorporated into every thing that he did or said; and the author  carefully  explains them to you, telling you the benefits of making these your habits as well.  If there was any man that we should try to imitate their lifestyle , it certainly would be Jesus.<br /><br />He tells you why they are important to incorporate in your life and even gives you enemies of the habits, which are reasons or circumstances that would stop you from developing them.  I have to say, I definitely could relate to some of these enemies and others I was not aware of until my reading. Thankfully now I  see where they have hindered me without my realization and I am able to make some needed changes. What a blessing that is and will continue to be.<br /><br />As a Christian I found this work to be extremely helpful and used it to check my own walk with the Lord. There are 31 habits listed and include categories such as; Prayer, Worship, Rest, Thanksgiving and Purpose, to name a few. Each category is clearly developed and you definitely have a complete understanding of their importance in the life of Jesus and in your own life when you complete this read.<br /><br />  A book of information, instruction and encouragement; The Jesus Habits is a must have for all believers to enrich their Christian walk.  However, I feel this book  would benefit not only Christians, but all that would like to become better all around productive people.<br /><br />Recommended for all those who would like to see their lives and this world become a better place.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2005-01-19

Our story begins with the brutal act of murder committed by a young soldier against his Sergeant  in the year 1917. Jumping from the troop train  to escape  punishment for his act; he finds himself lost in a swamp called Cocodrie, in the state of Louisiana.<br /><br />  The author does an outstanding job in conveying the horror Cocodrie envelopes our young soldier in as he is trapped in the confines of her borders. Right from the beginning she gives the swamp life of it's own, portraying to the reader a living joint personality of the many life forms that call Cocodrie home. The writing was so vivid, I actually could taste his fear.<br /><br />  We follow this soldier as he makes it through the terror of his first night in the swamp, saves a small child from the jaws of an alligator and becomes her victim.<br /><br />Saved by the child's family, whose father is the last pirate of New Orleans, and who has given up his heritage to live in peace in Cocodrie;  we are introduced to a community of swamp people. This unique community has left behind the world we know and has embraced the life of Cocodrie, where all are accepted without question of past.<br /><br />Following the life of this family and our soldier we are taken into the amazing world that exists in this mysterious swamp. We share the lives of the people, their deep commitment to one another and their swamp and the upheaval as the outside world begins to devour their beloved land and the rules start to change. The characters soon become as real as your own neighbors and through the authors excellent descriptive writing we soon become part of this close-knit community.<br /><br />Without fully understanding why; we respect their love for a land that is hostile and to many uninviting and fearful.<br /><br />Although this work has a wonderful storyline of well defined characters, I was more drawn into the actual life of the swamp itself and its struggle against the invasion of civilization, and the almost supernatural web it weaves on those whose lives it touches.  It is as if the author is telling the story of Cocodrie for Cocodrie; the struggle to continue to generate the life that it has forged for centuries. Whether it be human, animal, plant or reptile its battle to survive becomes personal.<br /><br />I have been privileged to read and review the works of author C.J. Morace and I applaud her outstanding ability to bring together a story that totally absorbs the reader into its very essence. Whether it be Appalachia, or Cocodrie, her skill as a writer is superb as she uses words to stimulate the true sensation of the events before you.<br /><br />I highly recommend her work and honestly tell you these reads you will not soon forget.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Reviewes on those whose lives it touches.

Raised during the depression area, Ms Berry relates the hardships her family endured, but also shows the spirit of unity of family to survive through hard times.  In this work, she communicates to the reader the commitment of friends, the importance of love, and the appreciation of the smallest blessings.<br /><br />I found this book to be truly heart-felt in it's meaning. A sharing of an era perhaps forgotten by many, never known by some, yet one that is etched in the portals of time.

There are times when I am asked to read and review a work that I know I must put my own personal beliefs aside to be fair in my review, this was the case with the work \\"Possessed By Ghosts.\\" Although I certainly do feel we are influences by those of the spirit realm, my take on whom or what we are dealing with is a little different than our authors. Nevertheless, her work was intriguing, interesting, well written and  I sensed a sincere desire to help mankind as I read her book. That is always refreshing.<br /><br /> \\"Possessed By Ghosts,\\" written by  renowned exorcist and healer, Wanda Pratnicka  is a work where our author opens her heart to you, and shares many years of her experience with freeing not only those troubled by ghosts, but the ghosts themselves..  Bridging this world with the next, she explains how she believes those departed influence our lives and often cause sickness and mishap. She gives testimonies and tells of different circumstances where this has occurred, taking time to answer the questions, you the reader, are sure to have. Carefully explaining her position as an exorcist and healer;  Ms. Pratnicka offers solutions to these difficulties.<br /><br />I believe we all have had some experience with those that we cannot see, even if we are not quick to admit it. In this work, Wanda Pratnicka offers you her answer to who these intruders from the spiritual side are,  exactly what they are doing, and what you can do about it.

All poets write from their hearts, expressing emotions often buried deep within their soul.

What a read!<br /><br />It isn't often that a book of poetry has the power to stir such intense emotions within me. Nor is it often that the words penned by another become seeded within my heart. But this was the case as I read the  words of this work and whispered within myself that surely love, hate, life, death, joy, sorrow, pain,laughter, all of these and more, touch each one of us on the journey that we call life.

In the beginning of this outstanding read we are confronted by a rescue of a young man stranded and half dead in the snow. Joe Devlin is on a journey, one driven by love for his wife Alice, who is suffering from tuberculosis.  Joe is a simple, honest man, but also a poor man, who is now faced with the cost of the 'cure' that Alice must receive at Lake Placid, New York, if he ever hopes to have her well again.<br /><br />We are taken along the journey of Alice and Joe and their struggle to  play the hand that life has dealt them.  Joe soon begins to do things he never thought he would, both in his work and in his personal life and Alice if faced with hard decisions of the heart. Neither life will ever be the same.<br /><br />The author does an exceptional job of bringing to life the immense hardships that patients and their families endured from tuberculosis during the 1920's. Her description of Lake Placid and the era bring you directly into the storyline as your heart merges with the well defined characters of her work. This is more than a story; it is a walk into part of America's past and the people who lived it. A story that shows love indeed has no end, nor obstacles that it cannot cross.

In this work, author Gail Gupton takes you on a 31-day walk through what she calls a Spiritual diet of Scriptures.  Each day emphasizing a  certain Scripture and it's meaning as she interprets it, also giving a page for your personal notes. At the end of the book she has a Glossary with a listing of Christian terms, such as  Blood of Jesus and Wine; in this Glossary she gives what she feels their meanings are, interesting.<br /><br />This work is well written, and I feel the author has a deep love for God and Jesus, but I cannot agree with her interpretations of the Scriptures in her work, so that did become a hindrance to my enjoyment of the book. Although I would lke to say,  I feel her commitment to what she believes is truly from her heart.<br /><br />On the back cover it is written, \\" This may not be a diet book for the die-hard, steadfast Christian follower,\\" and I believe I am in that category. Although I sense a  a strong desire to reach out and help others through her writings; I did not feel this book was beneficial to me.

George Konert is a widow; his entire life now is his garden and he is beginning to hate even that. Life itself is holding no meaning and his future holds no promise of happiness. George Konert is merely existing in a world of gray.<br /><br />George has children, but their lives do not include him.  He is lonely, discouraged and disillusioned with all life has to offer.  Something has to change and thank God, for George it did.<br /><br />In this read we are taken into the life of perhaps millions of Georges around the world. As their partners depart this earth; they are left alone in their latter years, faced with idleness, loneliness and  the prospect of a bitter end. For George this was not acceptable, what could he do to change that forecast?  Realizing that perhaps the idea of giving, that his wife had tried to impart in him years ago, just might have some merit; George sets out to give it a try. What did he have to lose?<br /><br />Having an abundance of cabbage in his garden, he loads up the old red wagon and goes house to house giving away his abundance.  In doing this small act of kindness an entire new existence opens up for George.  He finds a renewed zest for life as hearts open to his act of giving and George begins to receive the human contact he has longed for.  Is it possible that even at his age he is needed by others? George found out indeed he was in ways he never imagined possible.<br /><br />This is a work that shows we can change our circumstances by our actions, no matter what our age.  It shows the frustration of the elderly but also gives encouragement and hope to them for the future.  Many times life is what we make it; and this book shows we can make it better, not just for ourselves but for others.<br /><br />All of this moral learning is wrapped in a nice package.  The storyline is honest yet heartwarming.  The characters are well defined and bring forth the story in perfection, as we watch George bloom after being dormant for so long. A valuable message in a lovely story. Well worth your time.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Reviewe message in a lovely story.

I have read and reviewed countless self-help books during my reviewing career.  They all can pretty much be summed up in this; follow my directions and your life will change.  Most times, you are not going to follow their directions and the only change in your life has been the thirty somewhat dollars that you lost. And so it is.<br /><br />  However, there are times when the author is so enthusiastic about his concept that it oozes off the pages and you sit up alert thinking, maybe he has something here?<br /><br />You sense in the words screaming at you from the pages that this author truly has something that he has seen work, believes in,  and wants to share it with you.  Refreshing!<br /><br />That is what happens in this book by author Phil Keoghan, host of the Discovery Channel's \\"NOW.\\"<br /><br />  As with other books in this category, he gives you steps to take to reach the life goal that you have pushed aside for so long.  He shares stories of others that didn't think they could, but plunged ahead and found their victory.  He doesn't hide the fact that there will be obstacles to face and that perhaps there will be some failures, but his zest for life and his encouraging words make you think, perhaps I can! It's worth a shot at trying.  And he also gives you tips to help overcome the many obstacles that would keep you from your victory. Including many of his own victories.That is refreshing in a self-help book.<br /><br />  All of us have a hidden desire, an accomplishment that we long to achieve but perhaps have given up on ever having that goal met. This work will challenge you to rethink that goal, to look at the obstacles that have kept you from it, and perhaps give you enough courage to take the leap. Well worth your read and your consideration.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2004-12-03

Outstanding.<br /><br />Packed inside this exceptional book is much needed information for parents and teachers alike,  from a woman who has had 42 years teaching experience. How can that be interesting?  Believe me it is.<br /><br />  The author shares with the reader issues such as bullies in school, the decline of good manners, and what can be done about it, what to say to your children when there is a problem with a teacher and what not. The topics are numerous and insightful.  Author, Jacquie McTaggart uses wit and humor along with knowledge that only experience can bring. to give us the answers.<br /><br />  I truly believe this book would help any parent or teacher as they embark on the journey we call education of our youth, and give some useful insight to questions that have plagued parents and teachers from the beginning of the education process.<br /><br />Very highly recommended, a gem of a read.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2004-12-03

Our story begins by becoming familiar with a  Mr. Alex Cord, his wife and two daughters.  Mr. Cord is a manager of Govandit operations in Pakistan based in the city of Karachi. The author carefully introduces you to the character of this man and you find yourself respecting him and the way he lives his life and honors others.<br /><br />The author also brings you into the ways of the people there and how his family, servants and body guards interweave with them trying to live as normal a life as possible in a hostile foreign land.<br /><br />But something devastating is about to happen that will change everyone in this region and you, the reader, will become part of that whether you like it or not.<br /><br />  A terrible earthquake hits causing devastation beyond belief and toppling down the small protection Alex and his family had from the many enemies that surrounded them daily; those that would be happy to torture and kill all of them without batting an eye.  Deadly horrors that were kept at bay were now crashing down upon them and Alex was thrust into decisions that meant life or death for himself and his family. Decisions and actions that would haunt him the rest of his life and change his very destiny.<br /><br />  This book is one of those works that actually takes you into the heart of it, as the author pens his words in a way that are so gifted you merge with the complete<br /><br />hopelessness of the situation that surrounds you, desperate to find a way out for yourself and those you love. Just where would you draw the line? Who can answer that question? Knowing this could happen, only heightens the drama you feel as you turn each page.<br /><br />  I give this book my highest recommendation.  Adventure and drama so intense that you will walk away thinking of it days after the read, praying to God it never becomes a reality.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2004-11-23

I do however have two children who are actively pursuing a real estate career.  Nice timing for a review on the subject?  I think so.<br /><br />To my surprise I actually learned something.  Through reading this I found out that there certainly are a lot of hidden opportunities in real estate, especially in foreclosures.<br /><br />The authors write in a way that even novice like myself are able to understand.  They take topics like \\"10 Steps to Getting in the Game,\\" How to Profit from Foreclosures,\\" and \\"Why Should You Read This Book?\\" and pack each one full of useful information.<br /><br />They also explain about taxes and given an entire section to the different states and their laws.<br /><br />As I said, I don't know a lot about getting into the real estate business, but I'll tell you this.

Let me say right off that his work was totally different than any I have read in a long time. From the onset you are wondering what is happening as you are taken through the murder of a man and you are left with the question, why?<br /><br />As the story progresses you are introduced to a woman, what her true name is at this point is anyone's guess.  This lovely lady has a secret that could end the ills of all mankind but she knows if she revealed herself it would also mean the end of her life.<br /><br />Gibbs, another major player in this outstanding read, is a doctor who feels he has never reached his full potential in life.  Thrust into the world of our mystery lady the race is on to reveal the most exciting discovery the world has ever known, but first he must find this mystery lady and convince her that is the right thing to do.  Not an easy job; in doing so, he would be betting his very life on the outcome.<br /><br />I won't give away anymore of the storyline of this work, but I will tell you that this read will hold you glued to your seat from beginning to end.  Although it is packed full of mystery and well defined characters, it is also a novel that is laced with threads of moral issues and shows the greed and insanity of mankind. You are left wondering just who are the good guys in this world, and just how far will they go for their own gain? Shocking!<br /><br />I highly recommend this work. Definitely not the norm and that is a good thing.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2004-11-23

Taking his little sister home, the family begins a journey with James as they struggle to come to terms with a situation they cannot change.<br /><br />The author shares her thoughts and those of others in a personal journal that was kept during this emotional time. She shares the joys they had with their son, a tiny smile or watching him sleep, and shows the importance of every single moment we have with someone we love.  She also shares the heartbreak of his struggle to live, which became a losing battle.<br /><br />I congratulate this family for their courage in sharing with others their personal tragedy and their road to recovery during such a traumatic time in their lives. I believe this work will help other families who are going through such a crisis, giving them a drink of cool water in a dry and thirsty land. One day they will surely see their James again; I am so glad they hold onto that promise.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson	2004-11-22

I was excited and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The story starts out with our main characters, Gary and Clarissa, who play the parts of Mr. and Mrs. Spy, on  a discontinued TV series.  We find ourselves at a yearly convention with hundreds of die-hard fans that are hoping the series will be reinstated, and we find that Mrs. Spy would rather be anywhere else except at this convention and with her former co-star, Gary. Ah, but perhaps her feelings are going to change, as indeed her life is.<br /><br />We meet Harry,who has Gary and Clarissa under contract and also is living a double life.<br /><br />Harry is a mysterious man, with many hidden secrets, such as being a top spy. Thus, the storyline begins as the reader must help unravel exactly what these secrets are. Harry, murdered at the beginning of this work,causes Mr. and Mrs. Spy to be  thrust into a real life adventure as the \\"government\\" enlists their help in finding a chip that has the formula on it for a deadly gas. A chip that Harry has carefully hidden, and unfortunately all involved feel Clarissa unknowingly has the clue to where it is.<br /><br />As you can well imagine, many are after this priceless chip and will stop at nothing to find it. Gary and Clarissa are uncertain who they can trust, even wondering about the agents that are suppose to be protecting them. The confusion intensifies as they find out there is an informer within their own agency and they have no idea who it is. As they are forced to cling to each other, emotions that had laid dormant begin to surface and we are given a gentle whisk of love blooming.  However, the mystery and adventure is never far behind, as dead bodies are plentiful, suspense is never-ending and questions upon questions keep piling up with no answers. Just where did Harry hide that chip?<br /><br />\\"A Spy In The Hand,\\" is a well thought out piece of work.  Great character development, mystery interweaving romance, and chock full of questions that just when you think you have the answer, you find out you didn't.  I truly enjoyed this read and give it my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Reviewe Hand,\\" is a well thought out piece of work.

This work certainly may be aimed at children but I was totally absorbed in every page that I read, and excited to see how the story would unfold.<br /><br />Riley is going on a river expedition through the Amazon Rainforest while visiting his Uncle Max, who just happens to be a world-famous conservation biologist.<br /><br />Riley is excited, and with his cousin Alice, he sets out to help discover new plant and animal species. The adventure begins as the children stray too far from camp and use a very interesting tree to be rescued. Quite an amazing tree I might add.  Who would have thought a tree could do what this one did?<br /><br />During their adventure, the authors give insightful facts about the Rainforest.  Interweaving them within the storyline, children will learn without even realizing that is what they are doing, about the importance of the Rainforest to the earth and the unbelievable amount of plant and wildlife that live there.<br /><br />The illustrations are dramatic, colorful and realistic and will totally draw any young person along the story trail,and make them wish they too could be there to discover a new insect, plant or animal that the world has yet to know.<br /><br />This is an outstanding work, a beautiful book and a resource of great educational value.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson	2004-11-10

It was a good feeling to already be familiar with Kate, her boyfriend Cam, her assistant Graham and the delightful police detective Ken, whose main job seems to be protecting Kate from being murdered.<br /><br />Kate and Cam have just returned from a well deserved vacation after finding a body in the theater and solving the murder.  However, their bliss would be short lived as a long lost love from Kate's past will suddenly reappear in Kate's life. As fate would have it, a flood at the Calgary Arts Complex causes the world piano competition to be moved into Kate's theater, and with it comes Kate's long ago lover, his wife, his daughter and another adventure.<br /><br />Yes, we have another murder and this time it becomes quite personal for Kate, and more dangerous then she ever thought possible. Ah! The plot thickens.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the twists and turns that the author weaved into this mystery.  I really thought I had this figured out and was actually shocked at the ending being totally fooled at who the killer was; now that is a good mystery book.<br /><br />I loved  the way the author ended the work with a knock at the door and then not telling you who was there, but allowing you to know they shocked Cam, whoever it was.  That was just plain  unfair, now I have to know!  Who was it? And what mystery is this going to lead into?<br /><br />\\"Evening The Score\\" is a great work, one full of twist, turns, mystery, love, adventure and even some humor.  Don't miss this one readers.

However from the first chapter I was drawn into what this author had to say.<br /><br />Everyday Grace is a Spiritual writing, giving insight that the author has learned into the world of the supernatural. Now don't get turned off here, it is not spooky or in anyway connected with  the darkside,but rather a gentle guide back to our roots with our Heavenly Father.<br /><br />I loved the way Ms. Williamson explains how we have forgotten where we came from, and the resources we have within  to help us on our lives journey.  Excellent. I believe we all need a reminder of that.<br /><br />All in all I have to highly recommend this book.

I have found that no one ethical group has the patent on that hideous history. Slavery through time has taken many victims; black, white, yellow, young and old, it crosses all lines and has no limits. It is found in all countries, in mansions and in the ghetto's, for slavery is the disrespect for human life of all ages and colors.<br /><br />Although I feel we should never forget the crimes of our past, still at times writings only stir up the hatred for a new generation that had no control of their forefathers' affairs. It is a delicate line we must walk, keeping always in our memory the mistakes that were made, yet forging forward to uniting as human beings, praying that the lesson has been learned. That said; let us continue with our review of this book.<br /><br />Mingled Blood is an outstanding work. I was drawn into the story immediately and finished the book in several days, a feat which I rarely accomplish. It is the story of a young girl named Lena who is stolen from her country and her family and brought to America to do the bidding of a cruel taskmaster named Charles Dickenson. Alone and afraid, this young girl quickly learned what her purpose was to be, but she never lost her dignity or her spirit of survival. Birthing several children, whose father was her master, she instilled in them her fortitude of survival and the ever present hope of freedom.<br /><br />You travel with her as her life proceeds. You taste her sorrow, her despair, her fears and even her pride in her children and her roots.<br /><br />After her death you follow the lives of her sons as Master Dickenson transports them to another plantation. Unable to sell them, unable to look upon their faces, for in so doing he sees his own, this was his only recourse. You hold your breath in anticipation of what beholds these young men.<br /><br />The author does an outstanding job with her characters. She allows you to know their thoughts, understand their actions and visualize their dreams and frustrations. However, the author adds something different to the norm on books about slavery. She brings to light the love that Master Dickenson had for Lena, the forbidden love that he desperately tried to kill. You wonder how many times this has happened in history and you shake your head in sorrow.<br /><br />A wonderful novel, deep rooted in one of our country's saddest hours, this story that takes you from the masses to the heart of one little soul who was stripped of all life had to offer her. Heartbreaking and stirring! Well-done Ms. McGill! Excellent!<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Reviewr actions and visualize their dreams and frustrations.

The forming of such a complex story from start to completion could only be accomplished by a writer with an excellent grasp of the craft. It is evident throughout the story that the author has researched her subject matter and has incorporated details of character development, location and overall presentation with this research in mind. May I say, \\"Well done, Ms. Foster.\\"<br /><br />The story of forbidden love is set in the year 999. We meet Thorgunna Vagndottir, Lady Jar, mistress of the Isle of Tiree. A young, beautiful widow captured in the clutches of the evil self-named god, Loki, who lusts after her beauty and the power she possesses as the mistress of Tiree. He is determined to rule and reign over her and all her kingdom.<br /><br />We are introduced to Lerf, son of the ruler of Greenland who is shipwrecked on her island on his way to Norway, where he hopes to open the lines of trade between the two lands, and whom is destined to become one with Thorgunna.<br /><br />Thorgunna is gifted with what she calls 'The Second Sight.\\" The story whirls around her visions as she battles the evil villain, Loki, for control of her soul and her island. We watch her struggle against the love she cannot control for the beautiful Viking that hungers for her, yet must continue on his journey and the quest that is set before him. Little did he know he would hold the secret to Thorgunna's freedom.<br /><br />\\"Love's Second Sight\\" is brimming with supernatural events, demonic inspired turmoils and the search for the one thing that will end the terror and the evil plot of the self-made god, Loki. That can only be accomplished in the acceptance of the White Christ who has authority over all. Unfortunately, Thorgunna must battle her own fears, doubts and hatred that has been instilled in her from previous self-made demonic gods, before she would ever be able to trust in the true God, a God she cannot see. Her journey and that of Leif's causes one to wonder if theirs will always be a forbidden love. Wonder if she will ever open her eyes to the only God who truly can transform her life and still the storm within her. The answer to that you will have to find out yourself.<br /><br />The only drawback that I had with this work was the strong sexual content that fills the pages. If you are not comfortable with detailed sexual experiences then you will not want to read this work.<br /><br />Final analysis: Superb writing, top-notched storyline, heart-stopping conclusion, but for me the explicit sexual content definitely took away from an otherwise outstanding read.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book ReviewHer journey and that of Leif's causes one to wonder if theirs will always be a forbidden love.

Taking us back to before her birth, she shows how one family travels along a particular road and the effect it has on forthcoming generations.<br /><br />In this work the author shares stories that are deep in emotional ties, as the characters are revealed aand their hearts are laid bare before you.<br /><br />The stories brought forth many emotions in me.  Some made me smile, some made me angry, others brought tears to my eyes, but in each I was brought closer to understanding the journey that life carries us all on.<br /><br />The author goes beyond the past  and takes us yet on another  journey of making oneself into the person we know we can be, not the person others feel we are, or try to make us believe we are.<br /><br />I enjoyed this read.  I found it interesting and warmhearted.

I was excited to be reviewing such as work from a publisher that I know turns out the finest in mystery novels.<br /><br />Chesapeake Crimes is  compiled of short stories packed full of mystery, intrigue and suspense.  In this work, you get a delightful taste of numerous authors styles in writing, and perhaps a tad of their 'darker' side as they pen a carload of nail-biting tales, mystery with humor, and real to life characters that grab your attention from beginning to end. I loved the story, \\"The Butler Didn't Do It.\\"  I never saw that ending coming.  Great job!<br /><br />Everyone of the stories is unique, superb in the writers own flare, making each tale fresh and alive, satisfying that hunger for  different twists and turns that loom inside the reader.

I scanned this book at first wondering how interesting a read like this could possible be.  After all, someone writing about not having enough time to read books. Yawn!  However I was greatly surprised by what I found between the pages.<br /><br />The book starts out with Ms. Nelson sharing that she will be reading a book a week for one year. She shares with the reader her love of books and why, how she became an avid reader and just what reading has done for her.<br /><br />What I found to be quite intriguing was her concept that  the books we read chose us, we don't chose them.  Interesting  don't you think?  What does she mean by that? You'll have to read the book to find out. Have I wet your appetite yet for this work?  I hope so.<br /><br /> I can't really explain to you why this was such an interesting read, but somehow Ms. Nelson and her book tales seemed to keep me turning the pages and enjoying what I was reading. It was interesting and fun; also informative as I learned a great deal about many books just by the authors short descriptions of them.  I recommend this read.  I believe it has something to say to every reader out there.  Indeed we do have, so many books and so little time.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson	2004-10-24

I have read and reviewed countless books on sex and dating, but this one was new to me and quite interesting.<br /><br />The author, Leah Furman, approaches this topic for Jewish people.  Now that is something fresh and new. She talks to them about their fears of dating outside their faith and what may happen if a relationship becomes serious in that area.<br /><br />She openly discusses religious background and beliefs in connection with the dating game that we all play. She talks about family and their influence and even where you may find a nice Jewish guy.  Now there is a plus.<br /><br />In this work, you will find others that share their fears and also tell how they find remedies.  I am not Jewish, but reading this book helped me to understand their beliefs more and it would truly be an asset for any single person of that faith to read.<br /><br />Written in a fun but clear manner, the book can be referred to time and time again as the need arises. I believe all single Jewish people would definitely find this book to be a plus in their lives.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson	2004-10-16

This book will answer those questions for you.<br /><br />Chock full of adorable pictures of many different dogs, you'll find yourself smiling before you even read the first word. You won't be able to stifle the 'ah' coming out of your mouth or the urge to share one of these photos with someone else. Great visual aid to an informative read.<br /><br />The authors take a close look at the antics of our furry companions and explain in a fun way just what they are up to.

This book says yes, and I believe it's true.<br /><br />If you are an animal lover, or just want to have a real treat in a read, you will love this book.

You are aware that he has truly researched his findings, andhas a deep passion to warn the world of his findings.<br /><br />He gently takes the reader into the future and explains his perspective of what is about to take place on our planet and what you, the reader, can do to prepare yourself and your loved ones for these events.<br /><br />I found his writing and his research to be excellent, although in my own beliefs I did not totally agree with all that he offered in this work. I did however enjoy reading his perspective of the Scriptures and I was glad that there was another servant of the Lord sounding the alarm that time is indeed short for mankind.<br /><br />The work is well crafted and researched, the writing is easy to understand.  If you are interested in end-time events you may find some morsals in this work, but as always in books written on this subject, you the reader must make the final decision where earths future and your future is going.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review	2004-10-09

In the daylight hours of the roaring 4-day storm called Hurricane Frances, I had to find something to occupy my mind and quiet my spirit.  I found it in this delightful short story collection, Mistletoe Madness.<br /><br />If you think it strange that someone would consider reading a book through such a traumatic time, then you have never experienced the long hours that stretch never-ending before you with nothing to do but hear the howl of destruction.  This was a breath of quiet refreshing air.<br /><br />A collection of holiday short stories for children ages 7-12, this 384 page work is packed full of tales that will touch your heart, tickle your funny bone, boost your faith and bring inspiration to young and old . None alike, we have a myriad of subjects, from the mysterious and fanciful that can be found in The Stalking Snowman,(my favorite) and  The Great Christmas Tree Caper;  to the chuckle of  The Clauses Go Hollywood, and the heartwarming found in  Mrs. Whipple's Christmas and First Turkey. My  8 year old granddaughter and I shared several stories together to her delight. She asked me if I would give her the book when I was finished; I'll have to think about that one!<br /><br />Mistletoe Madness is a wonderful fresh idea in storytelling for children and adults to enjoy during the bustling holiday season, or anytime that you want to smile, sigh or just feel good all over. I can see nothing but praise coming forth for this wonderful collection; and I take my hat off to the many talented authors and illustrators who shared their gift with us in story, poetry and outstanding illustration. If a book can bring a smile during a hurricane, you have to know it's worth your time.<br /><br /> A wonderful read at a great price that will become a family treasure for years to come.

I suppose it is because I love the idea of helping street children and this is part of  what the storyline is all about.<br /><br />Maggie Madison and her friend Delta run a shelter for runaway and troubled children in the heart of Atlanta.<br /><br />Maggie has devoted her life to this work and is constantly badgering local business people for support money. Most are generous but one Adam \\"The Orge\\" Fuentes never seems to want to help without her constant nudging.  Needless to say their relationship is nothing more then strained.<br /><br />The true story begins when Adam's niece runs away and Adam finds he must seek out Maggie for help.  His greatest fear has indeed come upon him, but little did he realize that a spark would ignite between them and despite all the past harsh words and misunderstanding, they were destined to not only bring a child home, but bring their own hearts home as well.<br /><br />Madison's Miracles is a  story of love, family commitment and devotion to the well being of children. It is laced with deep seated emotions of past traumas that the characters must face up to in order to find their true happiness. A well crafted read that brings out the plight and cry for help of children, sprinkled with a tender love story of two hurting souls becoming one. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson	2004-09-11

Let me start off this review by saying once I started this book, I could not put it down.<br /><br />I have read and reviewed countless mysteries, filled with murder, gore and the likes, but never have I read a work quitelike this one, which brought forth the very essence of the killer, the torment that was deep within him, and the hideous actions that were birthed and unleashed upon humanity through his hands. Shocking!<br /><br />The author takes you into the mind of this serial killer, and despite the hatred and sickening feelings that flood your soul towards him, you are totally memorized at the workings of his mind. You know there is an evil that possess this inhuman man to give him the cunning skill that he uses to outsmart the authorities and capture his victims. You will not believe the way he outwits those that are relentlessly pursuing him.  Chilling!<br /><br />Mr. Tepper introduces you to each of this killer's victims allowing you to know them making the torture and killing of each one personal. Believe me you will feel their terror as this madman carries out his devious plan using them as ploys, while enjoying his demonic passion of torture, sexual perversion and finally murder.<br /><br />The conclusion is bittersweet and unsettling. Although the killer definitely gets his just reward, the twist at the ending leaves you wondering if this really is the end.<br /><br />I do not want to give the storyline away, however you are somehow aware that this evil has only been transferred and will live yet another day, to torture, torment and kill. The thought is mind-boggling.<br /><br />If you are looking for a work that will keep you glued to its pages; a work that will challenge your mind, leaving you thinking, could this happen?  Has this happened? If so,  this book is for you.  Bone chilling, thought provoking, a one of a kind read! Skillfully written in a way that you will never forget, even though you wish you could.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review<br /><br />Denise's PiecesSenior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review<br /><br />Denise's Pieces	2004-08-28

I was truly honored when asked to give my humble review on this work.  My heart ached as I picked up the book and gazed upon the cover picture of a family that continues on after being touched by hell itself.<br /><br />Cheryl McGuinness is the widow of Lt Commander Tom McGuinness, Co-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11. The pain of the memory of that day seared through my mind as I prepared myself for what words I may find written from this woman's heart.  I have to tell you from the onset that after reading her book, I have a deep love and respect for her.<br /><br />Mrs. McGuinness shares with the reader the events that happened on September 11th and all that followed, but she doesn't stop there.  Instead of dwelling on the deep grief and pain that she and her family suffered; she shares the sweet story of her life  with her husband before the tragedy hit and the victory she is determined to have now.<br /><br />In reading her words you find deep commitment to a loving God, deep commitment to a grieving family, deep commitment to a supportive nation and unfaltering faith in her God for a bright future, not only for her and her family, but for the country she loves.  That is a lot to come out of such a traumatic event.<br /><br />She unashamedly shares her  faith in God and tells how she clung to Him in each and every circumstance that she has had to deal with.  The author shares insights for the reader that may be hurting, to help them overcome their crisis and bring encouragement.<br /><br />I could never put into words in a short review what is inside this book.  I believe what impressed me more than anything  was the fact that the author does not just dwell on her loss, although you are well aware of the pain she has suffered, but understands everyday that someone, somewhere is experiencing pain and heartache; and because of that, she opens her heart to them, reaching out to help heal their sorrows.<br /><br />It is said, you cannot truly understand  pain unless you have felt it.  Mrs. McGuinness understands the pain and through her words sooths the soul.<br /><br />This book is more than a story of September 11th, it is a hand reaching out to those who hurt and saying, there is hope for tomorrow and we must never lose sight of that.<br /><br />A must read!  Thank you Mrs. McGuinness for your faith in God and in the future.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer<br /><br />Denise's Pieces<br /><br />MidWest Book Reviewain unless you have felt it.

Would it be words of advice that I could truly use, or just another book to place on my shelf.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised in my reading and what I found.<br /><br />The author gently leads you into stories of many people's  life experiences, their heart felt emotions, their deep seated fears, hopes, dreams and breaks down the why's of  their failures and even their success.  Interesting.<br /><br />  My favorite chapters were those on dreams and keeping a journal.<br /><br />I always knew that dreams, if not ignored could help us on our journey in life, and this work added new dimension to that idea. I loved it and found it very helpful.<br /><br />  As far as the chapter on keeping a journal, this was something I had been doing for quite sometime, but gradually stopped as I felt it was not helping me.  How wrong I was. In this chapter I learned how important and helpful it can be to keep track of your life and all that revolves around you.  In a way, it certainly helps to keep things in the proper perspective, and the author explains so many ways that doing this can be beneficial to you.<br /><br />  There is so much helpful information in this book that it would be impossible for me to detail here in this short review. However, this is one book you certainly will keep handy to read time and time again.  It is full of helpful thoughts, insights and information that will be a great aid for you in your journey through life.<br /><br />  The final thought that was left with me is this.  The blame or the pat on our back for our failures or our success does not  go to circumstances, location, upbringing, or any of the things we so quickly point our finger at.  It lies within ourselves.  Want to change your life?

The last time I flew was on an overseas flight from Germany to New York.  It was a terrible flight, as we experienced a severe storm over the Atlantic.  It was so bad, we were 4 hours late getting into Kennedy and they were so glad that we made it; we didn't even have to go through Customs.  That was the last time I flew. So, as you can imagine, I was interested in this work.<br /><br />I read with a smile the different stories of 'fearful flyers,' and to be honest with you, I could identify with their fears.  I was happy to read all the good reports of their overcoming.  The stories definitely gave encouragement that if they could do it, so could anyone else. And the insert to know the sights and sounds, which explained the trip from boarding to landing, was a real plus, and interesting to read.<br /><br />In listening to the CD, I loved the beginning song.  It was very soothing.  I cannot speak of how this CD will help one on a flight, as I have not had that experience.  However, I can imagine that if one were listening to this CD, they certainly would not be able to concentrate on being afraid; it demands your attention and for some reason you actually want to listen.  Strange but true.<br /><br />Now, here is the catch.  Not only, I'm sure, would this CD be an excellent help while in flight; I believe it is a wonderful CD for anyone battling any fear in life. The precepts that are flooding through the words spoken can be applied in any fearful experience that one maybe battling.  Perhaps the authors do not realize this, but I feel it is a truth and a plus.<br /><br />I enjoyed reviewing this work and give it a thumbs-up.  This definitely will be help for those who long to fly and cannot take that first step, and for any that are battling the powerful force of fear.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review<br /><br />Denise's Pieces	2004-08-21

To say that a marriage will not have speed-bumps, is like saying the earth will not birth a new day.  However, I myself know of very few women who have actually used their faith and knowledge of God's Word to plow through not just speed-bumps but a stone wall, as the author of this work did.<br /><br />Karen and Bill were in love from their youth.  They started their life together with all the usual hopes and dreams. Traveling through time,  they had their children, their financial security, and in the natural it would appear they would live out their lives together, but something was terribly wrong.  Soon Karen's world crashed down upon her, as Bill announced he was in love with someone else, and not just a stranger, but Karen's close friend! The trial of her faith was just beginning.<br /><br />I could go into much detail of the unfaithfulness of Bill and the challenges of Karen, but that is for you to read.  What I want to bring out in this review if that this book is one of deep faith and assurance in the power of actually living the Word of God in our lives.<br /><br />Karen had every right to turn from her husband and never look back.  However, when she made her vows before God they were sacred, and her love for Bill was steadfast.  In her work, she speaks frankly of her feelings, her hurts and her failures. She leads you through the Scriptures that the Lord gives to her to claim for her husbands deliverance and for her own.  As difficult as it was, she allowed God to change her so she could gently lead her wayward husband back to the Lord and his family.<br /><br />This is the story of a woman of great faith.  One that does not take lightly the promises of God, but strives to live the words that her faith is based on.  If you, or someone you know, is going through the heartbreak of betrayal, divorce, separation, pain and suffering, this books is for you.  And it certainly is a reminder to all of us who profess to be followers of Christ, that His Word is yes and Amen, if we only have the courage to walk what we talk. This is one woman who did!

The memories that made us smile, brought forth tears, increased our faith, and made us a family are so precious to us.<br /><br />However, the question always is there whether others will enjoy sharing what is so deep within our hearts.  It is a gamble, but one that I feel this family has won.<br /><br />As I read the different stories and adventures, the memories and the heart of these siblings, I was drawn into their world.  I found they openinly shared their emotions with stark honesty.  Whether it was fear, quiet trust in God, anger and hurt over broken relationships, heartbreak of death, or sweet fragerance of victory in life; they wrote words from the voice of their spirit to share, and I feel perhaps help another soul along the journey of life.<br /><br />If you want to read a work that has words from open hearts and deep convictions,this is the one for you.  You will smile, shed a few tears, and realize that no family is perfect, no life is without challenges,  but you will know that it is through these experiences that you become a family; sharing life is what a family is all about.

It will help them to understand that it isn't the package they see on the outside that makes a person, but the heart that is within.<br /><br />This is a beginning series, written in an attempt to bring awareness to children of the special needs of others, while showing them, they too just want to have friends.<br /><br />  Good idea with great potential; I wish them the best of luck with their future works.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /><br />Senior Reviewer<br /><br />MidWest Book Review<br /><br />Denise's Pieces	2004-07-31

How is that for a beginning to a read? What an ingenious idea; I loved it right away, and I was anxious to dig my teeth into this one.<br /><br /> Callous was murdered, and is now living in Limbo along with others who also were murdered, and must stay there long enough to get their questions answers. At that time they would either go to Heaven or Hell. Yikes! This was getting good; I read on; I had to know how the author was going to write a murder mystery with dead people being the main characters. Talk about a challenge.<br /><br /> In life, Callous was a PI and he was killed during an investigation where he was searching for a missing girl. He has been in Limbo for over 50 years and has opened a PI office, where he helps those who are there find out who killed them so that they can move on to wherever they are going. Creepy!<br /><br /> The story takes you to the house of his great-grandniece who is now in college and is doing a paper for her class. She has decided to investigate the murder of her great uncle and someone had to stop her, the truth could not be told. She is murdered and ends up in Limbo with her uncle. They team up with several other colorful characters that were murdered as well, to solve all of their mysteries. What a group.<br /><br /> I loved the character Callous. I enjoyed his wit and enjoyed watching him work through many of his own inward struggles. The moving between the living and the dead kept this reader on her toes and kept my interest high,<br /><br /> as the author weaved the story of several murders neatly throughout the read. Yes, this kept you guessing until the end, with all the normal questions of the who's what's and why's with each case.<br /><br /> To me this novel was like a breath of fresh air. It reminded me a little of the old movie &quot;Topper&quot;, and the idea of a dead PI doing investigations was so<br /><br /> intriguing that you just couldn't put the book down.

And would they be able to break the curse and return?<br /><br /> All those were enough in themselves to make an interesting read, but the author added a surprise curve to the read that I thought was great. Ryan becomes romantically involved with another woman while in the past and the reader is wondering if he will chose to remain there with her. Has Rebecca lost everything by trying to right a wrong? Could she ever forgive Ryan for betraying her love? Nice surprise twist.<br /><br /> Phantom Faces is a mixture of many elements that make-up a great read. Mystery, supernatural and romance all woven into one. Well done Ms. Amen, I believe you have a winner.<br /><br /> Shirley Johnson<br /><br /> Senior Reviewer	2004-07-29

Although I may not have agreed with every word written, so many of the words of wisdom within these pages brought peace and comfort to me.<br />  I read this book many, many years ago.  I quoted from it at times and thought of it often. The words seemed to wrap themselves around your heart and spring out in times of need. There are not many books that can stake that claim, and I have read many.<br />A classic in my opinion and a book that will never be outdated.<br />Recommended.	2004-07-05

Not a small job, as much responsibility is placed on her shoulder, but she loves it.  That is, she did until her and Cam, her boyfriend and maintenance worker at the Plex, found a dead body in the men's room.  Now things were becoming a nightmare in all areas of Kate's life.<br />  Detective Lincoln informs Kate that the deceased was killed with a nail gun from the Plex, as if that isn't bad enough, it had Cam's fingerprints all over it.  Was he guilty?  But wait, the shock isn't over yet for Kate, it seems the deceased is none other than the husband of an old acquaintance of hers, Gladys Reynolds.  Will this nightmare ever end for Kate?<br /><br />Things are not looking good for Cam and Kate decides that she would enlist the help of her head usher Graham and the others to prove Cam was innocent.  Bad move Kate!  It seems Gladys was quite the 'popular' lady among the men at the Plex.  Her ways caused men to leave their wife's only to be rejected by Gladys.  The list of potential killers was beyond belief, but why would they want to kill her husband?  Where would Kate start? And was Cam telling the truth about not having an affair at one time with Gladys?  The facts seemed to point the other way.<br /><br />Things begin to heat up as Kate pushes on with her investigation.<br />Attempts on her life become an almost everyday occurrence and her helper Graham is almost killed.<br />The torment that perhaps Cam was the killer tore at her heart, yet she couldn't be sure.<br /><br />Wow! What a story.  Murder, love, hate, adulterous affairs all spun together to create a who done it tale that will keep you guessing to the end.  Colorful characters spice up the read and a heart-thumping ending awaits the reader.<br />Well thought out storyline set in a not so run of the mill location, this book will keep you on our toes from start to finish.

Finally in Mr. Haggins wonderful book he addresses this problem and so many more that face women today.<br />So many women have been led to feel as if they were second class citizens in the spiritual realm.  That is not the case, but rather God deeply loves and respects women.  Rev. Haggin explains in simple terms what all the Scriptures concerning women taking roles of authority, fulfilling commissions and just plain being used in God's Kingdom really means. This book is a real eye opener and should be required reading for all women and men who are serious about obeying God and His Word.<br />Well worth your time.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-04

Being a student of the Word of God, I have always wondered just where was Jesus through those 'silent' years. The author asks you to read this work as fiction, yet to keep your mind open to the facts that are presented to you.  I was very impressed with what I read.<br /><br />It was evident that Mr. Parks definitely did intense research for his work. He found where Jesus had been placed in a school from the age of 12 to be prepared for his ministry.<br />He gives photo's of the now destroyed school he had attended. The visual aid really helped to bring the information to life. He included  maps and detailed information of the Essenes, whom he believed Jesus was with during this time,  and was taught their beliefs. Very interesting!<br /><br />Did I believe what I read?  I certainly didn't throw it out.  The information was very convincing, and I enjoyed reading about a group of Jews that I didn't even know existed.  Shame on me!<br />I enjoyed this work, it gave me something to think about, and although I don't feel we'll really know the answer for sure, of where Jesus was during those 'silent' years. until we are with Him, it was fun to say, 'maybe!'<br />Good work Mr. Parks.  Well researched, well written and very thought provoking.<br />Shirley Johnson/ Senior Reviewer	2004-06-30

Dovel.<br />The author shares with the reader two incidents where he came to the door of<br />eternity and returned to tell about it.  One happened when he was a young<br />boy, meeting and  enjoying the presence of a loving Savior.<br />The second was at his own hands, and what he experienced at that time was<br />much more detailed and not as pleasant.  I believe this had a great impact<br />on the rest of his life.<br />I have read many near death experience books, and have found the experiences<br />of what they see and feel can vary greatly, but I always find them<br />intriguing.  This work was no different.<br />I would have liked to have had a few more details in some areas,  but what<br />he gave was enough to keep my interest, and perhaps look forward to another<br />book.<br /> I did like the way the author encourages others to think about their life<br />on earth, giving some important points to follow and warnings to heed. He<br />also shares with the reader the change in his life since these happens,<br />which include visions, predictions and healings.  Interesting!<br />If you are curious about the afterlife you will enjoy this book.<br />All in all an interesting and enlighten read.<br />Shirley Johnson<br /> Senior Reviewer	2004-06-30

Soon  he becomes involved in conversation with a woman named Clara.<br />It seems George has been plagued with a nightmare for years and he believes that he has come back to try and solve the mystery of that nightmare.  He does not know at first that he is dead, as is his companion Clara.  Together they will solve the mystery of his nightmares and in doing find out that Clara is an important figure in them.<br /><br />Crossing The Meadow is a story of the dead, working their way to eternity, as they put to rest unfinished fears, turmoil's and bitterness that they harbored in life.<br />You see them walk side by side with humans, who are usually unaware of their presence.  Creepy!<br /><br />I loved the way the author worked all of his characters into the storyline, and I thought they were some of the most colorful ones I have had the pleasure of meeting in a long time.  Dead or alive! George's teacher and uncle were my favorites.  Great job!<br />This work was quite eerie, yet had some deep meaning.  Perhaps we need to make sure that we don't leave things unfinished for too long on this side.  We don't want to have to wait to 'cross the meadow.'<br /><br />Very good read!  Mystery with just the right touch of the supernatural.  I'll remember this story for a long time to come. Highly recommended.<br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer	2004-06-30

Joe has just become a Christian, new to benefits that a child of God has, Joe is very fortunate to have a special lady friend to help him.<br />  He's going to need it as a killer is on the loose, but this case is a little different than the rest, he is after Joe and all those that served with him in Vietnam.<br />At first Joe does not put the pieces together, but soon it is obvious that this madman is slowly killing these men, and he is forced to recall memories he would sooner forget.  The twist to this story is that somehow the killer knows each man's greatest fear and is managing to kill them in that way.  Be it electrocution, drowning, or other ways, that is how they were dying.  Creepy to say the least! You soon realize that this killer is pure evil and has the power of the devil on his side.  Only God will be able to save Joe and the woman that he was beginning to love.<br />  The author weaves in many Christian beliefs, but he does this in such a subtle way that the reader is not smothered by it, but accepts it as part of the storyline. His writing is outstanding, as he builds the mystery around the colorful characters from Joe's  past and present merging them into a top notch story.  Good job!<br />  A well thought out work, brimming with  layers of intrigue and heart pounding suspense. Magnificent conclusion that will leave you breathless.<br />Highly recommended.<br />Shirley Johnson	2004-06-13

Some of the stories were fascinating, some were of horror, but always in his eyes I could see a hundred stories that he would never tell.  These were buried deep in his spirit, happenings that could never be mentioned and would be tucked away forever in his heart and mind.<br /><br />Desperate Ground could very well be one of those stories, set during the Nazi regime it tells of a time when men and women, on both sides of the line, battled not only the effects of war, but their own haunting fears, desires and convictions.<br />The author introduces you to characters that you are sure lived through his excellent descriptive writing of their physical appearance and their inward workings. You become engrossed in their story, their motives and their very existence. The final climax of the story reveals what each was truly made of.<br />The ending may well stay with you forever.<br /><br />If you love World War II stories, mystery, and intrigue, this novel is for you. Well written, thought provoking, and real to life. A story you will remember for a long time to come.  Truly recommended!<br />Shirley Johnson<br />Senior Reviewer/MidWest Book Review	2004-06-03

You start the read with anticipation as you find Eryka in the middle of a crisis at work.<br /><br />I'm sure Eryka wished she was on vacation, visiting her friend, Lizzie instead of going into work that fateful day.  Her boss is missing, his secretary has resigned and the police are unwilling to see this as a problem, because the two were last seen together.  This causes the false assumption that perhaps Mr. Brokamp and his secretary decided to leave together; Eryka knew better but couldn't seem to convince others of that fact. No, she would have to be the one to find out what was going on and this choice would plunge her into great danger and adventure. To my delight the author brings into play another character from book one of her series; none other than Lizzie's husbands brother, Bradley.  Ah! Now we have some romance brewing within this mystery.  Bradley becomes Eryka's &quot;Knight In Shining Armor&quot; as they team up to solve the puzzle before them.<br /><br />&quot;Come To Me,&quot;  is a novel that is packed full of intrigue, mystery, adventure and sweet tender romance.  It is one that weaves in the message of the importance of one's faith in a God that watches over us, guides us and works all things together for our good. The author does a wonderful job of melting all the elements together making  for a read that will keep you on the fast track of mystery, yet allow you to pause and taste of tender love and reachable faith.

Lizzie is troubled with recurring dreams about the death of her father, some seventeen years ago. Could his death not have been an accident?  To top it off someone it trying to kill her fianc&eacute; and Lizzie fears the events are related but she is unsure how.<br />Struggling to make sense of all that is happening in her life, Lizzie finally realizes that she must turn to a higher and stronger power. To the joy of her already saved fianc&eacute;, Lizzie gives her life to Jesus, and learns how to also give him her worries and fears. Believe me, for what she is about to face she truly needs the Lord to be with her.<br />Author Paula Blevins does an outstanding job in  mixing romance, mystery, suspense and the saving grace of the Lord in her new novel &quot; The Way Home.&quot;<br />She slowly builds the mystery surrounding the death of Lizzie's father drawing you into the story. Anxiously you  read, hoping  to get a few more tidbits of information, as you wait for Lizzie to have another dream or vision of her frightening past. Just what did happen that day her father died so many years ago?  You had to know.<br />She also shows, through Lizzie,  the apprehension many feel towards accepting Jesus as their Savior and gently introduces His saving grace and the positive aspects of accepting Him as Lord of your life.<br />Ms. Blevins used wisdom in her portrayal of Ryan in showing that although he is a believer, trying to follow the Lord the best way he could, he still had problems that he had to overcome. Many feel that Christians are self-righteous but the author allows her character to be humble and believable.<br />His inward struggles and his faith that Lizzie would accept the Lord made the read very believable and the characters quite approachable.<br />The Way Home is a well thought out mystery, full of who? what? and why?,  that would satisfy the thirstiest mystery buff among us.

Being in the ministry for many years, &quot;The Aaronic Blessing&quot; is not only one that we have prayed over people time and time again, but one that we have put to song.  I was<br />interested in how she would present this material and what she would have to say about it.  I was not disappointed.<br /> The first aspect I liked was Ms. McKenzie beginning her work with words from her heart as she shared experiences of her youth and her family.  To me, this brought a warmth to the read and I felt comfortable in settling into it.  I have read countless books, written by countless religious teachers that were correct Biblically, filled with knowledge,  but lacked the personal touch that mankind so needs in these troubled times. The author<br />does a wonderful job through her writing in not talking down to the reader but encouraging them to continue on in anticipation that the knowledge they would obtain would truly be a blessing.<br /> The author breaks down the Aaronic Blessing, teaching on each aspect of it in detail. She ends her work with a short lesson on the Levitical Priesthood, how the prayer originated and the<br />symbolic message it has for us as Christians today.<br />I truly enjoyed how she explained the meaning of the word 'blessing' in Hebrew and I felt her knowledge of the subject matter was exceptional.<br /><br />&quot;The Aaronic Blessing&quot; is a book that will help you understand the love of God, the true meaning  and importance of His blessings and will lead you into receiving them in your own life.<br />Very highly recommended!<br /><br />&quot;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying, 'Speak unto<br /> Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye<br /> shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto<br /> them,  The LORD bless thee, and keep thee: The LORD<br /> make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto<br /> thee: The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee,<br /> and give thee peace.  . and I will bless<br /> them.&quot;Numbers 6:24, 25, 26, (KJV)<br /><br />Shirley Johnson<br /> Senior Reviewer<br /> MidWest Book Reviewace.  . and I will bless<BR> them.&quot;Numbers 6:24, 25, 26, (KJV)<BR> <BR>Shirley Johnson<BR> Senior Reviewer<BR> MidWest Book Review	2004-05-22

Slow at the start, this read picked up with such a pace I had to run to keep up.<br />The story's main characters are two women, Sara and Belinda, who have been friends since childhood.<br />Sara is adopted and at the onset of the story her adopted father has died, causing Sara to have a hunger to know who her true parents are. Little did she know that her father,an inventor,  was also looking for her. Attending a party  given by Belinda ,Sara is made very uncomfortable by a  drunken man who is  following her around. Upon leaving the party, Sara finds the drunken man dead on the staircase and when he is identified she learns, to her horror,  he is her father.  His untimely death only complicates  Sara  quest in her search for her identity and now she must find  answers to the mystery that is wrapped around the murder of her father.<br />Belinda is married to a wealthy doctor and has been overcome with an unknown  illness. Stricken in the prime of her life she battles a foe that is baffling countless doctors. Both women are thrown into a quest to solve a mystery; one the murder of her father, and discovering her heritage, the other,  the reason for her depilating sickness.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I have been so drawn into a storyline, but this book did it, keeping me up at night reading to find out the answers.<br />I had to know what was making Belinda so sick, and I had to know who killed Sara's father before she even had a chance to meet him . The suspects were never-ending and each character that you were introduced to seemed to be more guilty than the last.  Outstanding!<br /><br />Here is the good part, the author weaves the two mysteries together in a way you would not believe. You would think, just hearing the storyline, that having two separate mysteries going on  would only throw confusion into the story, but somehow the author took you back and forth in the read keeping your interest peaked to the highest on both counts.  Great job! That is the mark of a writer who knows their craft.<br /><br />I was relieved to finally know what had been attacking Belinda's body,<br />and the final outcome revealing the killer of Sara's father was so shocking, I am still surprised thinking about it.

I was used to stories of  pirates and pirate ships coming from these ladies and here I was faced with a totally different storyline.  How well would they do? I will say this,  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Set in 1728 we are introduced to Lady Christine Lockhart, the main character of our story,  a beautiful young woman who is looked down upon by all the social aristocrats of the day.<br />It is said that she is the daughter of a sea captain and only came into her title through the marriage of her mother to Lord Lockhart.  Certainly not blue blood, or was she? You are drawn into the very soul of this young woman wanting to know what is truly stirring up the hatred from others that surrounds her.<br /><br />You meet her family, her mother, her colorful cousins,  and Andrew Chandler, Duke of Kenilworth, the most eligible bachelor in the country and  who would one day be Christine's knight in shining amour. And of course we have Lady Marian Sanders, who is Andrew's mistress and  has every intention of being the Lady of Kenilworth. A woman whom you will see take revenge in seething rage and fury as her unrealistic dreams are destroyed by Andrew's marriage to Christine.<br /><br />The authors do a great job of building the characters and their relationships with one another.  They sprinkle slowly the hints of a mystery about to be explored in the read and they carefully build up the suspense, taking you step by step into the unfolding drama. Outstanding!<br /><br />Someone is trying to kill Christine, and Andrew  is determined to find out who and to protect the woman that he so deeply  loves. The story flashes  back to Christine's youth when she attended Lady Bellows School for Girls. A terrible secret is hidden behind those walls.  Happenings to young girls that take away their very souls and crush their spirits. Christine had tried desperately to put a stop to those ungodly events, but had her actions from the past caused the horror that now plagued her?  I'll tell you, I could not stop reading this work until I found out the answer and was shocked at the person who was trying to take the life of this woman.<br /><br />Sweet Christine is a historical romance, one that will fill every lover of that genre with satisfaction above and beyond what they have experienced in any other work. Desperate love,  heights of passion await the reader as they share the union of these two souls.  However, it is also a mystery lovers fantasy read, twisting and turning taking the reader on a roller coaster ride  trying to figure out the age old question, who done it?

That's what I found in my read of \\"No Time To Mourn.\\"<br /><br />Jim Wolf is our PI, living on a boat and having a pet python named Monty. Yes, you read that right; but before you wrinkle your nose let me say that old Monty  proves to be very instrumental in the solving of this case. A little off the beaten track for a character, don't you think?  Good job.<br />Wolf is thrust into a murder investigation by his ex-girlfriend and helper Lori.<br />He knew this investigation was going to be different from the moment he met Susan. Why was he relating to this woman whose husband had just been killed and who was being stalked by a man she called Red. Why did he think her past held the answers and what was it about her that made this whole thing different from other cases he had worked on? Wolf didn't know, but Red only made it more personal when he attempted to kill him right after his initial meeting with Susan.<br /><br />Unfortunately Susan is killed  not long into the story and we are introduced to several suspects such as her  colorful step children Junior and Edith, who certainly would have a lot to gain from the death of both Susan and her husband, but that answer seemed far to simple for Wolf to swallow.<br />The story twists and turns as we are taken down the road of corruption, lies and greed as other suspects are introduced into the story. Dark and seedy, these suspects add a good chill to the read causing Wolf to be more determined to dig deeper into this mystery.<br />No, there was more to this investigation than was meeting the eye  and Wolf enlists the help of a reporter named Constance who adds a little spice to the drama and  also conflicting emotions to our already confused PI.<br />The author opens the mind and emotions of Wolf to the reader.  Not only is he trying to solve a double murder but he is also dealing with commitment issues and personal life problems, this makes him real in your minds eye as you are included in his inward struggles as he tries to make sense of his own life and his personal relationships.<br /><br />No Time To Mourn is a mystery written with a flare from the past mixed with the present.  It is a story that shows how greed overshadows the preservation of life and it is a story that brings out inward emotions as we watch Wolf work through his own fears of personal involvements with those who love him.  If you want to read a good mystery with a slice of personal struggles with the main character, this one is for you.

Words that will seep deep into your subconscious and draw upon a hidden emotion?<br />Unlike a story with a plot, each poem written from the heart of a true poet is the expressions of their soul, the passion of their personal experiences in life written from the recesses of their inner being, and birthed with pen in hand.

We may try to dodge it, ignore it, bury it, but alas it still seems to creep into our everyday existence.  I have heard all the old additives that without pain we would not know we were hurt, of course I would rather just not know myself, but that is not the way of life.<br />In Ms. Altemus's book she tells her story of pain and shares how she turned that pain into a positive aspect in her life.  She also incorporates stories from such people as Goldie Hawn, Martin Sheen and many others.  They share tales of their pain and how it became a turning point in their lives.  Each one tells of the force that they clung to and how it helped them to overcome. Whether it be God, a person, an idea or a belief, and they share how they used this focal point to turn their pain into a positive.<br />If you are hurting, or have been hurt, and haven't we all;  you will find encouragement in the words of this book. The stories of those who have not given into the pain but have used it to transform their lives will help you to overcome your own pain and lead you to a path of healing.<br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer<br />MidWest Book Review<br />Denise's Pieces	2004-04-27

Ms. Marshall's book, &quot;Realizing Your God Given Talents&quot; may just give you those answers.<br /><br />The author explains how each of us are given certain expertise that we could excel in if we learn to utilize them. She carefully explains how to become aware and recognize those areas in your life and gives some great tips for you to use to developed them. Her examples are often heart-warming and I found them quite enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Her usage of Scripture is woven gently in and adds a reassuring substance to her words. And she tops it all off with a listing of resources at the end of her work, giving the reader easy access to institutions that they can investigate for possible use, in achieving their full potential in their God given talents.<br /><br />All in all a very useful read, encouraging and informative.

At the onset of the story Susanna is fired from her job and  decides to take up her Aunt Ora's invitation and visit with her for a while in Wyoming.  Her son Rusty is overjoyed and can't wait to begin the adventure, but Susanna is only looking forward to some quiet relaxing time.<br /><br />Aunt Ora is a believing woman, setting her hopes on the Lord for her everyday existence. Susanna loves and respects her aunt but does not share the devotion and commitment to the Lord that she does. However that would soon change. And you know, without being told, that Aunt Ora was inspired by a higher force to invite her niece to spend time with her. Realizing this, you are aware that God has a plan for this young woman's life and you await to see it unfold before you.<br /><br />On Aunt Ora's insistence Susanna and her son accompany her to church where Susanna meets and is befriended by Beth O'Connor.  She also meets Mark, a man she finds quite appealing despite Aunt Ora's disapproval of him, and is one of our colorful sinister characters in this work. The author did a good job using this character to show how the enemy  sends counterfeits along our path to sway us from God's ultimate purpose. But the Lord is at work in Susanna's  life and things are about to change as he turns her  to him.<br />Her conversion takes place when her son is missing and Susanna promises the Lord that she will change if he is returned safely to her.<br /><br />We are introduced to Zeke McCall, a rancher that is in need of a cook.  Aunt Ora thinks this would be the perfect opportunity for Susanna to pick up some extra funds and for Rusty to enjoy ranch life for a while.  Susanna is not so sure but agrees to at least meet the man and discuss the possibilities.  Their meeting does not go well and instead of making Susanna pick up and leave she decides to prove to this man that she can indeed take on the responsibility of cooking for the likes of him and his men.<br /><br />Zeke is a widower with a young daughter named Laura who has not spoken since the tragic death of her mother in a car accident.<br />This is where the true meat of the story begins as the author introduces you to colorful ranch hands that challenge Susanna to battle for her acceptance as one of them; you will smile at their playful antics towards Susanna, but you will also<br />cringe as the author has woven in some very distasteful characters that almost destroy Susanna's life. Good mix.<br /><br />The author takes you on a journey in this read of this woman Susanna, this man Zeke, both  struggling with their inner hurts and fears.  Both feeling the force that is drawing them together and both battling against the tide.  Susanna's faith is growing and Zeke has not yet accepted the Lord, this is not acceptable to Susanna who could never have a relationship with a man who does not have the Lord in his life.<br /><br />The story takes you through many trauma's, from a near rape of Susanna, the near loss of the ranch for Zeke,  to the desperate search for the children during a blinding blizzard, which leads to Zeke's acceptance of the Lord.  The author shows through each and everyone of these the saving grace of God.<br /><br />Safe Pasture is a work that takes the lives of two people and shows how God is able to intervene  to bring them to the place he wants them to be.  It is a work that is filled with raw emotions, tender love, nail biting suspense and deep inward faith all interwoven in a great storyline. One that will keep you reading, and will encourage  you in your walk as you see how the steadfastness of one believer can indeed move mountains and change lives forever.<br />Very highly recommended.<br />Shirley Johnson<br />Senior Reviewer<br />MidWest Book Reviewe likes of him and his men.<BR> <BR>Zeke is a widower with a young daughter named Laura who has not spoken since the tragic death of her mother in a car accident.<BR>This is where the true meat of the story begins as the author introduces you to colorful ranch hands that challenge Susanna to battle for her acceptance as one of them; you will smile at their playful antics towards Susanna, but you will also<BR>cringe as the author has woven in some very distasteful characters that almost destroy Susanna's life.

Reba and Shay, both harboring deep sorrow at the loss of their partners, whom God will tenderly bring together. Cole, a young man who also has tasted the sorrow that life can bring, and is battling deep feelings of guilt and resentment.<br />We go on to meet elderly sisters, Kathryn and Willa,  who have wasted years of their lives living in despair over the loss of their loved ones and a future that was not meant to be.  And of course we have our villain, beautiful Amber Conner who tragically was injured in an automobile accident and who is determined to make everyone pay for her misfortune.<br /><br />The plot thickens as we are taken to a small community called Cocodrie where Shay's friends live in a town full of the love of God.<br />Unfortunately someone is trying to disrupt the harmony of this peaceful existence with such occurrences as life threatening accidents. Shay's friend T-Jack and his dad have to protect their families. The problem was knowing who or what they had to protect them from.<br />Could it have anything to do with Amber and the fact that her grandmother, whom she hates,  lives and is part of this tight knit community?<br /><br />Seeking has taught some to trust in the Lord, while others continue in their destructive behavior, not knowing that the Lord is about to intervene and through some intense circumstances bring them to Him.<br /><br />We have all the elements of a good mystery in this read.  Greed, hatred, love, anger and revenge all twisted together as each character battles against the forces, both good and evil that are working in their lives. The author even sprinkles sprays of romance and hints of blissful holy union amongst the turmoil of her characters. She also manages to add slivers of humor, showing that amidst life's hardest times there are can still be smiles.<br /><br />This is a great read, showing the intervention of a God who loves us, yet giving the reader a big taste of mystery, romance and a chuckle along the way.<br />Good job Ms. Taliaferro!rces, both good and evil that are working in their lives.

As a Christian it is essential to be open and alert to the workings of the Lord through our brothers and sisters.  Our God uses each one of us ,through our gifting from Him, to prepare His church in these end-times. We need to be discerning for sure; but we also need to be open, least we forfeit a revelation that may be the stepping stone we have been waiting for. I believe this book has  many of those stepping stones.<br /><br />Paul Keith Davis, by yielding his life to the Master, has birthed a book that is essential<br />in helping Christians to achieve their mandate in the next move of God's Spirit and in their personal walk with Him. Outstanding!<br /><br />The author shares visions, dreams and revelations from the Lord and explains their meaning and usage for us as we march forward in His army.<br />He speaks of overcoming the Devourer, and emerging a Champion. He shares the revelation of being clothed with Christ and keeping our flesh in submission, pointing out the pitfalls that many of us must overcome to emerge a winner.  His writings are easy to understand, not Religious or condemning,  are backed with Scripture, and his desire to help his fellow Christians is paramount in each word that is written.<br /><br />The Thrones Of Our Soul is a book packed full of revelation and insightful information that can only increase your effectiveness as a child of God. I am very thankful that he shared his Gift from our Lord and look forward to other reads in the future.  Recommended!<br />Shirley Johnson/Reviewer	2004-03-03

Sheriff Joe Dalton has a problem, namely finding the murderer of his best friend Jack Hatfield, whose decapitated body was hung neatly over the landmark Superman statue in front of the courthouse.<br />Things like this don't happen in his town and certainly not to one of  his old schoolmates. This case was personal and if it took him his entire life he would find out who did it; the quest beings.<br />I have read a lot of murder mysteries, some have been grisly, some have kept me sitting on the edge of my seat, some have bored me to tears,  but this one was different.<br />The author weaves the storyline around in a way that you very quickly feel you are a member of Sheriff Dalton's town. He does this by bringing in personal aspects of different town members lives, their hopes, dreams, fears and shortcomings. They no longer are just story characters in your minds eye, but through the author's words they are alive.  The murder victim Jack, his sister and brother, the Mayor and even Dalton's wife become your neighbors and friends and you find yourself just as determined as the Sheriff is to find the culprit of this crime.<br />The only problem is that it is your very friends and neighbors who become the prime suspects as two more bodies turn up, a newborn baby and Big Ed, the town drunk and possible witness, who may have been able to shed some light on the crime.<br />How does the baby figure in all of this? You have to know.<br />Murder In Metropolis is not a fast paced read, but one that draws you into the lives of the suspects, allowing you to search them for motives and making you part of the crime investigation. I enjoyed that, it was a lot of fun trying to figure out, &quot;Who done it!&quot;  The motives for the murders and the ending I promise will surprise you.  Very well done. Who would have ever thought! A delightful reading  experience.<br />Final analysis:  A well thought out mystery drawing the reader into the very lives of the townspeople, the suspects and the victims themselves. Written in a way that allows you to participate in the investigation, but let me warn you, no matter how much you think you have it all figured out, the ending to this one will surprise you.

As I sat down to begin my read of Ms. Gerlach's sequel to &quot;Thorns In Eden&quot;, I sat in anticipation of the words before me, wondering how the author would be able to pen a work finer than the one before.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The author begins the story with our young heroine Rebecah finally standing on the soil where her beloved Nash is. Your heart leaps with joy as you want to jump into the pages of the book and hurry her along to his side; however the author does not allow our young lady to find her love that easily.  No, before she even reaches the small town, that Nash is in; she is confronted with cruel slave sellers, stories of horrid massacres, and is held by none other then Nash's enemy, Jean LaRoux. It is only through an act of God that her life is spared. What a scene! Excellent!  Again the author carefully weaves in the element of faith as young Rebecah meets the kindly Reverend Filmore who puts her into capable hands that will speed her towards her beloved Gently through her writing, the author lets us know that God is always near! Great beginning!<br /><br />Nash is also undergoing great stress, grieving for his beloved, whom he thinks he has lost forever, he is trying desperately to bring peace to the settlers and the Indians, knowing that soon a war with his own countrymen will be fought. Torn in many different directions, his heart yearns for the tenderness of a love he fears he will never have.<br />Finally, the author brings the two of them together, but it is not the blissful meeting this reader hoped it would be.  Instead the hurts that each bear surface and for a while the bitterness in their hearts keep them apart. How so in all our lives I fear!<br /><br />True to the Romanticist that the author surely must be, their love indeed is stronger than the scars they bear, as Rebecah and Nash kindle their love for each other and unit in marriage.  Oh my heart melted!<br /><br />This was not the end of the story however, they still had many hurtles to cross, and as with all of Ms. Gerlach's work, she saves the best for last. She builds on the characters personality and love for each other and mankind, their strong faith and trust in God and each other, using orphaned children, black slaves, and the final test when the evil Jean LaRoux  and his group of renegade Indians, burns down their home and kidnaps Rebecah and two other women.  My heart sank! What a story!<br /><br />The author brings in different elements to her work, such as a deep love between an Indian and a white woman, gossiping townspeople, friendship that goes beyond the love of a brother and deep commitment to God. She threads these in a way that only a crafted craftsman could do, constantly giving her work a refreshing, like frequent rain showers on a hot blistering day!  Bravo!<br /><br />I wept with joy and I wept with sorrow as I read this work.  The way the words were penned I felt as if I were there, facing the problems, battling the enemies, feeling their pain and sharing their love, strength and faith! Truly, Ms. Gerlach is a painter, painting words with her writing that wrap around your heart and whisper through your spirit; words of a story of love, life and courage that only God can give! A story you will carry within you forever!<br />Shirley Johnson/Senior Reviewer<br />MidWest Book Reviewey still had many hurtles to cross, and as with all of Ms. Gerlach's work, she saves the best for last.

Never have I read it explained in such detail, nor understood the importance of each move that God planned for the Church.He writes in an easy to understand manner, not condescending but clear and pointed, leaving you with the knowledge of knowing the why's of God's movements and their importance for mankind's destiny.<br />I have to admit that I must shift my thinking some and get it in line with what the Lord is about to do; however this is of course what the work is about isn't it? Helping the Body of Christ to know where we have been, where we are and where we are going! This is an outstanding study book; it would be wise to keep it handy to help explain to others where we are on God's timetable. It also is a great witnessing tool to generate excitement for those whom you are trying to reach for the Lord. Share with them the future and show them what part they can play in the drama of God on earth.<br />Very highly recommended reading for all Christians and a real wake-up call to our destiny.

Many are born only to be tortured by cruel 'human beans' and never are allowed to experience the love they long for. Touching to the very core of your soul!<br />The story is told in a way that is eye opening to the plight of these helpless animals and with the help of the magnificent photos that fill each page you not only hear the heart cry for help, that is often ignored, but are able to see pictures of the little life's that has been given a new beginning, one filled with love and not hate! The lucky ones!<br />As Princess Fiona tells her tale you learn what CASR is all about, you understand their work and their purpose and just how important they are.<br />The story tells you how they work with these cats to help them emotionally adjust and live in harmony where they are adopted.  One of my favorite parts of the story was Wuffy, a beautiful dog who nurtures kittens that have been abused and tries to bring them comfort.  After seeing and reading about Wuffy no one could possibly believe that animals do not have deep feelings.<br />I learned a lot from this little book, Princess Fiona did a fine job in her writing, of course a Princess would you know!<br />She not only told the heartbreaking story that is so common for so many animals, but she explained in detail the work of CASR and she did it in such a way that you wanted to rally around Princess Fiona, join paws with her and the workers of CASR and make a difference.<br />  You really need to buy this book.  It's a wonderful well-told true story, beautiful photos of adorable felines on each page are a plus, and you are contributing to a great cause.<br />Nice job Princess Fiona!  I look forward to book two!<br />CASR is the California Siamese Rescue; it is a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote the welfare of Siamese and mixed Siamese cats by finding them loving homes and responsible owners.<br />Please take time to check out their website!

I love this book and keep it on my desk at all times.  I am very interested in dreams and feel strongly that the Lord talks to us during the night so this book was a must for me to have.<br />The author lists countless meanings of symbols and words in his writing, such as seeing an animal in your dream and what that animal stands for.  He also gives an explanation of dreams, how to interpret them, what the Bible has to say about dreams and how you can understand yours.<br />I found this book to be so interesting I could not put it down and now those that know I have the book come to me to ask what something meant in a dream they had.<br />Humm....perhaps they need to buy their own book, don't you think?<br />Great read! Informative! Well worth your time.	2003-09-26

The author<br />takes time to explain what the Jezeleb spirit is and how it works to destroy Christians and churches.  It isn't a woman against man thing, it's evil against good.  The spirit is one of control and destruction. I felt the writing was Biblically sound and the examples were excellent.  A good learning tool for all Christians serious about their walk with God!	2003-09-26

I know Mr. Hagin now dwells with Mr. Kenyon in the presence of the Lord, but thank God that both have left us with some wonderful teaching books on our use and authority in the Name of Jesus.<br />Mr. Hagin clearly explains how important it is for believers to correctly use Jesus Name as they go about their Christian walk.<br />I found this book easy tounderstand, Biblically sound and very useful.

The Priestly Bride by Anna Rountree unfolded the deep tender love that Jesus has for His bride in a way that I have never seen before.  As the author shares her experiences with the Lord you are touched with His deep love, compassion and deep emotions for his soon to be bride.  Written in a way that all can relate to, this author helps those seeking the true knowledge of the love of Christ for them and their love for Him. My heart flooded with love when she spoke of the Father singing, giving all of creation sound that they may sing back to Him. Do you want to know what love is all about?

That is how I felt about &quot;Noble Savage&quot;.  Now don't misunderstand me, as far as I am concerned Liz Moore is one of the finest writers I have had the pleasure to review their work in  quite a while. Her work touched a nerve within me, it was different, deep, sinister and perhaps too real to life.<br /><br />The story is about one man who decides that he is the best choice to rule the world.  All those who accept this &quot;Prophet&quot; are given a shot to protect them against the impending doom of death that will take place, all those who do not are warned that they will not live to see another day. Few believe his ravings, but on that fateful day a good percentage of the world meet their final destination, eternity.<br /><br />I was drawn into the lives of the characters that Ms. Moore penned through her description of their personalities, families, beliefs.  I hated them and I loved them, feared some and cheered for some. Their deep feelings of despair and longing for a life and loved ones that were long gone seeped within me as I actually felt their emotions. What a ride this read was!<br />What was to happen to the human race as this madman continued to rule with no limits<br />set on his insane plans.  Some chose to end his reign of terror and set out to plan his destruction, but I wondered was it too late?<br /><br />This was a great book from a great writer, however it left me disturbed and unsettled.<br />Perhaps because it could happen? I don't know!  Would I recommend it?  Yes I would, but be prepared for something that will stir inside of you and leave you with a prayer that we will never have to face such a fate!<br />Good job Ms. Moore! Any book that can rile up such emotions has to be a winner!<br />Shirley Johnson<br />Senior Reviewer<br />MidWest Book Reviews<br />Denise's Pieces	2003-09-22

How does one begin to review a book such as this?  We all have been touched in one way or another by the loss of someone we have loved and was dear to us.<br />When I received this book for review I ravished it from cover to cover, however it has taken me several weeks to begin to write for you what I have found within it's covers.<br />The author takes a look at sixty-two near-death experiences and shares them with the reader.  They range in topics from God, Heaven, Hell, Reincarnation and Suicide, to name a few.<br />What did I feel as I read these experiences.<br />Oh dear reader, such a mixture of emotions that it is hard for me to express them to you.<br />Joy, sadness, fear and hope are just a few that raced through my being as I devoured this work.<br />Are these true?  Did our brethren of this human race truly see into the next world?<br />What awaits each one of us as we walk through that portal?<br />Does it really matter what faith we are or how good or bad we are in this life?<br />That is for you to decide! I believe I already know that answer!<br />To me this book was one that only affirmed my belief in a far better world than I am in now.  I smile with anticipation at the thought of seeing my Savior and my loved ones on the day of my departure from this earth.<br />Death is something we will all face.  You can't buy your way out of it or talk your way out of it.  This book, in my opinion will help to ease your fears and may just make you a little jealous of those who have already made this wonderful journey. Highly recommended!	2003-08-23

A MUST READ- SAYS MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW	Thorns in Eden is perhaps one of the most outstanding books I have read in quite a while. Set in 1773 in Fredericktowne Md and England, this novel takes you into the intimate world of the people trying to birth a free Nation, under God.You become one with their struggles and the very essence of their lives is etched in your heart forever!<br />The main characters are brought to life by the author to thepoint that you feel a deep kinship to each one. Rebecah Brent, the daughter of a slain British Officer is thrust into the arms of her less than appealing uncle, Samuel Brent, who is given charge of her life. Rebecah is a young woman that is determined to taste liberty, not only in government but as a woman.<br />We have the uncle, Samuel, who harbors a deep resentment for his now deceased brother, the mystery of why has not yet been unfolded, although you are given several hints. His loving wife Kathryn, submitted to a harsh hurting man; his children, young Hugh, a lively wonderful boy who seeks out the love and attention of Rebecah. The two woman cousins, Lavinia and Dorian, who are as different as day and night. Dorian being quite stuck on herself and her beauty, does not like the idea of the attractive cousin coming to live, and sweet Lavinia immediately befriends Rebecah and a deep relationship is seared between the two. None of them realize how important each one will be to the other in this drama of their lives.<br />The author brings into light the one trying to win Rebecha's heart, and the one whom has been chosen for her, rich Cecil Lanley. I, like Rebecha, did not like this self-centered man and cheered when she refused his attention. However, she is reminded that a woman has no say so on whom she will marry. Rebecah had other ideas, good for her! My favorite characters were the kindly Nash family, Lady Margaret, Sir Rodney and their son the young patriot John Nash, who was trying to make his life in the colonies. Nash was a patriot, and was against the control that the British had on his new land, this was a death wish for him and his family, one that becomes the main focal point of this entire story.Through only the hand of a higher power, Nash and Rebecah find each other, but the battle is on, not just for the liberty of a new land, but for the liberty of a new love.<br />It isn't very often that you read a book where the author is able to blend the deep faith of the characters into the story without being preachy or religious. Rita has done just that, in a way that lets you understand all the decisions that they make, throughout this wonderful read, are based on their commitment to a Higher power that is leading their destiny.Only the hand of an exceptional writer could pen the words in this way, bringing to life the true heart of the people who gave their lives for our liberty. Oh how this story twists and turns as the life of each player surfaces and merges with the others, like a muted sunset at the close of day.<br />Battles, emotional, physical and spiritual rage throughout the confines of these pages. Deep conflicts of the soul and spirit are wrestled within each character as they bring to life a novel that will draw you into the making of a nation, through the shed tears of the past. As I read the final pages my heart broke, not just for what was behind, but for what lies ahead for the characters I had grown to love. If you only read one book this year, I recommend Thorns in Eden, a story of love, a story of faith, a story of freedom, a voice from our past, a prayer for our future!

What is the limit of anguish that will finally destroy the life flow within us? Cerise and Beck , the main characters of Laurel Johnson' novel, The Alley Of Wishes, could answer these questions for you. Meeting in the glamorous city of Paris, France, Cerise and Beck were two wounded souls that fate, or perhaps a God who loves us, brought together. Beck, a farm boy from Kansas, had come to France to fight for the idea of liberty, not knowing the stark truths of war and death would sear his soul with scars so deep that surely he could never be free. Cerise, caught in the throes of an affair with a sadistic man, struggles to maintain life with a crushed and broken spirit, never allowing herself the thought that any man, other then the cruel heartless Paul, would want her.<br />The Alley Of Wishes is a story of tragedy and defeat, heartache and deep sorrow, but one that shows how love, reaching deep inside our being, can result in a meaningful life of happiness. Cerise and Beck share their past sorrows and struggle to overcome unsurpassing obstacles that life bestows on them as their spirits become one.The loss of a child, the loss of one's mind, are only two of the many battles that they must overcome.<br />I have read and reviewed many a novel, but never have the characters stayed within my heart as Cerise and Beck have. A love affair that will draw you into its very essence awaits you in this outstanding read. War, lust, murder, love, hate and forgiveness all play a part in The Alley Of Wishes. This is a story you will not soon forget.	2003-08-01

As a Counselor I was anxious to see what this book was all about and it was worth my time to read it.<br />  The author works with children who display atypical behaviors due to neurological dysfunction and she has developed what she called \\"The Matrix Model\\" method in dealing with these children, that certainly seems to be producing results.<br />  The four elements of this model are: Attachment Disorder, Dyslexia, Multiple Intelligences and The Felenkrais Method.<br />I will not even try to explain these to you as I could never do them justice, but I will tell you that the author gives case after care of their use and shows the wonderful progress with children that they bring.<br />  As a lover of children my heart went out to these young ones as I read of their trauma, but I rejoiced also at the help that Dorothy Halla-Poe and her wonderful work is doing for them.<br />  If you have b children with these problems, know someone who does, or if you are just interested in help for children, this book is for you. My prayer is that many, many children will be helped with this strategy and can have a better quality of life.	2003-07-23

This at first horrifies Denise but something inside of her draws her back to the doctor to find out the truth.<br />  Under hypnosis, Denise goes back to her past life as a young woman named Olivia who is married to an abusive husband. This is where the story truly blossoms.<br />Olivia falls in love with her coach driver Wilson, who is a black man.<br />  They are drawn to each other by their deep desire to be free, one from the abuse of racism and one from the abuse of a cruel husband.  Unfortunately their love causes both of their deaths.  I found myself not able to put this book down until I completed the read.<br />  Although I am not a believer in reincarnation, to me this was a story of deep love that spanned the fringes of time. The author does an excellent job in drawing you into the very life's of her characters as their world unfolds before your eyes.<br />  I recommend this read, a real page turner with a very happy ending!	2003-07-22

I was excited when I received this book to review, actually, I asked the author for a copy which is something I rarely do.<br />If any of you have been following my reviews you know I am a Christian and an animal lover.<br />This year has been a tough one for me personally, as I have lost 5 dogs and to me<br />this was  like losing family members.<br />I needed to read this book and I was not disappointed.<br />  Is God truly interested in animals and what happens to them for eternity?  The author has the answer  to this question for you, with countless Scripture references, showing our loving Creator does indeed care about all of His creation, even your beloved Fideo.Thank God!<br />  As an Ordained Minister of the Gospel I have always known that animals would be a part of eternity but never took the time to research the Scriptures on this subject as author Niki Shanahan has.  I tip my hat to her for doing an outstanding job in bringing to light the truth of eternity for all living things.<br />  If your heart is broken because you have lost your beloved pet, this book will bring you peace.  If you question where animals go when they die, this book will quiet your mind and bring a smile to your lips. A book that can be read with the heart and with the intellect, this is a must read for all that love animals and for those who have stepped  so low as to be cruel to God's creation.  After reading this book you may just change your actions, I hope so.<br />  Highly recommended reading, top of the line research. Excellent, Outstanding and Life changing! Good job Ms. Shanahan! Thank you	2003-07-22

That to me is a good read.  Let me give you a little background.  Mark and Randall are traveling back home, Mark is soon to be wed and he longs to be with his beloved. Randall and Mark are growing tired of each other, they are very anxious to end their travels, but that is not going to happen anytime soon.<br /> The adventure starts when Randall is hungry and pulls into a beaten down rest stop restaurant, with some rather seedy clientele.<br />  As Randall is about to get out of the car to grab a bite to eat<br />they notice a cowboy making his way hastily out followed by a rather large man and the two began to confront each other.<br />Were they about to witness a double murder? Were their very lives in danger? Happily the fight ended and Randall and Mark decide to travel on down the highway away from the troubled area, or so they thought.<br />  After going a short distance they are surprised to be confronted by a man , named Harley, who had entered the back of their trailer and had TNT strapped to him, demanding they do everything he says. This is where the fun begins as Randall, Mark and Moon, a young man they picked up along the way, try to figure out exactly what Harley wants from them before he blows them into eternity.<br />  Mishaps and adventure await you as you read the antics of these men and find out exactly what their invader Harley is really up to and why.  You wonder if they will ever reach home alive but will have a few chuckles at the adventures these boys go through on their way.<br />  To me this was a very enjoyable read and I recommend it.	2003-07-22

I only hope I can do it justice.<br /><br />It is the  heartbreaking story of a girl who at first is called &quot;Forsaken.&quot;<br />Forsaken is an abused, cast off girl, the garbage of mankind, no longer useful to anyone she has been discarded on Potter's Field, the town's garbage dump. Her spirit crushed as a child, her body and mind used and manipulated as a young woman, Forsaken is the symbol of so many others that this life has written off as expendable.<br /><br />You find you are feeling many emotions as you read the thoughts of Forsaken, the writer touches a chord within you.<br />She is a broken vessel, battling the forces within and around her that whisper death would be sweet and beckon Forsaken to plunge into the depths of hell, where there is no return.<br />Wondering around Potter's Field ,with other vessels perhaps even more pitiful than herself, the war begins for the eternal home of this forgotten soul of mankind.<br /><br />The author does an outstanding job of allowing you to feel the heart cry of Forsaken, know her thoughts, her pain, her agony. You breathe a sigh of relief as you read of the Master Potter's pull on Forsaken to come to Him, and you silently pray that she will have the strength to reach out to that call.<br /> Her Angel stands near wanting to do more than he is allowed to, awaiting her final decision for her eternal destiny, as demonic forces throw their fiery darts at her in hopes that she will curse God and die.<br />As the story goes, Forsaken does follow Master Potters voice and He lovingly takes her to His home and begins to mend her broken spirit, changing her name to Beloved.<br />Wonderful!<br /><br />I really am not sure how to explain this to you, but never have I identified with a character in any other novel that I have read, as I did with Beloved.<br /> By the time I was at the end of the novel, I had become that girl. I was Beloved, it was my life that Master Potter was carefully sculpturing for His service; it was my life that the enemies of the cross were scheming to destroy. Although some of the circumstances that would have brought me to the point where Beloved was may have been different, it was still the road that I was traveling. The author weaves her words in such a way that I feel everyone would identify with Beloved and the pain that life can inflict on each one of us,for they too have tasted the blood on the battlefields that they have experienced in their journey we call life.<br /><br />As Beloved continues on , she encounters satanic forces that are battling to take her away from Master Potter, who is of course the Lord, and  their job is to destroy her forever.<br />With each battle she fought, I fought it with her.  With each tear she shed, I shed it with her and with each tender kiss of the Master, I soared in her ecstasy of His love for her and for me.<br /><br />This book is the story of every Christians life, their battles, their victories their walk with God.  We are on a journey, pilgrims walking through the land, completing our mission and this book tells that story; in a way that will touch your very soul as you relate to each saga that is being played before you.<br /><br />I sighed when I realized I had to wait to read book two before I could continue the story of Beloved, but somehow I think I know how it comes out.  At least I hope I do, because it could well be my story too.<br /><br />Highly recommended read for every Christian and for those that want to know just what we are all about.<br /><br />Shirley Johnsonl that I have read, as I did with Beloved.<BR> By the time I was at the end of the novel, I had become that girl.

This is such a book. The story is of a young Israelite girl named Achsah, who is the only daughter of a high leader of the tribe of Judah, Caleb.We are told at the beginning of the story some of the traditions of the Jewish people, such as the Father always chooses a husband for his daughter, this does not set well with young Achsah.<br />  Achsah is a strong willed girl, not wanting to be told whom she will spend the rest of her life with, as is the custom.  The author takes you into the heart of young Achsah as she battles with her emotions of loyalty to her father, her God and the traditions of their faith. Will she be able to submit to these traditions and still find the happiness she believes belongs to her? You become entwined in her mind as she comes to terms with her destiny. It is a tender story, carefully written with respect for the history it is based on, yet full of adventure and drama. A taste of the past flavored with emotions felt in the present, very good mix.<br />  Unveiling during the conquest of Canaan, the work allows  you to experience the victories and defeats of these chosen people, taste a little of their rebellion and understand a great deal of their faith, as young Achsah blooms into a woman and takes her place in the land of promise.<br />A very good read! Thumbs up on this one!	2003-07-05

It is a tale that soon we will be living.  Perhaps not exactly as it is portrayed by the writing, but the basic idea will be in full bloom.<br /><br />The book is good against evil, the rise of the<br />Anti-Christ, coming to rule the world in all his<br />ungodly fame and glory.  The code has been found in the Bible, a code that can be used for good or for evil, the race is on.<br /><br />I believe that Christians will enjoy this read and it might just get a few non-believers to dig a little bit in the Word of God to see what is about to take place in this old world of ours.<br />Recommended!	2003-06-28

I have heard a lot of sermons on its existence, but nothing had prepared me for what I was about to read between the covers of this book &quot;A Divine Revelation of Hell.&quot;<br /><br />The author, over a period of forty days, is given visions of hell and the people who are trapped there for eternity. I cannot begin to tell you the horrors that she saw and reported, but if you really want to know what is there, this is the book for you.<br /><br />However, I will warn you, she is faithful to reporting exactly what she has seen and if I were you, I would prepare myself before I opened the pages of this book ,because if what she is saying is true, and I believe it is,<br />than we all must reevaluate our very existence and motives in this life before it is too late.<br /><br />A very good read that I hope will reach many so they will turn to Jesus and never have to be trapped in this place we call Hell.	2003-06-25

I was not disappointed; this book held my attention from beginning to end.<br /><br /> \\"Lawman to Outlaw\\" is the story of Verne Miller, a known underworld figure,  perhaps one  whose life  was filled with more mystery than any other. Mr. Miller was responsible for the slaughter that took place at the parking lot of Kansas City's Union Station, June 17,1933.  Did you know that the FBI was actually formed because of this event and the outcry of the American people against crime.  Interesting piece of information, I would say.<br /><br />The author takes you through the life of Verne Miller; his childhood, his military days, his days as a well respected Sheriff and draws you  into the mystery behind this man and his faithful companion Vi Mathis.  What made a law abiding respected man turn into a cold blooded killer? Mr. Smith addresses this question and more.<br />I cannot even imagine the intense research that went into this work. Detailed information is revealed, events are replayed as the author walks you through the life of this notorious gangster and finally his death at the hands of his so called friends.  Quite a story, quite a read!<br /><br />Well done Mr. Smith, hats off to you! A recommended read for all those that are interested in our colorful past and those that painted it red!	2003-06-24

These are but a few words, that I can use to describe Ms. Fish's book, Everything You Need To Know About Being A Woman Can Be Learned in the Garden.<br />Her usage of the comparison between natures creatures and humans is exceptional. Not only did I truly see it, but learned a considerable amount about our friends. I will not look at them the same.<br />Ms Fish uses humor to bring across many important issues facing women today. Each and every story, as told by the women of the book, sparked within me a deep emotion. I laughed with them, I cried with them, I became one with their anger, as their words took on the visions of situations women must face. Some had victory, some had defeat, but through this, Ms. Fish's book, produces a joining of the spirit of women everywhere.<br />Cindy will forever be grafted in my mind. I think we all have a Cindy in our lives. I saw my Cindy's face, as I read Ms. Fish's Cindy's words, and chuckled. She was the delight of the book, as her personality flashed at you from the pages. It was with great anticipation that I waited to see what Cindy was going to say or do at the next discussion session. Her final act at the end of the book, was not something I was prepared for.<br />If there is any down side to this book, it would be that the read was over too quickly. I look forward to another book in the future with more wisdom from my garden sisters, and especially from Cindy.<br />This is a must read for all women, and men if you dare!	2003-06-06

Are you blaming circumstances, others or fate for<br />your situation in life?  Well, perhaps you better turn that finger inward and  point at yourself.<br />  If you are a Bible believer, than the words in Proverbs 18:21 should make you stand up and take notice.  \\"Death an life are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.\\" In other words, your own words are planting in the ground your future.  Scary isn't it?<br />  I don't suppose we like the ball to be put in our court when it has been so easy to blame everything else on our 'rotten luck', bad situations, and unfulfilled dreams.<br />After reading this book, we now have a new saying in my house and a new word maybe you would want to apply it as well and change your life forever.<br />\\"Just what are those little 'lippers' saying?\\"<br />If I can have what I say, I say I have only good things from now on.

Talk about scary!<br />He speaks of his early walk with the Lord and begins to share with the reader many visions and visitations he has had with Jesus Himself.  Sound fishy? Not on your life!<br />I can only tell you this.  Through the years I have studies under teachings of Pastor Hagin and know of His knowledge of God's Word and his relationship with Jesus. The man would never disrespect the Lord by telling something that never occurred.<br />If you are interested in the supernatural, you need to turn to this book for a healthy dose.<br />You will learn much about the Lord and His Word and how to apply it to your life.  I loved this book! It was great!	2003-05-31

Why do most of us pray?  Because we are in a situation that we can't get out of and we need help.  The problem is, we pray and say we believe an answer will come, but we still worry and make negative confessions concerning it.  Mr. Capps explains in a simple biblical way how this negates the very prayer we prayed.  Interesting!<br />He teaches you the authority you have as a believer, how to train your body to pray and<br />learning to use your words for good and not for evil.<br />I really liked this book.  I felt it was written in a clear concise way, simple to understand and to follow.  I believe it would be a plus for any Christian wanting to go higher in their prayer life.	2003-05-31

Some are of angels, while others are of figures or shapes that are not quite identifiable.<br />The photographer Stephen Brigidi was intrigued by these pictures and enlisted the help of noted poet Robert Bly to add words to his photos, thus &quot;Angels of Pompeii&quot; was born.<br />I enjoyed seeing the ancient images and reading the words that Mr. Bly wrote to accompany each one.

I don't know if it is because I could relate to what the author was saying, since I am Italian, or if it was the way he wrote, but this book is a gem.<br />The author gives you first hand information on how to survive dealing with an Italian family. During meals, on trips, and yes even at a funeral.  Hey, I have been to many Italian funerals, you just don't know what you are missing until you have attended one.<br />His comparison between an Italian family and a non-Italian family is a riot!<br />I loved &quot;The Italian Mother's Early Morning Worry List.&quot;  Yes, that is because I myself<br />have worried about the same things that are on the list. Great!<br />The cartoons add just the right amount of visual aid to enhance the pure joy of this read.  Fantastic!

Could this be true?  There had to be a catch and I was going to find it, or so I thought.<br />Dr Perricone reveals his theory that aging is caused by inflammation at the cellular level and is speeded along with our life styles, such as poor nutrition, pollution and stress, to name a few.<br />He explains how we can change our dietary habits, take in the proper vitamins, exercise<br />correctly and totally rejuvenate our body.<br />This was worth reading.<br />He shares with you case studies, shows you before and after pictures, gives you names of vitamins and tells you what they are good for and what the symptoms are if you are lacking these.  He even shows you how to exercise properly, all bringing you to a new and healthier body. Very good!<br />The only problem I had with the entire regiment was the diet.  I do not like fish, cannot eat it, and that is one of the main<br />staples in his food chain.  I need an alternative Dr. Perricone, any suggestions?<br />If that stronghold is overcome I would gladly give his system a whirl.  I believe he is really on to something and I'd like to give it a try.<br />All in all this was a great read, informative<br />from page one on.  I highly recommend this book, I believe it will help many people live a happier and healthier life.<br />One final thought, if you were to receive this book as a gift for Mother's Day as I did, just what would your reaction be?<br />Was my child trying to tell me I was turning into an old hag and this book might help?;or,was he truly concerned for my future and my health?  Perhaps I will never know that answer, but one thing is for sure, I did enjoy the knowledge this book gave to me, and for that I say, &quot;Thank you!&quot;	2003-05-29

He explains that in drawing closer to God, you will be exposing your own heart and the motives therein, something some of us may not be ready to see.<br /><br />He speaks of repentance, faking Christianity, overcoming idols and shaking free from the many things that have us in bondage.  My favorite part of this great book was Chapter 15, \\"Holiness Is A Tree Ripe With Fruit.\\"  Here the author makes you face your very existence as a Christian by the words of the Bible, \\"The tree is known by its fruit.\\"  Talk about cutting to the quick. Just how much fruit are we bearing, or are we afraid to know?<br /><br />This is a book that will make you search your heart and study your walk with God. Just how much are you willing to put on the cross and how much of His likeness are  you willing to become?

Now that caught my attention, could it be so, I wanted to know and I wanted to know where this stronghold of protection was. I was interested!<br /><br />Francis Frangipane takes you out of pretense into reality at the onset of this work; explaining our walk to Horeb, where we are allowed to be real with God and our feelings about what is happening to us. We breath a sigh of relief knowing we can release our frustrations and fears and we breath in a breath of hope as the author assures us that God has a place of safety from all we are experiencing.<br /><br />The author takes you on a journey, using men of old from the Bible as examples to bring you out of the many negative emotions that are trying to cripple you  and leads you to a knowledge of knowing how to run under the shelter of God's stronghold of protection during trials and tribulations that life brings upon us all.<br /><br />I would do this book an injustice to try and review the countless helps Mr. Frangipane gives the reader to obtain this desired result, but believe me he<br />definitely gives you all the information you need to run into God's Stronghold.<br /><br />If you are a Christian that is feeling overwhelmed by the world that we are living in; if you are seeking the promises of a God who loves you,and the protection His Word speaks of, then this book is for you.<br /><br />We all need a safe harbor, and for those that are His, there is no safer place than the Stronghold of God.

In these end-times it is vital to know who and what you are fighting and what weapons you need to win the wars.  In this outstanding book, &quot;The Three Battlegrounds&quot; you learn exactly that and more.<br /><br />What are the battlegrounds that Christians must face?  The author breaks them into three distinct groups, the mind, the church, and the heavenly places.<br /><br />He gives you needed insight into overcoming battles that are raging around you and against you.  He shows the importance of your thoughts and the very words that you speak, bringing revelation that is life changing.<br /><br />This book, in my opinion, should be on every Christian's nightstand.

Her description of the characters brings them to life before your eyes and at times you are routing for them to win, even though they could only be described as monsters. It takes a very good writer to achieve this goal.<br />I will not [fool] you, this is not a short read, and it is one you will want to have time to truly devour. To try and tell you the storyline would never bring justice to this work. Trust me, if you like the unusual mixed with mystery and seared with love, this is the novel for you. Good read!

That was his dream and he would make it happen. When his son's wife decides she has had enough of her husbands affairs and bowing to his controlling father, she announces her intentions to divorce her husband.  This could not happen at a worse time, as public<br />opinion would turn against William Randolph Pritchett IV and he would never win the election.<br /><br />Father Pritchett was not about to let this happen and devises a plan using the kidnapping of Lilly's young son as a controlling devise, to make Lilly bring his plan to fruitation.  The plan was dark and evil and would involve Kidnapping and killing the Senators wife in hopes of swaying public opinion and win the election.<br /><br /> Lilly only killed to rid the world of evil, never had he killed the innocent; would he begin now,  to save his son? The pressure was on!<br /><br />There are many twists and turns to this chilling novel. I breathed a sigh of relief when Lilly's son was rescued, only to moan when his wife took his place as the captured. Who was betraying Lilly and why?  Emotions covering father-son relationships, friends, husband and wife<br />are all dealt with as you ride along the journey of this story.  It held my interest from beginning to end.

I was engrossed with the story of Manny, I believe that was my favorite part. Mr. Malensek words allowed me feel  Manny's tribulations. His fears and concerns, very good!<br />My husband and father-in-law asked me to please let them read this work after I was finished. They are both prior military, and I am sure will devour the words of this book in no time. I still have not decided if I will let them. (smile)<br /><br />I believe for a man, or a woman, who is in military service, this read would be like a delicious piece of their favorite cake; however, a harder read for those not interested in this arena.  I do however feel, if others would take the time to read this work, they would understand fuller the heart of man, the horror of war.<br />Perhaps the cover page says it all!<br /><br />I take my hat off to Mr. Malensek for the intense labor that surely had to go into completing this work, and highly recommend this for any that are interested in the deep recesses of military conflict, and<br />are wanting to share in the heart of a soldier. Mr. Malensek's skill as a writer is evident  in &quot;The X-Mas War&quot; as he weaves his words on the paper,as an artist would paint their picture on a canvas!<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Reviewer	2003-05-06

I would have never thought I could get caught up in the excitement of \\"landing the big one!\\" In this young adult book by Graham Salisbury, that is exactly what happened. Graham's description of events drew me into the drama of the moment, and I could almost feel the<br />salt air misting on me.  Excellent!<br /><br />Lord Of The Deep is a great action and adventure story, but it is more than that as well.<br /><br />Mikey is growing up and on an outing with his father Bill, who charters his fishing boat, Mikey tastes young love ,stirring new emotions and feelings inside of him. Already struggling with new feelings, Bill makes a decision that goes against the rules after the catch of a 'big ' one,  Mikey does not approve of Bill's decision and is troubled over it. He learns not all things in life are black and white.Not all decisions are made on what is correct.<br /><br />Perhaps some readers will feel that this story should have had a different ending then the one it did.  However, I believe the author wanted to show that what we feel are right decisions are not always made by the ones that we think the highest of.<br />Growing up is not easy and pretending that adults will always practice what they preach<br />is often a fairy-tale, as hard as we might try; decisions may be based on reasons unknown to others. Right or wrong!<br /><br />I liked Lord of The Deep.  It was a fast pace, quick read.  Kept my attention from beginning to end,and that is what a good book is all about!<br /><br />I recommend it.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Reviewer	2003-05-05

It makes my skin crawl to think about it.<br />Prince of The Wind begins with the young Prince being rescued by the Zonelanders from a year long captivity on an enemy ship. Riain Cree was only 16 years old and had not tasted manhood yet when the young Prince contacted Labyrinthian fever and had to be nursed back to health by Prince Gunter DeViennes' daughter Suzanna, who was still unmarried and untouched at the age of 29.<br />Suzanna became infatuated with the young Prince and drugged him, causing his body to become inflamed with desire for her. After their act of intimacy, Suzanna claimed the young Prince as her own. Unfortunately for her, his mother and father had other ideas for him and whisked him away back to his homeland. Even in this fictitious tale, my heart went out to Riain's mother, who would stop at nothing to save her youngest son. But her attempts were in vain!<br />Suzanna was insane and cursed the young Prince and all those he loved or would love. Selling her soul to a demon, she involved the powers of darkness to weave her web and claim him as her own. However, a sorceress named Maeve had fallen in love with the young prince and swore to save his life and be with him forever. Will her powers be strong enough or will Riain be lost forever in the dark Abyss?<br />The story weaves in and out with fragments of the paranormal, mysticism, time travel, witches, werewolves, vampires, and romance. Prince of The Wind is a tale of obsessive lust and undying love. What force will win?<br />A good read, especially for those who like a tale that makes the hair stand up on the back of their necks. This one may just give you a few nightmares!	2003-04-18

How they felt being labeled a Geek, Freak, Jock, just to name a few. Quite an eye opener!<br /><br />She breaks her book down into three parts:<br />\\"What's in a Label?\\", \\"How Labels Make People Feel.\\", and \\"What You Can Do About Labeling.\\"  In each  section she tells others experiences, asks the reader questions and<br />interacts with you, the reader. Very good job at making one think about what they are reading!<br /><br />I not only recommend this for teens, but feel adults would benefit from this read, as well. After all, do we stop labeling because we turn 21? I think not!<br /><br />A book that will make you know that you are more than a label, and why.

Battles with other pirates, mutiny and near death for our beloved main characters fill the pages.<br /><br />Captain Black main quest throughout this work is to find his true love Mala, who has been kidnapped by the notorious British Captain Alexander.  More evil than any pirate could be, you only wish for this man to have many life's so he can have them ended time and time again.

I don't think he would have enjoyed the spice and vinegar he would have found she was made of.<br /><br />You will cringe when Aubrey's uncle Jonathan Hacker comes on the scene and does all in his power to take control of Aubrey and bring to an end the life she has learned to love.

The books main character Flora Darby, is a spoiled rich girl. Raised under the protective arm of her father, she is kept from life itself. Her father I feel, had both her and her brothers best interest at heart, he just failed in the way he showed it. Keeping both Flora and her brother Bill sheltered from the real world, left them hungry for the normal activities of life and frustration took it's evil bite. Bill escapes his prison, seeking happiness with a woman that his father does not approve of, leaving Flora more frustrated and alone. Bill himself, never finds the happiness and fulfillment he longs for.<br />Flora discovers her father's secret 'smut' reading . Since Flora is now becoming of age, her feelings are stirred reading and viewing this material. The guidance of a loving Mother is not there for Flora, as her Mother was killed many years before. She has no one to turn to, to discuss the burning desires she is feeling. Her lust is kindled as she consumes the readings of her father. Because of this, a murder takes place in their home and brings about the arrival of another young woman. You find yourself glad that Flora finally has someone to talk to, however, this only leads to more perversion and lust. Eventually Flora leaves her prison, as did her brother. Their futures do not have happy endings and left this reader disturbed.<br />I think Mr. Rehak did a fine job at showing how lust and perversion can totally destroy a persons life and also the lives of those around them . I do feel however, that he did not need to be as graphic with his descriptions with some of the sex acts that he has in his book. I felt as if I was reading an X-rated smut magazine, and it left me uncomfortable. He could have let the reader know what was going on, without such personal details. It certainly took away from the book in my opinion. Greed, lust, murder, incest, all play a part in this novel. All of these things lead to destruction, and this is the way for Flora Darby and all those that she touched, including the one person who truly loved her, John., incest, all play a part in this novel. All of these things lead to destruction, and this is the way for Flora Darby and all those that she touched, including the one person who truly loved her, John.	2003-03-29

Inspired when her son Alex had to be hospitalized for open-heart surgery, the author saw the trauma on her other son, Joey, and realized there was a need not being addressed in this area.Her work has met this need with flying colors.<br /><br />Of course when a child must undergo an operation, we all zero in our attention and affection on them, and we should.  However, without meaning to, we often forget the other children in the family and do not realize the emotional conflicts that they are encountering. This book will open your eyes to their feelings.<br /><br />Ms. Jaworski does a wonderful job in \\"My Brother Needs An Operation\\" in showing, with honest words and  colorful illustrations, what will happen during this time.<br /><br />She establishes the family relationship, the different activities they share and the bonding between siblings.She speaks of the fear that the sibling feels when he hears his brother will be in the hospital and she begins to deal with that fear in many constructive ways.  She takes you into the mind of the child, what he is thinking and feeling.  Excellent!<br /><br />Ms. Jaworski includes in the back of the book a Hospital Diary and Activity Pages.<br />This is great.  She has pages for the child to fill in his name, feelings, draw pictures and play games.<br /><br />I can not even imagine the heartache a parent feels when their child must undergo an operation, but I will tell you this.  If you are experiencing this trauma,and you have other children in your home, this book is a must for you.<br />It is one of the most outstanding books, touching the emotions of a hurting child, that I have read in a very long time.

You'll find<br />  out what they are about in this enlightening read.  I found myself<br />  saying, \\"Ah, so that is why they do that! Now I understand.\\"<br />  Outstanding information, and  written in such a fun way! The author<br />  also includes a few tid-bits that will make you wonder, such as, the<br />  information given of the theory that the Native North American's<br />  ancestry is traced to a supposed Israelite migration of the Lost<br />  Tribe. Quite intriguing! Could it be so? Certainly gave me something<br />  to ponder, I like that!<br />  I also enjoyed learning some of the Yiddish language, and I liked the<br />  listing in the back of the book.I told my grandchildren that I was<br />  their Bubbie. They didn't really say much, but then again, I think<br />  they may call me many names behind my back; they'll just add this one<br />  to their list!  \\"Oy Veh!\\" Now, if I hear a word, say in a movie, I can<br />  look it up and know what they are talking about!  Great idea!<br />  All in all, this was both an educational and a fun read.

You will in this story, and Captain Mala is someone you will grow to love and respect, along with the love of her life Captain Rene Black.<br />The story begins with your introduction to Aubrey Malone, a young Irish women who was rescued from sure death, when the Widow Maker, ship of Captain Black, was sunk to the bottom of the sea. Protecting her and rooming with her, is the irresistable first mate, Morgan Alcott. Captain Mala's right hand and friend, or is he? I feel in love with this man, who had the integraity of a Saint as far as Aubrey was concerned and immediately despised quartermaster Deats.<br />Deats had rescued Captain Mala from an Island where Rene Black had left her while he attended other 'pirate' business. Unbeknown to him, Mala was pregnant with their child. During her stay on the island a British ship docked, Captain of which was John Samuel Alexander. Captain Alexander went from island to island, raping, killing and taking anything he wanted from the Island people, leaving no one left alive to tell the tale.<br />Mala gave birth to her son Buccus on that island while her beloved Rene was away. Mala had waited a long time for his return and felt that he had deserted her, but this was not the truth. During her stay on the island Captain Alexander landed and while Mala was on another part of the island he killed everyone there, including her baby. Mala's life was destroyed at that moment and she vowed she would have revenge on every British sailor and also on Rene Black for the death of her child. This is the condition that Deats found her in. He lusted after this beautiful women and wanted her for his own, but deep within her heart she still loved Rene Black. When the Widow Maker was sunk Mala though Rene had died with it, but he had not.<br />As the story goes Mala finds Rene alive and in prison ready to be hung. During his time there he also encounters Captain Alexander who taunts at Captain Black. During a moment of anger Captain Black speaks of his beloved Mala, her beauty and her spice. This intrigues the evil Captain Alexander, who from that moment swears to have her as his own. After rescuing Captain Black, Mala turns away from him, but he longs for her. Boarding her ship, he overtakes her and her men and a new adventure begins for all aboard. Unfortunately, not all of Captain Black's men respect Mala and her crew as he does. Especially the unsavory Beautfort, who longed for Aubrey while she was on the Widow Maker and is determined to have his way with her now, but Aubrey's heart belongs to another.<br />You will cheer when you read what becomes of this nasty man.<br />At first Mala dislikes Aubrey because she bears the mark RB on her chest, which Captain Black branded all the women that were his. Aubrey however, was branded by him for a very different purpose; and through the many adventures that the two women face together, there becomes a bond between them.<br />Murder, deceit, lust, revenge are all part of this great adventure. My heart yearned for Mala to tell Rene of the life and death of their tiny son, but as of this book she does not. It ends with the disappearance of Mala, being kidnapped by the horrid Captain Alexander and the plot of Captain Black and the men to get her back.<br />I have left out so many wonderful twists and turns of this book, but it would take me writing a book just to give it the review it deserves. For now I will say this, do not miss reading this trilogy. Excellent is the word I would like to leave with you.<br />I can't wait for the next book, it is sure to be a winner.ill say this, do not miss reading this trilogy.

Jamie is reluctant as she is<br />strongly against killing in any form, but her life is about to change.<br />After graduation, they both received orders to attend ABM training at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida.  Their final assignment would be with Joint STARS at Robins AFB. There they would be onboard aircrafts<br />helping to find targets and fixing any problems that might arise.<br /><br />Jamie was a natural using the radar.  She could predict the enemy's air-to-air tactics and tell the fighters what they needed to do, but Jamie still could not settle the issue of killing in any form in her heart.<br /><br />It was at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia that Drew and Jamie met Captain Lee or better known as \\"Weed.\\"  To me, this is where the story truly begins.  Weeds takes Drew under his wing and although his training is controversial he is one of the finest.<br /><br />This part of the story was very good as you learn about \\"Weeds\\" and read intently as he teaches Drew more then he would learn from a text-book. Jamie also profited by his unique training, and a bond is<br />formed between the three.<br />There is so much activity now in this work that it is impossible for me to give you a good overview, but I'll tell you, you will not be bored!<br /><br />The story moves on and you find the crew onboard a plane helping our men in North Korea.<br />We have, of course, Weeds, Jamie and Drew, our main players in this novel.<br />We then come to dear sweet Alpha Hotel, as the crew liked to call him.  Aircraft Commander of the plane that Drew, Jamie, Weeds and the rest were<br />now in, flying over North Korea, where they should have never been.<br /><br />Weeds insisted that they quickly leave the area but Alpha Hotel, in his arrogant way would not allow it.<br />He would not admit that his errors had brought the plane into enemy territory.<br />A struggle incurs onboard the plane and Weeds is knocked out by a lucky punch from Alpha Hotel.<br /><br />The plane crashes in enemy territory and only a handful survive, including Jamie, Drew, Weeds and Alpha Hotel.  This is where the story gets really intense as they are captured by the North Koreans and are tortured and some are killed.<br />My adrenalin was flowing and I couldn't read fast enough to see what was going to happen. I wanted to jump into the pages and stop the pain and suffering I was reading!  How intense is that?<br /><br />Mr. Jones does an excellent job of making you one with his characters, letting you feel their emotions<br />in this see-saw read of adventure.<br />You will cringe at the torment the young women go through at the hands of the evil North Koreans, and your heart will break at the death of some of the characters. Can people be so cruel and is it indeed a foreshadow of things to come and things pasted? I shudder at the thought!<br /><br />I will tell you this, it has a surprised ending, but not before it twists and turns and takes you on a ride of your life! I loved it!<br />Highly recommended!

Damian Shtup is a gay man who does not hold back on his opinions of all those who come in contact with him. Growing up with parents who decide to ignore his alternative sexual preference, Damian strikes out on his own, making his way through different situations, he finally goes to Beauty School, meets his future employees, Muff, Rosemary, and Girl From Canada, and decides to open a beauty establishment which caters mainly to New York's Mafia wives.<br />Mr. Schreibman uses a great deal of satire in this novel, in the development of his character Damian Shtup. Do you love him or hate him? I'm still not sure! The novel twists this way and that way as Mr. Shtup becomes a target of a stalker following the accidental death of Mrs. Marinara, a Mafia wife, in his shop. A shrunken horse's head on the end of a comb to spewing blood from Damian's hairsprays become the beginning of a mysterious adventure for Damian.<br />Many other facets are interwoven in this story. The discontentenment of parents over their child's choice of a gay lifestyle, Damians own insecurities as he seeks counseling from Dr. Scrotum, who by the way is not all you think he is. Officer Tiernan, who has a hidden agenda in his life besides protecting the good people of New York, and Damians social connection with Officer Edgar Ramirez. Let us not forget his association with Marjorie Higganbotham from General Foods Information Hot Line, nor his three employees who somehow keep Damian within normal limits. Each one of these characters is played upon by the author giving the reader a chuckle along the way. None are what Society would call normal, but each somehow fits into Damians lifestyle.<br />Damian goes through many situations as he and Officer Ramirez try to solve the mystery of his stalker. Why would someone want to stalk Damian Shtup and who could it be? Their identity will surprise you, believe me!<br />I believe if there is a downside to this novel, it would be dishonor given to Catholic Priests and I do feel that this book could be offensive to those of the Christian faith. I would not recommend it for Christians to read. However, Mr. Schreibman is a talented writer and Blood In My Hairspray is well written, humorous, and mysterious at the same time. Not all books are for all people, for some it would be a great read of satire and mystery. For others it would be offensive. That choice is up to you!there is a downside to this novel, it would be dishonor given to Catholic Priests and I do feel that this book could be offensive to those of the Christian faith.

Colee. I read and reviewed The Enchantress and greatly enjoyed the novel. The Widow Maker gave added insight to the characters that I had become so involved with in trilogy two. Reading firsthand of the horrible life that Aubrey was living with her Uncle help me to understand her better. The thought of being with the men that her Uncle wanted her to marry actually made my skin crawl. No wonder she ran away and booked passage on the Gull to go to Africa. I would have run too! Unfortunately the ship was taken over by the notorious pirate Rene Black and Aubrey found herself thrust into the world of Rene and his pirates on his ship, The Widow Maker. Aubrey was marked as his woman and began to learn the meanings of the words, fear, courage, and love.<br />I was glad to see that she had spunk , knowing what she would face in the story ahead. Learning more about Rene and Mala (the true love of his life) made my heart more tender towards them. I am a romantic and want the love that they once shared to bloom forever! Also, learning about Jean Luc Pierne and his love for Aubrey helped to put the feeling of Mr. Alcott from book two for Aubrey, in more of a perspective. Now I can't decide who I want her to love! Not fair!<br />RB, The Widow Maker is an excellent pirate, romance adventurous book. Drawing you into the story and the lives of the characters and making you want to know what happens next. All of your emotions will tingle as you read this novel. Love, fear, hate, anger , and yes, even compassion, will bubble up inside of you, as you watch their lives unfold. The first book of this trilogy bleeds into the second, yet, in my opinion each can stand alone. This is a good mark for a trilogy and makes for an excellent read. If you have not sunk your teeth into these novels, I would highly recommend that you do. I look forward to the ending and only hope that it plays out the way I want it to. I love a happy ending!t the way I want it to. I love a happy ending!	2003-02-08

It is the story of Michael Sinclair and Bruce Plantard, who set out to do a student archaeology trip to the Mendip Mines of Somerset, England. What they found, the journal of the first Baldwin King of Jerusalem, started them on an adventure that would change the world.<br />Feeling that the journal gave them clues to greater hidden treasure in Mendip, they are financed by Bruce's Uncle Edmond and a secret expedition is undertaken. Uncle Edmond also gives them some new documents and with those and the journal in hand they discover a secret chamber and what it contained was almost unbelievable. The excitement rose in the young men! Could they truly have discovered the cross that Jesus was nailed to? And what was in the jars that they had found? Could it be the blood of the Savior? I wanted to know.<br />Trust me, this story is not easily figured out. Secret societies are discovered, murders uncovered,and the birth of a child conceived with whose seed? You'll hold your breath waiting to find out as all leads to a climax that you will not soon forget.<br />Is it the story of the beginning, or the story of the end! This is the thought that you will ponder after reading this excellent novel by Greg Cicio. A Very good read!	2003-02-08

Having been a Pastor for over 20 years, I was anxious to see how she would present this information. I wondered if it would be 'preachy' or given to the people in a tender,understanding way.<br />The author takes all of the Spiritual truths that are needed from the Word of God and presents them to the reader using Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive brain development. Now, don't let that big name scare you away! The author really does a wonderful job of using these concepts in teaching the reader how to raise their spiritual level and get the most out of their spiritual walk. As Christians, we are always striving to have more understanding of God's Word and His principals.<br />Using the six levels of the taxonomy she applies them to knowing the Word of God, the Holy Spirit, prayer, fasting, faith and answered prayer, among others.<br />She does an excellent job in presenting her information. I feel someone wanting to truly grow in God's Word would benefit greatly from applying her format.<br />Higher Order Thinking Skills For Spiritual Abundance would make a good complimentary book to your Bible. And would be an excellent companion book for those wanting a deeper walk with the Lord.	2003-02-08

Honor, morals, faith, and courage all are outstanding qualities among her main characters. These<br />qualities capture your heart.<br /><br />Matthew Hale is a rebel and a traitor to King James, facing execution, fate intervenes and he is sent to the Colonies and slavery.<br />Again fate or perhaps a higher force intervenes and he is bought by Edmund Carey, who leans that Matthew is the son of a man who saved his life during the English Civil War. This, among other events wins Hale his freedom.<br /><br />The story takes you on a journey with Matthew  as he travels to find Mr. Carey's daughter and bring her home; a daughter he had not seen since she was a baby. Love, suspense and mystery are spun within the telling of this journey.  The plot is too involved to discuss in a short review, but I will tell you this, the author does a marvelous job of bringing her characters to life and allowing you to become one with their emotions, feeling their defeats and victories. The author gently threads in a delicate love story that<br />will take your breath away.<br /><br />I like the way she carefully weaves the characters faith in God and their moral fiber into the story.  Although it is action packed and can at times be quite suspenseful, she keeps the element of the backdrop of a divine plan neatly in place.<br />I liked this and I truly enjoyed this work.<br /><br />Highly recommended and well worth your read.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Reviewer	2003-02-08

They both had met their match. Little did she know that she would spend her life with him.<br /><br />My favorite part of this novel was when the<br />ship they were on was sunk by a German<br />submarine ship.  Josie and Keno were rescued by none other than the Captain of<br />the ship that sunk them.  I will not tell you<br />how they escape this captivity, but author<br />Denise Clark does an exceptional job in her<br />description of this event.  I loved it!<br /><br />An excellent romance/historical novel.  Filled to the brim with heart wrenching emotions as you share the victories and defeats of Josie LeMay and her experiences in war torn Europe.<br /><br />A wonderful read, highly recommended, one you do not want to miss.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Reviewer	2003-01-28

No, this one will make you sit up and take notice.  Think the world of prostitution is bad?  You just don't know the half of it.  Mr. Christensen writes from first hand knowledge, being a retired police officer, he tells the true story of the interaction between the three, Hookers, Tricks and Cops.  He will answer the questions that have been whispered behind close doors.<br /><br />The stories are true encounters that Mr.Christensen and his fellow workers have had.<br />Often sad, sometimes humorous, he gets down to the nitty-gritty of lives age old profession.<br />Who are these women and men who sell something so precious for so little?  Why do they do this and where do their lives go after their youth and innocence has long departed them?  This book takes a hard, accurate look and answers these questions and many more.<br /><br />I was surprised at some of the comments and attitudes of the prostitutes and tricks myself.  Mr. Christensen takes away the myth of the innocent victim and allows you to see things as they really are.  Not a pretty sight, I might add!<br /><br />This is not a book for the tender of heart, as some dialog is crude but necessary in keeping with the content of the story.<br /><br />&quot;Hookers, Tricks and Cops!&quot;  Interesting, sad, humorous, violent and sobering at the same time!<br />Quite a read!  Thank you Mr. Christensen for shedding a new light and answering many unasked questions.  And....for those who maybe<br />thinking of taking a little ride down to the Red-Light district of your hometown.......maybe you<br />might want to read this book first.

As a writer I was immediately interested in Mr. Wellman's informative book, &quot;A Writers Roadmap.&quot;  Although it is geared toward screenwriters, those of us who are involved in any form of writing will find invaluable information packed inside these pages.<br /><br />Coming from a man with the experience and background of Mr. Wellman only adds to the encouragement that this reviewer would give to other writers to make it a point to read this book.  He shares freely not only his triumphs in writing, but also his mistakes.  This puts you at ease knowing that no one is perfect and that writing is a learning experience and a road we are all traveling together. He takes you by the hand and gives you example after example  of many different aspects to make your screenplay, or in my case, my novel all that it can be.<br /><br />His words of knowledge will help those who are being held down by the sneaky 'writer's block' that we all experience from time to time.  He shows how to draw from our own experiences in life, our friends, our enemies, ourselves and use that to help create the work that is within us.  He explains clearly the different levels that any good work should have within it and helps you to achieve that goal.<br /><br />Mr. Wellman writes in a way that is simple to understand and apply. He does not talk down to you, but encourages you to reach out and become all that you can be as a writer.<br /><br />I highly recommend that every person who is serious about their writing, be it screenplay writing, novel, short story or whatever area they are pursuing, to grab a copy of this excellent book and keep it by your side.<br /><br />It is a wealth of information, ideas, suggestions, and encouragement that you will turn to time and time again.<br />I thank you Mr.Wellman for allowing me to review your book and believe me I will incorporate your suggestions in everything that I write.<br /><br />A must read for all writers!<br /><br />Shirley Johnson/Reviewer<br />MidWest Book Review	2003-01-16

Paper Back<br />Pages: 151<br />Publish America<br />P.O. Box 151<br />Fredericks, MD<br />...<br /><br />  Flesh Craves, The Vanfell Legacy tells the tale of a family travelling west in the 1820's to seek an inheritance left to them. During the course of their long journey, all but a few fall victim to the elements and attacks. Two adults, Des and Shileen, seek to rescue Honey and Sinclair (Shileen's children) from an evil Indian tribe. The plot expands as they befriend an indian who introduces them to his tribe, the Watcheeny.<br />  In reading Flesh Craves, I found several themes that were woven together to bring out the underlying point of the story. Although the book centers around a curse that gives man and beast cravings for blood and flesh, (hence the name) the true hub of the story is the indominable spirit of man. Through all the tragedies and losses they endured, both white man and indian work together to survive in an untamed and harsh world. I found myself immersed with the descriptions of the wild, and how life must have been for those who lived in it.<br />  I was pleased with the way Brian interwoved the supernatural into the story. It didn't overpower the flow of events, as many books do. Although vitally important to the book, it kept a back seat most of the time (though you could feel it's presence,especially toward the end.)<br />  Some parts of the book are quite graphic, but never get out of hand. Though I must say again that the story takes place in the wilds of the west, and life was certainly a challenge for those who braved it. I also liked how the indians were portrayed, instead of the stereo-type descriptions of butchers and heartless warriors given today.<br />  If I had to label this book, it would certainly not be under horror, but there is an amount of suspense in it that eats at you until you reach the end. With suprises and twists throughout, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a story they can really get into, but be prepared for the unexpected!<br />  In conclusion, I enjoyed reading Flesh Craves, and hope that Brian will continue his style of writing in future books.<br />  Michael Bogert/Reviewer<br />MidWest Book Reviewwould recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a story they can really get into, but be prepared for the unexpected!<br />     In conclusion, I enjoyed reading Flesh Craves, and hope that Brian will continue his style of writing in future books.<br />    Michael Bogert/Reviewer<BR>MidWest Book Review	2003-01-05

I believe in Mary as the Mother of Jesus, respect her and honor her.  Sometimes I have almost felt envy that she was chosen by God for such a wonderful destiny. I wondered how Ms. Sawyer would handle a subject on a woman who has been as controversial as her son, Jesus.<br /><br />The author pens her words as if written by Mary herself. Have you ever wondered what Mary's childhood was like? Did you ever think what emotions, fears or concerns she felt when she knew<br />she had the Son of God within her? When you have heard the sermons on the death of Christ, have you<br />ever shut your eyes and thought of the pain and suffering his mother had endured at the foot of that cross? And  did you ever smile as you remember the first time she saw him after his death?<br />Her Resurrected Lord, her precious son!<br /><br />Ms. Sawyer takes you on a journey inside the mind and heart of Mary.  She answers these questions for you and more.  She allows you to become one with a woman who many of us feel is so unapproachable, too holy to ever put her on the same level as we! Through the words of the author<br />you touch and feel the raw emotions of  Mary, Mother of Jesus; yet a woman, just like any other, who laughed and cried, hoped and dreamed and placed her destiny in the hands of God.<br />Are her accounts  of Mary's life fact or fiction?  That is for you to decide!<br /><br />My Name Is Mary is a story we are all familiar with, but Ms. Sawyer's account will make you stop, and celebrate ,the life of this exceptional woman. It is a tender story of a mother's love, told with her words, of her sorrows. joys, and her destiny.	2002-11-18
