The title is a little bit of a misnomer.  One gets the idea you will be reading a story of conspiracy against the German dictator by German army officers.  What one gets is the story of German army officers misleading Hitler and letting the Allies win at the Normandy invasion.  Even this is not really proved.  The author footnotes many authors that have proven false themselves.  An author he quotes even wrote a book about Hitler purporting him to be alive in South America.  Johnson gives a lot of attention to Canaris, as the master of this conspiracy.  Most don't know what this shadowy figure gave in the resistance movement.  There are a lot of theories but very little actual proof.  This book is unfounded in many things on the Normandy invasion.<br /><br />This book gives a lot of trivial facts about the Normandy invasion, but little in the way of proof of what the author alleged happened.  Not a difficult book, but the reader must understand that what is written is not always true.	2005-10-13

Innocent Iraqis and British soldiers are killed by Moslem fundamentalists after they infiltrate the Iraq border.  This sounds familiar.  It is and history is repeating itself.  Sir John writes about his ten years on the border of Iraq and Saudi Arabia (Nejed).  Nejed fundamentalists (Ikhwan) are raiding the border tribes of Iraq and killing all the men.  These Ikhwan then plunder all these tribes have (mainly camels and sheep) and write it off as Holy War.  Well we call these people robbers and terrorists nowadays (not in the Middle East).  Glubb tells of how he organized the tribes to defend themselves against these terrorists.  His ten years of effort pay off when these Ikhwan irritate Ibn Saud.  Ibn Saud then organizes a campaign that dirves these cutthroats out of his country.<br /><br />This is an interesting read because of the similarities with today's conflict.  America is fighting fundamentalists infiltrating from Syria while Britain fought fundamentalists from Nejed.  Then the Iraq government was very weak, as it is today.  There are many other similarities.  This is a good book to read because of today's conflict.	2005-10-07

This is an OK read about the Arctic.  There are actually two stories here.  The first revolves around English explorer and pirate  Martin Forbisher and the second about an American Charles Francis Hall.  Forbisher was searching for the northwest passage to China and found what he thought was a passage way and a black stone.  Assayers felt the stone could yield a fortune in gold.  The passage Forbisher found was a bay and the stone contained little in the way of precious metals.  Hall searched for the survivors of an earlier Artic expedition of Franklin.  He was disappointed too.  What he found were the traces of Forbisher's expedition.  Both explorers searched for something that was not there.<br /><br />The book is of interest to those historians who like the explorations of the Arctic and Antarctic.  What is facinating is the life of the Inuit or native peoples who inhabit this inhospital land.  It was interesting to read of how these people adapted to their environment.  The white man may have thought them savages. They were far more civilized than the white man.  As stated an OK read about a little known expedition.	2005-10-03

This is a great read, and the only reason why I gave it a four star is because the authors seem to sympathize with Casellano.  Castellano was the head of one crime family of five in New York.  They specialized in corruption and punishment of those who didn't let them get their way.  When Paul talks of clipping people, he means he will have someone murder them.  Should we have sympathy for someone who has clipped others, being clipped himself.  Or for that matter, the man who busted up people with a baseball bat getting six slugs in him.  I think not.  These guys got what they deserved.  The only bad thing is the Gambino crime family fell into the hands of John Gotti and his son.  They were bigger hoods than Castellano.<br /><br />This book is an interesting read in the fact of how it sheds light on the La Costa Nostra.  These people are human.  This is all too apparent with Paul Castellano.  He was an old man who fell for a younger woman.  He lost his management abilities and with an organization like the Mafia, there was no retirement villa but some bullets to the head.  It sheds light on the lesser figures who led some of the other families.  These guys are not invicible, but are human and make mistakes.  Their fall is proof of their mistakes.	2005-09-30

Everybody has heard about the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  Few have heard of the U.S. Expeditionary Exploration of the Pacific Ocean and Antartic.  I commend the author writing about the little known expedition that lead to the Smithsonian Institution.  I did know of Wilkes being the captain who authorized the seizing of the two Confederate dipolmats.  This book fills in the period when the United States was coming off the War of 1812 and before the Civil War.  During this time, the United States wanted to make its mark on the world by sending out an expedition which would survey the coasts of the western territories as well as chart the Pacific islands.<br /><br />The author describes the formation of this expedition of ships and the travels.  The prime focus is the commander of this expedition who was smart and driven, but obviously not a leader of men.  Leaders make people want to go where they don't want to go.  Wilkes was one of those people who just forced people to do what he wanted by blunt force.  This driven man had few leadership skills and alienated most of those who served under him.  This is a good example of how not to lead.<br /><br />This book got off to a slow start, so that is why I rated it only a four star.  This is a good story and a book well worth reading.	2005-09-23

For those interested in how this country came into being, this is a great book.  I never thought that the history of this country is relatively new.  The House of Saud ruled the region of the Nejed.  They dispossesed the House of Rasheed through the use of a fundamentalist  Islamic religion called Wahhabism.  Then they conquered the Hejez, ruled by the Hashemites.  The leader of the Nejed was Ibn Saud.  He lived a long and fruitful life, having over 50 sons (no mention of daughters though).  When he died in 1953, his sons took over and haved ruled since.  The current sovereign Abdullah is one of his oldest.<br /><br />For those interested in the current situation in the Middle East, this explains much.  The export of this fundamentalist strain of Islam called Wahhabism is now plaguing the world with terror.  Since the House of Saud has cultivated this strain, they have much to be responsible for in the current terror situation (including 9/11).  The original author of the first ten chapters was murdered in Egypt and one wonders if it was as a result of writing this book.  This is a very informative as well as long book.  It describes much of the internal politics of Saudi Arabia.  Since this was published in the early 1980s, it is a little dated.	2005-09-22

This is the third book I have read written by Richard Hough.  They are all good books, and Hough has a way with describing naval battles.  In this book, he describes how the Russian Admiralty collected four good battleships and a motley collection of other ships to lead into the battle with the Japanese.  This 10,000 mile journey across half of the world ended in defeat at Tushuma (Donkey's Ears).  Hough describes how the failure of the Admiralty, the ship's crews, and the Admiral resulted in one of the most stunning defeats in naval history.  There is plenty of blame to go around.  Several thousand Russian sailors died as a result.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers that more of the writing should have been devoted to the actual battle.  In itself, the travel of the Second Pacific fleet was also a naval accomplishment.  For a latter and more detailed book of the battle, see The Tsar's Last Armada.	2005-09-12

I wondered why I never heard this story before.  The Bremen was a huge ship (over 50,000 tons).  In late August, 1939 the Bremen found herself in New York harbor with war clouds gathering in Europe.  The Bremen left New York after many hurdles put up by the American administration and proceeded to cross the Atlantic and dock in North Russia.  Three months later, this same ship left North Russia and came back to Nazi Germany.  She narrowly escaped a British submarine on her way home.<br /><br />First off, I believe the story of this ship was rather inconsquential.  It was a somewhat interesting story for those interested in World War II.  However this liner never was important to the war effort and later sabotage prevented it from serving any other purpose in the war.  It was of interest to show how Roosevelt was not neutral at even the beginning of the war and how the Soviets helped the Nazis at the start.	2005-09-08

This story was written back in 1942, so it is rather dated as far as WWII history is concerned.  The U.S.S. Lexington was a battle cruiser converted to an aircraft carrier while still in the shipbuilding process.  This famous aircraft carrier was one of the handful the U.S. kept in the Pacific to hold back the Japanese onslaught at the beginning of World War II.<br /><br />Johnson details the life of the ship prior to her sinking.  He interviews the crew and gets the feel for life aboard an aircraft carrier.  Since he is writing in 1942, he details the force formation the Lex was sailing with, by saying Cruiser I, or Carrier II.  Carrier II is obviously the Yorktown.  References to the enemy are in a derogatory and rascist manner, so this sets the book back.<br /><br />This book gives a good feel to what is was like in 1942.  The U.S. was battling for its life, and the enemy were evil.  News was censored, so journalists couldn't not report everything.  A nice read for a WWII era book.	2005-09-07

Fundamentalism whether Christian or Moslem always breaks out the nut cases.  So it was with Christian Fundamentalism in the 1820s and 1830s of the United States.  Christianity is undergoing a revival and various creeds are arguing about what is the one true version.  Up through the ranks come the likes of Pierson and Matthews who dream of the old days where women obey men.  They recreate a small kingdom (only a house with several families) with a head patriach.  Matthews becomes King Matthias and makes the decisions in his kingdom.  He selects another man's wife as his servant and allocates the financial resources for his kingdom.  He is in fact a cult leader.  His actions may have resulted in a old man not getting proper medical treatment and then dying.  The civil authorities take him on and prosecute him, whereby he loses much of his power.<br /><br />I didn't know the history of this affair.  It seems rather mild by today's standards.  The book is an OK read.	2005-09-03

Du Bois Institute)	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Politics and dictators in Nigeria.	This is a short book, but very difficult to read.  This is surprising since the author has a Nobel prize for literature.  It is also rather dated.  The author writes about his feelings after the military dictator Abacha annulled the election of June, 1993.  Several months later, Abacha hanged another noted author.  Soyinka writes about the wasted life of Nigeria under the various military dictators.  He predicts that if the military dictatorships continue, Nigeria will break up into pieces, and there will be nothing left to argue over.  He also details the military and political kleptocracy that has taken over Nigeria since independence.  Things have gone to the worst state imaginable, and only democracy will cure this.<br /><br />I found myself laughing at some points in this book because the author has a way of detailing how he feels about the military dictators who have run his country.  He makes them out as idiots.<br /><br />The author uses complex language and assumes the reader has some knowledge of Nigerian politics.  Therefore this book is not for the lay reader.  A difficult read.	2005-08-30

Women now constitute a sizeable percentage of the workplace.  Not only have they changed the structure of the workplace but family life is also changing as a result.  The author is a noteable management consultant who relates how moms (and dads) can now structure the family.  A family should not be hierarchial, but focus family tasks on the project system.  All members should at least have input in the family's decisions.  By this way, there is at least focus on where a family is going.  This is good info for those who try to balance family with work.<br /><br />In the last part of the book, Neale loses focus and ranges against the prevalence of golf at business.  She gets her point across that businesses should try to get new benefits that will help families and not have businessmen improve their golf game.<br /><br />I am all for this.<br /><br />This book is an easy read and brings up points on how business should be more family focused.  This would not only help women but also men.  The first part about involving all family members in the chores of the family is also very relevant.	2005-08-30

Hornet and her one year life.  What she lacked in longevity, she sure made up for in activity.  Her airmen were a deciding factor in robbing the Japanese of their finest pilots.  Once her first line pilots were gone, the Japanese had few replacements and at that point, America was producing its second generation of carriers and another crop of pilots.  The Hornet was indeed the last gift of the pre war U.S. Navy.  Indeed, this carrier at one point was the only active serving carrier in the Pacific.  It was indeed a ship that held the line.  After her loss, no more fleet carriers were lost in the war.<br /><br />The author did a nice job of detailing the life of this carrier.<br /><br />He pointed out her weaknesses and that of the planes she carried.<br /><br />After perhaps the Enterprise, Lexington, and Yorktown, she was one of the famous ships of the war.  A nice read about a famous ship.	2005-08-30

Hats off to these authors for writing a book about the Chesapeake/Leopard duel and the resulting conflict with Great Britain over impressment of American sailors.  I think this book does a great service to historians for why the War of 1812 came about.  One author took the diplomat side of the story while the other covered the naval aspect.  What one finds explains a lot about the subsequent war five years later.<br /><br />British sailors were poorly paid and badly treated.  American sailors were better paid and treated.  British sailors deserted in droves for the American merchant marine and small U. S. Navy.  Britain took it upon herself to stop ships at sea or even a foreign harbor and take what sailors it needed to complement the ship's crew.  This was British Arrogance at its worst.  No apologies/nothing in the way of compensation if they took other's nation's citizens.  The British Navy regarded this as a right.  Today we call it piracy.  The U.S. government under Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison tried to stop it.  However, American merchants and the U.S. Navy willingly took on British deserters for crew on their ships.  This also was probably wrong.  The confrontation was set.  The Leopard stopped the U.S. Navy frigate Chesapeake and demanded to search it for deserters.  When the Commodore refused, they put several broadsides into the U.S. ship.  The Chesapeake was completely unprepared for battle.  The Chesapeake surrendered and three British deserters were taken off.<br /><br />This was not the end of the affair.  There was needed a scapegoat for the U.S. ship's surrender.  This was the Commodore, even though the Captain and some of his lietenants were as guilty of being unprepared as the Commodore.  The subsequent trial and acquital of the junior officers was unfair.<br /><br />This is a nice easy read.  Again, hats off to the authors for writing about a little known event.	2005-08-29

There are few people who impress me in history.  Robert E. Lee is the exception.  Not only was this a wonderfully, kind man who was trained as a soldier and engineer, he was brillant in many other areas.  He disliked slavery, even though he had some inherited slaves.  He felt loyalty to his native state of Virginia and fought for her.  He was a great administrator of several educational institutions (West Point, Washington and Lee College).  He hated war but fought for his native land.  This is perhaps why Americans still revere him when other CSA Generals and politicians don't merit the same praise.  This short book has selected  writings from either Lee, his family, or his associates.<br />This is a ninety page large picture book.  It is packed with information, but it is short.  There are longer books out there on Robert E. Lee.	2005-08-25

A nice story about the decline of one of America's leading brokerage houses.  If it weren't for the arrogance of Bob Fomon, this venerable firm might still be around.  Other personalities-Rittereiser and Pierce were also rsponsible for the death of this firm.  It just goes to show that power corrupts and total power absolutely corrupts.  I wonder how many Bob Fomons are out there in the rest of the large companies of this world.  Probably quite a lot.<br /><br />The book details the founding of this firm by E. F. Hutton, and the subsequent leadership.  The first fifty pages are the history of the firm, with the remaining two hundred pages detailing the rule of King Fomon, and the power plays between various players in the brokerage house.  These internal power struggles ultimately weakened the firm, so that it took its eye off its customers.  Ultimately, the firm was taken over by Shearson, a subsidiary of American Express.  A nice read on the trevails of poor leadership.	2005-08-24

If you read Zlata's Diary, you will find out how war has affected a little girl.  Her friends move away, one friend is shot, and there is the lack of electricity, food, and water.  She notices that her parents visibly age as the war progresses.  Everybody is under tremendous pressure.  She spends many days couped up in her apartment without seeing daylight.  Snipers shoot into her bedroom making it unsafe.  This is the sad fact of war and how it affects civilians.  Zlata shows the world the inhumanity of warfare and its affects on children.<br /><br />One thing not talked about is who Zlata is...Muslim, Serb, Croat.  I know the reason why this was left out.  It was to show the effects of war on children regardless of enthicity.  Other than the reader's curiousity on this, this is a sad story on what warfare really does to people.	2005-08-16

If there was ever a face of evil, then it had to be Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Hitler.  Hitler once said about Heydrich that he had a heart of iron.  Reinhard was sadistic and was the architect of the Final Solution.  This was no man with a humane touch, he was in short a monster.  The Czech government in exile and the British sent this man to where he belonged at a terrible cost.<br /><br />The book details the plot to kill Heydrich.  Surprisely, the murder and details took up perhaps three to four chapters, with the rest of the book dealing with internal Czech politics and how the government balanced between the English and Soviets.  There was some good information on the wartime policies of Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic) and the government in exile under Benes in England.<br /><br />The world was a better place without Heydrich.  A short biography is included in the writing, and it shows Heydrich in all his bloody lust.  His own killing was because he had so much contempt for the Czechs.  He and his driver were the only ones on the road, and the killers had a big target, especially when Heydrich told the driver to stop when he saw the guerillas.  This was truly an evil man.<br /><br />The book is a nice read.  It details the bio of Reinhard, plus the detail of plot and murder, and finally the end of those who killed Heydrich.  A good book.	2005-08-16

A nice little read, even if the author does not always understand jet aircraft or nuclear power.  This is a story of Saddam's attempts to get the bomb, and Israel's raid that denied them the bomb.  There are many characters in this book:  pilots, generals, Saddam, Begin, and Jacques Chirac.  Chirac sells the Iraquis nuclear technology which could have given Saddam the bomb.  His justification....France made a lot of money out of the deal.  Just another example of how the Europeans don't care who they sell their technology to.<br /><br />The book is a blow by blow story of how Israel first delayed and then plotted the attack on Iraq's nuclear reactor.  Israel used sabotage, extortion, and then assasination to delay the completion of Iraq's nuclear reactor.  Then it plotted the destruction of the reactor by an air strike.  The pilot's stories are the most interesting in this book.  This was a nice little read.	2005-08-15

In fact you would learn little about Goering's early life from reading this book.  What this book reviews are the policies Goering pursued at both the Luftwaffe and his Economics Ministry.  Goering was no military genius, and he certainly couldn't organize like George Marshall, so he basically was a flop at both these positions.  Yet, he garnered them up and retained them throughout much of the war to the detriment of Nazi Germany.  It was a good thing he was on their side.<br /><br />The other thing that is striking about this book is that Goering made possible much of the war and murderous genocide of the regime.  Even though he acted as the humane face of the regime, he in fact was one of the chief devil's disciples.  He deserved what he got at Nurnenburg.  He was as guilty as Hitler for the genocide, slave labor, and brutal warfare.<br /><br />This is a difficult read, since it covers primarily the policies of Nazi Germany.  For policy wonks, this is a great read, for the lay reader, probably not.	2005-08-09

If it were up to Karl I, the Austrian Empire might have become a federal empire, and World War I would never have happened.  As it was, the old Emperor Franz Joseph survived two more years into WWI, and any remaining hopes for a revitalized Austrian-Hungarian Empire were shattered.  This old book is the story of the last of the Hapsburg line, who died on a small Portuguese island three years after the end of the First World War.  He was an accidental Emperor, since three men before him in line died young.  His is an interesting story, and the author relates it to the reader in a personal story.  The author also knew the son and widow of the last Hapsburg Emperor.<br /><br />This is a rather old book (c 1968) and very little has been written of this man.  It is surprising that many books focus on Wilheim II of Germany, but few take the effort of Karl I.  Their personalities were different, but if the world has more Karls, and less Wilheims, it would be a safer place.  A good book about a great man.	2005-08-06

It was a great book.  Recently I saw a reprint of this book in the supermarket, so I decided to read it again.  What a great story!  Mr. Lawson, since deceased, spelled out how he began his flying career and how he got involved in the mission.  His flying experience over Tokyo (amounting to thirty seconds) was a small factor in this book.  What really makes the story are the heroic Chinese who saved Lawson and his crew from the Japanese.  In the crash itself, Lawson injured his arm, leg, and head.  The resulting infection of his leg resulted in amputation.  His travels in his injured state were the main focus of most of the second half of the book.<br /><br />This is such a great read.  Not only is the author a humble, patriotic man but his story details those who made his escape possible.  A great read for anybody.	2005-08-01

I give credit to Dick Morris for trying to gauge the future effects of the Internet on politics.  I believe many of the things he proposes will come true, except that it may take extra time for the Internet to have the effect.  Many people are still not hooked up to the Internet, and so what he says may happen could take 20 years.  Still, the Internet will have a dramatic effect on politics.  One thing I disagree on is that political parties will die on the vine.  Somehow, parties will cling to power and influence the public as they have for hundreds of years.<br />This is an interesting read with some very valid points.  I give the author credit for writing about something unique.	2005-07-26

Indeed the world did fail Rwanda as the author points out in the book about the genocide of the Tutsis in Rwanda.  First off, Egypt and France sell huge quantities of arms to a government in a civil war.  The French even send military advisers to train the Hutu Power militias.  This advisory team has the intials C.R.A.P., something easily indentifiable with the French.  The British and Americans downplay the fact that a genocide is about to occur and even urge no U.N. peacemakers be sent to the country.  Boutros Ghali-U.N. Secretary General and one of those who earlier sold weapons to the Rwandan Hutus downplays the possibility of large scale killings and genocide.  When the genocide does occur, they are in disbelief and don't react for two months while 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus are killed.  Finally when the bankrupt Hutu Power regime is in its last gasp, the French send humanitarian assistance to the Hutus.<br /><br />As the author shows, there is plenty of blame to go around.  The Americans and British prevented help from being sent to prevent a genocide.  The French supported a genocidal regime, and in my opinion don't even deserve to be on the Security Council.  Hutu Power hopefully has been consigned to the dustbin of history.  The U.N. is a paper tiger with feckless authority.  The world did indeed turn its back on 800,000 Tutsis in Rwanda.  A good read about a tragic event.	2005-07-23

A nice little history of the First Afghan War of 1839-1842.  As the British East India Company started to worry about Russian incursions into Central Asia, the British became involved in the politics of Sind, the Punjab, and Afghanistan.  Thus started the Great Game between Russian and British interests in Central Asia.  The First Afghan War was the result of this competition.  The British decided to foist a deposed Afgan Shah onto the country and depose Shah Mohammed Dost.  The first third of the book details the lead up to the war and the politics.  The second third details the British occupation of Afghanistan and last third detail the death of the Kabul occupation army as it retreats through the Khyber.  Only one man returned from this occupation army.<br /><br />This is a good read, and something to remember with our current situation in Afghanistan.  The British were trying to install a pro-British government in Kabul during this war.  It is a wonder how history repeats itself.	2005-07-23

I have read a number of books on this war, and surprisingly few have covered the political aspect as well as this book.  The other books have reviewed the military aspects of the war, and spent a short summary on the political part of the war.  This book is different.  It went into great detail about the POUM, Carlists, Anarchists, Left Republicans, Socialists, Monarchists, etc.  After reading this book, I now know where these groupings came about and what they believed in.  This is a very good review of the political history of the Spanish Republic.  As for the military side, very little time or pages were spent on the battles.<br /><br />This book is a nice read and has many great pictures.  When reading it, it was a little distracting to read about one subject, and then find another topic covered.  The author could have made the material have a better flow.  Subjects changed even in the middle of a paragraph.  I never saw that in other historical books.  For this reason, I rated it only four stars.	2005-07-18

An interesting book about the Siege of Vienna and how the Turks almost managed to change the course of history.  The Ottoman Empire was a powerful Empire in the world and made an attempt to dominant the life of Central and Eastern Europe.  On September 11-13, 1683, Poles, Austrians, and Germans routed them on the outskirts of Vienna.  After the battle, the Turk Empire became the Sick Man of Europe.  The Turks and Islam came very close to upsetting the balance of power in Europe.  A few more days of siege may have forced Vienna to surrender.<br /><br />Stoye does a good job of showing the politics of how this siege and the resulting battle took place.  Louise XIV of France was the mortal enemy of the Hapsburg and Spanish Empire.  His efforts helped the Turks make a decision on the showdown with the Hapsburgs.  Turkish court politics as well as John III's position in Poland are also discussed.  The resulting combination of Hapsburg, Saxon, Bavarian, and Poles in confronting the Turks is also reviewed throughly.  The result was the successful Allied effort in confronting the Turks.<br /><br />As one of the reviewers has already mentioned, only two of the nine chapters dealt with the siege and battle.  The rest was the history of the politics of this conflict.  The first part of the book drags, but I managed to learn a few things about this famous conflict.  This book is not for the beginning historian.	2005-07-15

Actually this was a pretty good book about one person's participation in the war.  Unlike the other readers, I felt that this book got off to a slow start.  His talk about his early life was interesting but I couldn't get a read about what he was trying to convey.  Perhaps he was trying to state he was brought up as an upright moral person in his early years.  His conflicts with the French and then collaboration with them was confusing.<br /><br />I was miffed at his later righteous anger and wrath when confronted with the realities of the war.  Other officers were crooked and could be bribed.  Most of the American officers did not know their positions or behavior in Vietnam.  Then he turns it back on them when he is adapted into an American community.  You can't have your cake and eat it too Kiem.  If you criticize how Americans adjusted in Vietnam, you can't criticize how you adjusted here in the States.  In one passage of the book, he recounts an argument with his wife about his big ego.  I think he showed that in his writings at some points.<br /><br />If you can adjust for the above mentioned criticisms, this is a good book about a Vietnamese Naval Officer's War.  It is important to get views from many participants in the war, and I think the South's officer core has not written much of the war.  This is a good addition to Vietnam War library.	2005-07-09

Jon Peters and Peter Guber took Sony for a long and expensive ride in Hollywood.<br /><br />The book also serves as a biography of these two famous gentlemen and how they managed to take credit for a lot of other peoples creativity.  They took credit for other peoples ideas and then promoted the hell out of these movies and managed to make themselves rich.  As the authors put it, most people in Hollywood knew their reputation. It took a foreign business (Sony) buying Columbia to figure out their less than stellar management capabilities.  For this, Sony lost a ton of money.<br /><br />The authors do a nice job of detailing Guber and Peters backgrounds and their unique chance at changing the landscape of Hollywood.  This is a fairly long book, but well written, so the time flies when you read it.  A great read about the sordid business of Hollywood.	2005-07-06

I think the previous reviewer hit it on the head in regards to this book.  It accurately details the history and nature of this war, but it is so dry and fact based, that it was a difficult read.  This book of 10 chapters and 250 pages is chock full of info, but it does not convey any good reader interest.  It is hardly a page turner.  I have read some books twice the size of this book in half the time.  Other criticisms of this book is that it details the movement of troops and sometimes one cannot figure out whether the author is talking about the British or Americans.  In one instance, it talks of a tactical retreat by the British to Burlington, Vermont when the author meant to say Burlington, Ontario.  That confused this reader.<br /><br />If one whats information on this important war, one should look elsewhere.  This book is full of info, it just not interest the regular lay reader.  Look elsewhere for a better book.	2005-07-05

Even though I gave this book only three stars, it is an interesting though tough read.  Simes is a Russian Jew who left the Soviet Union in 1973.  Since the late eighties, he has served the former late President Richard Nixon.  His trips during the late Soviet era and the first years of the Russian Federation show how U.S. policy has not been full of insight and purpose.  Rather he shows the errors of the Bush I and Clinton presidencies.  We supported the leader (Gorbachev and Yeltsin) rather than policies that would have helped Russia. Simes also tells us we support doctrinaire policies rather than ones helpful to the Russian people.  This is good information for our vaulted foreign policy, since Simes showed the West has made things worse rather than better.  He also criticizes democracy in Russia, when at best the government of Russia is a benign authoritarian government.<br /><br />What I dislike about this book is the name invoking nature of the author's writings. His obvious closeness to Nixon and his policies is one thing.  I think the author tries to place himself close to other top Russians.  This tends to get old after the first few chapters.  Also, the writings of an academic are hard on a normal reader.  As one of the previous reviewers has already noted, the chapters move from one topic to another and the reader gets confused following this.  Overall there is alot of good information in this book.	2005-06-27

This book shows a unique side of Napoleon that other biographers rarely mention.  Here is the man who ruled France for 12 years, prepared to live the life of an exile until the Congress Allies defy the treaty they made with him.  First, the Austrians take away his wife and child.  Then the Bourbons (they learned nothing and forgot nothing) don't bother to pay the pension promised.  It also shows the the qualities of Metternich and Tallyrand, and there treacherous qualities in statemanship.  These were the men who made Europe after the Congress.  The story revolves around how Napoleon first adapted to life on the island, and then as the Allies thought about rethinking their position toward him and Murat, changed it to make a comeback in France.  The final four chapters deal with his march on Paris and his reinstallation on the throne.  A great story.<br /><br />This is a good book in that it talks about a little known chapter of his life.  The book starts off rather slow, but the chapters are stirring toward the middle and end.	2005-06-25

Life magazine always produces great pictures and this is no exception in this book.  The book is a compilation of the life of America following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  The personal stories are always the best to read about.  There is a personal background of five people who survived the attacks and this is very poignant.  One detailed a young widow of a NYFD person killed in the attack.  She described the payout which she recieved as a victim as our \\"sad money\\".  These people will never be the same as a result of the attack.<br /><br />I find fault with this book because there is so little focus.  It descibes personal stories, then goes off to talk about the ex mayor, then looks at Afghanistan.  There is a series of writings in here about the American spirit, but there is no focus in even this.  This is a hard book to follow, so I rated it low.  The editor should have focused on one trend.	2005-06-21

Latifa is a 16 year old girl when the Taliban seize power and she lives in Kabul.  Once the Taliban seize power, Latifa can no longer go to school, pursue a career, and even go outside.  The Taliban outlaw all pleasures like watching TV, listening to foreign radio broadcasts, flying kites, having pets, listening to music.  Latifa knows these things are not against the laws of Islam, but rather the rulings of the Taliban who have perverted her religion into something that imprisons women.  Latifa becomes a prisoner in her own home, for she fears going out on the streets because of the criminal activities of the Taliban.  Eventually she decides to circulate a newsletter and teach younger kids and this makes use of all her time.  She gets an opportunity to go to Paris to tell the world of the criminal activities of the Taliban and the Taliban give a fatwa against her and her family.<br /><br />This book demonstates the crimes of the Taliban.  They were indeed a criminal regime and Mullah Omar should be placed on trial in the Hague for crimes against humanity.  Latifa also tries to make the case that the Tailiban were the invention of the Pakistani government.  There is some evidence, but this is not clear cut.  Overall a good book about the crimes of this fundamentalist regime.	2005-06-20

Krauss was one of those reporters who worked Central America in the 1980s and 1990s and reported as an independent news correspondent.  In this book, he gives his views on the six countries of Central America (he left out Belize) and gives a brief history of each nation.  I think Krauss was both fair and objective in his views of each of these nations.  Krauss details the violence endemic in El Salvador and Guatemala.  He also finds the less violent ways of Costa Rica and Honduras amazing in an area so prone to violence.  Nicaragua and Panama are the middlings in terms of violence.  He also tries to view recent events through the prism of each respective nation's history.  There is a lot of insight in this book.  Other reporters would have just reported what they saw and mixed in their own political viewpoints.<br /><br />The book is an interesting read with some very dry spells.  I found the 60 page chapter on El Salvador a hard slog to get through and understand.  The other chapters seemed to be OK.  One has to be interested in Central America to read this.  Since I have visited all these countries, I found the material in this book of interest in understanding these countries.  This is probably a better book than Buckley's Violent Neighbors.	2005-06-18

This is a picture book on the war that toppled Saddam from his dictatorship.  As one of the previous reviewers have already noted, it is a coffee table book.  The pictures are great as they show the reality of war--innocent civilians including children being wounded and killed.  Not surprisely, I found the book to be pro war and anti Saddam.  The period detailed was the initial invasion and the aftermath.  People were generally pro-American and welcomed the Americans, and this shows in the pictures of U.S. soldiers being kissed.  Much has changed since this book has been published.  At present, it does not demonstrate the true feeling of Iraqis or Americans about the war now.<br /><br />There is not much to read in this book.

As the recent conflicts in both Afghanistan and Iraq show, the West has had to confront Islamic fundamentalism throughout its history.  In the 1880s, the Mahdi rose to prominence as the hidden Iman and confronted both British and Egyptian Imperialism in the Sudan.  The British Prime Minister withdrew from the region rather than confront the threat.  For close to 15 years, most of the Sudan was ruled by the Mahdi and his successor Khalifa.  During those years, many atrocities were committed in the Sudan including slavery and cruel punishment for those who didn't believe.  When Britain decided to re-engage in the Sudan, it was only because the French were exploring the area.  This is the jist of Warner's book.<br />As one of the previous reviewers has already noted, this book is a Western perspective and so perhaps is the slant on the cause of the Mahdi.  The military campaigns were well detailed, but there is too little perspective from the other side.  This is the only criticism of this book.	2005-06-16

Until recently, Poland was a satelite of the Soviet Union.  Before World War One, Poland was part of three different Empires. The only time Poland was truly an independent country was between the two World Wars.  Under the leadership of Marshall Pilsudski, a large European nation was born which had been submerged for over 100 years.  As part of that emerging process, Poland fought a war with the Soviet Union and managed to stem the tide of Communist advancement in Europe.<br /><br />This is a great history book.  The politics and history of Poland come alive.  During this time period, Poland was not a democracy, but an authoritarian state ruled by a benovolent leader.  Poland played a balancing act between Germany and the Soviet Union.  The National Democrats, the PPS, and Marshall Pilsudski played power politics.  This book was very complimentary to Pilsudski, portraying him as the glue that held the nation together whereas the other political parties used power to enrich themselves.<br /><br />Watt is a favorite author of mine.  His books, Dare Call It Treason and The Kings Depart are two of my favorite books on World War One.  Watt does another home run with this book on interwar Poland.  For those interested in Polish history, this is a must read.  For those interested in general history, this is a great book to read about Poland.	2005-06-14

The two Balkan Wars of the 1912-1913 were bloody affairs, and it is a shock to see a writer of the British aristocracy treat them with contempt.  Joyce seems to more concerned with what he is eating, and his fellow countrymen's particular personalities than with reporting the bloody conflict.  Only in the later part of the book do we get a view of some of the conflict's results.  Perhaps this was strictly a personal journal of the writer's own feelings and was not meant for publication.  If that is so, it shows the disdain this author had for the victims of the Balkan Wars.<br /><br />There is not much info in this book.  If one likes his novels, then this may be a book to read.

Let me say that I believe Mr. Overy is a fine historian.  His book Why the Allies Won was a solid read for why the Allies won World War II.  I rate his present book as only an average read.  Overy details the reality of the Battle of Britain.  This is good info, if of a short duration.  The reality is that this vaulted battle was a series of short campaigns which had no regular start date.  Other pertinent information was that the British pilots outnumbered the Germans.  The British Spitfire had more crashes than the Hurricane.  Both sides (Germans and English) did not willingly target civilian targets.  Hitler even forbade terror bombing.  However collateral damage was very high.  The British always had superiority in numbers.  This is all good information for the World War II historian.  This shows how people have made myths of certain historical events, when in fact the reality is different.<br /><br />This is a nice little book which shows reality versus myth.  I wish it were longer and more detailed, but the book shows the reality of the Battle of Britain.	2005-06-13

Then there are the French and Russians whose action also caused the war.  France did not want to be seen as causing the war, but her President Poincaire almost certainly raised the level and desire for war.  As I have stated before, the Russians and French were not babes in the wood, and Thomson shows how their actions resulted in the conflict.<br /><br />This is a nice read.

It satisfies somewhat, but after consuming it, you wonder why.  I like Chris Matthews, because I think he tries to be fair to both sides on his TV show.  I read to learn new things, and regretfully I learned little from this book.  This book tries to tie in history, famous figures, and movies.  Well, I suppose there is something to this, but history is history and not stories in movies.  The other tenet in this book is the characteristics of Americans that make them different from the rest of the world.  Again a long stretch.

This is a nice expose of the crime of Fort Pillow in the Civil War.  I have to agree with the previous reviewer, this book gets the goods on Forrest.  Southerners revere Forrest, and he was one tough fighter and guerilla leader.  He was also a cheater, racist, and murderer.<br /><br />First, the author does a great job detailing the essentials of what happened in April, 1864.  Forrest surrounded a Northern fort, and overran some of the outer defences.  A truce was called and an ultimatum was called by Forrest for the surrender of the fort.  During this truce, Forrest cheated and moved soldiers into advantageous positions.  When the commander of the fort refused surrender terms, Forrest overran the fort and most of his soldiers refused the surrender of Northern soldiers and killed them.  One white officer was even nailed to a cabin.  Black soldiers were placed in cabins and the cabins were set on fire.  Soldiers were driven into the river and executed.  The Northern commander was captured and later executed.  Forrest's troops wanted to kill those because of their skin color and/or regional sympathy.<br /><br />After the war, many excuses were put forward by the criminals who did this.  Essentially it was something like this.  The Northern command should not have placed troops in this area.  They were responsible.  As the previous reviewer has already stated, this defense is much like that of a rapist.  Well, that type of defense is not coherent.  What happened was a crime, and something should have been done about it...such as hanging Forrest after the war because he was a criminal.  He should not be made out to be anything but a war criminal.  Yet his statue stands in Memphis today.<br /><br />I commend the author for writing a great expose of a little known crime of the Civil War.  More needs to known about Fort Pillow, even if it inflames Southern pride.	2005-06-03

There are few books on this subject and I wanted to know the legend of this famous siege and the leader of the forces in Mafeking.  For those of you who were once boy scouts, Baden Powell was the founder of the Boy Scout movement.  He was also an author of several books.  He also was a poor soldier.  However in the Anglo-Boer War, he stationed his main body of troops in the wasteland city of Mafeking and let the Boers surround the city.  Once surrounded, Baden Powell improved the morale of the city and outlasted the Boer siege by seven months.<br /><br />His morale building habits led the population to resist the Boer encrouchments.  After the siege, Baden Powell led a body of troops that performed poorly because of bad leadership.  He was placed in charge of the police and promoted to General.<br /><br />The author demonstrates in this book why Baden Powell was a poor<br /><br />military man.  His body of troops could have done more harm to the Boers on the northern border than being trapped in a small city.  His assistant Plumer was far more active in the war and tied down more troops.  However the British newspapers and public revered this man and he became a legend despite his poor military manuevers.  This was a satisfactory read.	2005-06-02

The last 40-50 pages dealt with combat experience and how he adjusts to losses through both training and combat.<br /><br />I enjoyed this read very much, but there are so many books just like his out on the market.  There is no unique material in here, just a story of an average man making an adjustment to his life to fight for his nation.  Our nation in built upon the sacrifices of young people like him.	2005-05-31

This is the story of Bill and his final battle with cancer.  This man survived the battle of Guadalcanal by his wits and bravery.  He was in the signal corps which basically meant he strung telephone wire between different front lines and rear areas.  His story is his experience of life and death on the island of Gaudalcanal.  The book also has commentary from his doctor on his final battle with cancer in 1997.  This is truly a touching story, much like Duty.<br /><br />The veterans of World War II contributed much to the greatness of this country.  Bill and Ben's sacrifices made this country great and that is why I love to read these stories.  It is sad that Bill could not experience the satisfaction of seeing his story published.	2005-05-31

I picked this book up and read it in two hours.  When someone you know and love uses the principle of invalidating, it hurts.  Sometimes this hurt can destroy personal lives and careers, so it is important to control this behavior by the invalidator and somehow stop it.  Since this book is so relevant to me, I found the principles in this book GREAT.  I now know how to look for this behavior and somewhat how to respond to it.  I would be interested in a revised edition, since Jay Carter has left it up to the reader on a strategy to cope with invalidating.<br /><br />This is a great book for those who suffer the effects of invalidating.  After experiencing invalidation, I sometimes find myself using it.  This book has helped me to put a stop to this behavior in myself and to try to use Carter's principles (especially mirroring) on that loved one who uses invalidating.	2005-05-31

First, I commend the author for writing a book about a little explored topic.  Many books tell of the land warfare in Korea, but few detail the air battles involving Mig 15s and Sabrejets F-86s.  This book attempts to do this, and I think suceeds in showing the violence of the air war.  The author breaks his book into chapters detailing the exploits of individuals waging this battle.  Unfornatunately, it tries to cover too much in a very short book.  One gets a good sense of the first year of the air battles, but nothing of the last two years.<br /><br />This is a good, though average read.  The material covered is unique.  I just think the author tried to be too broad in his historical approach and personal stories, and didn't do either very well.  An average read about a little written part of the Korean War.	2005-05-28

The authors take to task WWII naval historian Morrison for identifying the Australian search pilots as the culprits for the Allied unprepardness in the naval battle of Savo Island.  The pilots reported the Japanese task force sailing south toward Guadalcanal.  Rather the communications system along with the decisions of U.S. Admiral Fletcher and British Admiral Crutchley resulted in five crusiers being badly damaged or sunk and over 1200 Allied seamen dieing.  Crutchley is in for the blame of leaving his task force without a good command structure while he went off to attend a conference.  Fletcher deserves his share for removing the naval air arm from protecting the landing fleet.  The Japanese were aggressive, and used these mistakes to inflict a loss of four cruisers and one destroyer on the Allies.<br /><br />This is an interesting read on a controversial battle.  The Allies obviously learned from this to take the Japanese to task later.  The authors did superb investigative work to uncover the real lapses of judgement by those in command, and not brave airmen trying to make a difference.	2005-05-27

I disagree with the previous two reviewers on this book.  At best, this is only an average read.  The author and main character in this book, Major Phil Ashby was one of the youngest majors in the British Army when he assigned to the UN Peace Force in the African nation of Sierra Leone.  I expected to read a long book about the conflict in Sierra Leone, but clearly half of this book was about the author's experience in his physical conditioning in the Royal Marines.  After a hundred pages, one gets the idea this guy is tough.  Then he details his experiences in Sierra Leone and his escape from the brutal RUF rebel faction who controlled the diamond mining area.  This part was the most interesting.<br /><br />I felt the author could have devoted a chapter to an explanation of the different factions in Sierra Leone and why they are fighting.  A little history of this nation would also have been nice to throw in.  A little more of this info, and a little less of his physical exploits would have made this book a more interesting read.	2005-05-24

This book was written in 1984 with a slightly liberal slant.  However it provides the reader with a good overview history of the region and why the countries were mirrored in violence.  The focus of the book was on El Salvador and the struggle with the radical left and right by Duarte's Christian Democrats.  This region was certainly a violent one during this time.  Buckley also does a good job of providing the reader with a summary history of each country from the start of their independence.<br /><br />The one thing which I had a problem with is the author's liberal bent and how he labeled Reagan's actions not smart.  I think Reagan's tough position made the radicals more willing to concede things (like elections in Nicaragua) in the long run.  So Reagan and subsequent administrations can claim this region as a success story in the Cold War.  This goes against what the author thought would happen.<br /><br />That said, this is a nice book to read on this interesting region.  Before visiting the region in the 1990s, I read this book and thought the insights were good for the most part.  This is the second time I read this book, and it still provides good info on the region.	2005-05-22

Strawson draws the broad conflict between the Axis and Allies in  North Africa in World War II.  This is a British perspective of the conflict, since the contributions of the Americans and Free French were only briefly mentioned.  Also given low priority were the Italians.  Therefore you get an Anglo-German conflict.  Strawson is partially right since the conflict focused mainly on these two nation's armies.  However to disregard the Torch landings in Morocco and Algeria, and not to mention the Free French, one gets the idea the author is being nationalistic. <br />Strawson is at his best in describing the strategies of the various commanders: Rommel, Wavell, Montogomery, and Auchinleck. <br />Unlike previous authors, Strawson is very complimentary on the services of Wavell and Auchinleck since they made victory possible for Montgomery.  Their training, administration, and logistics helped Montgomery win.  The policy and how it applied to other parts of the British Empire also helped to explain the long see saw duration of the battle. <br />A helpful read of the conflict.	2005-05-21

This book is meant as a textbook for high school and college history courses.  I thought the author did a good job detailing the main aspects of the war, and also making it exceedingly boring.  The book gives all the relevant information about the war, but it adds none of the human element in a war struggle.  The book also gives a brief biographical sketch of all the main characters in this stuggle.  Also included are all the major documents of the war and these are of interest to the historian.<br /><br />Few textbook writers make their material interesting to the average reader.  They dwell on the main parts of the history, and this is why I rated the book as a three star.  A more human and lively element would have made this a better book.	2005-05-20

I liked this book because it showed the situation of a country desiring to stay out of the war.  Istanbul was only 40 miles from German occupied Bulgaria.  British, Americans, Soviets, Germans, and Italians all bumped into one another in this city and the Turkish capital of Ankara.  These various groups spied on one another and the Turk military, and they in turn were watched closely by the Turkish secret police.  The Soviets tried to kill the German Ambassador Von Papen.  Jewish groups tried to get Jews out of Nazi controlled Europe.<br /><br />There were many small memorable stories in this book.  One was of a American OSS member looking for the Greek Embassy and knocking on the doot of the Japanese Embassy and being politely told where he needed to go.  Another was the future Pope John XXIII being caught with a bust of Mussolini in his personal quarters and explaining to an American Cardinal that sometimes one had to put on appearances even though a person felt differently.  Then there was the stories of human sufferings like the Turks and British not granting visas to Jews who could escape.  Those not granted visas simply were killed by the Germans.<br /><br />This is a nice read for WWII historians.  This indeed was a different city to battle the forces of evil in.  The author did a good job detailing a little known theater of war in World War Two.	2005-05-15

I like Hoyt's books but as he has gotten older, some of his books have a slapped together feel to them.  This is one of them.  In this short book, Hoyt tells the story of the developement of the Hunley as a weapon of war for the Confederate States of America.  The development of the submarine and the use of the Hunley in the sinking of the Housatonic covered two thirds of the book.  The remaining third details the rediscovery of the lost submarine.<br /><br />Here is what I don't like about the book.  It tells the story in very simple terms.  The first two fatal accidents with the Hunley are very briefly described.  The further development of Davids (advanced Confederate subs) was mentioned once.  The sinking is covered in ten pages.  The rediscovery of the sub is covered in over thirty pages.  I want to know the history of the sub and what other developments occurred, but this is missing in this book.  This could have been a better than average read.  It was not.<br /><br />This is an OK story of the Hunley.  There are better books out there, but as a short book it accomplishes its task of informing the reader.	2005-05-15

There is just way too much material out there relating the story of America's royalty.  I thought I would read this short book to get greater insight into the Kennedy family and the book holds up.  Not only is it concise, but it is packed with information both on the family and President Kennedy.  Also, I feel it is very balanced in showing both the weaknesses and strenghts of this President and his family.  It is probably one of the better short biographies of this President.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone wanting a snapshot of this President.  As with all short books, it doesn't delve into great detail about JFK and his family.  However it serves up enough of the dirt about the family and JFK.  Such dirt as the adulteries of both Joe Senior (Gloria Swanson) and Jack (Marilyn Monroe, and many others).  It also shows the family and JFKs strength.  A nice portrait of the family and JFK.	2005-05-09

I didn't think there was much of a story here until I read the book.  This a nice concise summary of the history of submarines, complete with great illustrations and pictures.  The perspective is British throughout, since this is a BBC book.  It details the development of the submarine from the Revolutionary War to present times.  This book leaves out the exploits of the Hunley, the Confederate submarine which sank a Union frigate.  I found this kind of poor writing, since the Confederate submarine was one of the first to prove its ability as a military weapon.  Other than that, the author does a good job detailing the development of this military weapon.  The author also adds a chapter for the scientific and economic value submarines may hold for the future.<br />If the reader is looking for a book detailing the development of the submarine, this is a great read.  It supports a major television documentary on submarines.  Good reading.	2005-05-09

For those of you who don't know the word, this is the German word for cruiser warfare.  In World War I, Germany stationed many cruisers around the world to support its worldwide set of colonies.  The largest of these forces was the German East Asiatic Fleet with a set of two heavy cruisers and three light crusiers.  With the subtraction of the Emden and the addition of the Dresden, this fleet waged war on the British in both the Pacific and Atlantic.  The fleet  destroyed two British cruisers off Colonel and was itself destroyed off of the Falkland Islands.  This happened in the early stages of the World War.  This book tells of the trevails and exploits of the German East Asiatic Squadron.<br /><br />Hoyt's books are always interesting, even though he has written over 80 of them.  There is no groud breaking academic material in this or his other books, just a solid story of man against the elements. A nice little read of a forgotten element of World War I.	2005-05-09

This is a rather large biographical sketch of 40 people who were traveling on United flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco on 9/11/2001.  As most people know, four Arab hijackers took control of the aircraft and turned it around aiming it in the direction of Washington D.C.  The hijackers never made it to their intended target because probably 5-6 passengers decided they were going to take the aircraft back.  The hijackers either lost control of the aircraft or plunged it into the ground.<br /><br />Almost all the passengers were detailed in this book.  Many of them had made last minute phone calls to their loved ones to say good bye, and these were tear jerking moments to read.  That is why I rated this book a four star.  Most of the other material was rather pedestrian.<br /><br />The problem I have with this book is that the author leaves much of the material out about the probable struggle aboard the aircraft.  Perhaps not much is known, but it would have been  interesting knowing the possible scenarios.  What we get is sweet memories from relatives of their lost ones on Flight 93.<br /><br />This should be known, but the struggle needs to more detailed in the book.	2005-04-25

What a convenient book to come out with the U.S.'s sputtering effort in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Algeria was indeed a difficult country to subdue for the French and their effort was ultimately unsuccessful.  The FLN engaged in terrorist acts to demonstrate their capability to the world.  How do you combat people ready to kill easy civilian targets, rather than tough military and political targets.  The only proven way is to fight terror with counter terror and make the terrorists pay such a high price that is not worth it.  This is what the author demonstrates with his relation to the counter terror struggle.<br /><br />The author throws in way too many names in his zeal to show how the government was complicit in the killing of 3,000 terrorists. Since he was acting under orders, it was interesting to hear how top government officials wished that an FLN leader would commit suicide and the next day it would happen.  The author was responsible for these deaths.  Those killed happened to also have killed others.  The problem is who determines who dies.  The terrorist does not make any distinction.  Civilized society needs to have a standard for this determination or they are as bad as the terrorists.	2005-04-25

This is a nice view of what happened when Kennedy, Kahn, and Carter deregulated the airline business in the late 1970s and the resulting chaos caused by this new law.  A stable industry was thrown for a loop as new laws were implemented, and the old ways were thrown out.  Such venerable companies as Pan Am, Braniff, and TWA went out of business.  Predators in the business (Ichan and Lorenzo) bought up companies and vowed labor confrontation to bring down costs.  Some companies(United, American, and Delta) became giants in the industry.  This book describes the immediate aftermath of the airline deregulation act.  More people flew and were employed in the business, but many lost their careers and incomes in this consolidating industry.<br /><br />I think the authors did a wonderful job of depicting the industry up to 1991.  I would have liked some more information on the early part of the industry, since this may have shed more light on their various philosophies.  Overall a great book on the industry.	2005-04-20

This is the political life story of the Grand Old Man of British politics (GOM).  William E. Gladstone certainly did influence British politics for over fifty years, and was elected to the Prime Minister position four times.  This short book (or thesis) explained his political development through those fifty years.  He moved from a Conservative on social issues to that of a Liberal or even Radical position.  His championship of Irish Home Rule kept Ireland within the British Empire for thirty more years.  This man and his political position kept the radical left from many popular positions.<br /><br />The unfortunate part of this book is that it reads like a thesis.  It probably was a thesis and as such will not attract much interest from the general public.  I did learn a great deal about this most influencial of British politicians.	2005-04-15

This book begins well enough in the description of Augusto Pinochet.  The first two chapters describe his early family life along with his reluctant decision to join the junta plotting the overthrow of the Allende government.  The last two chapters then go into unproven killing, torture, and drug and weapons trafficing.  The author tries to give us a picture of a dictator that knew everything going on in Chile.  I am not sure that is the case.  I do know this dictatorship in the process of overthrowing the legal Marxist government killed 3,000-4,000 people.  That is a fact.  I am sure torture and killings were part of the plan to stay in power.  I am unsure whether they were systemic, as they are in Castro's Cuba.<br /><br />I don't believe this is a balanced view on Pinochet's Chile.  I believe there is much truth in this book, but also stories that don't pass the muster of honest reporting.	2005-04-13

This book reports to be like \\"A Night to Remember\\".  I disagree. Lord did a wonderful review of the Titantic Diaster.  The authors modeled their book on Lord's with the WTC twin towers as the disaster.  This book falls far short of Lord's book.  Perhaps the authors tried to include too many people in their writings.  I had problems with what people escaped and who didn't.  For instance, there was one man stuck in the elevator in the lobby, but the book never stated whether this man ever made it out alive.  There are many instances of this in this book.<br /><br />That said, this book sheds some light on why people fell from the top of the towers (many were pushed by others trying to get air) and why so many rescuers died (19th floor North Tower).<br /><br />There were some nice illustrations of what the two planes did in damage to both towers.  Nice stories about the PANYNJ construction guy going from room to room freeing people, and ultimately losing his own life.  Another story about the friend who would not leave his handicapped buddy in the building.  These stories will make a strong impact on any reader.<br /><br />This is a good read, but not the best one on the market.  It sheds valuable light on those victims who resided in the buildings on the day of the attack.	2005-04-13

I have been to both of these poor countries so I was interested in this book.  I made three separate visits to the island, twice to the Dominican Republic and once to Haiti.  They are indeed very unique and yet very similar to each other.  Wucker does a good job on both their similarities and differences.  Both had a strong traditions of dictatorial rule, along with weak democratic governments.  People in both countries are of similar ethnic background, but both try to point out their differences.<br /><br />Haiti is to France and Africa what the Dominican Repuplic is to Spain and Latin America.  Wucker just states they are like two cocks fighting it out.<br /><br />The one problem with this book is that the author writes more about the Dominican Republic viewpoint than that of Haiti.  One has to explore Haiti to truly love it and its people.  After reading this book, I don't know if the author really got to know the Haitian people.  When she does write of Haitians, it is often those who have lived for years in the Dominican Republic.  She should have spent more time in Haiti.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book about a little known conflict.  For those people interested in the Caribbean, this is a great book.	2005-04-13

I believe humor and the ability to laugh at yourself is a great asset with any person in high office.  When Dole lost in 1996, he stated he slept like a baby....he cried all night.<br /><br />The book is structured on rating the president's ability to crack jokes.  Many people believe that Lincoln and FDR had great wits.  Dole states the many unknowns such as Coolidge's jokes about his silence.  Some of our underrated Presidents had great wits.<br /><br />This is a nice little humorous read.  If the reader needs an uplift, this is a great book to begin with.	2005-04-12

I actually know where Trieste was before I read this book.  Unfortunately I have never visited the city.  I wanted to read this travel book about this famous city, but after a few chapters, I wondered where the book was going to.  After the final chapter, I still do not know what the author's intentions was with this book.  Perhaps I don't read too many travel books.  Obviously the city means a lot to the author, but she did not express it clearly in her writing.  I was scratching my head at the end, and wondering what I read.<br /><br />I learned a little about the city, but not in relation to the amount of time I spent reading this short book.  The city of James Joyce and Maximillian.  The imperial port of the Austo-Hungarian Empire.  The meeting point of Slav, German, and Latin Empires.  One of the ending points of the Iron Curtain.  This city breeds interest and yet the author took us on a round about journal that confuses the reader.  I am sure the author's other books are good, her last one was not the greatest.	2005-04-12

The title states a hypothesis that has not been proven.  What this book tries to do is prove that Albino Luciano (Pope John Paul I) was murdered.  Certainly there are strange happenings between the time of the death and the discovery of the body.  The author narrows the field down to six candidates who may have committed this outrage.  This book is a conspiracy book.  If one were to believe all the material in this book, one might as well believe there was a second gunman on the grassy knoll. Stranger still, three of the possible killers were Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church.  Possible maybe, probably not.<br /><br />All that being said, the author has shed some valuable light on the inner workings of the Vatican.  Corruption certainly exists in the Catholic Church, and the book points that out.  I have doubts whether people murdered John Paul I.  The book also shows the pious nature of John Paul I.  The world certainly lost someone that could have helped mankind.  The one aspect this book really nails is the funny circumstances of the death of this holy man.  Why embalm a man who just died?  Why not do an autopsy?  How could a perfectly healthy man just die of heart disease, especially since all signs pointed he did not have heart disease?  These things along with the way the Vatican authorities handled these circumstances, points to something different happening to John Paul I.  The author cannot prove someone murdered John Paul I, but he certainly proves something was rotten in Vatican City on September 29, 1978.<br /><br />This is an interesting read.  The reader should be cautioned that some of this book might not be true.  However the author raises good questions about the death of John Paul I.	2005-04-11

Her book describes the union struggle with Texas Air over the corpse of Eastern Airlines.<br /><br />I could have easily rated this book a two star.  All the letters are capital and this means the author is yelling at the reader.  There are no chapters, and the author just rants on of her hatred of Lorenzo, Bates, and Texas Air and her love of Eastern Airlines.  This is not a balanced picture of the decline of Eastern Airlines but a pro union argument about the evils of Lorenzo.  She even states that Texas Air's takeover of EA was equal to the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.  Joannie, you are over reaching here.  Calm down.<br /><br />The author comments are probably mostly correct about Lorenzo and Texas Air. Eastern Airlines had its share of problems prior to Texas Air, but it was a sad loss to the nation with the demise of this carrier.	2005-03-26

The killing of Prime Minister Verwoerd of South Africa in 1966 was considered a blow against white supremacy.  In fact, it was the work of a crazed assassin who was acting on his own notions.<br /><br />The assassin Tsafendas was a half breed of Greek/black descent who was torn apart between both races.  His illegimacy was also a source of tension in his life.  Both factors contributed to stress on his mind and the result was the killing of the Prime Minister of South Africa.<br /><br />This was a little known event in the rest of the world but traumatic in South Africa.  Tsafendas by thrusting his knife into Verwoerd demonstrated his hatred of a system that hurt him.<br /><br />Tsafendas was a lunatic, but his action showed the resistance of some to white supremacy.  The book is a short but good read about a little known event.	2005-03-24

One can hear the arrogance in this person's writings about British India.  Lord Curzon was a Viceroy of the British Raj and ruled over millions of Indian subjects.  In this short book, Curzon writes about his travels on the subcontinent.  In his travels, he meets some of the Indian royalty, visits Afghanistan and other small princely states, and goes on tiger shoots.  His description of turn of the century India was insightful.  However, one also has to tolerate his arrogance and feelings of superiority over his subjects.  In his eyes, most of the Indians and other native subjects are socially lower than all Europeans.  Curzon writes in this way, and destroys his creditablily.<br /><br />If one can overcome the arrogance of Lord Curzon, this is a great travel and history book.  Be aware of this Englishman's feeling of superiority over his native subjects.	2005-03-23

I am going to disagree with the previous reviewers and state this book was only an average read.  Why?  Because the writing was marginal (with some mistakes) and most of the stories were of bombers crashing in WWII England.  The pictures in this book were excellent.  The photographer (one of the authors) snapped some great pictures on the death and destruction caused by the crash of these great bombers.<br /><br />The book is good because it shows how even the bomber crews led very hazardous lives in their war with Nazi Germany.  One can feel the tension in the lives of these crew members who risked all in their flights over enemy territory.  Even over friendly territory, the bombers sometimes fell apart and crashed causing crew and civilian deaths.  Indeed these fliers were very brave men.<br /><br />This book has great pictures but only marginal writing.  Check it out of the library, and look at the pictures.	2005-03-23

Daugherty was one of three Case Officers of the C.I.A. in the American Embassy in Tehran when it was seized by Iranian militants in 1979.  Daugherty describes his captivity at the hands of the Iranians and gives a short history of Iran-USA relations proceeding the crisis.  This is a very informative read, and I think very balanced at least in the view of internal American politics.  The author is very forthcoming on how he views his Iranian captors.  He concludes and I agree that they were ignorant and naive in their beliefs.  Tehran Mary is portrayed at the height of her ignorance when she didn't even know that Japan had bombed Pearl Harbor.  She is now a high official in the Iranian government. Daugherty describes his views on his Iranian captors, and it is not a pretty picture.  No wonder the U.S. opposes Iran having nuclear weapons.<br /><br />The author does a great job of describing his introgation, and internment by the Iranian radicals  He successfully opposed them for 444 days.  I rated this only four stars, because of the slow start of the book.  Otherwise a great book.	2005-03-13

It is for everybody.  Husbands negotiate with wives.  Children negotiate with their parents.  Workers negotiate with their bosses.  To be an effective negotiator, you need to know yourself and your wants, your opponents wants and needs, and organize and plan your negotiation.  In this way, you can learn to have negotiations and agreements that satisfy the wants of both you and your opponent.  Ineffective negotiators will not meet their needs and become unhappy.<br /><br />This is a great book to read to learn more about yourself and how you rationalize your decision making.  Negotiation is indeed a great tool in everyday life (home and business).  I commend the author for writing on this topic.  This is a rare book that will help the reader with both his family and business.  The only negative is the author putting much too much focus on theories when simple stories would suffice.  This is why I gave this book a four star.	2005-03-12

As most of you know, the airline business was deregulated in the 1970s and 1980s.  Capitalism provided us with cheap fares and an abundance of flights.  In this book, Captain X fills people in on the unintended effects of deregulation.  These effects would be such things as snarly passengers from the lower rungs of society, crowded planes, frills cut back, worn down aircraft to transport these passengers, and other items.  Captain X also fills you in on the airline biz, and how it has changed so rapidly.  This gives the reader the inside view of the business.<br /><br />Captain X has some great stories in this book.  I read this book back in the early nineties, and I have read it again this week.  Much of what he relates is still very valid, and I still found interest in this material.  The last chapter on the future is not valid, so discard this chapter.  A good read.	2005-03-10

There have been few books on this subject (at least those available in the U.S.), and this book describes this crisis well. Over 300,000 troops escaped envolopement from the Germans by evacuating from Dunkirk.  Lord does his capable best in writing how the British and French were outflanked and almost destroyed, but the Germans turned a great victory into a minor one.  Goring and his Luftwaffe did inflict terrible damage and caused much death, but the fact is the greater part of the British Expedionary Force was allowed to escape and fight again another day.<br /><br />One thing I like about Lord's writings are his personalization of the conflicts.  We hear from soldiers who actually fought and escaped through Dunkirk.  His writings also tell the story through a description of what went on and the military strategy involved.  Lord is one of my favored authors.  He devoted much time (2 years) for each book he has written.  It is a shame we no longer have him here to write great books.	2005-03-04

This book was published back in 1950 and is a collection of humorous sketches of historical figures.  Cuppy's presentation of humor leaves a lot to be desired.  He makes a joke of some of the great figures of history, but since most of the jokes are dated, I laughed little.  I wonder why a publisher would reprint a book that was so dated it would appeal to few people.  I read this book for the purpose of trying to either learn something or laugh, and I didn't do either.<br /><br />For those who know something about history, this would not be a good read since it is neither humorous or factional.  For those who know little of history, this book would be a disaster.	2005-03-02

This is a relatively quick read about a film crews travels in the Caucasus Mountains.  There are two stories here.  The first is the story of the travels in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, Georgia, and Chechnya.  Then there is the story of Iman Shamil, a leader of the Avars and Chechens who led the revolt against the encroaching Russian Empire.  Shamil led the revolt that took the Russians thirty years to suppress.  This revolt was termed the Murid Wars.  It cost the Russians dearly.  In the end the revolt was quelled when the Russians cut down the trees that constituted the hiding places of the rebels.  Both sides were vicious in dealing with the civilian population.  This harks to the present conflict which is just as destructive and vicious as the one of old, if not worst.  This book is interweaved with these two stories.  The one distraction with this book is the exploits of Ilya, an Uzbek Jew who causes trouble with the other film crew members.<br /><br />This sheds light on a little known conflict.  The book is an easy read, but I wish the author had concentrated on one story, rather than two.	2005-02-27

MacPherson has rated this book as being one of the better summary histories of the Civil War.  I have to agree.  I learned a lot reading this short history of the Civil War.  These two British authors describe well what in essence was the dividing point between the North and South and the nature of the battles.<br /><br />The book is also loaded with great pictures and illustrations of this era.  All in all, a nice summary of this war which cost the American nation 600,000 people.<br /><br />There have been many books written about this conflict, and I have read a number of them.  This is one of the better concise histories of the war.	2005-02-25

This is my fourth book I read on this war, and I actually learned a great deal more of the political battles in this book than in the previous books.  There are a number of books which describe what happens militarily, but little which cover the politics of the war.  This book fits the bill and describes how the American, Russian, Israeli, and Arabs had individual battles and combined this almost resulted in the use of nuclear weapons.  Israeli generals and politicians were very divided and this almost resulted in the end of the Third Temple.  Breshnev used language in letters to Nixon which resulted in US forces going on Def Com 3 alert.  Arab leaders started the war with modest goals and came close to conquering Israel.  The author does a good job of detailing all these little crisises.<br /><br />This is a good solid read about the Yom Kippur War and the airlift which saved Israel.  This is a good addition to your history library.	2005-02-24

Hats off to the authors for this very authoritative book about Enron.  How did a Fortune 500 company implode into bankruptcy.  Simple, poor managers did not oversee their direct reports (Lay, Rice, Skilling, and Mark).  The company CFO was virtually printing money by moving dogs to special accounting entities (SPEs) and paying his own company to later sell them back to Enron.  The top managers did not consentrate on managing, but rather focused on deal making and doing mark to market accounting, which was very unpredictable.  Profits were booked, but most were never realized.  As time went on, these deals became very unprofitable with the result of the company having to rely on funny money provided by CFO Fastrow.<br /><br />This is a great book for those who think Wall Street always values a company correctly.  The company was perceived as innovative, but in reality the  managers just hood winked the average investor in believing their stories.  Investor beware. A very worthwhile read.	2005-02-21

This is an OK read, and it certainly explains how a person like Rasputin could raise up to the very level of the ruling elite in Czarist Russia.  Russia was experiencing profound change, and the mores of society were changing.  Most Russians still clung to the Orthodox Church for support, although there were off shoots of this church that had changing morals in terms of behavior.  This explains why an uneducatated, deviant person like Rasputin could rise in his local community, then up the Orthodox Church, and finally attach himself to the Russian Monarchy because of the hemophilia of the heir Alexis.<br /><br />There are some nice pictures in this book, and the author paints an sympathic view of Rasputin.  Some may view him as evil, but I think this is an improper picture.	2005-02-14

This is a nicely told story of the Sepoy Siege of Lucknow as seen by the British soldiers and their loyalist Indian troops.  The siege was indeed a harrowing experience for the trapped Europeans who had once lorded it over the natives.  They were trapped in a small enclave that was pounded by cannons, and shot at by the rebel sepoys.  Many of the soldiers were killed or wounded, which meant a slow painful death.  The reduced rations slowly starved the defenders, while the sepoys tunneling, reduced the defenders energy.  The first relief column was then trapped in an expanded enclave, and the rations were reduced further.  These soldiers and civilians were trapped between five to six months before another relief column evacuated them.  This is a dramatic story and one very little known about in the United States.<br /><br />Edwardes does a good job of explaining the situation and drama from a European point of view.  This is one sided, in that the sepoys were viewed as uncivilized, and the Europeans were the cultured people.  The author provides a nice view of what these trapped civilians and soldiers had to live through.	2005-02-12

There are thousands of books that come out each decade about the Vietnam War.  I think the story told in this book is worthwhile, since it gives the account of border Cambodians in their fight with the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.  I would not label it a literary masterpiece, simply because it is a combat story of why America lost the wars in Southeast Asia.  These ethnic minorities in Vietnam were promised American support in their efforts to rid their homeland of occupiers (namely the Viet Cong) and America turned its back on them in order to leave the Vietnam War.  Who suffered:  the ethnic Cambodians who fought against the Communists and were killed off.<br /><br />This book also puts an end to the story by liberals that the Viet Cong were liberators of the South.  They killed, taxed, and made the local Cambodian population suffer their brand of Communism.  The South Vietnamese may not have been much better, but at least they respected the local population better.  This is a story of American betrayal of the Cambodian population of South Vietnam.	2005-02-12

This is a nice little book about what went on in the Russian Campaign.  The author served on the French General Staff and describes the inside activities of Napoleon, Ney, Eugene, and Murat and their Russian opponents.  This book describes the fire which consumed Moscow as being the result of Russian patriots setting the capital ablaze rather than let the French keep the conquered capital.  Murat is described as a couragous though foolhardy leader who led his calvary to death and destruction.  Ney is viewed as a leader who sacrificed his troops and himself for the greater good of the Grand Army.  Favorable portraits of Prince Eugene (Napoleon's stepson) is also provided.  The campaign and the resulting retreat were indeed a tragic consequence of Napoleon's grand designs.  The description of the retreat and the loss of thousands of troops is griping and is terrific reading.<br /><br />This is a good read for those interested in the Napoleon period.  Tolstoy researched this book when he was writing War and Peace.  The portrait of most of the French characters including Napoleon is very balanced.	2005-02-07

This is a nice book of soldiers/sailors recollection of D-Day.  The book explains the outlook of a sample of soldiers for each of the 5 D-Day beaches and reviews the obstacles which they had to overcome.  Along with the written book, you get two fine CDs of the various soldiers relating their experiences on this famous day.  The oral history along with the summary of the battles gives an in depth picture of what these men had to face on this day.  In my viewpoint, all these men were heroes because of what they had to do.<br /><br />There are other books out there that portray the battle day with more detail (The Longest Day) and some who relate experiences better (most of Ambrose's books).  This is an above average book and the CDs are great material.  The book and CDs are great, but there are better books on this subject.  This book will not disappoint.	2005-02-02

Chace does a good job of detailing why the election of 1912 was so important to the United States.  He describes the four participants in the election of 1912: Wilson, Taft, Roosevelt, and Debs.  Bryan was also a factor in the Democratic nomination of Wilson.  The main focus of this book is how these leaders would affect change in America.  Taft was the conservative and Debs was the radical.  Roosevelt and Wilson were the candidates for the Progressive faction of the country.  Chace describes each candidate and all his positives and negatives.  I didn't know Wilson was such a reactionary on race and immigrant relations, while Roosevelt was generally very liberal on these issues.  All in all a good book about the campaign and why the Republican Party veered to the right.<br /><br />For those interested in the politics of America, this is a good read.  The reader would be surprised to find that the red and blue states have actually changed over the years.  In the past, the South was reactionary and the West was Progressive while the East and Midwest favored the conservative (Republican) issues. Not so today.  Hats off to Chace for writing a good read.	2005-01-26

This book also examines different aspects of the battle itself such as the engineering, medical, journalist parts.  For many, the battle itself was the high point, but beyond that were the planning and engineering that made the victory possible.  This book also points out the command system of the Allies and Nazis.  The Allies had a command system where individual initiative resulted in local commanders changing orders when the need arose versus the Germans who had to seek the Fuhrer's approval for command changes.  Book also had nice little biographies of those who contributed to the victory.<br /><br />A nice read and picture book for those interested in World War II.

A sad story about a ship's crew deserting their quarters to save themselves rather than the passengers they were carrying across the Atlantic.  For those interested in disasters and the maritime trade across the Atlantic, this is a great story.  I have read one other of Shaw's books (Daring the Sea) and this is by far a superior story.  Shaw recreates much of the 1850s trade with Great Britain, and the subsequent disaster, that this is enticing reading.  The hero is Captain Luce who is willing to sacrifice the life of himself and his young son for the passengers.  Ultimately he is one of the survivors through a fluke of fate.  His son dies.  Another hero is the crewman who continued the distress signal until he died.  These people deserved to live, not the rabble who took the life boats.<br /><br />Walter Lord endorsed this book before he passed away.  Since most of Lord's books are great reads, the reader should get a hold of a copy of this book and read this exciting tale.	2005-01-20

A religious fundamentalist seizes control of a major holy place and unleashes terror onto others for their beliefs.  It sounds like 2001, but in fact it was Amritsar, India 1984 and the religious fundamentalist was a person of the Sikh faith called Bhindranwale.  Bhindranwale was a Sikh fundamentalist who believed in establishing the Punjab as a Sikh state.  Hindus, and other Sikhs who didn't believe as he did were murdered and assassinated.  This was all in the name of religion.  Mrs. Gandhi at first didn't tackle this problem and let Bhindranwale seize control of the Sikh holy place called the Golden Temple.<br /><br />When terror continued to be directed from the Golden Temple, Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to seize this place.  Hundreds of Sikhs were killed because of the Sant getting out of control.  Gandhi was later assassinated by a Sikh as a result of her ordering the Golden Temple raid.  This book is the story of this conflict.<br /><br />This is an average read on a very interesting event.  Few books have been written about this conflict.  I think the authors treated all parties from a equal perspective, so this story is not slanted.	2005-01-19

This is a good book detailing why the United States and Great Britain went to war with Saddam's Iraq in 2003.  Obviously the war in Iraq is not over with the spreading guerrilla war against the Coalition Occupation.  The consensus is this was the war to topple the Baath Party and Saddam's dictatorship of Iraq.  This is why Keegan limited the focus of the book to just the regime change in Baghdad.  He also covers the killings of Saddam's sons and the capture of Saddam himself.  For all those who opposed the war, this thoughtful book tells the reasons why it happened.<br /><br />At a little over two hundred pages, this is an easy read, and gives a detailed summary of the stages for the war.  Before the action, Keegan details a short summary of Iraq, along with a chapter about Saddam.  A final summary of what the U.S./U.K. face with the guerrilla challenge should have been added.  This is a good read.	2005-01-15

This a nice short book about the Battle of Tsushima and the Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05.  There have been other books out there on this war, but the author of this 1969 book actually interviewed some of the survivors of this battle to get a clear picture of what happened during this battle.<br /><br />Busch lays out the beginning of this war and why Japan decided to go to battle against the Russian Empire.  Japan was treated like a child with all the other European empires.  She went to war to get some of the spoils of Korea and the Chinese Empire.  Russia was arrogant against this upstart nation.  When Japan pulled a sneak attack on Port Arthur and bottled up the Russian Pacific Fleet, the stage was set for Russian naval  reinforcements for Port Arthur.  The relief fleet was huge and outgunned the Japanese, but as the Japanese Admiral Togo said, 100 shots and hits is greater than 100 shots and 1 hit.  So the Japanese concentrated on the shots making a hit, and the Russians did not hit much with their guns.  The Russians Admirals were humane and brave people, but their people were not experienced enough to score hits.<br /><br />A nice tale of brave men battling the elements in a battle of two empires.  This is a nice book if you can find it.	2005-01-13

His advocacy of a medicinal cream called Firmo was a real laugh.<br /><br />This was an OK read, and I got some insight into the military award process.  I am not sure why Mike Wallace needed to contribute anything to this book.  I guess the Publishers wanted a high name person attached to this book to boost sales.  Wallace's contribution was little, and his writing should not have appeared in the book.	2005-01-11

This is a great read for those interested in the history of the Third World.  India and Pakistan are countries with huge populations and their independence in 1947 was one of turning points in the decolonization of the Third World.  Collins and Lapierre detail this story in this book.  Also detailed are the four people most important in the independence:  Montbatten, Gandhi, Nehru, and Jinnah.  Millions may have lost their life in the Punjab, but it would have been a far bloodier story if these people were not around.  Focus is given on Gandhi who was a most unselfish person, in recognizing the rights of all faiths.  The book details how Gandhi's struggles lead to the independence of India, and how the leaders of the different faiths broke the country up into Pakistan and India.  The last part of the book is the story of the assassination of Gandhi by Hindu fanatics.<br /><br />This is a great read.  At a little over 500 pages, this book will take some time to digest, but it is one of the best books about the independence struggle of Pakistan and India.  This book also sheds some light on the current problems with Kashmir.<br /><br />A great read.	2005-01-11

As if we needed a book about 'evil' people, here is a book that many people have read and is in the discount section of a major book chain.  The choice of these 16 men and women is very subjective.  I would have made other choices, as some of these people either don't deserve to be there ('Bloody' Mary and Rasputin) or are small potatoes (Countess Bathory, Ilse Koch).<br /><br />As one of the previous reviewers have noted, why not add a few such as Mao, Bokassa, the Hutu murderers in Rwanda, Himmiler to name just a few.  These people probably deserve to be identified for what they were.<br /><br />This author has subsequently written many other books about evil people (women, dictators, criminals).  I guess the examples of bad people really sell.  I think the subject of this book are all offensive people and we really don't need a book extolling their 'virtues'.<br /><br />One other comment is the poor writing in this book. As a previous reviewer has noted, there are many grammatical mistakes in this book.  I also noted a historical mistake.  The book stated the father of Nicholas II was Nicholas I.  The real father was Alexander III.  Altogether an alright read.  The reader could pick a better book about a more suitable subject.	2005-01-04

I admire what the Israelis did when an Air France airliner was hijacked by Palestinian and German terrorists in 1976.  In a short time, they opened communications with the terrorists and plotted a raid to secure the hostage's release.  This is an inspirational story of Rabin, Peres and Netanyahu and how they battled the dark forces of Amin and the PFLP terrorists.  The solution to terrorism is to deal with what terrorists understand and that is force.<br /><br />This is a nice read that details the terrorism Israel has faced from her beginning to 1976.  One can understand why Israel reacts the way she does when there is constant terror on innocent civilians in her country.  Israel has become a tough country because so many of her people have been killed because of Arab terrorism.  This is also an inspirational story of Yoni Netanyahu and how he traded his life to free the Air France hostages.	2005-01-03

I picked this book up in the discount section and was prepared to read a boring analysis of American foreign policy.  I was surprised because this is a concise history of the development of American foreign policy.  Professor McDougall also destroys some myths viewed as facts by the American public.  One item is the Monroe Doctrine.  McDougall details what the Monroe doctrine was in reality, not what they tell you in the American history books.  The book is divided into two parts, Promised Land (Old Testament) and Crusader State (New Testament).  In each section, there are four chapters detailing the development and stages of American foreign policy.  I thought the outline and stages of American foreign policy was a nice touch in showing the reader how different things influenced American foreign policy.<br /><br />This is a great read for those trying to figure out American foreign policy.  I actually learned how to view our foreign policy in the light of these eight stages in development and how Iraq and Vietman figure into the equation.  This was written before the present Iraq war so it would be great to see how Professor McDougall views the present conflict.  A good read.	2005-01-03

Spencer wrote this book for young adults, but I thought it a good read for those uneducated in China's history.  Sun Yat-sen was certainly a dreamer and an idealist, but he provided his countrymen with an inspiration for a different China, not the semi-feudal Manchu Empire.  In large result, Sun was responsible for the Revolution that overthrew the Manchus.  He also was an inspiration for the latter Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists.  Both Chinas now pay reverence to his legacy.<br /><br />This is a quick and easy read for those interested in China.  This book is a good read for both the young adult and the adult.	2004-12-30

This is a surprisely good read on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  At only 180 odd pages, many studded with great pictures, there is a lot of history packed into this tight book.  The writing is really clear, so the reader is able to understand what was at stake in each of these conflicts.  The only unfortunate part of this book is the pro-Israeli slant of some of the writing.  Clearly this book sides with the Israelis when it comes down to the portrait of this conflict.  However, I think the author went out of his way to make sure he was fair.  Another aspect that I liked is the description of the equipment and the geo politics taking place in these conflicts.  Again the material was clearly laid out and the reader could draw his conclusions.<br /><br />This is a nice little introductory read on a conflict which still plagues our world.  Barker details the history of this conflict.  Since this was written in 1980, it is rather dated, and as already stated--somewhat pro Israeli.	2004-12-22

This book is a little misleading.  This is supposed to tell of the eyewitness account of the siege of Jerusalem and the birth of Israel.  This is what it says on the cover, but in fact, most of the book talks about Hurnard's belief in God.  It even goes into Biblical prophesy on the second coming when Israel was reborn.  At least half of the book is devoted to Hurnard's belief.  This is what I hate about born again people, they feel they have all the answers and the rest of us are pagans.  Hurnard writes very little about what happened to her during the siege.  She recounts stories about the shells and bombings of her neighborhood, but other than that, not much else.<br /><br />The reader interested in the birth of Israel should avoid this book.  This is a book about faith, and is more at home in the religion section.	2004-12-21

Well, at least you can say that George Washington Plunkitt was a 'honest' politician (not a liar).  He didn't mince words and tell the voters what they wanted to hear, and then didn't deliver.  He delivered a service that the voters of his district could count on.  He provided them with a sense of security which the politicians of this day don't provide.  In a difficult and ever changing world, I am not sure more voters would cherish the ideal of what the machine can give them.<br /><br />Plunkitt rips the civil service ideal in much of this book, while extolling the fruits of rewarded service.  He takes a slash at the education system by constantly making the comparison between book learning and common sense.  As some of the previous reviewers have already stated-his arguments on honest and dishonest graft are almost unbelievable.  The reader will find themselves chuckling at some of his arguments.  This is what machine politicians believed in during their time.<br /><br />This is an OK book.  Ultimately, Plunkitts ideas are out of time, and a more fair system is now in place.	2004-12-20

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't think this book was a great read.  The stories are unique, no doubt.  However bringing them together leads to a disjoint and is not smooth.  One story talked about the Western Front, then the next dealt with the Eastern Front.  There was even a story in there from a Russian soldier.  I tried to interpret these stories into some theme, but the only thing I got was the disorganized nature of the German Army.  The last story from a Waffen SS recruit bordered on unbelieveable, and some of the interpretation mention that some may not be true.  Perhaps a book called Berlin Dance of Death is a better book on the subject, although it is written by only one soldier.<br /><br />This is an OK read, but there are better books out there from German soldiers.  The stories are alright, if the reader is familiar with the last battles of the Third Reich.	2004-12-16

Party	This is an interesting book just for the examination of the assassination of President McKinley.  Rauchway details the shooting of McKinley and the aftermath.  The aftermath was the trial and execution of Leon Czolgosz, the war on anarchism and the rise of the Progressives (Roosevelt and Wilson).  During this short book, I read of the history of the social and political movement at the turn of the last century.  The political legacy was of conservative Republicans allied with big business and capital, with an arch conservative judicial system.<br /><br />McKinley's assassination caused the rise of a different force in the Republican Party.  Roosevelt made the Progressives respectable and caused changes in the political process which modernized the political, social, and economic landscape.  The final portion deals with the assassination attempt on Roosevelt in 1912 which was a reaction to all that Roosevelt accomplished. The assassination of McKinley focused negative press on the Anarchists, and the attempt in 1912 was a reaction to the Progressive policies of 1912.<br /><br />This is a good read.  The only criticism I have is that this book focuses much attention on the human element of one assassin.	2004-12-13

First off, let me say that Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace is one of the best books about why there are still problems in the Middle East.  It should top anybody's list of great historical works.  I really enjoyed it.  I was expecting the same with this work, but unfortunately this book comes up short.  Fromkin's thesis is that there were two wars comprising World War One.  The first one dealt with Serbia and Austria and the second one dealt with Germany versus Russia and France.  It generally paints the Serbs and Russians as peaceful people with just a few bad apples among them.  The Germans are depicted as warmongers and military supremecists.  I am not sure I agree with this depiction.  The Serbs were engaged in some very disturbing activities not just in Bosnia but elsewhere.  Half the Serb population wanted to dissolve Austria-Hungary and pick up pieces to reconstiture a great Serb Empire.  Russia wanted to support its ally in the Balkans after its ruin in the Russian-Japanese War.  Both these nations were not babes in the wood looking for a peaceful solution.  They actively participated in starting the war and that is why I can't accept Fromkin's thesis.<br /><br />I was interested in the politics of the blank check.  It does add color to what is generally understood about the treaty situation in WWI.  Germany needed to back Austria, even though Austria would never back Germany in a similar crisis.  I think that part is believable.  This book gives an interesting theory, but it is the same samo.  Blame the Germans and Austrians because they started it.	2004-12-13

This is a nice edition to the Vietnam literature.  Most have heard of the grunts pounding the ground in South Vietnam and maybe an occasional story of a helicopter pilot, but there have been few stories of the pilots flying out of Thailand and going north to bomb North Vietnam and Laos.  As for this story, Raz does a good job of keeping the interest of the reader as he recounts his training and deployment in the F-105 Thunderchief.<br /><br />The Thunderchief was really an aircraft that should have been kept home and the new Phantom sent instead.  However the author tells the story of his 100 missions over North Vietnam and his bombing runs in various parts of North Vietnam.  He should be proud he served his country in 1966 and later.<br /><br />The reading is light and the flow of the book kept the interest of this reader.  This is a nice story of the difficulties a F-105 pilot experienced in his deployment in Southeast Asia.  I hope Rasimus decides to write a follow up book on his later tour in the Phantom.  Keep wearing that bullerproof mustache, it helps your writing ability.	2004-12-09

This is a fairly old book written by a Professor in the University of Wisconsin system (where I might add I graduated from).  Chew does detail the war very well and some of the writing is interesting.  However, the writing is very, very dry and it took much time to plod through this book.  I have no problem with the accuracy or detail of the book, but this is dry reading.  Since this book was written in the late sixties/early seventies, much material from the Soviet side is also lacking in this book.  If the reader is looking for what Finnish or Soviet units fought in what battle or part of the front, this is a great read.  For those who just want the details of the war, perhaps Frozen Hell is a better(and more modern) book.<br /><br />This is one of the first books about this war in English so I give credit to the author.  Presently, there are better books out there on this war.	2004-12-08

I read this book out of an interest for why someone would throw a promising career away for ideological reasons.  Obviously this book was written after the Soviet Union fell apart, and Blake's reasons for defecting have been swept into the dustbin of history.  George Blake was born of a naturalized Englishman and a Dutch mother.  However, he turned against his adapted country because he believed in Communism.  This despite a harsh life in prison during the Korean War when his embassy was overrun by the North Koreans.<br /><br />Blake's reason for spying don't ring true.  He tells of taking photos of all documents that came his way.  This undoubtably led to the death of many agents in the East Bloc.  He says he had a agreement with the Soviets that nobody would be killed because of his unmasking of British agents in the Soviet Bloc.  Gimme a break.  Several British agents were killed because of his spying. Then he complains of his \\"harsh\\" sentence of 42 years,  Come on, a spy causes the death of several British spys, and then complains of his hard penalty.  If he was on the other side, the Soviets would have placed him in front of a firing squad.  Blake is just trying to justify his most reprehensible behavior in betraying a country that gave him everything.<br /><br />This book gives a very personal history of a traitor.  This is an adequate read for someone interested in the spy wars of the Cold War.	2004-11-27

Whiting's books are good reads, even though he has written so many of them.  This is a book which describes the rivalry of the Allies in breaking the final barrier into the Thousand Year Reich.  By crossing the Rhine, Germany was exposed to the military spearheads of the Western Allies into the very heart of the Nazi Empire.  Competition was between the English, Americans, Canadians, and the French.  Whiting paints a poor portrait of Montgomery and his competitors of Patton, Bradley, and Hodges.  The American generals are shown as disregarding the orders of the Supreme Commander in order to sabotage the reputation of the \\"Old Fart\\" Montgomery.  In the end, Montgomery came in third for the race of bouncing the Rhine.  Hodges and Bradley beat him in crossing the Rhine.  Despite all this, thousands of lives were spent in competition between the Allied Generals.<br /><br />Whiting does an adequate job of describing the various battles before and after the crossings.  This is the fourth book I have read from Whiting and I believe his books inspire a good interest in World War II.	2004-11-27

This is a short book that tends to blame the West for everything which has gone wrong with the Middle East.  I think there is blame to share for everything but this book blames Great Britain and France after World War I and the United States during and after the Nixon Administration.  Throughout the book, it labels the Israelis the aggressors.  Throughout all the book, it absolves the Soviets and Arabs of creating any problems in this theater.<br /><br />This book is an introduction to Western policy toward the Middle East, but I think it fools many into believing the West is to blame for the problems of this region.  I think there are many truths in this short book, but for the unthinking reader it is just another book that blames the West.  This is a complex region and indeed the West has committed plenty of errors here.  However, many of the problems have been committed by the Arabs and other nationalities that live here.  Shlaim needs to focus where the Arab and Muslim World along with Israel have gone wrong, not blame the West for the problems of societies that have not stepped into the 21st Century.<br /><br />I don't buy all what the author is trying to convey in this book.  The reader looking for an introduction to this region probably should go to another book for a more balanced read.	2004-11-23

I recently visited Branson, Missouri and picked up a copy of this book.  Branson residents assure me this book is true and is based on Wright's visit to this region in the late 1800s.  At the end of the story, Wright's image appears as the artist painting the Ozark mountains.  I saw the cabin where much of the story takes place.<br /><br />For those interested in a book that is as lively as Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn, this is a good addition.  Why, because the language is much the same as what Twain uses in his book.  The author was once a minister, and the main character in the book is a former minister working as a shepherd of a flock of sheep.<br /><br />The reader should understand there are plenty of references to God in this book, but this is not the main tenet of this book.<br /><br />This is a pleasant read and there is an inspirational message in the story.  I read this 250 odd page book in less than a day, so the reading is light and at first difficult due to the language used.  However, I would recommend this book to anyone desiring to read about the endless conflict of right versus wrong.  This book is based on true events.	2004-11-23

The cover of this book compares it to the Endurance.  Well, I disagree.  This is a very enjoyable read, and the adventure is certainly there but this book only rates 3 1/2 stars for me.  First of all the author tries to rate the commander of the Speedwell and he is a difficult character to rate.  He is a master sailor, but he also usurps the authority of his commander and the owners.  As time has passed, he has become respectable whereas some of the other characters are termed felons, mutineers, and socialists.  Since this happened way back in the 1719-1720 period, it is hard to get a good handle on all the personalities from the ship.<br /><br />As stated, the adventure is certainly in this book.  These British seamen were all privateers wanting the partake of the riches of the Spanish Main.  They raided ships and wrecked their own ship.  They were marooned on an island where they constructed a ship to escape.  After several more captures of Spanish ships, they sailed across the Pacific in a worn out vessel and eventually some of the crew returned to Great Britain. This was the best part of the read.  The reader will gain a little history of sailor's living conditions during this time and the Great Power politics of Great Britain, Spain, and France.	2004-11-20

Davies is a fine historian of Poland and he is at best in describing about this little known war.  Few people know that Poland invaded the Ukraine in 1919 or that Russia invaded Poland in 1920.  Davies describes these see saw battles in this book and how it affected the rest of Europe.  Despite what one reviewer descibed at the saving of Western civilization by Poland, Davies is prettly harsh with his evaluations of the participants in the war.  Lloyd George was fickle in his lack of support of the Polish.  The French were spineless (and still are) in their support of the Polish when the Russians invaded.  Lenin swayed back and forth between building socialism in one country, or causing revolution worldwide.  Pilsudski was a military dictator.  The Germans were disinterested.<br /><br />This is a nice read on a little known war.  Few people know that the Russian Revolution might have been crushed if the Russians had defeated the Polish and invaded Germany.  If this had happened the French and British would have had to stop the Red Menace for good and destroyed the Bolshevik Revolution.  This is a good read for those interested in the aftermath of the First World War.	2004-11-19

Great pictures and that is what this book delivers.  Unlike other books dealing with Pearl Harbor, this Life book examines the conditions in both the U.S. and Japan, then goes in detail about the attack, and then shows some of the personal glimpses of some of the participants sixty years later.  This book excels in both its photos and personal portrayals of people.<br /><br />There are some flaws in this book.  An experienced person can pick them out quite easily.  For instance, it talks about the battleship Shaw blowing up, well the Shaw was a destroyer.  It also details the invasion of Belgium and Netherlands, and states the invasion of France was later, both invasions occurred at the same time.  There were other mistakes, so hopefully this does not confuse the beginning historian.<br /><br />This book was a OK read, and the pictures are great.	2004-11-09

This squadron composed chiefly of two heavy cruisers and three light cruisers roamed the Pacific from the start of the war till December.  It inflicted a stinging defeat of a British squadron at Coronel, and was subsequently defeated and all five big ships sunk by two battleships off the Falklands.<br /><br />This author has many good books about naval matters, but unfortunately most are out of date.

This is a brief story of a B-24 bomber crew that had to leave their plane after bombing an airport near Hannover, Germany.  The nine members of the crew were captured by German military.  After capture, eight of the members were being marched to a Stalig POW camp. They had to disembark their train because of damage to the railway lines from a RAF attack the previous night. This raid caused considerable damage to the nearby town of Russelsheim, home of the Adam Opel Werks, a munitions and auto plant.  Most of the German civilians of this town were unharmed, although many of the slave laborers were killed in the RAF raid.<br /><br />As they were marched through the town, they were set upon by the German civilians and six were killed.  Most were stoned, beaten with hammers, 2 by 4s, and shovels.  A local Nazi official shot four of them with his pistol, gang land style.  Of course, when the American Army marched into this town, many forgot about this crime and said they had no part in it.  The story reviews the trial and the execution of six of the murderers.  Three others (two women) were later released after serving jail terms.  These three had been condemned to death.  Other civilians of this riot were also given jail terms.<br /><br />The author tries to evoke some sympathy for the German civilians and refers to the bomber crews as Terror Fliers.  Well, I wasn't taken in by this kind talk.  What this pack of 150 civilians did was cold blooded murder.  Justice was served by Leon Jaworski, latter of Watergate fame, who made sure the leaders of the pack got what they deserved--the hangman's noose.  The people I feel sorry for were these poor men being stoned to death, or the slave laborers at the Adam Opel Werks.  Those would be the people to feel sorry for.  I give the author credit for writing about something that wasn't known.  This book predates Flyboys, so the author should be credited with writings an interesting story.	2004-11-06

During my younger days, I flew Pan Am to several of its world wide destinations such as London, Frankfurt, West Berlin, Montivideo, Buenos Aires, Miami, and New York Kennedy.  I always liked this airline because of its exotic destinations, but at that point the planes were really old.<br /><br />The book is a great read detailing the early starting of Pan Am by Juan Trippe and others.  It progresses with Trippe being a visionary in the fifties/sixties with the 707 and 747. These planes really revolutionized the way the public traveled.  Along the way, the author tells the story of the Skygods, old flying boat pilots who flew their planes any way they wanted.  Sometimes they crashed their planes, and after a series of accidents, Pan Am instituted safety procedures that resulted in the company becoming one of the safest.  After Trippe retired,<br /><br />Pan Am's CEOs became just plain bad, and flew the airline into the ground.  The book does answer why Pan Am went Tango Uniform<br /><br />(bankrupt).  Some of the reasons detailed in the book:<br /><br />  1.  Purchasing National Airlines at an inflated price and then<br /><br />  moving National's personnel up the pay level to Pan Am's<br /><br />  level.<br /><br />  2.  Unfair advantages by foreign carriers for passengers<br /><br />  (landing rights, government assistance, and other fees).<br /><br />  3.  No domestic network in the sixties and seventies, even<br /><br />  though the domestics were expanding with international<br /><br />  routes.  This is where the Federal Government was<br /><br />  responsible by tying the hands of Pan Am.<br /><br />  4.  Poor leadership<br /><br />The last portion of the book details how Pan Am was sold piecemeal to satisfy the creditors, and then the failure in 1991 after the sale of the remaining European routes to Delta.<br /><br />Gandt is a former pilot with Pan Am, and throughout the book, he details the fall of the Skygods.  His story includes many personal ones which add interest to the story.  Pan Am may not fly anymore, but it is not forgotten.  This is a great read for anybody interested in the airline business.y includes many personal ones which add interest to the story.  Pan Am may not fly anymore, but it is not forgotten.

This is a good read for those interested in one of our Great Presidents.  It also shows the machine politics which infected Missouri in the 1930-1940s.  Tom Pendergast was the leader of the Kansas City, Missouri machine which put forward its candidates for local, state, and national politics.  The real election was not in November, but during the primary when the Democrats made the choice of who their candidates would be.  During the general election,the Pendergast machine rigged their wards well with only marginal votes for Republican candidates.<br /><br />It was not true democracy.  Pendergast was convicted of income tax evasion after he didn't declare bribes he \\"earned\\" in an insurance settlement scheme.  The book details Truman's 1940 Senate election campaign as he attempted to revive his fortunes following the fall of his mentor Tom Pendergast.  Truman did not forsake his mentor (neither did he mention him) but managed to defeat the seating governor and prosecutor for his Senate position.<br /><br />This is a short book.  The first chapter doesn't read correctly and the flow is not there.  The detail and interest are, and the following chapters have more page turning drama in them.  Truman won the campaign and must have impressed FDR since in 1944, Roosevelt gave him the Veep position.  The book also details the duplicity of FDR in his dealings with other Democrats.	2004-10-30

This is a nice little book about the history of the island and its people.  The history of the island begins with its first Indian population.  The history concludes with the election of Prime Minister Edward Seaga.  The history includes the brief Spanish period, the occupation by the British, the introduction of slavery and sugar during the 1600s and the 1700s, the British Crown Colony, and independence from 1962 to 1980.  The history includes Jamaica's interaction with the rest of the world, and Jamaica's contribution to the West.<br /><br />For those visiting Jamaica on a beach vacation, this is a nice little read.  Although short, it is full of good information about this country.  This book is also full of nice historical pictures.  I picked this book up in a second hand store in Jamaica, so it might be difficult to obtain a copy in Jamaica, so use Amazon to procure a copy.	2004-10-25

I believe the author to be a well versed authority on the subject he is writing about which is the rise of political Islam.  This book gives a valid critique of many of the regimes of the Middle East, and the West's policy toward this vast region.  Since this book was written before 9/11, it does not include any of the current developments in this region.  Huband slants his writings against the West (and in particular the U.S.) and Israel.  Therefore we get many criticisms of the U.S. in its policy against Iraq and as a occupying force in Saudi.  We also get the comments of duplicity by the Israelis in their policy against the Palestinians.  I think both comments are off the mark, and that is one reason I rated this book only a three star.<br /><br />This is a short book, but the language used in the writing of this book makes it unnecessaryly difficult.  The reader will learn of how the failures of the present Middle East regimes gave rise to political Islam.  Failures in providing social services also gave rise to the Fundamentals.  I also think the author panders to much to the Middle East audience.  He blames the policies of the West and those of the elite which rule these countries of the Middle East.  A difficult read and one not recommended for the beginning historian.	2004-10-25

Gordon summarizes the great amount of information into an a very readable 250 pages.  Gordon also gives some short biographies of some of the very interesting characters of Wall Street such as Alexander Hamilton, Commodore Vanderbilt, J. P. Morgan, Hetty Green, and Dick Whitney.  This history tells the rise of stock trading on Wall Street to the present period.  It is interesting to see why initially the Dutch and the geographical position of New York assured Wall Street of becoming a world financial power of the first degree.  This book details why the initial advantages plus the innovation of the financial leaders gave Wall Street the premier financial position in the world.<br /><br />This book is well written with short biographies and historical summaries of the rise of Wall Street.  This is a good initial read since it will show the reader why the NYSE and Wall Street become the financial leaders they are today.	2004-10-25

A good little read, especially for those who think they have it difficult.  I had not known of Shackelton's amazing voyage until I read this book.  Alexander certainly has done the research to draw on the what happened when the Endurance got stuck in the ice and Sir Ernest's boat journey to South Georgia island.  It is amazing to find how Shackelton led his men to their salvation dispite all the difficulties they faced with survival in the Arctic.<br /><br />This book is amply supplied with photographs from the journey with suitable explanations.  As stated previously, Alexander has done a great job detailing the history of the trip, along with short biographies of the key players in the expedition. The photos (all black and white) are simply great to look through.  A good read.	2004-10-19

Most historians of the Eastern Front detail the big battles that were the key turning points such as Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Kursk.  Howver, most overlook Operation Bagration which occured at the same time as the Normandy landings.  Bagration freed Belarus from the Nazi occupation and cost the Germans over 300,000 soldiers.  This battle forced the Germans to retreat to the pre war borders of Poland and handed the Russians the opportunities to force the Germans onto the defensive.  This book gives the reader an overview of the battle and its later effects.  Since it is a summary short read, there is no in depth discussion but the overview is sufficient.<br /><br />This is a good summary read for the military historian.  The book is chock full of photos and technical details of the battle.	2004-10-19

There is a certain amount of revisionist history floating around that the slave/master relationship was one of benefits to both slave and master.  Katz puts this to bed by saying resistance was fairly common and the master/slave relationship was one of exploiter/exploited.  Not only did slaves take over ships (Amistad), but they escaped to the North and Canada, started slave rebellions, and resisted in the plantation, factories, and homes of the slave holders.  Slaves also destroyed the plantation economy of Santo Domingo and hung their slave masters.<br /><br />Katz relays in this thin book about how slavery debased humanity for both the black and white population.  This is a good short book about why slavery needed to end and answers the charges of the revisionist historians.	2004-10-15

This book has an interesting theme and is an original subject.  I am notat all sure what Masters writes is true, since this history is very long ago, and the sources are not there.  It seems probable that Machiavelli met and knew DaVinci.  It seems clear that DaVinci tried to use the Arno initially to cut off the water for Pisa, and later to improve the commercial position of Florence and the city's boss Borgia.  The book does show how DaVinci was ahead of his time in trying to damm and control a river.<br /><br />This book drags at time and has lots of related material thrown in.  I did learn a little more about the characters of Borgia, DaVinci, and Machiavelli.  An alright read.	2004-10-15

This is a great book.  The story takes place in 1962 when a black veteran James Meredith tries to enroll in University of Mississippi.  Since Ole Miss is a white school, he is refused.  After court injunctions, the Mississippi state government and Governor Ross Barnett flatly refuse to enroll Meredith.  The Federal Government through similar attempts also tries to enroll Meredith.  Finally two weeks into the fall semester, Federal Marshalls and government troops are called into action to enroll Meredith.  White students and right wing radicals from surrounding states decide to confront Meredith and the registration process and a riot/battle ensures.  The battle is the climax of the book.  It is amazing this happened in my lifetime.  I am surprised how narrow minded these people were in intregating the University of Mississippi.<br /><br />I commend Doyle on a great book.  He tells the story with suspense so it becomes a page turner.  This is not a short book, but the reading flows well and it becomes an easy read because of how the author approaches the subject.  This book also is well researched and is ground breaking telling the reader of a little known conflict that most people now would like forgotten.<br /><br />Great story.	2004-10-14

Jannen's book is the book a reader should review/consume prior to reading Tuchman's The Guns of August.  As Jannen rightly describes, in 1914, Europe was full of lions.  Diplomacy was the field of leisurely aristocrats.  Jannen's story begins with the assassination of Austrian Archduke Ferdinand on June 28, 1914.  As Jannen relates, the Serbian government had a BLACK HAND influence in the assassination of the Archduke.  From there begins the game of contests, first between Serbia and Austria Hungary, then between Germany and Russia, and finally between Germany and France/Great Britain.  As each succesive days ticks down in July, 1914, the diplomats/politicians rachet up the stakes with each other until war was the only possibility.  When the war finally ended 4+ years later, all the initial participants wondered how war came upon their nation.<br /><br />I never knew that the history of diplomacy could be so page turning.  Jannen's book should be a requirement for diplomats/foreign service personnel.  The world might be a different place if not for the Lions of July, 1914.	2004-10-12

There is a lot of loose, angry talk in this book.  There is also plenty of passing references to national origin.  As a conservative to moderate Republican, I don't agree with the language, views, and attitudes of Savage.  I can understand where he is coming from because of the liberal bias of the media and uneven playing field. Savage has some good points in these arguments, so that is why I rated it a 2 star than lower.<br /><br />One reason I don't read books from conservative political commentators is for the reason of Savage's book.  The book makes all liberals to be against this nation, which I don't think is the case (with the exception of Michael Moore).  The struggle between conservatives and liberals is the reason this country is great.  The nation is more balanced.  If we all followed the tenents of Savage, then this nation would be a right wing dictatorship and very few immigrants would come to this country.<br /><br />This book is thought provoking if the reader can get beyond the abusive language.	2004-10-10

I read this book back in the 80s and it is still quite relevant today.  It talks about a fictional company called Punctuation and how it lost market share to an up and coming company.  The reason they lost market share was due to quality.  How to reverse that trend is the nature of this story.  Suffice to say many companies (and bosses) continue to fall into the same traps to regain their market share and profitablity.<br /><br />This is a great and quick read about what quality should be.  Since it is so brief and the language is so simple, most reading audiences can easily understand the topic and moral of the story.  It would be a great book to hand out to production, service, and management personnel.	2004-10-10

As some of the previous authors have already noted, this book is cleary marked for the conspiracy minded, and those who hate the Japanese monarchy.  It is revisionist history at its extreme.  Also it takes a lot of swipes at the Republican Party, even though it is a book about the Japanese monarchy.  It is dedicated to Diane Fienstein, the liberal Democratic Senator from California.  Where to begin?<br /><br />Up to Chapter 9, this was a very believable book.  It discussed the Meiji and Tashio Emperors and the first stages of Hirohito's rule.  Then it became unbelievable.  First it talked about how Roosevelt let Pearl Harbor happen.  There have been many books about this but suffice to say, this is VERY REVISIONIST, and probably not true.  Then it questions the courage of MacArthur.  Most historians don't debate his courage, but the Seagraves thought they could throw it in there.  It also suggested MacArthur was interested in the 1940 Republican nomination, when this is clearly not true.  Then it talks about the 1936 coup attempt in Tokyo as being very liberal, when in fact they were very militeristic and anti democractic.  This book takes swipes at Hoover as encouraging the corruption of the post war Japanese government and suggested he took a bribe of several million dollars.  Hoover devoted most of his life to public service and charities, so it is hard to believe the Seagrave's nonsense.  Then there were all the stories of the billions of dollars of gold and gems looted from the conquered Asian countries.  There were so many billions tossed around as sure facts, that I lost track if there was that much gold in the world. The Seagraves then detail all the corruption of post war Japan and blame it on Americans, the monarchy, and the rich strata of Japan.  It was hard to read this stuff when the documentation is just not there.<br /><br />This is a hard book to swallow.  Part of this book is history, and the last 100 pages is pure fiction.  When an author puts one controversial subject in a book, it is open to discussion.  These authors threw in literally a hundred controversial subjects (loot, gold, blame for Pearl Harbor, corruption,) and ask the reader to believe them.  Please!!!!  Stick to the facts Seagraves, and no more treasure stories.  One gets sick of so much fantasy in a history book.rsial subject in a book, it is open to discussion.

The author does a good job of detailing why George Washington was a great man.  Rather than become a King or dictator after the War of Independence, he returned his commission to the Congress and returned to Mount Vernon.  This was after eight years of separation from his home.  His only desire was to depart from the public stage and resume his private life.  This was unlike most people who would have clung to power.  Washington wanted to become a private citizen again.  This book details his change from a military general to a private citizen.<br /><br />Washington takes control of New York from the departing British,<br /><br />says farewell to his soldiers and other officers, returns the commission to the Congress in Annapolis, and gets home in time for a Mount Vernon Christmas Eve.  This brief period says alot what Washington was and why people wanted him to be their leader.<br /><br />Weintraub does a good summary job of describing this two week episode in the life of the first American President.  By his example, the military would always be controlled by the civilian government.  The importance of Washington is shown in this short story and good read.	2004-10-05

Ascherson dispels the notion that Poland was just another backward East European nation.  The first chapter details the early history of the country and most of the later chapters details the independence, inter-war period, WWII, and the post war Communist domination of this nation.  Poland is indeed a unique nation.<br /><br />Poland was one of the first democracies of the world.  After the partitions, Poland didn't cease to exist, but lived on with the people who lived in Austrian Galicia, Prussia's Silesia, and the Russian dominated Kingdom of Poland.  The author details these struggles with the three large powers, and later struggles with the U.S.S.R. and Nazi Germany.  As the Pope stated, Poland doesn't exist on any particular land, but in the hearts of its people.<br /><br />This is good informative short read.  There are plenty of pictures in this book that add to the good writing.  For more information about Poland, read Halleck book on the History of Poland.	2004-10-01

For those seeking a biography of the man or his military accomplishments, this book does not fit the bill. Horne focuses on the political, economic, artistic, and scientific accomplishments of Napoleon and the Napoleonic Regime.  So this book focuses on an area not covered by most authors.  Since Napoleon is a topic that many authors have attempted, Horne focuses on an area not usually written about.  Napoleon changed a lot in France, and Horne outlines both his accomplishments (Code of Napoleon for law, and scientific research) and his failures (theater, opera, and literature).<br /><br />This is not an easy read, despite its brevity.  It is a read that will enlighten a Napoleonic historian.  However, the subjects and concepts are more difficult to understand than the<br /><br />military victories.	2004-09-27

One hears about some very familiar disasters, but I was not familiar with the General Slocum steam boat disaster.  Over 1,000 people (mainly women and children) died in this disaster on the East River.  O'Donnell does a superb job of detailing New York at the turn of the century and the dangers associated with steamship travel.  Then he goes into great detail about the disaster and the aftermath of the sinking of the General Slocum.<br /><br />I believe O'Donnell does a fair job of detailing who failed in this disaster. The owner, USSIS, and the Captain all were to blame for this dangerous situation.  The result was the decimation of a large German immigrant church community.<br /><br />O'Donnell's short chapters, and his coverage from all angles gives the reader a clear picture of the disaster.

The title says it all and De Jonge delves not only into the biography of his subject, but also the times that spawned this unique creature.  If one was raised in the Western tradition, then the spiritualism of the East is often difficult to understand. In this book the author gives us an idea of why someone like Rasputin could rise to the level he did and influence the very level of command he did.  I think other biographies of Rasputin are not on the level of this one because they focus strictly on the scandalous nature of Rasputin, and not the culture that created it.<br /><br />After reading the author's work on the Weimar Republic, I was a little disappointed.  This book is five star all the way.  Not only is it easy to read, but the author researched his subject for many years.  It may not be the ultimate text on Rasputin, but is definitely the most readable and understandable.	2004-09-25

I would not determine it revisionist, since it examines the efficiency of the Prussian Army and the total incompitence of the Austro-Hungarian militay.  In fact, Professor Wawro alludes to the fact that the Austro-Hungarians almost talked themselves into defeat.<br /><br />Wawro demonstates why Prussia and Sardinia won this war, and why the Austro-Hungarians lost.<br /><br />At times, this book was a difficult read.  Both my Dad and I read this book.  My Dad states this book reads like a history thesis, and since he has a Master's in History, I believe him.  It is not the easiest read, but the reader will get an understanding of the war and the ultimate outcome for Europe.  Since then, Wawro has come out with a book on the Franco-Prussian War.  I can't wait to start this book and compare it to Howard's book on the same subject.<br /><br />For one wanting to understand the rise of Prussia and the decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, this is a challenging but enjoyable read.  A good read.	2004-09-25

I like his style.  I read Black Hawk Down in two days, and I read this book in the same time.  If someone wants an intensive read, these are both great reads.  Anybody will realize the outcome of this book.  It is the killing of an evil man.  In this book though, you also see the debate between people about the methods used in the killing of this evil man.  There are some that will only use civilized, lawful means.  Others will use means that will destroy the evil using the methods used by the evil men.  I think we face the same problem today with Osama.  How do we destroy evil using the methods of the civilized world.  Bowden relates the stories of Los Pepes, and the use of methods to take apart the infrastructure of Pablo Escobar's empire.<br /><br />This is a great book.  For those wanting a great read for several days, this would be a great read and a great addition to your library.	2004-09-20

A few years ago, the story came out on how 946 American soldiers died when practice landings on the Devon Coast in Great Britain went terribly wrong.  This was due in no small part to Ken Small who lived in the region and beach combed as a hobby.  Small describes how he uncovered this little known story and the remains of this landing.  Along with the raids by German E-boats, several tanks sank during the initial landing.  Small uncovered one tank and arranged that it be brought ashore, repaired, and displayed as a memorial to those soldiers who died.  He battled both the American and British governments to accomplish this.  He also spent a small fortune in this effort.<br /><br />I admire the courage and fortitude of this man.  The book is his testament to the deaths of these 946 Americans, and the grateful expression of one English man for their sacrifice.  This is a pleasant read for those who think all Europeans have forgotten what the USA did for Europe in WWII.	2004-09-20

I will not rate this book 1 or 2 stars just because it is less history and more theory, but I think some of the previous reviewers are right in disagreeing with some of the authors statements.  Fernandez-Armesto comes up with some quite interesting reasons why Latin America developed so differently than the United States and Canada.  This is less history and more theory and conjecture.  The reader should at least be open to some of these theories, because they can explain some of the reasons north and south developed so differently.  Perhaps it was economic, political, or geographical, but Fernandez-Armesto tries desperatly to point that it was not the ethnic make up of the population.  I agree with the author, but he should make that point up front, rather than dance around it.<br /><br />This book is an OK read.  Some of the other books in this series are more history than theory, so I was a bit put off by the subtitle of a hemispheric history, when in fact it is some theories about the inequality in the continent.  The reader should keep an open mind to these theories, since they may prove to be true.	2004-09-14

Lots of books have been written about Lincoln.  Most tackled this subject through Presidential Papers.  Few took the time to look at those who knew Lincoln.  Holzer does this by reading all the available material about Lincoln and getting together the writings of those people who knew Lincoln.  This book is a summary of some of those people remembering Lincoln.  It is great reading.<br /><br />One is struck by the Lincoln in this book.  He comes across as a very human person.  He was ugly and not very cultured.  He was smart, friendly, and did not take on an attitude with his high position.  He was approachable and easy to talk with.  A baby sitter reveals his humanity with her encounters.  He was not a racist, in a age when most white people were.  He was ready to forgive a people who broke the nation apart.  He was a rare human being.  This comes across in the writting.<br /><br />For those interested in the real Abe Lincoln, this is a great book.	2004-09-11

Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty	Books	4	3	5	N	N	The history of the Bush/Walker clan and the rise of George W	This is a nice book detailing the history of the Bush/Walker clan and the early life of George W. Bush.  There is a lot of trash out there about this man and his politics, so it is hard to get a good biography of him.  Make no mistakes, Minutaglio reveals a lot of the unsavory side of George W., but it is unbiased and he deals in facts.  He also covers the strengths of this man, so the reader can get the good and the bad about him.  The author only reveals the facts of his National Guard stint and the glosses over the drug allegations, so the reader cannot judge the current controversy over these allegations.  I enjoy a book dealing in facts and not conservative/liberal conjecture.  Minutaglio does a good job in this.<br /><br />I especially like how Minutaglio reveals the personal relationship of George W. with his father.  This is probably the most difficult aspect of this book, but the author summarizes their relationship well.  Few other authors have attempted this with George W.<br /><br />For those wanting a good biography of our 43rd President, this is nice book and read.  For those wanting to read trash, go elsewhere--there is plenty to pick from.	2004-09-11

I liked this book because it paints the good and bad about George W. Bush.  Bruni covered the Bush Campaign for the New York Times.  In this book, he reveals the real George Bush and the close election of 2000.  There were lots of colorful insight and also jokes played during this campaign.  What this book revealed was an uncomplicated man who was seeking the presidency.  Bush also could laugh at himself, including his fumbling of the English language.  The Presidency was not his all consuming passion as it was for Al Gore.  This knowledge validated my vote for Bush.<br /><br />Bruni covers only the campaign and the aftermath of the election.  There is only a little background history of Bush before his presidential run.  There are no photos in this book.  The book is strictly a look at Bush's run for the White House in 2000.	2004-09-09

I have read two other of Murphy's books about disasters, and this is along the same line.  Murphy breaks down the Yellow Fever epidemic which savaged Philadelphia from August, 1793 to October, 1793.  During this plague, 4,000 to 5,000 people died in the largest American city at the time.  Both the Federal and State governments were incapacitated from this plague and had no control.  George Washington moved back to Mount Vernon for several months.  The rich fled for rural areas.  What was left were poor people left to fend for themselves and some die hard patriots that tried to help.  Murphy tells the story of the plague and how the sickness ran its course.  The city eventually survived and made a full recovery.<br /><br />This was a good read, although not like Murphy's other books.  A young reader can easily cover this book in two days.  This is a good read for adults too.  Another good read from Murphy.	2004-09-09

Endeavour was the small ship that Captain Cooke first ventured to the South Seas with.  Her crew of little under a hundred people was outfitted for a voyage which would take over two years to complete.  Cooke is like Columbus to Australia, and Endeavour was like the Santa Maria.  In this book, Macarthur details the crucial aspects of life aboard this small ship.  Cooke shared his suite with a number of different scientists.  This voyage must have been very difficult and life in cramped quarters must have been a trying experience.  A replica was built of the Endeavour in the nineties and there are some nice pictures in the book of this vessel.  This short book is well illustrated.<br /><br />Unless you are a person interested in Cooke or his travels, this book has little appeal to the average reader.  It is a short summary of the history of a famous ship.	2004-09-07

Another fine book for young readers by Jim Murphy.  I was not aware of the history of the March, 1888 Blizzard on the East Coast and this very readable short book gave me the low down of the tragedy people had to endure when two storm systems met off the East Coast.  The book focused the attention on New York, but other localities were also included.  Several hundred people died as a result of this storm, so I was surprised when I read this book.  The author modeled this book for young readers, but it can be of interest to the adult.  In a short read, an adult can get a brief history of this terrible storm.<br /><br />A good little read for those interested in tragedies.  The authors writings are smooth, and the flow is good.  It is an easy read.	2004-09-03

I have read the other reviewers and I have to agree this is a great read for the young adult and for that matter everybody else.  Murphy does not get bogged down in great details but simply tells the story from the perspective of a handful of individuals.  Along with this, the author provides numerous illistrations and maps detailing the progress of the fire from its origin at O'Leary's barn.  The writing is smooth and gives urgency to read just a few more pages.  This is the best type of writing to urge younger people to read.<br /><br />This is a great little book for readers of all ages.  The author focuses on the young adult as an audience, but his writing style is better than most other authors vying for a more sophisticated reader.	2004-09-02

I enjoyed two of Whiting's previous books, but this one was hard to follow.  One of the previous reviewers stated this work was rambling.  I have to agree.  The flow in this book from chapter to chapter was terrible.  The author would review one section about the Red Orchestra, then in the next chapter review some aspect of Roehm, Boring, Nebe's life.  One had a hard time with what the author was trying to prove.  Intermingled in this writing was slugs of information about Gestapo Muller.  It almost appeared that the author had a hard time finding enough material about Muller, so anything related to him was thrown into the book.<br /><br />This could have been a good book if the author had focused on the subject.  Rather he threw everything in, including the kitchen sink.  I did learn something about Gestapo Muller, so that is why I rated this two stars.  Otherwise this was a poor read.	2004-08-30

Personally, I like this author and I have a few of his books.  This one was an average read because in a brief 200 pages, Fest describes the last days of Hitler.  Trevor Roper's book even though ancient gives a better picture of the last days of Hitler than Fest's book.  In Fest's book, one gets glimpses of Hitler in his last days of life.  Gone are the great expectations of German Empire, and one can get a glimpse of the crazy man who led Germany for 12 years.  Fest gives only glimpses of Hitler and life in the bunker.  One cannot get a definitive account of all the activities of that period.  One can get a better image with Trever Roper's book.<br /><br />I enjoyed some of the information in this book, but definitive it is not.  There are better books out there than this, so if one wants a summary, this is a nice book.  However if one wants a more through book, they should look elsewhere.	2004-08-23

The author has written many books on WWII and has befriended many old Nazis.  One of the books the author has written was on the Massacre at Malmady.  What the author did with his previous book about Malmady is add chapters on Jochen Peiper.  So therefore the reader gets a brief history of Peiper, the discussion on what happened when SS troopers opened fire on American POWs, and then the murder of Peiper in the 1970s by mysterious persons.<br /><br />The author argues that Peiper was far away from the scene of the shootings, did not give written orders how to treat POWs, and then later saved 150 American POWs who were captured and released.  Whiting gives the view that Peiper was innocent of the charges of shooting these American prisoners.  He also details the reaction of American soldiers following the discovery of the massacre.  In this case, SS troops captured were also shot, rather than taken prisoner.  The trials of the SS Waffen troops was also detailed.<br /><br />I am reading my third book by Whiting.  His books provide the accepted view of what really happened during this time period.  His books lack detail that make other history books more substancial in their view.  In this book, you get a tiny history of Peiper, more on the massacre, and then a little look at Peiper's murder.  More detail would have silenced others who have criticized Whiting's books,	2004-08-23

The author Karl Zinsmeister describes his thirty days in March and April, 2003 fighting with the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division on the invasion of Iraq.  Zinsmeister was an embedded journalist reporting for several magazines and papers.  He describes his experiences during these thirty days.  The U.S. Army is indeed a unique institution, and the author had unfettered access to the rank and file as well as the command of this division.<br /><br />The author is of the conservative persuasion and makes this known throughout the book.  He lambasts the liberal media, as well as the liberals in Canada and Europe for opposing the war.  Since I think like him, I agree with what he had to say, but in some readers opinions, this might not be the best objectivity in available war books.  Whatever his views, Zinsmeister makes it known that the Army used all resources to keep civilian casualities and collateral damage at a minimum.  This is reassuring, since the media tend to focus on the negative in a conflict like this.<br /><br />This is a very readable book.  At a little over 200 pages, this is a short read on one journalist's perspective of the war.	2004-08-18

I heard about this successful raid, and finally I stumbled upon this great little book describing the raid.  The book starts by describing the thought process of Wallace who thought the dams would be a worthy target of British bombers.  The floods would destroy factories and limit the output of water and energy in the industrial Ruhr area.<br /><br />Wallace had to surmount bomber limitations, design a new type of bomb, and devise a method on how to deliver the bomb load against the side of the dam.  These processes are all investigated and solved in the course of this book.  The final bombing run is the high point of the book with the successful destruction of the dams.  The loss in bomber crews plus the German civilian losses are also summarized.  I wish the book could have focused more on the later aspects of the raid, rather than the science that went in solving how to destroy the dams.  Otherwise a great read.	2004-08-17

Haykal does a good job of detailing the rise and fall of Anwar Sadat.  For those in the know, when Sadat was assassinated, few of the populace mourned the passing of this great man.  He led the Arabs to victory, and he made a great gamble and went to Jerusalem to seek peace.  The peace dividend did not amount to much, and the Israelis used Sadat to some extent.<br /><br />Haykal who is a prominent journalist in Egypt details the conditions in Sadat's Egypt.  They were conditions which were similar to the Shah's Iran.  Both Christians and Muslims were very discontented.  The IMF wanted food subsidies to go down which caused rioting in the streets.  Parliament, journalists, and the bureaucrats were muzzled.  Haykal details this in the majority of the book.<br /><br />The last two sections of the book deal with the unrest and assasination of Sadat.  I was not in full agreement with what the author stated in the summary.  He detailed how Sadat gave in to an imperial Israel who was trying to dominate the region.  I felt like saying give me a break.  He stated that Israel was the main terrorist in the region.  Of course that would explain how Palestinians like to hijack aircraft and blow things up.  This is the typical poor Arab, bad Jew views expressed in most Arab areas.  It is not objective and does not hold up to the available evidence.<br /><br />Sadat was human.  He broke the mode by choosing peace rather than endless war.  He had democratic tendencies, but he was an authoritarian leader.  This book pointed out all Sadat's weaknesses but also gave this man credit for what he did.  Muslim fundamentalist terrorists killed this great man, but Haykal points out that if he was not killed, he might have been overthrown.  I have read Sadat's autobiography In Search of Identity, but reading this book gives a more balanced view of this great man.	2004-08-16

For such a difficult subject, Pagden does a good job of creating a readable book detailing the rise and fall of European Empires.  From Alexander the Great, and the Roman Empire to the decline of the British Empire, Pagden details the rise of these empires and why they fell.  In the end, it was the weakness of the colonizers along with the rise of nationalism which spurred the end of all empires.  Pagden also details that some of the early empires were not racially divided, but with the rise of science and some of the new European nation states, racism along with slavery reared its ugly head.  Commerce and the search for raw materials spurred on the exploitation of these colonies, and reduced the natives to subject status.<br /><br />This is a nice theory book about why empires came about.  It gives a lot of information in a few short pages.	2004-08-14

Although I don't subscribe to Buckley's conservative ethics, this was a good read for such a short book.  It took me all of one day to go through this book.  What I liked best is the first chapters talking about the loss of population in East Germany due to the easiness of walking into West Berlin and emigrating to West Germany.  The erection of the wall prevented this exodus in 1962.  It simply stopped the flow and erected the barrier to the population shift.  What I dispute is Buckley's view that the East Germans would have stopped the building if a few American tanks rolled over the barbed wire barricades to assert their rights of the four powers in Berlin.  This might have started a Third World War.  Perhaps Buckley has seen some documentation that I don't know about.  The later part of the book I witnessed in person in Eastern Europe, so this is something I was very familiar with.<br /><br />Buckley throws in a few complicated words in this book, so I had to consult my dictionary.  I did not know there was a word for throwing someone out of a building, but apparently Buckley found one.  I have already decided not to add this word to my vocabulary.  Other than that, this is a nice little read for someone interested in the Cold War and Eastern Europe.	2004-08-08

I think the author brings up some very good information about the poor treatment of German POWs by the French and Americans at the end of WWII.  Not only did the Americans lower the calorie intake of German POWs but after the end of the war classified these prisoners under different status therefore depriving these men of all food.  Then to make matters worse, they turned these prisoners over to the French for slave labor.  The French camps were no better and the result was many deaths.  Not all German forces were subjected to this, only those captured at the end on the Western Front.<br /><br />After doing a good job of describing the motives and way of the Americans and French, the author then describes a vast conspiracy to starve and then cover up the deaths of a million German POWs.  He faults the higher ups in the American military and DeGalle for doing this.  I found his discussion on the arithmetic to be confusing, but he sounds dead serious in his feelings that at least a million died.  After I read his analysis, I came away with the feeling that starvation and deaths did occur, but not a million men.  It sounded to me more like the U.S. Army did not know how many men they had captured.<br /><br />However, the author justs keep pounding away on this vast conspiracy.  Jim, if there were a million dead, where are all the bodies.  Where are all the grieving relatives?  Come on, be realistic, there may have been thousands starved, but a million men.  His arguments and justification did not convince this reader.  He merely confused me with his math.<br /><br />I think this book serves a purpose.  It shows the U.S. military can also be cruel and kill people.  The theory of a vast conspiracy is hard to stomach.  The author is a Canadian and vented his dislike of the U.S. and French governments.  The vast conspiracy portion of the book just showed the venom of the author.  This was not objective analysis of what happened.  He actually equated Eisenhower with Hitler.  What a comparison!ison!	2004-08-05

This is an OK read and the writing flows easily, but I have a problem with this book.  Jack Beeching wrote an 1980's title called the The Chinese Opium Wars, and Travis and Hanes quote this extensively.  Since I have read Beeching's book and rated it 5 stars, why write another book basically detailing the same story.  I felt I was reading the same thing.  This is a good book, but Beeching's book is better and the original is still on sale, even on Amazon.  So readers, go with the original.  This book is good, but Beeching's book has more detail.  I enjoyed this book, and its more pro Chinese positions that the authors adopted.<br /><br />The book details the two wars fought between Great Britain and China in the nineteenth century.  The war was extensively over the drug trade in China.  Great Britain imported quite a lot of tea and silk from China losing much silver in the process.  As a means of equalizing the trade, Great Britain and certain wealthy traders started exporting opium from British India to China.  The result was a deterioration in the Chinese population, corruption in the Manchu court, and more silver flowing from China to Great Britain.  The two wars were fought to open up more trade to China, including that of opium.  China was opposed to this, and the wars resulted.  This was a grave injustice to China, imposed by the British. It also details the loss to the world of the Chinese Summer Palace, which the British burned in the war. The book reviews these two wars.	2004-08-03

I didn't think this was a great book but it did give me some knowledge of how terrible the Black Plague and the terrible effects on Europe and Asia.  It really decimated the populations of Western Europe, almost to the point where civilization was at stake.  Cantor describes it as the modern day example of the atom bomb.  Cantor does some theorizing about the origin and the fact that the plague may have also been anthrax, and not the plague spread by rats.  He also theorizes what might have happened if the plague had not been.  Society and civilization may have developed faster, rather than recover from the population loss.<br /><br />This is an OK read, and I learned something from Cantor's writings.  I am surprised others have rated this book so low, because it did give a side of the Black Plague that is rarely written about.	2004-08-02

This is a wonderful little story about the building of Santa Maria Del Fiore by Filippo Brunelleschi.  This domed church is one of the marvels of the world and led Medieval man into the Renaissance.  This book details how a dream became an actual building through the genius of Fillippo.  Not only did he solve how a dome could be built of thousands of tons of stone and stay upright, but he managed to design many of the machines that helped build the dome including lifts, and cranes.  This story also details the rivalry of Filippo and Lorenzo Ghiberti who was brilliant in the casting of bronze doors.  These two man not only built, but were also great artists.<br /><br />Ross King does a good job of detailing a story about Renaissance architecture into something that a modern reader would be interested in.  The story is short but very compelling.  The intro leaves a little to be desired but the rest of the story flows very smoothly.	2004-07-28

At the end of the second hurricane-the ballast shifts and the ship takes on a terrible list.  The crew rides out the hurricane on her, and then hails two other freighters and abandons ship.  The ship then travels on a southerly direction until spotted by a salvage tug.  This and another salvage tug take Leicester to Bermuda where she endures another hurricane and is beached with the salvage tug.  The last chapter details the salvage of both the ship and tug.  This was indeed the ship that wouldn't sink.<br /><br />This is a nice little story that will keep the reader's interest.<br /><br />A Perfect Storm is so much more dramatic that I wouldn't rate this book as highly as that.

I give Allen credit for writing about a little known event in our nation's and WWII history.  This was the explosion caused by the mishandling of ammunition at the Port Chicago Naval Station in California.  Over 300 people died as a result of this explosion, the majority of them black ammunition handlers.  When the Navy tried to redirect the remaining black ammunition handlers to another yard, they refused to handle any more ammunition.  If I were them, I would too.  The Navy then selected a representative 50 of the 250 soldiers who refused to handle any more ammunition, and court martialed them with long prison sentences.  That was injustice.<br /><br />This is an interesting story.  However, Allen's leftist rantings tended to alienate the reader from the story.  Bob, most people agree that what the U.S. Navy did to these 50 sailors was wrong, but why slant the story so radically.  Allen's writings was not as smooth as most writers, so I tended to slog through this very interesting story.  The story could have been better written and the slant should have been left out.  More detail about the explosion could also have been included in this short book, without slighting the main theme of discrimination of the U.S. Navy.	2004-07-23

Freeman does a great job of detailing the life on this carrier and the result of the fire and deaths as a result of the accidental firing of the Zuni rockets.  One gets a sense of purpose of those people who work their lives on the carriers.<br /><br />This book taught the value of following procedures in dangerous situations.  Those who circumvented the rules indirectly caused the firing the rocket into McCain's aircraft.  The government using old WWII ordinance also bears some of the blame.  The young crew are to be truly commended for fighting such a dangerous blaze at the risk of their lives.  Their actions saved the ship.  Freeman tells an amazing story.	2004-07-22

It is an interesting history of one of the largest ore freighters and the infamous sinking of this great vessel.  MacInnis does a great job of boiling the history and the tragic sinking of this ship down into an easy to read 120 pages.  This is great story, and I was surprised that it took so little time to read this book and understand the tragedy of 29 dead men.<br />This book is a good history of the ship and the brevity of it makes it a quick read.  None of the real far fetched accounts (UFOs) for the explanation of the tragedy are included in this book. The details of the two explorers filming the results of the ship on the bottom are also detailed.  MacInnis makes them out as quick buck artists working the tragedy for all its worth.<br />I am less sure about this, but the book is a good read.	2004-07-19

Anyone knowing the history of Winston Churchill visualizes the confrontations he had with Lady Astor.  The author includes one in her book about poison.  Another one has Winston being drunk, and Lady Astor confronting him and he responding Yes I am drunk, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you shall still be ugly.  I wanted to know a little more about Lady Astor and this book gave me a brief insight into her.  It was an average read, and I commend the author on writing something original.  In this age where we have three or four books coming out about Benjamin Franklin, it is refreshing to have a book about an original subject like the 1919 election of Lady Astor.<br />This book is dry in places because the author focuses on the use of language in the election of Lady Astor.  It is rather a short book, so she should have just concentrated on the election and detailed more of the aftermath of the election and the rise of Nancy Astor.  Again, the author has done a good job of detailing the rise of this remarkable woman.	2004-07-17

I thought this was an original concept of a war story.  The authors tell of the French love of the national drink of wine and the German Occupation. The Germans took a portion of the output of the vineyards, and the French were starved for wine.  Various stories of the burgundies/champaynes and other assorted wines were told in this conglomoration of a book about wine and WWII.  French POWs in a Stalig camp throw a wine party after accumulating wine.  Resistance figures siphon off wine from casks bound for Germany.  Bad wine is sent to the German occupation authorites.  Collaborators sell the drink to the German authorities.  Jews are hidden in the vineyards.  These are all stories included in this short book.<br />The concept of this book was interesting.  This collection of stories does not lead to a very coherent book, although many of the stories are very interesting.  This is more of a fluff book, unless you are interested in wine.	2004-07-15

A great book about the rescue of the crew of the submarine S-5 in 1920.  There have been a number of books about the loss of submarine crews but fortunately this book has no deaths (at least in this sinking).  Captain Cook or Savvy as he is known manages to keep his crew alive by shifting the water in the sinking sub.  He manages to tilt the submarine on end and then drill a hole in the back end of the sub, where he motioned a passing ship to save his crew.  The sub turned out to be a total loss but the crew was saved.<br />There are better submarine books out there, but none that describes this particular sinking.  The author is a medical doctor, but he does a great job of giving the reader a thrilling adventure.  Great job A.J.	2004-07-15

After reading about Highly Effective People, Covey gives more sound advice on how effective families function.  I think Covey does a good job in describing how effective family structures place all members in a win/win situation.  This reading is rather light on how to tackle issues with family members in difficulties and/or problems situations.  Covey just feels that all members are in the family to work together.  In most circumstances, there is always one or more family members battling difficulties such as drug abuse, depression, uncontrollable behavior.  Covey would probably argue that good family structures would prevent/minimize such problems.  However all families face some difficulties and the book is rather light on facing these problems.<br />A good read on how to structure a family and make each member a contributor to the team.  This book is not a cure all, but it has some sound advice.	2004-07-14

Both are trying to attain their manhood.  The young person convicted of murder becomes a man first and shows the community what it is like to face a grim fate with dignity and courage.  The young black professional learns from this person how he should conduct his life.<br />This is wonderful story with good life examples of how people become adults.

I was particularly interested in this book because this is when I graduated from my university and got my first job.  Many people were going into the securities industries and making a killing in terms of salary.  I stayed in industry because I liked the thought of making something, not pushing paper.  Smith does a credible job detailing why this decade should not be considered the best in American history.  During this decade, Americans became addicted to debt both personally and by company policy.  Buyouts and LBOs were rampant in American society.  Schools emphasized the MBA.  The Pacific Rim countries-notably Japan exported more to the USA than others.  It was a difficult time in U.S. History because we became more dependent on the rest of the world.  We became the world's largest debtors.<br />Smith goes into great detail of why Ameicans must come to term<br />with who they are.  Americans need to become more competitive with the rest of the world.  If we do not, others will eat this country's lunch.  Smith details all these warning and why it is important to heed them.<br />Smith is giving friendly advice to a nation that is coming to grips over who has money.  Americans need to change their belief in short run gains at the expense of long run profits.  Only by focusing on the customers can we beome better manufactures.<br />This books jumps from one topic to other, and therefore few people get the whole story.	2004-07-09

Ms. Nivat reports on the War in Chechnya by way of traveling with the civilians and rebels of this war torn province of Russia.  Civilians are indeed the victims of any war, and there is no difference in this conflict.  I would say that perhaps the Russians were more brutal than other nations.  Their targeting of civilian centers by artillery and air bombing turned many of the Chechen civilians against the Federation of Russia.  Nivat is very sympathetic to the Chechens.  She has been treated kindly by them.  She makes frequent mention of the Wahabbis (Islam Fundamentalists) and even describes the terror of these fighters.<br />Present day knowledge shows that many Chechen Fundamentalists fought and died for the Taliban of Afghanistan.  Chechens themselves have been accused of killing and beheading foreigners helping the civilians of Chechnya.  Knowledge of this makes me think Nivat could have been a victim of a Chechen crime.  Sympathy for the civilians is one thing, supporting Chechen Fundamentalists is another.  Chechens invading other provinces of the Russian state and bombing apartment buildings does not give me much sympathy with the goal of this ethnic group. Nivat has too much sympathy for the civilians and overlooks the killing of the rebels.  This was (is) a fierce war, and both parties don't look too appealing.	2004-07-09

This is a nice little picture book with an accompanying summary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Plenty of pictures and illustrations of the battle itself show the history of this great attack.  The author describes both the Japanese and American point of views prior to the attack.  Then a general description of the battle itself and the resulting outcome.  There is not many personal stories in this book, just the basics of the attack itself.  Lots of information in this thin book.<br />This is an average read.  I like a book full of personal stories along with the history to become interested in the book.  This is an analtical perspective of the attack and is more focused toward the military historian.  A good perspective of the battle.	2004-07-07

This is a picture book with a fair share of writing about what happened on June 6 and 7, 1944.  On that date, British, Free French, American, and Canadian forces assaulted five beaches in Nazi occupied Normandy.  Young details the battles that happened on the day of invasion, and one day after.  What I found good in this book is the detail Young puts into the numbers.  Five Divisions on the initial assault day versus 40 divisions in Nazi occupied Western Europe.  If only the Germans were able to concentrate their numerical superiority on the day of invasion, they could have easily defeated the invasion.  Instead, as Young points out, they tried to defend too many areas, and spread their forces too thin.  Even placing experienced divisions into the likely areas could have defeated the invasion.  The Allies deception on where they were going to land spread the German forces in many unlikely areas.  This is how the Germans were defeated.<br />Young was a Colonel commanding British commando forces in the initial assault on D-Day.  He tells his story as well in this book.  This was an enjoyable read, and their are some nice pictures in this book.	2004-07-03

My parents lived through the Depression and raised their children in the prosperous sixties and seventies.  They live in northern Wisconsin where most of the population was white.  The similarites with Brokaw's South Dakota is basically the same.  As a product of the Midwest, Brokaw is more similar to me than Rather (Texas) or Jennings (Canada).<br />I enjoyed this simple story.  Tom relates how he made it in televison journalism and New York.  Despite where he lives now, he considers himself at home in South Dakota rather than New York.  Tom chronicles his early life and relates how and where he was raised even now determine his outlook on life.  I feel the same way and that is why this book struck home.  I would rather tramp the forests of northern Wisconsin than see the lights of Chicago.  People make their way in life in some measure because of who they were born to and where they lived.  Tom's rural life and his parents survival of the Depression determined a lot of what Tom eventually turned out to be.  A great story.	2004-07-01

For those interested in how Marketing focuses on the customer, this is a great way to understand the marketing of a particular product.  That said, this fact packed book is about as dry as can be.  If you read this book, you will see how the reader has to slog through this material.  Lots of facts and theory, but little in the way of interesting the general public.<br />One market for this book is to university students in Marketing.  This book is a great summary of where Marketing will go in the future, and this could help the student.  Few people would find this book interesting, other than sales people and Marketing.	2004-07-01

Herbert Hoover was probably the smartest and most able of the American Presidents (a distinction he shares with Clinton). His Presidency will go down as one of the worst.  Why?  The Great Depression hit the country soon after Hoover took office, and despite tremedous efforts by the President, extended throughout his term.  Smith details the rise of Hoover and his administration during these four years.  I think he is fair on how Hoover and his administration tried to cope with the Great Depression.  He also details the rise of FDR and gives both positive and negative stories about him.  For instance, Roosevelt failed to cooperate when he was President Elect with Hoover in trying to shore up the banking system when so many banks were failing.  Up to the moment he left office Hoover tried to serve the American people, while Roosevelt played politics and let huge banks fail.<br />This is a good portrait of the Hoover Administration.  Smith details quite a bit about the Hoover Administration and the 1932 Presidential Election, but he is short on early material about Hoover.  Altogether a good read about a well meaning man and the Great Depression.	2004-06-28

Gross's book Neighbors illustrates the latent anti-Semitism prevalent in pre-war Poland and the murderous result when the Poles took action against their Jewish neighbors.  In the town of Jedwabne, two thirds of the residents were Jewish, and after<br />the Germans occupied the Russian half of Poland, the Polish residents of the town and surrounding countryside decided to take things into their own hands.  They massacred the 1500 residents and took their property.  The book briefly details the massacre and the burning of the barn where most of the Jewish residents were jailed.  The Germans took no action, so the Polish residents were the chief culprits in these murders.  After the war, the Poles blamed the Germans and until recently the crime was covered up.  Gross details how the town residents did know and reveals this in the book.<br />I have read some of the comments from some of the other readers.  It is hard to acknowledge crimes committed by one's nationality.  Unfortunately this crime and other related did take place, and people do have to owe up to these things.  I have traveled extensively through Poland and find the same anti-Semitic feelings even today.  Both the Poles and Jews were victims in WWII, but the Poles also victimized the Jews.  If I have any criticism of Gross's book, it is that it was far too short.  Gross needed to describe in more detail these murders that took place in 1939-1941 period throughout Poland.	2004-06-23

The main theme in this book is that Hitler told everybody exactly what he was going to do prior to his selection as Chancellor.  Therefore it is no surprise when he instigated his murderous policies of war and genocide.  When the German people said they didn't know, Laffin states without hesitation that the majority of people knew exactly what Hitler was going to do.  When the countries which eventually fought Hitler stated they didn't know, Laffin states they should have known because of all his stated goals in speeches and his book.  If they didn't know, then they weren't listening.<br />Laffin's book takes photos from a 1936 German publication, and then explains the text.  He also uses a chapter about a British soldier watching the rearming of Germany and explains the warning signals.  There are a lot of pictures in this book, and they are quite interesting.  The writing could be better, but the message is quite true.  The German people and the Allies decived themselves about Hitler's intentions.	2004-06-21

The main contention of Rees is that there was little difference between Stalin and Hitler.  He is at least partially right.  I believe Stalin was more irrational and murderous than Hilter, and the numbers support Stalin as being worse than Hitler.  Mao was the worst.  Anyway Rees contention is that Hitler waged war against the rest of the world while Stalin waged war against his own countrymen.  The result was millions killed and rivers of blood.  Along with this review of the two dictators, is the war that was waged on the Eastern Front for close to four years.  It was waged against soldiers and civilians on both sides.  The review has a good summary of the war with many great pictures.<br />This is a good summary history and picture book.

Ok, so Silent Cal was not one of our greatest Presidents.  He was a very honest President, who had a very shy personality.  White wrote this biography in the thirties, and knew Calvin.  Even though White knew Coolidge, criticism is still present in this biography.  The most damning was Coolidge not taking action to prevent the build up of credit and speculation in the stock market.  All indications are there that he should have limited money at some point, but Coolidge let the market make its own correction.  This was one of the reasons why the market went down so fast.<br />White does a good job of showing how someone like Coolidge (and Harding) rose to the top of the heap.  Throughout this book, Coolidge is shown as an honest politician who lived off his salary.  He even stayed in boarding houses when he was Governor and Vice President.  He was very shy and limited his talking.  He asked people to vote for him and they did.  He only lost one election, so this shows people trusted him.  He worked the political system for his constituents and his beliefs.  Although conservative, he backed some very liberal ideas at the time including the vote for women and opposed anti immigration efforts against the Japanese.  When he told people what he was going to do, people could trust he would do it.  He even made fun of himself and his personality.  His personal characteristics were very admirable.<br />White's biography is a bit dry at times, but the subject comes across in very human terms.  The book is divided into four sections, so one can read bits and pieces of that history which may interest the reader.  The first one hundred pages was slow going, but it gets better after that.  For those interested in a President who governed for six years, this is a good read.	2004-06-16

This is a rather dated book about Thubron's journey through the Red China of the 1980s.  The Wall he is referring to is the Great Wall and he visits both ends of it and meanders around this vast country.  As a travel experience, Thubron treats his travel experiences by jumping around.  First he tries to describe the countryside, with some flourishing descriptions and this tends to confuse the reader.  Perhaps he is writing this for a British audience, but those of us on the other side of the Atlantic have a hard time digesting some of his wordings.  He jumps from one experience to the next, so the flow of his writing is rather jolting.  Some of his experiences make for good stories, but for the reader to mine this, he is in for an uneven read.<br />This is an average read because of the flow of the book.  For those interested in Red China, this may be of interest.  For those interested in travel, there are better travel books out there.	2004-06-15

This is a great book for the novice historian since it explains the battle with maps and explanations of all three sides (British, French, and Prussian).  Not only is the battle explained, but brief biographies of all the major players in this drama are also included.  One can get an idea of why this battle was waged the way it was because of all these descriptions.  Chandler is very fair to all sides in this battle as he describes the conduct of the campaign.  One of the previous reviewers attributes him being British as taking the British perspective, but I don't believe this to be true.  Chandler describes the battle from all perspectives.<br />This is a great introductory book of the battle.  It is a summary, but not an in depth story of the battle.  The pictures, maps, short biographies, make this a very good read of the Waterloo battle.	2004-06-15

I am not as enamored of these Russian short stories as some of the other reviewers are.  The last story about Bulba depicted Jews in a very demeaning way, and you can see the stereotypes of the Eastern European Jew written into a very interesting story.<br />Gogol was one of the great Russian writers, but the inclusion of this shows him to be an anti-Semite.  Otherwise the stories are interesting and humorous of the Tsarist times.  The story of the Russian bureaucrat pretending to be Fernando VIII of Spain starts out this book and is by far the best.  The others are silly stories, and the last one about Bulba shows the Polish occupation of the Ukraine in medieval times.  The first and last stories are by far the best, if you can stomach the anti-Semite tone in the latter story.<br />Overall, an interesting and slightly humorous read.  This book gives you a picture of Russia in the times of the Tsar.	2004-06-02

I like one idea which Dick places before everybody and that is that nobody can accomplish all they seek to do.  Prioritization places you in a position of working on those that need to be done, not on those that are the least important.  Another gem was never working overtime on Quandrant Three and Four activities, it just isn't worth it.  Lohr states using these techniques will give the individual three weeks worth of extra time in a year for work activites which is a great reward for us busy managers.<br />I have already started using these techniques and I believe Dick is right when he says it will increase your business effectiveness.

Walsh certainly comes up with an interesting topic that has been bypassed by other historians.  The case involves Duff Anderson and his use of a deadly weapon in killing a large man.  Because of his friendship with the family, Abe Lincoln defended Duff in court and got him acquited of the charge of murder.  In the trial itself, Abe may have used an incorrect almanac, and this was not challenged by the prosecution.  Because of this, a guilty man may have went free.  Walsh also questions other Lincoln cases in the book.  This is all interesting reading, even though unproven.<br />I give the author credit in writing about a topic that has not been explored in great detail.  He writes this as history, but there is not enough evidence here to convict Lincoln.  Lincoln used the full extent of his powers to defend his client.  At this stage, there is not enough documentation to prove he doctored the almanac.  This is a quick short interesting read.	2004-06-01

A fairly interesting book.  O'Donnell lists the campaigns of the elite troops of this theater of command, details the plan of battle, and then gives the oral histories of those who served in those campaigns.  Most of the veterans are at the end of their lives, so these oral histories present a heartfelt tribute to the difficulties these soldiers endured during combat.  What surprised me most was how these soldiers/veterans got choked up recounting the battles they went through, and the friends they lost.  Freedom isn't cheap, and these soldiers are living proof of how America was affected by the battle.<br />This is a good read.  Oral histories are good at describing the personal experiences of soldiers, but they don't put perspective on the actual battle campaigns.  If one wants to know more about the War in the Pacific, one needs to read a general history, before reading this book.	2004-05-29

As one of the previous reviewers have stated, I was a little confused about the reason for this book.  Perhaps I am not spiritially developed or possibly this is a confusing book.  I think the world that has not been fully discovered/developed is the spiritual aspect.  So I believe the author is right in this respect.  After that, the author starts rambling about original growth forest, reincarnation, and new family structures, etc.  This confused me as well as other readers.  I am sure there are better books out there about discovering you spiritual identity.	2004-05-27

A wonderful little book about a small tragedy that happened in Boston in 1919.  As a result of an above ground tank rupture, 21 people lost their lives and others were premanently crippled.  Puleo deserves credit for bringing this tragedy to light.  He does a good job of explaining why the tank was located in the poorest, most densely populated portion of Boston, how the tank was put together slap dash, how signs indicated the coming collaspe of the tank, and finally the rupture and the resulting court battle.  The author even includes the attitudes of the largely Italian neighborhood and the execution of the Italian anarchists at the end of the book.  The final summary is a large corporation put the people of this neighborhood at risk for a gain in the war profits from industrial alcohol.<br />This is a good read.  Puleo puts a lot of interesting information into this book and it makes compelling reading.	2004-05-27

A short summary of good tips on becoming valuable to your employer.  Somervill outlines a number of ways to become a better employee through self improvement.  She also cautions people to find the job they are most interested in, rather than fight it out in some job you don't care for.  The text of the book is that by becoming more valuable to your employer, you can improve both your job and yourself.  Somervill also states that employees need to be true to themselves, since in today's marketplace, employers regularly discard workers.  Those who seek to improve themselves will always be more marketable in the long run.<br />I found this book a very practical read.  For those who need suggestions on how to improve their jobs and themselves, this is a good starting point.	2004-05-27

How do you criticize someone who developed partnering between two large corporations.  Lou developed a good relationship between Proctor and Gamble and Wal Mart.  He made a stormy relationship into one which benefited both these large corporations.  Lou also managed in an economy dominated by  dictator Marcos in the Philippines.  Both of these relationships helped develop Lou into a successful manager.  These stories and Lou's early business life selling soap constitute much of the book.<br />I think this book has some common sense ideas on how to approach customers.  Some of those listed include treating everybody fairly and equally, developing partnerships, treating employees as you would want to be treated and being a change agent.  For the last item, this will involve rocking the boat, and might get people upset with you.  But being a change agent is never easy.<br />This is an easy book to read.  There are no radical solutions here, just a common sense approach to business.  This is why I rated it only as an average read.	2004-05-21

How did the Eurasian societies come to dominate the peoples of North and South America, Africa, and Australia.  Diamond places a number of nice theories on how Eurasia came to dominate and colonize those of the other continents.  They are all very plausible, and that is why this book offers such a vast vault of information.  In fact, there is a lot of info in these pages, so the reader may be placed on overload just trying to understand all this.<br />Some of the theories focus on the geography of the Eurasia compared to the others.  Eurasia spreads east and west and in many cases, weather was duplicated from one place to the next.  The other continents were spread north and south.  The peoples of Eurasia built cities and were more concentrated than other societies and thus were more immune to diseases.  When these diseases came into contact with people from other continents, there was no one who was immune.  Big tamed animals and plants were more plentiful in Eurasia than elsewhere.  There is so much more in this book that is all very valid.  That is why Eurasian societies ended up with more of the cargo.<br />This is a great read.  Allow some time to understand all the theories because there is plenty of meat in this book.	2004-05-18

As the previous reviewer noted about Senator Morgan from Lousiana, I also found a error in this book.  It states some of the elections from Indiana and how Roosevelt and the Democrats suffered losses in this state.  We are talking of the first Roosevelt and he was a Republican, and not a Democrat.  Perhaps the author or one of the proof readers made a mistake, but it gets you thinking that if they do a poor job in the basics, perhaps the author made other errors.  I don't think Diaz is stretching too far when he states the Administration, certain financial interests on Wall Street, and the French banks conspired to help Panamanians get their independence in exchange for making a favorable treaty with the American government.<br />This is a nice little book and the author makes some reasonable assertions about how Panama got its independence.  Colombia had already lost Ecuador and Venezuela in the mid 1800s.  Panama was not an intregal part of Colombia and the civil strife in Bogota was great.  All it took was a little money (which the banks loaned) and the will of the Panamanian people, and Panama became independent.  Diaz may think this clouds the reputation of Panama's  founders, but I think it was inevitable what would happen to Panama.	2004-05-18

I had a hard time with this book.  As some of the previous reviewers have noted, Shattuck seems to have a problem with where he wants to go with this book.  It would have been great if he stuck to how some things should not be known by man.  However Roger gets mucked up and first describes man's yearning for the unknown, then talks about his liberal viewpoints on nuclear weapons, and then talks about sex and violence.  This book went all over the place, and I wonder what he was trying to prove.<br />There must be better books on this topic but I just don't know where.  This was not a great read, but the subject is important.	2004-05-14

Altner was a seventeen year old German when he was inducted into the German Army and fought for five weeks in the defense of Berlin.  This book is the story of those five weeks.  As a previous reviewer has noted, Altner is not very careful in his descriptions of arms, tanks, aircraft, etc.  Footnotes are provided that fill in much of this information.  What is a seventeen year old interested in....food and sex, and so some of the story focuses on these two items at the expense of others. Altner also focuses on the traumatization of war, seeing a friend without his nose and eyes, walking past a wounded soldier without stopping, watching wounded soldiers be run over by tanks.<br />One gets a pretty vivid portrait from this seventeen year old kid of what war is like.<br />Although an interesting read, there are better stories out there such as Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier.  Altner's experience was only five weeks, so perhaps it was not a complete picture of the war on the Eastern Front.	2004-05-14

Well, it was because Walgreen's had a bunch of bargain tapes prominently featured in their store, and the music playing had a subliminal message that said buy me.  Seriously, Rushkoff does a good job of detailing how people are influenced to buy a product, subscribe to a belief, or follow a messianic leader.<br />I think Rushkoff is suspious of all people or companies trying to sell a product.  However, in most cases, he details how Western style societies have been influenced by consumerism, and how companies have refined their selling habits to sell their services and products.  Rushkoff does not just stop at the selling of products.  He talks about why people join and stay in cults, why people follow political leaders, the effects of the worldwide web and internet on people, and pyramid schemes.  In modern marketing, as well as these, people are coerced in subscribing to alien beliefs or products.  This is why people need to understand these principles in order to avoid the damage of coercion on their person.<br />The book is relatively interesting.  A good book for those interested in the decision making process of the Western consumer.	2004-05-12

This is a great read for anyone having a family or coming to terms with family problems.  Bryan came from a disfunctional family and spent a decade of his life blaming his family for the letdowns in his life.  Once he saw his family was not the problem and he was, he came to terms with his family and decided to become a member of the family again.  This book mainly focused on the interaction between children and their parents, but it can be used with other relationships.  This is a great read for any of us who have problems with their family, because it councils us in how to behave in the proper manner.  As Bryan himself also states, he even has to work on how to see his family in the proper light.  This gives great insight into family dynamics, and is useful reading for anyone.<br />I plan on using some of Mark's principles with my family.  Family matters, and as Mark show, some of us have some pretty heavy baggage.  Losing the baggage is a first step in coming to terms with your family.  Good read and great advice.	2004-05-10

The author Bryan Perrett seeks to give the reader ten unlikely victories which were against great odds.  Most of these victories are little heralded in modern history (with the possible exception of the commando raid on Normandy) and so present the reader with fresh perspectives on ten little known battles.  All of these are land battles, so those interested in naval history will have to look elsewhere.  Such battles described included the taking of the Taku Forts, the march into Palestine by the British, the relieving of Lucknow, a Hill fight in Vietnam.  All very relevant, but all little known.<br />All these victories are relevant, but somehow I lost their relevant importance in the great scheme of history.  The author tries to impart this in some of the ten stories, but fails in others.  I consider this an average read in history.  There are other books out there that cover important battles better.	2004-05-10

Professor Parssinen has written a great read of the conspiracy by the German Army for a coup de etat against Hitler.  The stage was the Sudetenland crisis of 1938 and the German generals were against a new war.  They were hesitant against launching some thirty odd divisions against the Czechs and having to defend the Western Front with nine divisions.  If the French and British had stood their ground, the German military would have overthrown and killed Hitler.  Instead Chamberlain backed down, the Sudetenland was taken over, and six months later, the Germans completed the occupation of Czechoslovakia.  The German generals were in no mood to overthrow the government since all had gone well with Hitler.  Colonel Oster was the Abwehr second in command who organized the elements who would have overthrown Hitler.<br />Parssinen feels the coup would have taken place.  I am not so sure Hitler would have been so easily overthrown.  At this stage, people still believed in the Nazis and Hitler.  Parssinen feels that German people were antiwar and would not have supported the government if there was an alternative.  However, the book shows the extent of the Nazi resistance in Germany.<br />A great read.	2004-05-08

I enjoyed this book because Pat is definetely old school when she comes to her coaching and managing.  I think as America has become a rich country, hard driving individuals like Pat and her parents have become downgraded as more people opt for the human relations style management.  Pat proves that the hard driven type management is still very effective in motivating people to their best.  In this book, Pat describes both her personal and professional experiences and how that has changed her to the coach she is today.  Nothing beats success, and Pat's championships prove her way can make results.<br />This book is a surprisely good read on leadership and managing.  It is applicable to both sports and business.  The personal and professional stories prove that Pat's way is still effective in today's world.	2004-05-06

The author and his wife are converted Jews who discover love, faith, and forgiveness during World War Two.  This is a religious book and much of the content is religious in nature, so if the reader is looking for a human interest story, then plan on reading material debating some aspects of the Bible.  Anne Frank also makes a brief appearance in this book.  In this book, there is also great sorrow as people are sent to the death camps.  Hetty and Elly's parents are sent to the death camps.  Despite all this, Ernest has the ability to forgive his captors and tormentors.  For this he is commended, because I don't think I could forgive them.<br />As I said, this is a religious publication.  It is a short and easy read, and the personal stories propel the book forward.  However, there is a lot of quotations from Bible passages, so for those that are not interested in that, this might be a trying book.  Also, the author cannot see why other Jews don't believe as he does, so there is a certain amount of moralizing in this book.	2004-04-29

The author is the daughter of two French resistance figures of World War II.  Her father was a French naval captain who divorced at mid age and married a young Polish Jew living in Paris.  When the French gave up and signed an armistice, this captain wanted to fight on and joined the Resistance.  Rather than escaping to London where he could have served in the Free French Navy as a high officer, he serves as a resistance figure and climbs to the head of a cell.  He is then tortured and shot with his wife just before the liberation of much of France.  It is a sad tale.<br />This is a short book, and as the previous reviewer notes, makes these heroes come to light with all their positive and negative characteristics.  I feel I was reading something very personal when I read this book.  Since the original book was in French, perhaps the translator did not do a great job in the translation.  This is why I rated it only three stars.  Also, a more detailed description of the aftermath could have been done describing how the daughter was adopted by her uncle and what happened to the Leitner family children.	2004-04-26

I have read many stories from the Vietnam War and this is one of the better ones.  Jack does a good job of detailing his 77 days at Khe Sanh.  No wonder the Vietnam War scarred so many people at so young an age.  Jack is set down in Khe Sanh and the North Vietnamese Army targets the base day and night.  Marines get little sleep as rockets, mortars, and artillery are flung at them at odd hours.  Jack details his life during this 3-4 month ordeal.  Loss of friends, million dollar wounds, and the West Dickens street sign are just some of the stories told in this book.<br />This is a great read.  I managed to read it in two days because of the easy flow and good stories.  Great job writing your first book Jack.	2004-04-23

As the previous reviewers have stated, there are some words of wisdom from the thinking of Gerry Spence.  There are also some whoppers, which detract from the book.  Spence is verbose, and this also takes away from the book.  This makes him seem arrogant.  Also, as some of the other reviewers have stated, Spence is liberal and you can sense this from his writings.<br />One thing this book reinforced in me is speaking from emotion.  If you say what is in your gut, it is a more convincing argument for an audience.  Spence convinces us through his choice of words and tone.  I learned some like minded principles going to Dale Carnegie.  Other common sense suggestions such as thinking through what you say, then commiting it to paper are also there.<br />Suggestions on arguments in the family are also good sense.  These are the good points of the book.  Most of the rest is just fluff, and can be left to better authors.<br />If one is in the law, this is a great book.  Other readers can look for better books on how to get your point across.	2004-04-22

I have to agree with most of the other reviewers in saying this was a so-so book on leadership.  Bennis tells a lot of stories about theories and tries to interweave leadership principles into these stories.  Perhaps I was looking too closely for some sort of theory and what I got was a lot of common sense to support the stories told.  For example, treat people the way you want to be treated, let people try things and even if they make mistakes, it benefits the organization.  I would hope most people would think these are common sense type suggestions.<br />As other people reported, Bennis takes a lot of stories about the entertainment industry, feminist organizations, etc, and one wonders how strong these organization leadership abilities are.  Industry, military, and political organizations are perhaps better organizations to describe for leadership principles.<br />An average read for those interested in management.	2004-04-22

I have been pleased with some of the other books by Albert Marrin.  This book is an OK read.  It is neither a great nor poor read.  One learns about Napoleon Bonaparte and the world he created in France and Continental Europe.  Since this is a short book, Marrin had to shorten some of the depth on this book.  One thing which I liked in other books by Marrin are the interesting asides about words or phrases.  These asides are missing in this book.<br />Marrin is a good author for historical subjects for the young reader.  For this subject, Marrin boils down the substance of Napeleon in a short quick read.	2004-04-19

Rees explains the deviant behavior that arose in Japan after the first wars of the 20th Century (Russo-Japanese War, WWI).  In those conflicts, Japan immitated the Western Allies in their treatment of captured territories and POWs.  With the rise of nationalism in Japan, Japanese were taught to believe they were the favored race and others in Asia (Chinese) were just so many beasts.  With the war is China, Japanese soldiers took Chinese for bayonet practice.  Japanese doctors practiced difficult operations on Chinese who then died after their operations.  Women served as brothel material.  Rees lists examples of all these deadly proceedings.<br />There are no surprises in Rees book.  He talks about the fire bombings of Japanese cities, rapes performed on Okinawain women and the shooting of Japanese POWs by the Americans.  The fire bombings and use of the atomic weapons on Japanese cities is all true.  I am also sure some surrendering Japanese POWs were killed as well as rape.  I doubt if this was widespread.  I guess Rees is trying to equate that all war has certain evil in it, but it takes away from his expose of the criminal behavior of the Japanese military.  This hurt the book.<br />This is a short book of worthy material for the historian.  Be prepared to read some pretty disgusting material on cannibalism.<br />His attacks on the Americans detracted from the book.	2004-04-17

Both books are rather brief, so they could have been combined with a book of only 300 pages.  However after the success of the first, the publisher probably wanted to make a little more money on a second book of war stories.  That said, the stories are powerful about the cruelity of war and its consequences.  Some of the stories at the end are the most powerful, especially about the wayward boy looking for his father in the trenches.  Some of the others, the reader is left scratching his/her head on what the author was trying to convey.  This is simply a collection of stories from the residents of Sarajevo to the outside world.<br />For a quick read on the siege of Sarajevo, both Dizdarevic's Sarajevo: A War Journal and this book are good human interest reads.  The reader can go through them in a three hour sitting.	2004-04-16

This book was written in the 1930s and is now coming back as a reprint.  With all the revisionist history floating around (Ungrateful Daughters), it is good to read something about why James II did lose his throne.  Basically James II was an inept leader who attacked his base of support (Tories) and alienated the Whigs.  When William I landed and advanced on London, James II gave up and fled.  If he would have stayed, he and his son would have ruled Great Britain with the consent of Parliament.  Trevelyan does a good job of detailing how James II lost his throne.<br />This is an academic read.  There is little dramatic actions in this book.  It is simply an explanation of how a leader should not rule.  This is also a short read for someone looking to understand the Glorious Revolution.	2004-04-12

This would be a great read around Thankgiving.  When the Pilgrims first landed by Plymouth Rock, the native Indians helped the English settlers survive the winters.  Cooperation between the Indian chiefs and the settlers resulted in survival in the new land.  Fifty years later, the settlers took away the land of the Indians, sold Indian women and children into slavery and killed off most of the male Indians.  How could peaceful coexistance lead to genocide of the Indians.  Bourne explains this in his book about King Philip's War and the death and destuction of the native Indian tribes.<br />The author's contention is that Native Americans and the settlers could have led peaceful lives in New England.  The influx of settlers led to the loss of the Indian's lives and land.  Bourne argues that this should not have happened.  What struck me is how the Pilgrims and Puritans (both religious fanatics) justified their wars and genocide because the Indians were heathens.  Even if the Indians had converted to Christianity, they were still fair game in this war.  This history is what should be taught at Thanksgiving.<br />That said, this book is only for the academic.  The style of writing would not incite interest among the general population even though the topic is important in American history.	2004-04-09

What a great little book about the power politics of the Congress of Vienna 1814-1815.  The author, Susan Mary Alsop brings a female perspective to the politics of the Congress.  Whereas most male historians would write about how Alexander I, Talleyrand, Metternich, Hardenberg, and Castlereagh determined the fate of Europe, Alsop gives insight on how some women influenced the course of history.  For example, both Metternich and Alexander I slept with the same mistress during the Congress.  These insights provide the reader with some background behind the Congress that determined the makeup of Europe for the next hundred years.<br />This is a lively read and at a little over 200 pages, the reader will have invested little time for a great deal of history.  A great read.	2004-04-09

Such are the mighty questions Faye asks in her book.  All that stress must have forced the breakdown of her marriages and the cocaine and alcohol habits.<br />As the previous reviewers have already noted, there is not much sympathy for this kind of lifestyle.<br />I read this book for the simple fact of gaining some insight into Nicole's husband.  O.J. is indeed a great actor.  His facade has masked what he really is.  In this, the book suceeds in giving some glimpses of a very troubled person.  At the same time, it gives a poor view of the lifestyles of the rich and idle.	2004-04-06

For those who have trouble with understanding the political divisions in Republican Spain, this is a great book.  One can then understand the Republicans, Anarchists, POUM, Communists, and the Catalan parties because of Borkenau writings.  For the vast majority of the general population, this read is very difficult.  In addition, factor in Borkenau's leftist leanings, and you have a justification of all the attrocities of the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War.  During that time, if you were a priest, factory owner or manager, or a significant landowner, the penalty was a firing squad.  The author wants to impart on his readership that it was right to execute these people as well as tell how bad Franco's side was.  My viewpoint was that neither side were angels, and one was as bad as the other.  Only at the end when Borkenau was arrested by the Republican police did he start writing about the terrorism of the state.  He should have been writing about it when the various political parties ransacked the churches and killed the priests.  At least Franco did not pretend to be what he was not.<br />I would not recommend this book to the average reader.  It is a difficult read with all the political discourse.  I did learn a lot about the various political divisions in Republican Spain and in this case, the book was informative.	2004-04-03

This is Captain Eddie Rickenbacker's story of his survival of life at sea for 21 days.  The founder of Eastern Airlines is indeed a remarkable person.  He survived an earlier crash outside Atlantic, became involved in audits and speeches to front line airmen, and then survived for 21 days at sea after his B-17 bomber was ditched in the Pacific.  During those 21 days, he and the airplane's crew caught fish and gulls, drank rain water, and came close to dying.  This is an inspirational story, and one wonders if Eddie was around in the 1980s and 1990s, Eastern Airlines might still be flying.<br />This is rather a dated book.  Rickenbacker provides hope even in the bleakest times in the Pacific.  If I had to paraphrase the message in this book is to never give up hope.	2004-04-01

The authors and mainly Smith dwell on their vast experience to have their audience confront the fears which plague people.  Since all people have fears which prevent them from moving on and up in life, Smith categorizes these fears and then tells the reader how to confront them.  Confrontation of fears and overcoming them is easier said than done, so the author puts together a plan on how to overcome them.  This is a sound way to overcoming difficulties in your life.  For those who have some sort of fears (as all of us do), this is a plan of tackling those fears.<br />The one problem about this book is the author always dwelling on his own personal conquests of his fears.  After the first dozen stories, one gets kind of tired of this approach.  After reading this, I got the impression the author has a big ego.  However the book gives you a plan on a way to confront your fears.	2004-04-01

Dizdarevic does a good job of showing the terror of everyday life in Sarajevo.  What struck me about this book is how the population slowly accomodated itself to random shootings and starvation.  As the population adjusted itself, you can feel the anger welling up inside the author against the world leaders and the UN.  UN troops sat around and did nothing.  These troops were Canadians and French who watched Serb troops shoot down innocent civilians.  When the Bosnians tried to defend themselves, these same UN troops issued veiled threats against these defenses.  It just goes to show the spineless foreign policy of the UN and those who provide troops for these peace keeping missions.<br />The reader can feel the anger of the author for the war criminals who terrorized the civilians of Sarajevo.  These criminals (Ratko Mladic, Zivota Panic, Vojislav Seselj, Radovan Karadzic).  The U.S. needs to bring these criminals to justice.<br />The reason why I rated this only a four star is because of the introduction by New York Times writer Robert Jay Lifton.  Lifton provides us with an introduction where he equates the nuclear weapons policy of the U.S. with genocide.  This is typical liberal drivel.  This book would have been better without Lifton's crap in it.  That said, the book was a good read about man's inhumanity to man.	2004-03-29

In this story, the Atlantis (Raider 16) makes a trip around the world on its goal of destroying Allied shipping.  The captain snares Allied ships, and then either places them with prize crews or sinks them.  This true story takes place in 1940-41, with the crew of the Atlantis being the most successful of the German surface raiders.<br />This journey was also the longest and took them to most of the oceans of the world.<br />This is an early book by Hoyt.  Hoyt's books are very readable and interesting.  This took me only a day to read, and is a good adventure read.	2004-03-27

An excellent older book about the little known War of the Triple Alliance.  The war pitted Francisco Solano Lopez and his Paraguay against Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.  Lopez was a dictator of the caliber of Saddam.  In fact, Lopez had his two brothers shot, and had his sisters and mother whipped. What a dictator.  Phelps takes an objective view of the dictator and the circumstances he and his country faced in the 1864-1870 period.<br />Phelps puts a little more into his book than other authors on this same subject.  First, he talks about the heritage of the Jesuits and how they affected Paraguay.  In this book, he also talks of the conspiracy of the American Ambassdor Washburn and his alleged plots against the dictatorship.  These all add color and insight into the plot of the book.  Finally he talks how this war was also linked to the two other major wars on the continent of South America.  Phelps provides a good study of the war and Paraguay's history.<br />This is an interesting read on a little known war.  The first part of the book drags, but once you hit the conspiracy portion of the book, it flies.  A most interesting read.	2004-03-25

Morris describes how the new political system works.  Since he and his best bud Bill Clinton upset the political formula in the nineties, this was something to behold.<br />This book is chock full of good advice.  I can repeat them here:  have a message, focus that message to the voters, forget about the undecided-they don't vote anyway, stay positive, when the election turns dirty, focus on your opponents misrepresentations, etc.  I don't think Morris actually followed this advice, but hey, what do you expect from a politician.<br />I think this is sage advice.  The messenger was bad.  Americans don't like dirty campaigns.  They want the message of what a person stands for.  This is a book about how a good campaign should be run.  For those considering running for an elective office, this is a very good read.  It is Politics 101.  I just wish the author was different.	2004-03-25

Americans have to take responsibility for themselves and stop playing the part of victim.  As a victim, they ask the government for benefits because of their victimhood.  If they take responsibility, they need to strive to improve themselves through education and other methods.  That said, I don't know if I am in accord with all his principles.  Government needs to help those who either cannot or will not help themselves.  I think Gingrich equates that with the Big Brother concept of government.  If it were up to Gingrich, many people who have relied on the government for their living would be thrown out on the streets.  I don't think that is the answer either.<br />As a moderate Republican, I don't subscribe to all Gingrich beliefs.  He is at the far right of the Republican Party and I was happy to see him replaced as the House Speaker.  I think some of his views are common sense, and some are right wing.  The tape was an average listen.	2004-03-19

At the outset of WWI, the British used some of the large passenger liners as auxillary cruisers.  The Germans did the same, but were not as organized as the British.  This book is about the fight between two of these armed vessels.  The British represented by the Carmania was rapidly converted to war use by the addition of guns.  The German Cap Tradalgar was converted using the guns of an old gunboat.  Both made themselves look like the other, and when they finally met, the Germans were bested simply because their opponent had more guns.  The German ship sank, and the Carmania averted sinking only through diligent action by the crew members.<br />Simpson does a good job of detailing the conflict between these two opponents.  This probably was not an epic battle, and it determined nothing toward the final outcome of the war.  It was a battle between two big ocean liners.  The story was well told.	2004-03-17

Hoyt states at the beginning of this book that there are serveral good books about Goering and that this book was about the Luftwaffe.  Then he details the life of Goering and his role in the Air Service.  This is more a book about Goering, than it is a book about the Luftwaffe.  That stated, it is a good introductary text on Goering and his Luftwaffe.<br />I like Hoyt's writing, but this book was only an average read.  The subject is not covered in detail.  Hoyt covers the main subjects: Goering's subservience to Hitler, his promises, the poor leadership of Udet and Kesslering, the lack of long range bombers, etc.  I learned a few things from this book.  The reason why Sweden was not invaded had a lot to do with Goering's promises to that country.  There are other interesting tidbits of info in this book.  However, this book does not cover this subject in detail.  Otherwise, an average read.	2004-03-15

I expected this to be a great book with all the hype surrounding this story.  I am also very fond of George H. W. Bush, since I voted for him twice.  This book I was not fond of.  Why?  Because it equalizes the Americans and Japanese during World War II.  Forget about the Japanese conduct in China or the way they treated captured POWs and enemy aliens and then you have the moral equivalent of the Americans.  This along with many other crimes against humanity are shunted aside.<br />Jim, The Germans, Japanese, and Italians were the first to target civilians in the 1930s and 1940s.  The Italians did it in Ethiopia, the Nazis did it to Poland, England, and Holland.  The Japanese did it in China and elsewhere.  They legitimized civilians as targets in war.  It must have been a surprise when they received the same medicine back again.  Sympathy I feel for those families who lost loved ones.  They should focus their anger at the leaders who brought them into the conflict.<br />Bradley is quite correct in saying the Americans of the early 20th century were racists.  But his description of our conduct in the Philippines is very slanted.  In Benovolent Assimilation, Miller shows the complex relationship between the islands and the American troops who occupied it.  Bradley slants it all in the most negative light.  The insurrection in the Philippines killed thousands of American soldiers, and the correct number of natives is hard to determine.  Bradley justs slants the most negative numbers onto his work.  For those readers who want a more balanced account, read Miller's book.  It will differ from what Bradley says.<br />I guess I am upset because Bradley is equating American action in WWII as equal to the Japanese.  There may have been individual actions of killing Japanese prisoners of war, but what the Japanese did was monsterous.  Their leaders paid for it at the end of the war.  If one had to be captured by the Americans, British, or Japanese, what would be the preference.  Only those wanting a death wish would pick the Japanese.  I prefer not to starve, be worked to death (River Kwai), beheaded, and/or eaten.<br />There was a great story in this book.  It was clouded by Bradley's moralizing about the evilness of the Americans.  He should have focused more attention on the story of the captured flyboys.Only those wanting a death wish would pick the Japanese.

Hoyt writes a nice story, even though there are no academic breakthroughs here.  Hoyt describes the naval and land battles of the Guadalcanal campaign.  He includes Japanese sources in this story of the campaign.  Because of the complexity of the campaign, this short book is only a summary read of the battle for Guadalcanal.  If one wants a more in depth book, one will need to read elsewhere.<br />There were a couple of distractions in this book.  First there was the habit of describing something about what was happening in the personal basis for the soldiers fighting this campaign, then in the next paragraph, Hoyt tells of the grand strategic dimensions of the war.  This destroyed the flow of the book.  Second, Hoyt tells of the sinking of the cruiser New Orleans, then he tells how this cruiser limped back to port.  Obviously, this was some sort of error.<br />Overall a good summary read of this campaign.  If only the flow was there and the typos were not, this book would have been better.	2004-03-10

This is a great adventure story by Edwin Hoyt.  I am glad this book is back in print.  This is the true story of the German light cruiser Emden and its adventures during the first part of World War I.  The Emden was based in the German colony of Tsingtao and was commanded by Von Muller.  This ship broke away from the main German Asiatic fleet and raided Allied shipping in the Indian Ocean.  It shelled the oil refinery in Madras, India and sailed into a Malayan harbor and sunk an Allied cruiser.  It caused so much havoc that the Allied authorities tied down valuable warships hunting for the Emden.  It was eventually caught and destroyed by the Australian heavy cruiser Sydney.<br />The story does not stop there because fifty of the crew escape capture and take a sailing vessel and go to Arabia, and then eventually make their way home to Germany.  This was truly a great story.<br />This is one of Hoyt's early works.  I always enjoy his books and recommend them to anybody who wants to both learn and enjoy a good read.	2004-03-10

As the previous reviewer from Portugal noted, humanity sometimes fails to acknowledge people who do the right thing.  Sousa Mendes was just such a man.  He was a Portuguese Council in southern France at the time of the German invasion.  Jews from the low countries and France fled south trying to get to the neutral countries of Spain and Portugal.  These countries sealed their borders in most cases, so one had to have a visa to get across the border.  Sousa Mendes violated his country's rule aginst these stateless persons, and literally issued thousands of visas so that these Jews and other opponents of the Nazis could escape.  In the process, he destroyed his career and eventually died in poverty.  He did do the proper thing where most others abided their country's rules.<br />This was an inspirational read.  Fralon details the life of Sousa Mendes and Portugal's role in both World Wars.  He also details a little of the fascist rule of Salzaar.  Unfortunately there were no happy endings with Sousa Mendes.  The Portuguese government even balked at honoring him, and was forced by outside pressure to recognize what he did in the nineties.	2004-03-01

This is a book about two pilots of a crashed Eastern Airlines flight 401 bound from New York to Miami.  The plane crashed in the Everglades because the pilots concentrated on correcting a burned out light bulb (for the landing gear) and disconnected the autopilot, allowing the aircraft to crash land in a swamp.<br />The plane was the relatively new L-1011.  These two pilots survived the crash, only to die of their injuries.  EAL used some of the parts of the crashed plane in other airliners.  These other L-1011s were subsequently visited by the dead pilots.<br />The pilots did not haunt the aircraft, but they wanted their presence known.  On several occassions, they helped warn of problems and fixed aspects of the aircraft.  Both pilots were friendly, but their presence caused emotional disturbances with the flight and cabin crew.<br />Fuller has written a number of books about the supernatural.  I don't know if I believe him on all aspects of his writings.  This book had a solid story of the crash, followed by sightings of the ghosts, and then some weird stuff of mediums and communicating with Don Repo through a Ouija board. The last four chapters are hard to believe.  Fuller died in 1990, so only he can tell us if all this stuff is really true.  John, I await your answer whether all this stuff is true.	2004-02-28

This is one of Hoyt's earlier works about a merchant ship equiped to sink British shipping in the Atlantic.  This ship, the Moewe (Seagull) sank British and Allied shipping during the First World War.  Her two voyages gave the German's a victory in disrupting Allied shipping.  Despite all this, the German captain Dohna-Schlodien was gallant and humane enough to rescue most of the crew members of his victims.<br />This is an adventure story.  Several of Hoyt's earlier works are classic reads on little heard of events.  I am surprised this book has not been reprinted.  I think there would be interest in the exploits of the German surface raiders because the odds were definitely against them.	2004-02-25

This book is a novel, or historical fiction as the long introduction will point out.  The author Smith wrote this and had the publishers say it was the journal of Davy Crockett.  It isn't.  Smith read some books ghost written by Crockett, and then wrote this story in a similar fashion.  That being said, it is a good and entertaining read.  However, it is not true, so fellow historians beware.<br />Crockett is a colorful figure in American history.  I can't say I know much about him, but this story places him in a very favorable light.  The saying much attributed to Crockett about the voters of Tennessee going to hell, but he was going to Texas is one of my favorites.  This is a great short read and I much recommend it.	2004-02-23

I read this after a reference to this book in a news story about the coup de etat in the island nation of Comorros.  At that time, some South African mercenaries overthrew the crazed rule of the African ruler of Comorros.  That is where the reference to the Dogs of War was made.<br />One of the previous reviewers thought it was bad for Forsyth to spend so much space on how the coup was organized.  The procurement of all the arms with the export license was very fascinating.  What Forsyth revealed was that coups could be done privately witout the knowledge of governments.  One only had to know how to procure and organize for the overthrow of a government.  I think Forsyth did this well.<br />This is an interesting read.  This may not be on the level of his previous books, but it is still a good read.	2004-02-21

Twenty years ago this was required reading for my East European history course, and I have to say it is not only a classic but a great read.  My Professor (an exile Latvian) wanted us students to know the reason why Eastern Europeans acted the way they acted.  After being dominated by major great powers, East Europeans became docile in the face of power.  Good soldier Svejk not only exhibits this with both the Austro-Hungarians, but also the Russians.  Svejk accomodates himself to the realities of his life by acceptance outwardly, but resists internally the controls placed on him.<br />This is a great read for those trying to understand East Europe.<br />It is also a humorous read.

I thought this a great read after the fiasco of the 2000 election.  Our constitution is great, but what if the electoral votes are so close and people decide to cheat in a election year.  This was exactly what happened in 1876 where both Democrats and Republicans cheated to get their man into the White House.  The result was the end of Reconstruction and the disenfrachisement of the black population in the South by our glorious Democratic Party.  It also resulted in a disaster of the Hayes Presidency, rather than a reform minded Samuel Tilden as President.<br />Robinson wrote this book in the sixties, but it is still relevant today.  Unless the American people change the way we elect our presidents, this might well happen again.  This is solid, interesting read.	2004-02-20

However the boy became a man, and came to understand the struggle of life after seeing death every day.

His childhood family is destroyed by the war.  After the war, his mother goes back to Burma with one of his brothers.  He goes to live in Great Britain.

Marrin always does a superior job of boiling down the essentials of an aspect of history.  In this book, he examines Stalin and his bloody regime in Russia.  In this book, Stalin is examined as a rebel, politician, leader, father, and dictator.  Marrin is right when he states that in terms of body count, Stalin was far worse than Hitler.  Stalin killed and starved more of his own citizens than Hitler killed in the European theater of World War II and the Holocaust.<br />I think this is a wonderful little book which a young person can digest easily.  The subject of the book may be inhuman, but the subject matter is readily understood.  There were some typos in the book (WWII started on 9/1/39, not 9/1/40).  Otherwise a solid read.	2004-02-16

This book was not read for pleasure.  My boss stated I had to read it, because his boss thought it was a necessary read.  After reading it, I have to agree that this book is a good leadership model for those people who manage people.  Even for such a structured organization as the U.S. Navy, the author proves that working with your people helps the organization attain success.  However, Abrashoff is just restating what corporations and other organizations learned in the 1980s. A proven way to satisfy your customers is to work as a team toward your organization's goals.<br />This is a great read.  The author should be complimented about changing how his organization functioned on his destroyer.  As I stated, this was only unique in the setting in which it took place.  Most corporations have used for some time these principles Abrashoff talks about.  That is why it is a little annoying to read all those I did this, I did that sentences in the book.  Abrashoff worked in a team, of which he was the leader and the principles were well established.  Abrashoff only implemented them in a military setting, rather than in a corporation.<br />The book is chalk full of stories about Abrashoff changing how sailors functioned on the Benford.  It is a good read to reinforce managers stuck on doing things the same old way.  It is also an enjoyable read.	2004-02-14

This is a rather dated book about the Nigerian Civil War.  The book was written during the war, so there is no detail on the end of the war.  There have been few books about this disastrous war where over a million people died in combat or by starvation.<br />Forsyth does a good job of damning the then Nigerian military government and the British Labor government.  In this Civil War, food became a valid weapon as the Nigerian government starved out and caused the deaths of millions of innocent civilians.  The rest of the world turned away because of British propaganda about the evils of the Biafrian government.  In addition, the massacres of captured Ibo civilians and soldiers is a damning indictment of genocide against the Nigerian government  (composed of Northern Nigerian Muslim tribesmen) fronted by Colonel Gowon.<br />Forsyth shows in stark contrast the two governments and their leaders.  Gowon is pictured as a front man for the Northern tribes sultans.  Ojukwu is shown as a leader of the Ibo tribesman, seeking a democratic council with the other minority tribes in the governing of Biafra.  Ojukwu is shown as civilized, using democratic principles where Gowon condones mass murder for the sake of putting down the rebel movement.  Gowon is interested only in Biafra for the oil it contains, and not the people.<br />Forsyth writes in a slanted way.  One realizes he is for the Biafrian government, and the book is structured toward proving the Nigerian government is evil and the Biafrians are good.  This book could have been more objective and this is why I rated it a three star.  In addition, an outcome of the Civil War would also be great for latter editions.	2004-02-14

This was an interesting read.  The author tries to delve into the the lives of the Nazi leader's children and detail how they viewed their fathers.  Some viewed their fathers as great men (Himmilers and Goering's daughters).  Others view things more circumspect, Boreman's eldest son loves his father but agrees his father was responsible for great crimes.  Still others hate their fathers.  Nilklas Frank hates his father to such a degree he celebrates the day his father dies.  Throughout the book, both authors try to delve into the morality of each child and how he views his father's past.<br />I rated this as only a three, although it could well be a four.  The organization of the book leaves something to be desired.  The book goes between the father and son's writing and one has to note what time period he is in.  Also, the author tries to much to place each child in a box.  Who does best as understanding the hurt their father put on mankind and his own role as a father.  These fathers may have done very evil things, but all in their own way was a loving father.  To expect a child to think of his father as a monstor is perhaps bad form.  An interesting read.	2004-02-09

The author-Stephen Bower Young-served as a gunner on one of the main turrets of the battleship U.S.S. Oklahoma.  He was aboard the ship when she was torpeodoed during the surprise Japanese attack.  This story is about his personal experiences during the December 7, 1941 attack and the escape from the ship when it rolled over.<br />Young offers recollections about the life aboard the battleship and the sailors he served with.  Many of these sailors would not survive the attack (448 died).<br />The majority of the book was about the attack and the subsequent escape.  I was most interested in Young's successful escape, when other sailors drilled holes into the bottom of the ship so those trapped could escape.  A most interesting read.	2004-02-07
795549:US	49945008	RKT0VZTXYK6YY	0313323658	56905051	To the Bitter End: Paraguay and the War of the Triple Alliance (Contributions in Military Studies)	Books	4	15	19	N	N	Lopez and the war against Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.	The previous reviewer does a good job of detailing what the book is about.  Francisco Lopez declares war on Brazil and Argentina because they interfered in the internal politics of Uruguay.  Uruguay (under a Liberal government) sides with Brazil and Argentina.  Paraguay invades both Argentina and Brazil and seizes property and land.  These three states form the Triple Alliance and roll back the Paraguay invasion and then invade Paraguay.<br />It is interesting to make a present day equation with another state called North Korea.  Both are headed by sons of dictators who assume the dictatorship.  Both are isolationist and militaristic.  Both pose a threat to their neighbors.  I am surprised that in the summary, the author did not make the comparison.  But the author strictly details the history and politics of the war.  Hats off to Mr. Leuchars for detailing this bloody conflict which caused the death of 60% of Paraguay's population.<br />After reading the book, the military battles come off a bit dry.  Lopez's terrorism is something else.  He shot his own brother and had his mother and sisters whipped because he thought they were plotting against him.  Presently Paraguay makes him out as a hero, but the reader is left to come to his own conclusion.  Leuchars explains that without him, Paraguay may have ceased being a nation.<br />Again I commend the author for writing about a little known conflict.  I wish he would have included some photographs in this book, although the maps were great.  The only reason I gave it a four rather than a five star, is that the military aspect was rather dry reading.	2004-02-07

I never thought a book about a speech would be so very interesting.  White does a great job dissecting this short speech and Lincoln's thinking behind it.  At the time, the speech was not thought of well, but after his assassination, the words became the last testament of this great president.  With malice toward none and charity to all, these words came to embody Abraham Lincoln.<br />I was especially interested in the spiritual aspects in both the speech and Lincoln.  White makes Lincoln come across as a spiritual person, who believed in fate.  The book examines his experience in three Protesant denominations.  As we look at Lincoln's spiritual growth, we find this reflected in his speeches, especially his Second Inaugural.  The last speech contained many references to God.<br />This is a great book about Lincoln.  For those who want to understand Lincoln more, White's book examines a crucial episode in the final stages of this president's life.	2004-02-02

A great little book about the war between the Russian Secret Police and the terrorist organization People's Will.  The Russian Secret Police was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Sudeikin and the People's Will by Vera Figner.  The People's Will was executing high Tsarist officials and the Russian Secret Police decided to destroy the People's Will from within.  They turned members of this terrorist party against the organization and destroyed it.  Sergei Degaev was turned and betrayed his comrades.  When he finally came to terms with himself, he confided his betrayal to the People's Will and they helped him kill Sudeikin.  He then emigrates to the United States where he becomes a Professor of Mathematics at the University of North Dakota.<br />This is an interesting and quick read.  I find it fascinating that some of the Russian Secret Police actually collaborated with the People's Will.  For a similar story of betrayal, see<br />Comrade Valentine, The True Story  of Azef the Spy-The most dangerous Man in Russia at the Time of the Last Czars by Richard E. Rubenstein.	2004-01-31

I have many of Leckie's books about American history.  His books are average reads generally. In this book, Leckie details the last battle of World War II and why Okinawa was picked as an island to be invaded by the Marines and U.S. Army.  At a little over two hundred pages, it is an easy read and one can understand the ferocious fight that developed between the Americans and Japanese.<br />Five chapters of this book deal with the kamikazes and the effects on the U.S. Navy.  Only four pages deal with the attack on the Yamato, which I believe was a significant event of the battle for the island.  The rest of the book concerns the desperate struggle for the island and the death or capture of the Japanese forces.  As a previous reviewer has noted, some of battles for the island have been shorted or left out in this summary history.  Leckie does include some interesting details, such as the fact 10,000 Japanese soldiers surrendered rather than commit suicide.<br />This is an average read about a great battle.  Leckie provides a lot of upfront history prior to explaining the great battle over the island, and this might lessen the interest of those who want to read about the subject of the book.  Operation Iceberg is a more detailed book about this battle.	2004-01-30

As a previous reviewer has also stated, I was introduced to this book by the movie Sea Wolves.  The book is better than the movie.  The movie starred David Niven and Roger Moore, and the producers gave Roger a woman to pursue in romance.  The reality of the situation was three German and one Italian ship were interned in Portuguese Goa for the duration of the war.  The largest and newest of the German ships had a radio transmitter sending signals to several U-Boats in the Indian Ocean.  These U-Boats sank thousands of tons of Allied shipping due to the Germans breaking the neutrality of Goa.  Some amatuer middle aged British businessmen set out to capture these vessels under the guidance of British authorities.  When they board one vessel, the crews of all four think they are about to be captured and scuttle their own ships.  The radio transmitter is silenced and the U-Boats are left to find their own victims.<br />The book reads like a novel, which it isn't.  It is a great read for someone interested in some of the lesser sideshows of World War II.	2004-01-30

For those who have not heard of William Walker, he was a freebooter or filibuster that tried to colonize Central America for the U.S.A.. He tried to introduce slavery into Nicaragua. He tried to detach Baja California from Mexico.  He was a lawyer, doctor, journalist, politician, and military man.<br />Carr does a good job of detailing the life of a much misunderstood man.  Walker held many progressive visions for Central America.  Although not a soldier, he was brave in the face of grerat odds, and won many military victories.  His try at the introduction of slavery into Nicaragua was an inducement to southern interests to invest in the country, and when this did not happen, Walker dropped it.  Otherwise, he was a progressive leader in this country.  His only fault was his irritation of both the Pierce and Buchanan presidencies, his opposition to British colonial efforts, and the Vanderbilt business interests in Nicaragua.<br />Carr details these misunderstandings, and clears them up.  Walker's efforts were not evil, but sypathetic to the population of Central America.  If he had suceeded, Central America might be a part of the United States, or unified, rather than broken up into seven countries.  Walker cannot be seen as good or evil but rather as a man who had faults but tried for the betterment of people.<br />Carr does a good job detailing the man and showing the history of Nicaragua in the 1850s.  This is a worthwhile read.	2004-01-29

On the back cover of this book, one reviewer compares this book to Dispatches.  I have to agree.  This book is a great read about the Soviet Occupation of Afghanistan.  The author is a stringer journalist who fell in love with Afghanistan in the early seventies and then went back to cover it during the Soviet War.  This book is his personal memories of the war.  Not only does this book giving a loving portrait of the country and the people, but is shows the brutal results when a totalitarian, clumsy superpower tries to exert its power over the people.<br />This is a relatively short book at 150 pages.  A reader will find interesting portraits of both the terrain, different tribes, and some of the characters who waged the guerrilla war.<br />As with all wars, there is death and destruction.  The one story I will retain about this book is the sense of honor among the Afghans.  The personal story where Rob was left in the mountains to fend for himself because of a mistrusted guide.  When Rob finds the town he wanted to go to, the Afghan muj find out about the errant guide and go off to kill him.  To the muj, the guide did an evil act by leaving a visitor in the hills and needed to be dispatched.<br />Overall a great read about the war in Afghanistan in the eighties.  Highly recommended.	2004-01-22

Akin is a survivor of the Tri State tornado.  He was only 2 at the time, but his experiences resulted in him taking a lifelong interest in geography and weather.  This book sets out to explain this March, 1925 tornado and its devastating effect on cities and communities in the three states of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana.<br />I found this book entertaining and informative about tornadoes and this particular disaster.  This is a summary read, since the book only explains the disaster and how tornadoes form.  I think Akin does a great job in detailing tornadoes and the 1925 Tri State tornado.  I have not seen any other books about this particular disaster, so I am unsure why some of the previous reviewers have been harsh on this particular book.  I found this a great and interesting read.  At a little over 150 pages, a good reader can read this entire book in five or six hours.	2004-01-19

As some of the previous reviewers have noted, this book reads like a novel.  However it is true and 297 GIs were either killed, wounded, or captured due to Patton wanting to free his son in law John Waters from a POW camp behind enemy lines.  Patton was a controversial general, and this action was very controversial.  Patton basically risked the lives of 297 men in order to save one man who was not in danger of death anyway.<br />The commander who conducted the raid wrote most of this book, along with two other participants.  The writing is good in places, especially where Baum is describing the action.  It seems to me the other two authors also wrote sections of this book, and perhaps their writing was not as good as Baum's.  The action is a thrill and reads like a novel.  Baron's description of the POWs is less interesting and wanders at time.<br />Altogether a great read about an unbelievable battle of World War II.  Highly recommended just for the content.	2004-01-19

The book has both an Arab, Israeli, and American perspective, but it leans to the Israeli side.  All the battles are detailed, as well as some of the politics from 1967-73.<br />Allen is much more generous towards the Israelis than other books.<br />The perspectives in this book are pretty stark.  The Soviets were trying to stir up trouble in the Middle East to enhance their position.  The Egyptians, Syrians are both portrayed as the aggressors in this and past conflicts.  Other Arab governments are portrayed as opportunists, reacting to the conflict by piling on.  The rest of the Third World are portrayed as gullible to the propaganda of the Arab and Soviet sides.  Not a pretty picture, but perhaps true.<br />I enjoyed the portrayal of some of characters in this story, especially Ariel Sharon.  Sharon seems to have caused as much problems with other Israelis as he now does with the Palestinians.  The Yom Kippur War may have settled things with Israel and Egypt, but the conflict in the Middle East still simmers.  This is an interesting read on this conflict.	2004-01-19

I have read eight of Howarth's books and they are all fine reads.  This is no different.  Howarth details the life of Ibn Saud, the founder of modern day Saudi Arabia.  Saud's sons still rule Saudi Arabia today.  Even though this book was written in the sixties, Howarth details the reactionaries that influence the politics of Saudi Arabia today.  Ibn Saud embraced a form of puritanical Islam (Wahhabi) and spread it through those parts of Arabia he conquered.  Bin Laden embraces this form of Islam now, and you can see the problems it has caused.<br />One chapter I was especially interested in was the terror these reactionary forms of Islam tolerates.  The Wahhabis raided settlements in Iraq and Trans-Jordan in the twenties killing men, women, and children and stealing their property because they were &quot;infidels&quot;.  Those they killed were fellow Moslem breathren.  However because they did not embrace the Wahhabi form, they were infidels and ripe to be killed.  I guess Bin Laden is just following in the footsteps of his forefathers.<br />An interesting read about an interesting man.  This book explains a lot about the present day problems with Saud's Arabia.	2004-01-14

This is a quick easy read for those wanting to know about the end of the German super battleship.  The book is from the fifies, but the recent reprint gives a fictionalized concept of what happened when the German super battleship ventured out into the North Atlantic and met its fate.  Since there were few survivors from the ship and almost none from the Hood, C. S. Forester recreates what could have been said.  For young adults, this is a good read.  I read this almost thirty years ago, and decided to read this again.<br />For one needing more information, this is not the book.  It reads like a novel, but gives an overview of the struggle for the Atlantic in World War II.  This is an easy read though.	2004-01-10

This is an average read of the very difficult subject of the Cold War.  Roberts gives the reader an adequate summary of this difficult time period.<br />Roberts breaks the Cold War into four stages.  They are:<br />The European Dimension 1945-1950<br />Korea to Vietnam 1950-1975<br />The Quest for Superpower Understanding 1953-1974<br />Resurgence to Ending 1973-1991.<br />These periods were overlapping.  Roberts explains them adequately.  Roberts terms some stages of the Cold War as the long peace since the superpowers tried to resolve conflicts with each other.  Towards the end, tensions rose as both superpowers tried to exert more power in different areas of the globe.<br />The reader will get a summary knowledge of the Cold War.  The writing is academic but the book is short.	2004-01-09

This book takes us from the arrival of Commodore Perry and the end of the Shogun period to the Tokyo Olympics in the history of Japan.  As Buruma emphasizes in his book, Japan has evolved from a feudal society to an industrialized democratic society.  This evolution was neither peaceful nor perfect.  Buruma describes the wars, rebellions, that were the result of this evolution.  Four wars, three emperors, numerous rebellions, and Allied Occupation and by the end of 1964, Japan is still in transition.<br />One of the reviewers from Japan scorned this book, but Buruma does a nice overview of Japan and its people.  Buruma reviews the present status of this country still beset with right wing politicians, corruption, and reliance on the United States.  Japan is in evolution, as most nations are.  By emphasizing these issues, perhaps the world can better understand this unique nation. This is a solid summary read of Japan.	2004-01-06

I like Kinzer as an author.  I have read his Turkey and Guatemala books, and found them to be objective.  This book about the 1953 Iranian coup is also an enjoyable read.  Kinzer tries to show both the Iranian, British, and American positions and what the result was.  The summation jumps to conclusions when it states this coup as the reason for the terrorism in today's Middle East.  The coup certainly fueled the terrorism, but it is not the total reason as other factors play into this.<br />Kinzer does to this coup, what he and another author wrote about the 1954 Guatemala coup (Bitter Fruit).  Corporate interests along with those of the British brought the CIA into overthrowing a legitimate government.  Who were those corporate interests--the Anglo Iranian Oil Company, better known today as British Petroleum.  Anglo Iranian poorly treated the Iranian workers and gave little of the profit to the Iranian government.  They actually argued that Iran's oil was the property of their company.  What arrogance?  The Eisenhower administration defends the British and overthrows Mossadegh because of this.<br />This is a good read.  The reader should draw his own conclusions about today's Middle East.	2004-01-05

This book purports to give a true view of Chile and the Pinochet regime.  The author is a sixties radical who at one time worked as a translator on Allende's presidential staff.  Warren Beatty endorsed this book as saying it cleared the distortions about Chile.<br />Where to begin?<br />I have never given a one star review of any book.  Cooper's book deserves no star, because it is a distortion of any truth.  I don't think the book is at all balanced with what I know about Chile.  I know Chile as well as Cooper.  My wife is Chilean and happens to be a socialist.  I also have visited Chile many times and love the people and the country.<br />First, Allende won a very narrow mandate in the election of 1970.<br />He sought to radically change his country but introduced chaos into his country.  He alienated many people including most of the middle and upper classes along with the conservative population of the countryside.  My wife is from Curico, in the central agricultural region.<br />Allende also antongonized some powerful patrons such as the United States and ITT (which owned the copper mines in the north of the country).  The United States contributed much of the foreign aid Chile received.  What did Allende do?  Nationalize the copper mines and invite Castro for a month long visit.  Smart move--make enemies of those who contributed most to the Chilean economy.  When the economy tanked, chaos was the result.<br />Workers demands became even more aggressive.  Nationalization of smaller companies and agricultural estates were the result.  Strikes and work stoppages were common.  Economic decline was the result.  Copper states that this was the finest hour for Chile.  WOW--what a distortion.  Economic decline and political chaos and he believes that it was Chile's finest hour.  If one wants a modern day example of Chile in the seventies, look at Chavez's Venezuela.<br />Cooper is right in saying the Nixon administration helped in throwing Allende out of office.  However Allende was going down a road which would have resulted in his overthrow.<br />The military sickened by the economic decline and political chaos overthrew the Allende regime.  Pinochet was a reluctant leader of the coup.  However, once the die was set, he embraced the coup and brutal crackdown.  Over 3100 people died in the coup and the seventeen year dictatorship.  Chile was not the worst dictatorship as Cooper would have you believe.  In fact, Castro's dictatorship has been far more harsh in this hemisphere.  Cooper does not want you to know that.  That would distort his story.<br />Most Chileans believe Allende was an inept leader.  Both Allende and Pinochet are divisive issues in Chile today.  People don't like to argue the issues involving these two people.  That is why Pinochet is not on trial in Chile.  Perhaps in the future this may happen, but probably after Pinochet's death.  But Cooper wants to rip open the scars of the past to try the crimes of the dictatorship.<br />One thing the dictatorship did do was set Chile as an economic powerhouse of South America.  Where most of the other countries are failing presently, Chile has a thriving economy.  Cooper does not want to credit the dictatorship with this.  This would destroy his distortion.  So he lies and lies and lies.<br />If I had to summarize the essentials of Cooper's book, it is leftist trash talk about Pinochet and Chile.  I wish this book was more objective.  It is not.

This is the second Marrin book I have read.  This author does a good job summarizing the important aspects of this history.  Along the way, he brings some interesting stories into the overall historical summation.  I like his writing style as it can be understood by a teenager or an adult.  The overall message in this book was how the Southwest was first lost by the Spaniards, then the Mexicans, and won by the United States.  The Southwest is defined as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and California.<br />As mentioned, Marrin always brings interesting stories into his narration.  You find out the origin of Texas, how Ps and Qs became a phrase, Taylor's reaction to a self important Lietenant, and others.  These stories liven up the historical summation.  They are a joy to read.<br />This is a good read for both teenagers and adults.  Although the history is not covered in depth, it gives the reader a base from where to go.	2003-12-29

I love to travel and I admire Hudson for taking off and spending a year traveling the African continent.  This book relates his experiences in three countries:  Mali, Zaire (DR of Congo), and Somalia.  This was written in the eighties before two of these countries fell to pieces.  It probably would not be safe to travel now with the way things are going in much of Africa.<br />Hudson's point is the African people are wonderfully kind to strangers, even those from the West.  His experiences prove that once you are off the beaten track for tourists, the people are friendly and helpful to the stranger from another land.  Hudson experiences no discrimination.  He lives and travels like Africans, and gets their viewpoint.  He even understands the corruption common in everyday African life.  I admire Hudson's courage in undertaking this trip and his writing is easy to follow.  A good read.	2003-12-22

Robert Jackson writes from a British perspective about the Berlin Airlift.  He throws in all the technical details about what aircraft was capable of what lift and the sorties these aircraft performed.  He made an interesting story bland by his focus on the technical details rather than detailing the human viewpoint.  As for the British perspective, the U.K. provided 20% of the lift capacity for the Berlin Airlift.  The book focuses 80% of the content on the British commitment, so one wonders how valid this perspective is.<br />Despite this, if one wonders the why, what, how, of the Berlin Airlift, this book will provide the details.  The technical details might kill the interest, but the book provides the details.  This is an average read on this Cold War crisis.	2003-12-20

Edoin does a good job detailing the initial fire bombing of Japanese cities by American B-29s.  Over 300,000 Japanese lost their lives and many millions became homeless because of General Curtis LeMay's decision to go after the residential areas of Japan.  Rather than try to precision bomb the factories that made munitions and aircraft engines, LeMay went after the residences because many were home based industrial enterprises.  These small shops were destroyed affecting the large plants.  In addition, workers who lost their homes also tended to go to work less ofter thereby destroying the morale of the Japanese worker.<br />This destruction (although a dirty business) proved to the average Japanese the loss of the war and served the Americans.<br />I think this was a balanced book.  Edoin proves the military clique of Japan made the civilian work force an acceptable military target.  It also shows how the American military went after a targets which caused thousands of civilian deaths.  More people lost their lives in the fire bombing of Japanese cities than the deaths caused by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  A thoughtful read.	2003-12-15

As Timerman is an Argentine, I expected him to equate Pinochet with the Argentine military rulers.  This is not what he does.  He makes Pinochet the focus on his topic of evil.  Well 3,000 (not 700 as Timerman states) people were murdered or disappeared in Chile compared to over 20,000 in the Argentine.  Pinochet did rule using fear and torture.  He also stabilized the country and built up the infrastructure.  If you were only to read Timerman's book, you would think very few people favored Pinochet.  I can assure the reader there are elements in Chile (not a majority) who think Pinochet did the right thing.  Well, Timerman's viewpoint is from the left, and not very objective.<br />I loved Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number.  Timerman's other books are suspect.  He writes from a leftist objective.  Allende was a terrible President of Chile, and yet we don't hear those viewpoints.  I believe Pinochet was bad too.  Torture, disappearing people, and murder should not be used as a tool to suppress people.  What you read in Timerman's books colors Pinochet's rule, but not Allende's regime.  If you are biased, you might as well be biased in all your writings.  There are some good books out there describing Pinochet's rule.  Please consult Soldiers in a Narrow Land, or Chile under Pinochet, A Nation of Enemies.  These are much more objective, and the reader will not suffer the leftist bias.	2003-12-13

In the introduction, Barber states his primary interest is detailing the rule of the Sultans (including the Young Turks and Ataturk) after the first ten Sultans.  Those that followed the ten (with the exception of Ataturk) brought the Empire down through their weak rule and disastrious decisions.  Barber uses many sources (most Western) for his story of the Ottoman Empire.  I enjoyed this book because the author does a good job of making the material interesting.  I also read the author's book about the Hungarian Revolution and found it a worthwhile read also.<br />I did not disagree much with the author.  Barber threw in several references to some of the Sultans preferences for homosexuality, and I think this interfered with the story.  Overall, a good read on the Sick Man of Europe.	2003-12-11

Blake's book is a good overview of the war.  Where other books have related the exploits of the Light Brigade or the heroism of Forence Nightengale, this book deals strictly with the military progress of the war.  Campaigns also covered were those in Asia Minor and the Baltic Sea.  Blake's book is also well illustrated with an overview of the ground, so one can visualize what the soldiers had to go through in order to accomplish the battlefield objectives.<br />With the battles in mind, I only rated this four stars because some of the writing is rather dry.  In one chapter, Blakes gives the viewpoint from both the Russian and Allies standpoint.  Rather than help the reader, I think this confused those trying to understand the battle.  Overall a good summary of the war.	2003-12-08

Graber's book about the Armenian genocide is unique.  The West only heres of the Jewish Holocaust and the recent events in Cambodia, Rwanda, Biafra, Bosnia, and Kosovo.  However there was a first genocide and it occurred in the Ottoman Empire against the Armenian population.  Whereas other peoples have admitted their past histories of killing groups of people, the Turks say it didn't happen or as an alternative that the Armenians deserved what they got.  You can see this attitude displayed in the previous reviews.  The Armenian genocide occurred and it displays the indifferent attitude of the Sultan of 1895-96, the Young Turks, and the Ataturk government.<br />One reason why I didn't rate this book the full five stars is the brevity of the book.  The book trys to be all by talking of genocide in general, and this particular genocide in detail.  It doesn't do justice to both.  Graber should have devoted his energies to the latter.  Graber does a good job detailing how the Young Turk leadership (Talaat) led the genocide efforts and direction.  Talaat's fate is deserved--he was assassinated in Berlin and the murderer was set free.<br />This is a good introduction to one of the first genocides.	2003-12-06

Russell dispels the notion that the trials following WWII were victor's justice.  The book details the crimes the Nazis perpetrated on the people of Europe.  These crimes included genocide, incorrect treatment of POWs and civilian populations, and torture.  Russell details in this short book why the Nazis were guilty of crimes against humanity.  In one quote, Goering states how he doesn't care about the civilian populations of the conquered countries--they could die for all he cares.  Well Goering and his counterparts got their just deserts following the war.  The Nurenberg trials and others were not victor's justice.  These trials brought to justice people who led a criminal regime.<br />This is a good read about the crimes of the Nazis.  Those who perpetrate crimes against humanity should be held accountable to the world population.	2003-12-02

Since the late 1990s, people have romantized the generation that fought WWII.  Fussell doesn't dispel that notion, but puts a dose of reality in this crusade against Nazism and militarism.  mong the young soldiers who fought WWII were cowards, criminals, people who shot themselves, and deserters. Many of our soldiers were heroes, but this generation included the usual people found in any population.  Fussell gives us the lowdown on this Greatest Generation.  The soldiers who fought WWII were young men just entering the world.  They made their share of mistakes on the battlefield like everyone else.  They were not superhumans, but average people put into a difficult situation.<br />This is a great short read.  I would hope people who have fallen in love with the concept of the Greatest Generation should read this book to temper their outlook.	2003-12-02

Well, first let me say I admire Timerman and his opposition to the dirty war in Argentina.  I read his Prisoner without a Name, Cell without a Number and was moved by this book.  He suffered greatly because of his liberalism and for being a Jew.  I also liked his book about Cuba.  This book I did not like.  Why?  Because Timerman raves on about his dislike for Begin, Sharon, and Arafat.  I thought I was going through another root canal.  Fortunately this book is not long, and the pain was soon over.<br />Timerman talks on about how he thinks Begin is a lunatice and crazy.  Well, I don't think he was neither.  He made a calculated move to end the Palestinian terror in Lebanon.  Unfortunately he chose the wrong man in Sharon to do it for him.  Sharon implemented his own reprisals and now we have a radicalized population in Lebanon.  At present, Sharon is playing the same game in the West Bank and Gaza, and I don't think the results will be different.  Timerman rants on and on, and the reader is wondering--maybe I should just stop reading.  The book is short but be prepared for a lot of ranting and raving.	2003-12-01

I have read Hoyt's books about Yamamoto and Tojo and gave them an average read for various reasons.  Hoyt in his book gives a better picture of Hirohito.  The overview is very sympathic to the Japanese Emperor.  The coverage is of his entire life, rather than just the war years.  Hoyt's view is that Hirohito was overwhelmed by the militarists when it came to war.  I think the judgement is still out on this.  Overall I think the book gave a good summation of his reign, with a concentration on pre war and war material.  The source material Hoyt uses are predominately Japanese, with some Western sources.<br />This is a good read of Hirohito's reign.  The reader will understand the factional disputes within the Army and Navy after reading this book.  He/she will also understand how the Imperial Japanese Army forced the war on an unwilling Emperor and population.	2003-12-01

This book was a disappointment.  As an Irish American, I wanted to learn a little of my ancestors.  What I got was a book that made some wild assumptions.  When the author stated that the Taureg nomadic people of North Africa may be related to the Celts, I nearly fell off my rocker.  The Taureg are the deepest black and to try to relate them to the Celts, well that was quite interesting.  In this book, the author aims some sharp jabs at the Romans, British, and the English royal family including Prince Charles.  I think those comments also may have been uncalled for.<br />I learned a little about the Celts, but I think I may have to read The Celts by Nora Chadwick to get an objective view of the Celts.  For those who want a more objective view of the Celts, read elsewhere.	2003-11-26

Hoyt does a alright job detailing the life of Admiral Yamamoto.<br />I felt the book dragged at points, but the author does a satisfactory job detailing the life of the person who planned the Pearl Harbor attack.  Hoyt kept strictly to the professional life of the Admiral, and only made passing references to the Admiral's family, passion for geishas, and gambling.  I think you don't get the full story of Yamamoto's success, unless you delve into the personal life. Hoyt doesn't do this, he strictly keeps to the military aspect of the Admiral's life, like his biography of Tojo.  I think you miss something here.<br />Another aspect missing from the Admiral's life in his killing by American flyers.  The killing is briefly detailed in a chapter, so again an interesting aspect of Yamamoto's life is left out. As I stated, the book could have been more interesting if it included more on his life, rather than the focus on the military aspect.	2003-11-24

First let me tell you I am not a fan of the narrative approach in history because it gives the author some leeway in slanting history.  I think Walsh does a good job with the available material to make this narrative work in the executuon of John Andre.  What I disagreed with in this book was Walsh making Andre appear as a calculating arrogant person, when in reality he was out of his element as a spy.  After reading the book, I came away with a good impression of Major Andre, not the one the author was trying to convey.<br />I learned from this book how a brave man met his end with dignity.  I also learned the severity of Arnold's treason, and why he should have dangled from the rope, rather than Andre.<br />Washington came across as a distant figure trying to save the young Republic.  The three captors of Andre came across as patriotic men trying to perform their job.  It is sad that in war, some brace, decent men have to die doing their duty.  Andre was just such a person.  He may have been an inept spy, but he was a decent soldier.	2003-11-21

Snyder's book gives us twenty-five great turning points in history.  From a Western perspective, these twenty-five events are all very valid.  Only one event, the flight of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina could be considered anything other than Western.<br />Other events describe the opening of Japan and Columbus's discovery of America which have tragic effects on the native population.  This book was written in 1971, so the perspective in both dated and not PC.  An author today would be more PC by placing other non Western societal events into the mix.<br />Other than the above criticism, the points Snyder brings up are worth reading and valid.  The turning points include topics on science, religion, military, and political.  This is a short book, and the summary of the twenty-five events is good.  The reader can then pursue topics which are important to him/her.	2003-11-18

Lots of photos plus good summary writing on the history of the Soviet Union.  As they say, a photo is worth a thousand words, and there are a lot of good photos in this book.  The summary writing of the history backs up the photos, although for further detail, you will need to look elsewhere.  Also, a great intro by Robert Conquest who has written some fine books about Stalin's regime.<br />I think photo books serve a good purpose in stirring the interest of the reader.  If a reader is interested in the Soviet Union, this is a good place to start.  I was especially interested in the chapter on the Breshnev era, since I visited the Soviet Union during the Olympic boycott period.  Great photos, good writing.  For further reading about the Soviet Union, look for books by Robert Conquest, W. Bruce Lincoln, and Richard Pipes.	2003-11-17

In the eighties, when this came out in paperback, I purchased it and read it in less than a week.  I looked for my old copy, couldn't find it and then recently purchased a hard cover copy of this book again.  It is the same enjoyable read it was in the eighties.  For those looking for an enjoyable read, this book is it.  The movie pales in comparison to the actual book, since many of the most humorous stories are left out of the movie.  One example is the bank deposit box being broken, and please deposit your money with the fake security guard.  What a laugh.  This should have been put in the movie.<br />Abagnale is a true con and this book is so well written.  For a true adventure story that flows smooth, this is a great book.  I recommend this book--Five plus stars.	2003-11-13

In this particular book, Howarth details the destruction of the true paradise of Tahiti.  First the British and later the Spanish and French come and in essence destroy the island paradise of Tahiti. How did the Western powers do this?  By imposing their morals and attititudes on the islanders who were already a generous and friendly people.  First rough sailors invade the islands and give the islanders sexual diseases.  The islanders were generous in both providing the sailors foods and any sexual favors they desired.  Then missionaries came and tried to impose their morals on an already generous and good people.  These morals also led to the destruction of the people.  Introduction of materialism also hastened the end to these people.<br />The results of all this change was a drastic reduction in the islands population and a complete change in the people's attitudes.  Later colonialism by the French and tourism destroyed whatever remained of this fabulous culture.  One of the reasons few native cultures now exist in this world, is colonialism and tourism destroying the essential aspects of the natives.  Tahiti changed because of the actions of the British and French.	2003-11-10

Starobin takes a collection of letters and places them in book form to show the inhumanity of slavery.  Along with these letters, are short bits of history about slave families, the desire for liberty, emigration to Liberia, and slave insurrections.  Even though Starobin is a Marxist, this book shows the true nature of slavery and how it undermined both the slave masters and those in bondage.<br />This book is very difficult to read, since most people in bondage were prevented from learning how to read and write.  The letters in the book are very difficult to read.  This is no fault of Starobin, he wants the reader to draw his own opinions.<br />However, one can see the sufferings of those in bondage, and know the inhumanity of slavery.  I think this puts to rest people who say slavery benefited the black population by civilizing them.  One telling letter was by a freed slave writing to a white pastor and asking why the pastor preached to the white slave holding families and not the poor blacks outside.  The slave asks if it was because these white families had money, and the blacks none.  This slave had more sense than that pastor.<br />A revealing book about the evils of slavery.	2003-11-01

As the previous reviewers have already noted, this is a great book defining how the Holocaust happened in one of the most civilized nations in Europe.  Wistrich notes the rise of anti Semitism in Germany and the rest of Europe during the ninetenth and twentieth centuries.  Even though thousands of German Jews gave their lives in the trench warfare on the Western Front during World War II, the Nazis blamed the Jews for the stab in the back.<br />In this book, Hitler's main aim was to rid Eurpe of all its Jews.  His goal continued despite setbacks on the fighting fronts.  Hungarian Jews were murdered up to the closing months of the war, even though Germany was in the process of being defeated.  Germany's loss was also blamed on the Jews.<br />Wistrich gives us a scholarly analysis of why the Jews were selected, how the lack of solidarity in the Jewish population helped the Nazis kill their victims, and why the Western Allies did little to stop the killing.  As Wistich states, other genocides in later years just shows how little has changed in the history of genocide.  A minority group is selected for the blame of something, and revenge is exacted.<br />This is a great scholarly read for why the Holocaust happened.  It places Hitler front and center in one of the greatest crimes of all time.	2003-11-01

If one wants an good reading experience on the fighter jocks in World War II, this is not the book.  Abner who must be pushing eighty now, writes about his experiences as a fighter pilot in the good war.  However the writing is all over the place.  First we hear about his childhood, then his romance and training, and then finally about his air experiences over occupied Europe.<br />Abner had fifty plus combat missions.  We hear about the loss of fighter pilots, and his revenge on one hapless German pilot.<br />What I don't like in this book are the letters written to his family after the fact.  Abner must have read about the war after his experiences, and then included his experiences in these letters.  This is disturbing since it is so much filler in a book which is already short (150 pages).  There are other books out there which are more informative on the fighter jocks experiences.  This is not one of the good books.<br />I admire Abner as a hero for his experiences in World War II.  However this is not a good book to read.	2003-11-01

Winter explains all the aspects of the soldier's lives such as the class background, officers, education, weapons, life in the trench and back area, and the aftermath for these soldiers.  The reader is meant to ponder what this war meant, but it was hell.<br />Winter limited his perspective to the British soldier, so one wonders how the German, Austrian, French, and Russian soldiers lived in comparison with the British.  It would have been a nice chapter for a comparison.  However Winter does a good job explaining all aspects of the British soldier's life.<br />A good read of a tragic war.

Like the previous reviewer, this is an overview from several people's perspectives on the German Republic after William II and before Adolf Hitler.  Some parts of the book are interesting, but some are just boring--especially relating to the cultural and sexual revolution in Germany.  This is not an in depth study, so really it is just the cited sources perspective which could be right or wrong.<br />De Jonge is a great author and his book on Rasputin flowed really well.  This book did not flow as well, but there is interesting material in here.  Those people's perspectives count in why Hitler rose to power.  The violence of Weimar as described in the book was a fairly new perspective.<br />A worthwhile, short read on the Weimar Republic.	2003-10-22

Barbary's book is a nice quick summary of the war in the Crimea.<br />The book is approximately 150 pages long, so the author gives a quick review of the battles including the Charge of the Light Brigade, and a review of Florence Nightingale.  The perspective is British, so don't expect to get a great viewpoint from the Russians or French.  One chapter deals with the experiences of Tolstoy in this war.<br />Barbary treats the Charge of the Light Brigade in a different light than some other authors.  The General commanding the charge is praised as brave, while the fault is all laid at the feet of the Commander in Chief.  In the references, the author lists The Reasons Why book as an authority, but Barbary lays the blame on the Commander in Chief for this self destructive action.<br />I list this as an average read of the Crimean War.  The book is interesting and short.  Those needing further details need to look elsewhere.	2003-10-21

Deaver offers a personal glimpse of one of our great modern presidents, and his interaction with him.  The book does jump around, but it is an easy read, and enjoyable.  Unfornately Deaver is not critical enough on Reagan on some points, and the book tends to hero worship.  Other than those two points, the book is very enjoyable.  As Deaver says of Reagan, what you see is what you get.<br />I voted and campaigned for Reagan/Bush is both 1980 and 1984.  I often wondered what the personal Reagan was really like, and this book at least satisfies some knowledge requirements.  Reagan was a complex man in many ways.  This book shows him as a simple man who pursued policy regardless of the poll statistics.  He was also a softy when it came to common people's requests.  This book shows the personal side of a great American President.	2003-10-13

A great book about a sad disaster.  The Kursk was the pride of the Russian attack submarine fleet and one of the newest ships in the Navy.  On an exercise in the Arctic Ocean, the submarine blew up and sank.  Twenty six people survived the blast but died on the bottom of the ocean because the Russian Navy did not have adequate rescue facilities or did not want ask foreign governments for help.  This was truly needless death.<br />Moore does a good job of detailing the death of this submarine and the decline of the Russian Navy.  Although the book is great to read, it does start off slowly, and the circumstances of the explosion is still in doubt.  Some say the warheads of one of the torpedoes went off, while Moore states categorically that it was the fuel of the torpedo which caused a flash fire and set the other warheads off.  The reason for the submarine exploding is still in doubt, but the aftermath is all too real in the suffering of the families of the crew members.<br />I have read another book about this subject--Kursk Down, but this is a superior read.	2003-10-11
947143:US	49945008	R2VVVTEII8IXHF	0811724336	951594971	The Winter War: The Soviet Attack on Finland, 1939-1940 (Stackpole Military History Series)	Books	4	22	23	N	N	A summary of the War between the Soviet Union and Finland.	This is a nice summary book of the war between the Soviet Union and Finland.  This book was written back in 1973, and the one on sale here is a reprint.  Trotter's book, A Frozen Hell is probably a better book because it gives an analysis of the war, where this book are reflections of the war from the Finish viewpoint.  However this book has merit, simply because it has recorded some of the sufferings on the Finish side, in the war with a super powver.<br />For those people wanting a balanced point of view, go with Trotter's book.  For those who only need a brief history of this event, this is an adequate and very readable book, complete with pictures.  As one of the previous reviewers has pointed out, one of the authors is a Finn, and this is his first book, so the wording might be a little stilted.  However, I don't think it detracts from the story of a war where the Soviets may have suffered over a million casualities, while inflicting only 50,000 casualities on the Finnish population.  The Soviets bit off more than they could chew when they decided to invade Finland.	2003-10-09

This is one of those nice picture books with the summary of the history of Russia at the time of Napeleon's Invasion in 1812.  The summary includes a short history of the country up to the time of these wars.  Special focus on Alexander I as the Tsar of all Russia is also included in this book.  Tolstoy's book is the central theme in this book.  Since War and Peace took place in this period, Palmer discribes the actual Russia of this time.<br />A person can read this book in one to two days.  For those people who are interested in Czarist Russia, this is nice book describing the pre industrial Russia of Catherine II, Paul I, and Alexander I.  This book does not delve into Russian politics or society too much, so a reader interested in those subjects would need to look elsewhere.	2003-10-06

An interesting story of the operation of anti-Nazi forces in Norway during World War II.  Howarth was the Royal Navy officer responsible for coordinating activities with Norwegian fishermen during this time.  The stories represent the resistance Norwegians provided the Nazis and Quislings in Norway.  Howarth was not allowed to go to Norway because of the dangerous activites, but his account is first hand, so I discount the previous reviewers assertion that this book is not truthful enough.  From the previous reviewer's viewpoint, we can't trust any second or third party accounts.  Well, Howarth was there and interacted with these resistance fighters, so that is good enough for most readers.<br />The Shetlands are a remote island group of the United Kingdom.  Howarth provides some details of the history of the region, and the geographic detail.  Then the stories of ferrying supplies and spies to German occupied Norway.  These stories are interesting, but not as interesting as the shoot ups I read about in some other Howarth books (We Die Alone, The Sledge Patrol, D-Day -June 6, 1944).  Howarth is a great author, and I have read eight of his books.  Anybody wanting to read good history should read his books.  It is a shame of his recent passing, because I will soon run out of books written by him.	2003-10-04

This is a good book and I am surprised the authors have not had more books after this one.  On the dust cover, they compare this to Alive.  Even though this book is every bit as interesting, I believe the frequency of jumbo jets crashing has made people immune to this type of story.<br />The story is about an Eastern Airlines L-1011 crashing in the Everglades late in December, 1972.  The pilots basically let the auto pilot fly the plane in the ground with the death toll at 103 persons.  Several little problems resulted in a new jumbo jet being crashed.  First two little light bulbs costing $12.00 were not functioning.  The pilots concern over this resulted in them losing focus on landing the aircraft and concentrate on reinstalling the light fixture.  The chief pilot had a brain tumor which may have impaired his vision.  Another airliner problem at Miami caused the air traffic controllers to focus their attention elsewhere.  What happened is that the plane flew itself into the ground.<br />I have seen a movie on this book.  An interesting aside is that purportly some of the L-1011's equipment was salvaged and used in other aircraft.  This caused some hauntings on other EAL  L-1011s.  I don't know if this is true, but the authors do not refer to this in this book.<br />This is a good read about the airline industry.  I wouldn't read it on a plane though.  The airline industry is indeed susceptable to human weakness, as this book points out.	2003-10-02

Another fine book from Edgerton.  For an anthropologist, Edgerton does a good job writing history.  There have been several fine books about the Congo Free State and even Mobutu's Zaire, but none have wrapped up the history of this huge country as Edgerton has in this recent book.  Basically, the author starts out with the description of the country, followed by a chapters on discovering the Congo, the Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, the independence and civil war period, and Mobutu's Zaire.<br />The history goes through 2001.<br />I would have loved to see some views on what will happen to the Congo.  Edgerton states that this country is rich in natural resources, but I wonder if it can really remain one single country due to the many tribes who live in the DRC.  Ethnic hatreds flamed by neighboring aggressive countries will test the strength of this country remaining as one.  If not, perhaps the DRC and it's people will continue to hang on after more bad governments.  For those interested in Africa, this is a worthwhile book.	2003-10-02

Hoyt does a good job detailing the political life of the wartime leader of Japan.  As one of the previous reviewers noted, there is little personal information on Tojo here.  What is detailed is the struggle for the control of Japan from 1936-1945.  Tojo came out on top four months prior to Pearl Harbor.  He was not completely to blame for what happened in Japan and her conquered territories, but his guilt was great.  Hoyt does a good job of detailing why Hirohito was less to blame for the outcome of the war.<br />Tojo was basically a spokeman for the Generals of the Army who guided the country from the early thirties.  He was the son of a samarai who made the transition to the Army.  Hirohito's rule was basically like the shogun ruled Japan.  The Generals had the veto power over all decisions of the government.  The Emperor participated very little in the decisions.  Tojo was the spokesman who ultimately pushed all contenders to the side.  In 1944, he was deposed himself.<br />Hoyt tackles some serious issues in this book such as the mistreatment of prisoners of war(POWs) and European civilians, the war of conquest in China, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity League.  This book may not be the leading authority on Tojo or what happened in military Japan, but it is a great summary of some difficult history.	2003-09-29

If there are any doubters about the evils of slavery, read this book.  I have heard it said by some white Southerners that slavery benefited the black population, and furthermore blacks were better off in the United States than in Africa.  Slavery was evil and this book proves it.<br />Douglass points out how slaveholders killed and mutilated their own slaves, and nobody did anything about it.  When a slave outlived his/her usefulness, the slaveholder often cast them off, so they did not have to feed and clothe these slaves.  Slave families were often broken up for the benefit of the slaveholder.  Wives and husbands were separated.  Slaves worked long hard days and then had to turn over their pay to their slaveholder.  If slaves tried to educate themselves, the slaveholders would break up their classes and then punish those seeking the education.  Same with those seeking comfort from the Holy Bible.  Those slaves were punished.<br />The question was did slavery benefit the black slave population of the South.  The answer is a resounding NO.  Douglass does a good job of detailing the hell of slavery.	2003-09-23

Gordon's book is a little wooden, but it packs a lot of history in this short 170 pages.  Some of the other Penguin life books have been a little wacky in their interpretation of the life of these great people, but Gordon does very well in her version of Joan of Arc.<br />Joan of Arc was a great leader of people in the unification of France.  However her life was very short, and her military insight was slight causing her to be ultimately defeated.  King Charles may have been a slacker but at least he saw his goal of a united France, long after Joan went up in flames.  I think Gordon does a good job in detailing this.<br />At the end, Gordon shows us the after effects of Joan being burned.  The Catholic Church bowing to political pressure started the process of making Joan a Saint in the late 1800s.  Gordon relates these events in a concise summary.  A good short read for those interested in the history of France.	2003-09-19

First, I don't know what book those previous people read, but I only consider it an average read.  Leninger intersperses his book with official communications, radio intercepts, and other related material which tell the story of the 4th Infantry Division, but rupture the flow of his story.  When Leninger does write, it is very interesting.  Otherwise the government reports are government reports and those are boring even though they talk of KIA, MIA, and WIA.<br />Also, Leninger seems to be a little bit of a slacker, and this is born out in the writing.  He criticizes officers who also made the supreme sacrifice of their life. One lietenant was especially criticized, even though he paid with his own life.<br />I also don't like the tone of the language when refering to Asians.  I understand Leninger's second wife is an Asian, yet the language appears in the text.  I know grunts spoke like that in Vietnam, but after initially talking about it, why repeat it endlessly.  Leninger held onto his religion in this conflict, but yet he disparages his enemies, officers, smokes drugs, and a number of other things.<br />This is an average read, and for a non professional author such as Leninger that is good.  However, there are better books out there, so if the reader has a choice, read something a little better.	2003-09-17

I have read Greene's Quiet American and Our Man in Havana.  This book is just as good a read as those.  Few people have read this as compared to the other two, since the setting is Haiti, the island prison of Papa and Baby Doc.  The Duvaliers are gone, but the memory remains in Haiti.<br />I visited Haiti and Porte au Prince and found the hotel where the setting took place.  In fact Graham Greene wrote his story while living in this hotel.  It is a great old place owned by a family.  Anybody visiting Haiti should stay there.  Pictures of this place should be placed in the newer editions of this novel.<br />For those of you reading this piece of fiction, the Comedians is not funny.  It is about people putting a mask on their true feelings, rather than display them in this island dictatorship.<br />The only true people were the Doctor and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Papa Doc.  They did not have to place a mask on their feelings.  They were their true selves.  Jones, Browne, the Minister of Social Affairs, Martha, and the Ambassador were the ones playing the Comedians in this deadly place.  Their struggle in the setting of Papa Doc's Haiti is the story which you see in the Comedians.<br />This is a good story which is entertaining.  The setting of Papa Doc's Haiti is the real thing, but the rest is fiction.	2003-09-15

Armstrong does a good job of clearing up some misconceptions about Islam, especially the split between Shiite and Sunni.  The history is pretty clear.  The chronology, important terms, and important dates were welcome additions.  There is a lot of meat in this small book.<br />The one point which I feel is well taken is the talk of fundamentalism.  Armstrong states that fundamentalists exist in all major religions, including Islam.  Fundamentalists seek to roll the clock back to the good old days, whatever that means.  In the process, they add more to the religion than the original founders had meant.  This addition may be good and bad, but this is what fundamentalists do.  Most of what is added may be good, but the outside world never hears about that.  What we hear about is how fundamentalists like Bin Laden murder thousands of people in the name of a peaceful religion.<br />One point I disagree about is the nature of autocracy in an agrarian state.  Armstrong seems to think democracy can only exist in a industrial society.  I feel there are models where democracy can exist in an agrarian economy.<br />Altogether a good read about a religion which is much in the news these days.  Armstrong covers her subject well.	2003-09-13

I believe this to be a unique book about what is going to happen after Germany is conquered and Hitler gone.  Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States all had different thoughts about what needed to be done to Germany.  In the United States there were differences between the State Department and the Treasury Department about what would become of Germany.  The Treasury Department headed by Morgenthau was for a vindicative peace.  Morgenthau was Jewish and wanted Germany to be divided and an agrarian nation.  Hull wanted a generous peace where the U.S. would help the Germans reconstruct, and stay an industrial nation so she could rebuild Europe.<br />I shudder to think if we had heeded Morgenthau on Germany.  The rest of Europe would have become Communist.  Fortunately, Morgenthau failed and Truman got him to resign.  This book details the policy battles between the State, Treasury, and War Departments about the fate of Germany.<br />Beschloss does a good job detailing the policy battles between the departments and differences with the British and Soviets.  This book was very readable, and not difficult to go through.  I have some of Beschloss's other books, which I haven't read and this will spur me to read these.  This was a pretty good read, especially for a policy book.	2003-09-11

Lee and then some.  Blount tries to give us the psychology of Lee and tends to put the focus off Lee when he does this.  I am sure Blount is a real good cynic, but Robert E. Lee and the Civil War need better than this.  When you do a biography of a great man like Lee, why spend excessive time talking of his tiny feet.  For that matter, why talk about a joke called Pusyism and then spend ten or more pages reviewing this.  (Pusyism was a movement in the Church of England, instilling more Roman Catholic traditions into the church, such as unmarried priests and the lead proponent was Father Pusy).  Blount focuses on this an awful lot, when he should expand on Robert E. Lee.<br />Blount does an alright job reviewing the personal life of Robert E. Lee.  However he does very poorly in analysis of his professional life and focuses a great deal on areas not relevant.  I would have loved to have had Blount's opinion of the relationship between Lee and Davis, but sadly this is missing.  What we get is jokes about feet and Pusyism.  Jeepers, I could have done better with another book about Lee, by somebody more professional like Burke Davis.	2003-09-06

Hoyt has written several books about WWII.  This is a rather short book and summarizes the battle.  The Japanese lost the light carrier Shoho and the Americans lost the fleet carrier Lexington, plus a destroyer and an oiler.  However, the Japanese were turned back from their objective of Port Moresby and lost the use of two carriers in the next battle Midway.  So therefore the Japanese suffered their first setback and the effects of two additional carriers at Midway may have tipped the balance.  After Midway, the Japanese were on the defensive.<br />I would have liked a little more information about the battle, but Hoyt in this book is only summarizing the battle.  I like his saga of the oiler Neosho and how this wreck drifted several miles before the crew were rescued.  Also lacking was the Japanese perspective of the battle.  Hoyt does give some info from this perspective, but I felt it was too little.<br />Overall a good read, about a little written about battle.  Everyone has heard about Pearl Harbor and Midway but few have heard about the Battle of the Coral Sea.  The battle resulted in the loss of the Lady Lex, but checked the Japanese for the first time.	2003-09-05

America had only six carriers at the beginning of World War II.  The oldest was the Lexington, the second carrier in the U.S. Fleet after the Langley.  She was build on the frame of a battle cruiser, had a good crew headed by Sherman, and a good record.  During the Battle of the Coral Sea she was lost after sustaining multiple torpedo and bomb hits which exploded ordinance inside here.  The author details the history of this mighty ship and the last eight hours of her life.<br />I like the insight the author put into this book.  He interviewed a good number of personnel from the Lexington before he wrote this account.  This shows the didication the personnel of the ship had towards saving her after her many hits.  It also shows the death of many while fighting the fires and then abandoning the ship.  It is a great story about a great ship.	2003-09-02

An average read about the life and death of the Tirpitz, the sister ship of the Bismarck.  The author was on one of the British ships protecting convoys to North Russia, and the Tirpitz posed a risk to these convoys.  He also produced a BBC show on the same ship.<br />This book is a picture book of this super battleship.  She posed a risk and tied down many British ships of the line.  As a result, the British tried a number of times to sink her by submarine and aircraft.  These many attempts at first damaged the ship and then sank her.  The British story about the pursuit and sinkings of this ship is almost as dramatic as that of the sinking of the Bismarck.<br />Kennedy's writing is OK.  The pictures are great.  The ULTRA translations are adequate in the telling of this story.  It seems ULTRA played a big part in how the British accessed the threat from this super battleship.  This is a great story, but an average read.	2003-08-29

After dropping out of college, he is drafted into the U.S. Army in 1965.  He goes because he feels it is his duty to serve.  His father tells him to make the best of it.<br />What he finds is racism in the U.S. Army.  Not only do the officers send him on guard and KP duty more times than the others, but once in Nam they send him on more dangerous duties.<br />He finds the Army divided between Souls, white men, and Hispanics.  Not only does this prevent the units from fighting more effectively, but it causes a hatred toward his fellow soldiers rather than the enemy.  He finally gets out and heads home to a divided land.<br />I think this book points out a unique perspective.  America was divided in the sixties, and blacks and others did not have equal rights.  However our nation put them at risk in foreign lands to back up our foreign policy.  This is a good perspective of the black soldier in Vietnam.	2003-08-28

As a previous reviewer has stated, this is a good short history of Winston Churchill.  Keegan does a competent job of giving us the short version on this great man.  However it is not really inspired writing, and not a page turner.  I found myself plodding through this book and wondering when the tempo would change.  It didn't.  All of the highlights of Churchill's life are there, it just didn't flow well.<br />There are many great books about Winston Churchill.  Some comprise several volumes.  I would rate Manchester the best in terms of biography.  Keegan's book is a good first start for those who don't know much of Churchill.	2003-08-27

The previous reviewers are quite correct that this is a very short volume about the defeat of Custer at the Little Big Horn.<br />Mari Sandoz died shortly after writing this book.  I don't diagree with some of the author's comments about the massacre of Indians at other battles and the possibility of Custer seeking the Presidency.  I think historical facts show these to be true.<br />Sandoz shows the battle from both sides.  Since she knew some of the participants in this battle (Indians) she vividly recreates what the battle must have been like.  Recent digs at the site have concluded some soldiers did indeed flee down toward the river before they were massacred.  Custer is shown as a man seeking fame.  I think it stupid that he went into battle after dividing his command in the face of a huge number of foe.  One wonders what he was thinking of when he did this.  The pursuit of fame had to be the chief cause.  The result was the death of 265 men.<br />A good book to read.  Some facts are debateable, but this is a quick easy read and one which presents one side of Custer.	2003-08-22

Why did the South lose the war?  Well, Jefferson Davis interfered with the role his commanding generals played in their respective theaters.  Davis enjoyed a good relationship with Robert E. Lee but less desireable relationships with Johnson and Bragg.  The Western commanders and the Army of Tennessee were a less dangerous foe to the Union forces.<br />In this book of essays from different authors, Davis's relationship with such generals as Johnson, Bragg, Hood, Lee, and others are portrayed. His interference in their commands made the difference in the West.  Lee was more of a diplomat and managed to cope and modify Davis's demands for the Army of Northern Virginia.  Also portrayed is a unique essay on how the wives of these Generals also had an effect on the war.  Jeff Davis was a poor commander, and most of his Generals (with the exception of Lee) failures.  Lincoln was the better Commander in Chief and that is one of the reasons he won the war.<br />A good read about the command function of the leader of a nation.<br />This book stirs your interest in why the South lost and the North won.	2003-08-22

Eisenhower's son writes very well, and this is the third book I have read of his.  He writes like Ambrose, so the flow of these books is good.  In this book, Eisenhower tackles the subject of his father as he would like to remember him--that as the General and Supreme Allied Commander.  This is not a biography but rather glimspes of his father and his interaction with some other famous personalities such as Marshall, Pershing, De Galle, Churchill, Patton,and Montgomery.<br />Some of the stories Eisenhower tells in this book deal with the working relationship of his father with these persons.  Montgomery was by far the most difficult of these persons.  What surprised me was how Ike regarded De Galle in a very favorable light.  Why Eisenhower talked about these persons and not others like Roosevelt and Bradley also amazed me.  Why were these people excluded from the book?<br />Otherwise, another great read from Eisenhower.  I hope he has another few books left in him so the history reader can enjoy his work.	2003-08-18

I have read some other books about Napeleon, but this one by Johnson was by far the most negative.  In this book, Napeleon is called a number of things such as antichrist, a tin horn dictator, a totalitarian dicatator, the sponsor of the first police state.  I am not sure these all could apply to Napeleon.  However I agree with one assessment and that is Bonaparte was indeed an opportunist.<br />Anyone reading this book will find that historical aspects of this major figure are little written about.  What is written about is how Napoleon rose from a minor officer in the artillery to Emperor of France and controller of Europe.  All the negatives of the French regime are written about and few of the positives are emphasized.  I was astounded to see how Johnson equated Napeleon's regime to cardboard.  I don't think I would make that assessment.<br />It is apparent Johnson does not regard Napeleon in high regard.  A much more balanced account may have swayed me to some of Johnson's points of view, but there is none in this book.  An easy read, but don't believe everything.	2003-08-16

There is very little writing in this book, so it is a photo history.  The book is in three languages, so two other translations appear along with the English.  Some of these are very touching photos, two dead Germans who appear to be soldiers but are in fact women who fought.  Another picture of a dead soldier with a Christmas card from his family opened up.  Most of the photos are those of the aftermath of the war when soldiers occupy Germany.  These show the devastation of war, and the effects on the population.<br />I rate this as an average read, but in fact there is little to read.  The pictures are great, but it would have been nice to see Vacarro's perspective along with these photos.  The reader (?) is left to make his/her own judgement on what they are seeing.	2003-08-12

A good read about the crisis in Islam.  The reader gets to view how contemporary Muslims blaspheme their own religion by performing acts of terror that are not sanctioned by Islam.  Khomeini issues a fatwa ordering the death of a author in a remote land.  Lewis descibes how this is very much against the laws of Islam.  Imagine a holy man violating the very laws he has lived his life under.  Usama bin Laden orders suicide bombers to kill thousands of innocent men, women, and children.  Another blasphemy.  Islam condemns suicide and the killing of innocent people.  Yet the Muslim world just yawns, and says America deserves it.  Lewis does do a good job with detailing the crisis in Islam.  If this great religion comes under the control of such people as Khomeini and bin Laden, they will destroy this religion and the progression of their people.  Muslims must act to break these people who blaspheme their religion.<br />Despite the previous reviews, this book gives a lot on information on the Muslim attitude and what needs to change in order for this great religion to become a progressive part of their believer's lives.  The Muslim world cannot just blame the West for their problems.  They must actively focus on the problems which face their society without playing the blame game.	2003-08-08

I like Howarth's writings and this has been the sixth or seventh book I read which he authored.  This is a good read, but can't compare with Ryan's book The Longest Day or any of Ambrose's writings.  That said, this was a very informative book, and it places more focus on the British participation than others.  If you read American writings, they focus extensively on the American view point, and leave out the other participants such as the British, Canadians, or even the Norwegians.<br />One thing I like about this particular book was the focus on how the British took tanks and made them specific to the function of the different beaches.  Some tanks detonated mines, others bridged the seawalls, and still others bridged tank ditches.  The Americans used brute force and no specialized equipment and thus incurred more casualities on Omaha Beach.  I have not seen this in other writings.<br />This is a good read on D-Day.  If read with some of the other books, the reader will get a detailed portrait of what happened on June 6, 1944.  This British author's writings have a flow that makes the book interesting throughout the 250 pages.	2003-08-04

Delbo is a French Resistance person who is caught by the Germans and put in their death camps.  The last camp she served in was Auschwitz.  In this very short book she writes of the horrors of the death camps.  The writing is almost dream like (or nightmare like). One might have to read the passages twice in order to understand what she is trying to pass along.<br />What can you say about these books.  They describe man's cruelty to his fellow man.  They all point to the suffering of those imprisoned in these camps.  Because of this, they are all good reads, and Delbo's book is no different.  Since Delbo is not Jewish, one can see that all types of people were killed off by the Nazis.<br />Since this book is so short, a person can finish this off in two to four hours.  The perspective gained might help to prevent such suffering in the future.	2003-08-04

This book covers 25 essays on life in Eastern Europe after Communism has gone to the wood pile.  I like Drakulic's sense of humor and commentary about life after Communism.  Many of these stories are about her native Croatia.  She focuses on both the excesses of both Communism and Fascism.  Each essay would require its own commentary, but here is my general impression.<br />It will take many years for Eastern Europeans to overcome the legacy of the Communist era.  During this time, a market economy will be slow to develop, and the social consequences will be great.  Older people will adapt the least and be the most affected.<br />Democracy will also be slow to develop, as can be seen in her Croatia.  Croatia was until recently ruled by Tudjman who was a Communist General in the Yugoslav Army. Tudjman controlled Croatia even though it was suppossed to be a democratic state.  He was allied with some of the Fascists who created a Croatian state in World War II.  A strange combination, but one which shows the nationalism controlling Eastern Europe.  Monarchy is also a possibility in this region.<br />The slow prospect of reform in all the region.  Society has been slow to cast off the restraints of the old system.  People still rever the old authorities, when they should adopt new systems and leaders.<br />Drakulic poses all these questions to the reader.  I'm not sure all are relevant, but it makes good reading.	2003-08-01

This is a hard read for such a short book.  The subject matter in these essays show how the provicials (Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton) created a new world order with their ideas and writings.  Such writings as the Federalist papers are now more quoted today than they were when they were created.  These ideas revolutionized how other countries changed their societies.  That is the essence of this book.<br />Bailyn describes these ideas in this short book.  The concepts are good in terms of how the founders poured the foundations which the United States stands on today.  What is missing is how other events (the American and French Revolutions) also changed the Atlantic states.  Ideas can help change societies, but force and political power have more relevance in change.<br />I would not suggest this book to the average reader interested in the American Revolution.  These concepts are perhaps too deep for the average reader.  Bailyn is writing for the academic audience.	2003-07-31

Keneally may not be as exalted a writer as others who have written about our greatest President, but he does a good job summarizing Abraham Lincoln.  At approximately 150 pages, the reader learns about Lincoln's early heritage and the political and military battles of his Presidency.  This is basic stuff, so if a reader needs more details, consult some of the other fine books on Lincoln.<br />I find some of the info about Lincoln somewhat in doubt.  First Keneally states Lincoln may have had a sexual disease.  I have read some on Lincoln, but I never found that in other references.  Perhaps I missed that somewhere.  Also in doubt is Lincoln's paternity where Tom Lincoln was not the father of Abraham.  Keneally dismisses that but should we include that in a short biography of this famous man.<br />Overall a good concise read on our most famous President.  Readers who desire the basics on this man will do well to read this book.	2003-07-28

Drakulic's book is a series of essays about the difficulty of life in Eastern Europe from a woman's perspective.  Communism collasped because it could not satisfy the demands of the population.  Drakulic details many of those shortcomings in her book.  Not only did Communism produce poor paint and bad toilet paper, it did not even produce tampons or other products for women.  That is why Communism failed.  Few history books will detail this perspective, but from a humanistic point of view, it is true.<br />The other perspective Drakulic tries to point out is that of a journalist pointing to the failures of both Communist and Western society.  Drakulic portrays the homeless of NYC with the fact that in Communist society everybody is poor but not homeless.  These perspectives are needed as well, because some aspects of Communism were indeed noble.<br />A good book about the failure of Communism.  This book was a short informative read about a doomed political system.	2003-07-26

While Europe was in the dark during the Middle Ages, the Middle East was the center of tolerance, learning, and political development.  Sometime during then and now, the West (Europe and North America) became the leaders with the rest of the world falling behind.  While some areas (Far East Asia) have caught up with the West, the Middle Eastern countries (except Turkey) have stagnated and no longer count in the economy (other than oil extraction).  How did this happen?  Lewis seeks the answers for the stagnation of the Middle East.<br />The focus is on Islam and how to an extent it has held up the Middle Eastern countries from developing  the society, economy, and political structure.  Lewis details how Turk, Persian, and Arab societies have developed, and what keeps them from moving into modernity.  Not only are these societies stagnating, but real risks are at stake if these countries turn fundamentalist.  These risks will confront the West.<br />I good summary of why the Middle East is failings its own people.  Lewis cites plenty of examples to give his views credence.  A pretty good read.	2003-07-24

Bernard Lewis is a prominent Middle East historian whose current works focus on the causes and use of terrorism in this area.  This is one of his first books and he details the rise of the assassins in the Shiite area of Syria and Iran.  The Assassins practiced political terror, since they were a small sect which held little ground.  The use of assassination gave them advantages over their larger rivals, since it instilled fear into the top polical level of their rivals.  These rivals wanted to control the Ismaili territories, but could not due to their location and the threat which assassination posed.<br />Lewis's book is overly scholarly and the readability of this short book is difficult.  Many complex Islamic names also hinder the reader's ability to comprehend some of this material.  However, the book gives the story of the rise of the assassins and the history of the religion of the Ismailis and the Aga Khan.<br />This book is beneficial to the history of the Middle East.	2003-07-21

A nice little book about a battle between U.S. and Imperial Japanese Navy ships in Iron Bottom Sound.  During this brief encounter the U.S. Navy sunk a Japanese cruiser and destroyer at a cost of a destroyer.  Subsequent action by airplanes out of Henderson sunk an additional two Japanese destroyers.<br />Cook was a participant in this battle and goes into great detail about what happened.  The U.S. Navy which had been rather lackluster up to this point, showed they were brave and ready to confront equal or superior forces.  The result was the Japanese were bested in this battle, with moderate losses.  They withdrew after completing their mission.<br />Since the book is short at only 150 pages, the reader can easily read this in a few hours and understand a little on the Guadalcanal campaign, especially the naval side.	2003-07-19

The author who is British paints the administrative qualities of Eisenhower and how his contributions contributed to the Victory in Europe.  Eisenhower was impartial with all the forces under his command-whether they are American, British, Canadian, or French.<br />Sixsmith details the plans to invade North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France.  With the people under his command, it is a wonder how he managed to get consensus on the goals and push the team toward victory.  Sixsmith does a wonderful job of detailing all of these conflicts with the various generals and Churchill, Roosevelt, and DeGalle.  Eisenhower really was a superior administrative genius and his abilities were as good or better than George Marshall.  It was great we had Eisenhower on our side during WWII.<br />This was a short read which detailed the military aspects of Dwight Eisenhower.  For more detail on his early life or later political life, one has to read elsewhere--perhaps Ambrose.	2003-07-14

I like Farcau as an author because he brings to light the little known conflicts of South America.  Obviously he has a special link to this area as his wife and father in law are Bolivian.  Of his two works, The War of the Pacific is by far the better.  In the Chaco War, he details the military and political battles that led to Bolivia and Paraguay going to war over worthless semi arid land.  This war resulted in 100,000 deaths and pointed to the incapacity of the League of Nations in controlling conflict.<br />Farcau does a good job in showing why the Bolivians lost even though they had more money and people.  The Bolivians fought between themselves.  The military fought the politicians.  The generals fought other generals.  Paraguay had a unified system where the politicians supported the generals.  The result was a win by Paraguay of huge tracks of worthless land.<br />As a previous reader has already noted, this book is riddled with typos.  Also the one map did not help the reader in understanding how the military forces were moved.  There should have been ten maps in this book, detailing the moves of the various campaigns.  I felt lost reading of the movements without having a map to consult.  Otherwise a fairly decent read.	2003-07-14

The author Rezak Hukanovic is a Bosnian Muslim living in a small city of Prijedor.  As the country Yugoslavia breaks apart, an independent republic Bosnia emerges.  The Serbs act on this and take over some cities such as Prijedor.  The Serbs round up the Muslim and Croat males and put them in concentration camps.  Even though Rezak has some friends who are Serbs and he is apolitical, he is put in the same camp as all the others.<br />First the Serbs rob them of their possessions.  Then they rob them of their humanity.  The Serbs torture and execute their victims, even though they knew them in a prior life.  Rezak details all these dispictable crimes committed on the Muslims and Croats.  Even though humanity stated never again after the killing of the Jews in WWII, Rezak details that most of humanity just stood and watched what happened in Bosnia to the Muslims and Croats.  This is a good short read.	2003-07-14

The Americans grow King Cotton with slaves.  They then export it to Manchester to be made into textiles.  These textiles are produced with child labor.  These textiles are then exported to India, where they wipe out the local clothes trade.  The Indians then discover a great crop that has great potential--opium.  The only problem with opium is that it is addictive and eventually kills those using it.  The British want products from China such as tea and silk.  The Chinese desire no Western made goods, so the British introduce opium.  The Chinese government under the detested Manchu rulers want no part of opium, so the British fight two wars to open China up to free trade, including opium.  They seize an island and part of a peninsula to protect the merchant houses that deal in this drug.  They name this Hong Kong.  Other grim business includes the coolie trade (similar to slavery, but only for long periods of time), and the Chinese version of Christianity--the Taipings.  The French and the Americans are also involved in the opium and coolie trade.<br />Beeching does a good job of detailing how the British and to a lesser extent the Americans were not always so noble in their dealings with Third World people.  As detailed above, we exploited their economy, made off with millions of coolies, made others opium addicts, and burned one of their prized monuments--the Summer Palace (looting it in the process).  The men that did this thought the Chinese were the barbarians.  I think Beeching was fair to both sides.  I liked his reference section in which he listed his sources, and then summarized what the opinion was--pro British, pro Chinese.  An excellent work.	2003-07-07

This is a pretty decent photo book about life in Hitler's thousand year Reich (although it only lasted 12 years).  The authors do a rather solid job of covering the highs and lows of the NAZI regime.  Many authors review the military aspect of the struggle, but this book covers the affects on the German society and population.  The beginning chapters deal with Hitler and the rise of the NAZI party.  Throughout the book are great pictures which summarize the life and death of NAZI Germany.<br />At only 210 pages, this is a good summary read of Hitler and his Germany.  The only thing which I disagreed with was one of the final chapters on the Eastern Front.  It had interviews with two German soldiers captured by the Russians.  These soldiers stated they were fairly treated by the front line soldiers.  I don't doubt that some German soldiers did get fair treatment by the Soviets but the overwhelming percentage were interned and fewer than 10 in 100 returned to Germany after the war.  Other than that, a great read on a most dispictable man and his regime.	2003-07-07

The author's analysis of why the ruling family of Portugal failed in implanting the monarchy in Brazil.  Some of the subject matter includes the loss of support from the armed forces and the abolition of slavery as keys to loss of support for the monarchy and the fall of Dom Pedro II.<br />Dom Pedro was indeed a popular monarch and very much appealed to the common people.  However these were not the people pulling the strings in Brazil.  Planters upset with the loss of their property (slaves) and generals upset with his decisions made the throne unstable.  Dom Pedro II was a liberal, well intentioned monarch, but proved unable to pass on his throne.<br />I gave the book only three stars because of Haring's dry analysis.  It should have been more interesting.	2003-07-02

Johnson does a great job of summarizing the Renaissance in a quick 150 pages.  The book summarizes the forward thinking which resulted in a revolution in the sculpture, paintings, and buildings of this period.  Man was outwardly focused during this time and shows developments in Italy and then in the rest of Europe.<br />The problem that I find with these quick reads of a complex subject is they have so little space to explain the subject and adequately make it interesting.  Johnson does a great job in the summary but fails to motivate the reader to other works which expound on the Renaissance.<br />For those who need a quick read on this fascinating time in history, this is a quite capable book.  It describes the advancement in literature, sculpture, painting, and building of this period.	2003-07-01

Henissart details the last year of French rule in Algeria which resulted in the General's Putsch and the formation and destruction of the OAS.  If the reader is looking for an account of the fight of the FLN, you will not find it in this book.  This is strictly an account of the OAS and pied nor fight for French Algeria.<br />This is a account of the guerrilla role played by the OAS in their fight for French Algeria.  Henissart details the brutalities of the OAS, especially of the Delta commandos.  Salan's role in the uprising is also examined.  Since the struggle occurred mainly in Algiers and Oran, this is where most of the history of the conflict is written.  The author also summarizes the politics of the Fifth Republic and De Galle.  Since the Fifth Republic was so divided politically by the war in Algeria, Henissart gives the reader an overview of the opinions of the French public.<br />This is an excellent book on the last days of French Algeria.  Again I would caution the reader that this book is about the OAS and not the struggle of the FLN.  One only gets pieces of info on the FLN, and thus an incomplete picture of their struggle.  For a more complete read of the struggle in Algeria, read Alistair Horne's excellent book A Savage War of Peace.	2003-06-28

St. Augustine's life was that of a writer on the relationship between God and his people.  Much of the material he has written forms the backbone of the Christian religions.  He is an important person in Western civilization.  This book by Garry Wills is supposed to tell Augustine's biography.  Instead Wills spends countless pages on philosophical arguments and one does not get a good view of this man nor the times he lived in.<br />A previous reviewer commented that one should read the writings of St. Augustine himself, rather than try to fathom what he stood for in the Wills book.  I agree with this assessment.<br />I don't really care for Wills' politics and after this book not alot for his writing.  This was a difficult book for me to get through.  Even though it is short, the writing style has a lot to be desired.  Perhaps Wills intended this book for his students at Northwestern.  A real disappointing read!	2003-06-20

As the authors quite rightly put, this was the prelude to Pearl Harbor.  The Italian Navy was stationed at this harbor and posed a threat to British sea routes to Egypt, India, Singapore, and Australia.  A daring attack by 21 aircraft from a British aircraft carrier damaged three Italian battleships and put them out of action for six to nine months.  Since they were in a heavily protected shallow harbor, it was indeed a daring attack, which the Japanese copied to place the American Pacific fleet out of action.  The Japanese attack was on a much larger scale.<br />One of the authors was a member of the attack group, and he gives his own account in the battle.<br />This is a nice little read.  The book is short and has plenty of photos.  A determined reader could finish this book in two to three hours.  Taranto was indeed the prelude the Pearl Harbor, but now few people realize this.  With Lowry's perspective, this is good book about the Second World War.	2003-06-16

Halberstam does a great job of personalizing the September 11, 2001 tragedy by the portrayal of 13 brave New York firefighters of Engine 40, Ladder 35.  Twelve of these men died on that day, along with many employees of the World Trade Center and countless other firemen.  Halberstam gives a short biography of these thirteen along with a history of this particular firehouse.<br />This is a touching tribute to these firemen.  All of them were male and most were white.  Halberstam paints the positive side of all these men and makes them heroes.<br />The one small criticism I have of this book is that it makes these men larger than life.  They are certainly heroes for going into a dangerous area with less than good prospects of returning.<br />These were men performing a dangerous job, but they were still human and had all the frailities of humans.  What of the other hundreds of firemen who did not return that day?  The tragedy of those other hundreds are lost in this story.  This is a good book to read, but the reader has to bear in mind the other losses on that tragic day.	2003-06-16

A good book about the American Revolution.  If people are reading this book for the military history, they should not since this is not Mr. Wood's intent.  The battles are summarized, but the book mainly details the effects on American society of the Revolution.  Wood gives us a good idea why the Revolution took place, and the result of the Revolution.  America matured as a result of this conflict, but not all issues were settled (as in the case of slavery).<br />This is my fourth book which I have read in this series.  They are all solid books and give the reader an idea why this event had so much impact on World History.  Even though these books are short, they still pack a lot of information into them.	2003-06-12

First, this book might not be true since most of the conspirators are dead and the author is writing under an assumed name.  Lin Biao was Defense Minister for ten years during the 1960s and in the late sixties became Mao's Number Two man.  In the book, Lin and his wife and son conspire to kill Mao and take over control of the People's Republic.  Mao was not in the best of health and had only five years to live after these events in September, 1971.<br />What happened is open to speculation.  The author says he had access to secret records which show that Lin and his wife died after a party given by Mao.  His son and some other conspirators chose to flee by a jet and helicopter.  The jet was shot down and the helicopter landed and all the conspirators were either killed or imprisoned.<br />The Westerner will never know what really happened.  The press reported Lin was killed when the jet ran out of gas and crash landed.  Since Red China is not an open society, it will be impossible to know the full story.  Even in an open society, there is much speculation about JFK's assasination.<br />This book is an average read.  The story is open to doubt, but one gets a glimpse of the privileged life of the rulers of Red China.	2003-06-11

A relatively good book about the sea battles which resulted in the loss of the Netherlands East Indies to the Japanese Empire in 1942.  During these battles, the U.S. lost the heavy cruiser Houston, several destroyers, and the first airplane carrier Langley.  The losses to the Australians, Dutch, and British were more heavy.  The plum target for the Japanese were the oil of the Indies and the rich island of Java.  These battles determined the fate of the Dutch Empire in Asia and placed a threat to Australia.<br />One thing I liked about this book, which I felt lacked in some of the other battle books is the relative strength of the Allies versus the Japanese Empire.  Thomas spent a large amount of page space covering this and why the Allies failed in this crucial battle.<br />I gave this book an average rating, since the style of writing by Thomas was not page turning.  The battles were detailed, but no personal experiences were written into them.  One faced why the ABDA forces failed and the Japanese won.	2003-06-09

I have read some of Kurzman's latter writings, so I was surprised by this old book about the politics of the Dominican Republic.  Kurzman details the fall of the first democratically elected President of the Dominican Republic Juan Bosch and the American military intervention in 1965.  Kurzman goes into great detail about the political situation in the Dominican Republic, so this is perhaps not the best book for the novice reader.<br />One can get an idea on the difficulty in imposing a free election system into a land which never knew this form of government (similar to Iraq today).  The United States faced this difficulty in the Dominican Republic in the early sixties, as now it faces it in Iraq.  The transition was not easy in the Dominican Republic, as I am sure it will be difficult in the Iraq.<br />The Americans intervened in the Dominican Republic because it feared the Communists were taking over the government.  Kurzman details in this book that very few Communists were in the revolt.  People supported Juan Bosch and not the Communists.  The Communists had been corrupted by the Trujillo dictatorship.<br />Altogether a good book about the DR and the difficult politics of this country during its crisis years.	2003-06-09

This is an easy read of the story of the 82nd Airborne in the invasion of Panama.  Briggs served in this unit as a First Lt, and he describes his experiences in Operation Just Cause.  His unit occupied the city of Colon and came into conflict with the PDF and the Dignity Battalions.  Since the conflict was not short, that means the book is also short, about 155 pages total.<br />The one thing this fails to relate is why the conflict took place.  This is purely the experiences of a small unit in this small conflict.  If one wants to understand why the United States invaded Panama in 1989, one has to read elsewhere, such as in The Fall of Tyrants.  A pleasant read about a small conflict which lasted a few days.  I like Briggs description of the evolving roles the military has to play in the conflict from combatant to constable.  This is relevant to our present status in Iraq.	2003-05-28

In the last six months, I read the New York Times book Out of the Blue, and to be honest the Germans did a better job with this book.  I think both this and Out of the Blue are 5 star reads though.  What really mattered was the extra information Der Spiegel put into this book.  As an example--how did the U.S. Government figure out the passengers who hijacked the four planes?  Well on one of the calls to an airline headquarters, the stewardess stated the seats the hijackers occupied, and one of these was Atta.  This information was not in Out of the Blue.<br />Also interviews with Atta's father and other hijackers families.<br />The beginning of the book talks quite a bit about the two planes which crashed into the World Trade Center.  Not as much info on the Pennsylvania crash or the Pentagon attack.  What is include gives good detail.  There is more in depth material on the New York attacks. The next to last chapter details how much of the operation was conceived and supported in Hamberg, Germany.  Many of the hijackers not only were educated here, but also settled down there.  Since the authors are Germans, much is detailed on the German connection.<br />In the appendix are some of Atta's writing and the drivel of Bin Laden.  One wonders who believes in this stuff.  It is apparent, bin Laden has not only managed to hijack four planes but believers in a religion.  The writers attempt to make some analysis on this in the summary, but it will still leave the reader shaking his head on these beliefs.<br />One small minus was a number of typos in the copy.<br />Altogether a great read on a tragic event for America.	2003-05-27

I believe Sadat was one of the Mid East's great men.  Here was a person who waged war but desired peace.  The world lost a lot when this great man was assasinated by Islamist fanatics.  Neither his predecessor Nasser or his successor Mubarak rate in his league.  If you have read Sadat's book In Search of Identity, then this book is a rehash of much of what he says in his autobiography.  The book expands a little on recent events such as the Israeli bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor.  Sadat condemned Israel for that.<br />If one wanted an overview of what Sadat stood for, this is the book.  If one wants more, the reader should read his autobiography.	2003-05-23

Most people have seen the film which was based on the book.<br />When reading this book, I came to view Ron Kovic as a self centered egotist.  His injury and his feelings were all that mattered.  If people disagreed with him, they were wrong and he was right.  In fact in the book, if a person disagreed with him, he was obviously guilty of something.  Cops who arrested him were guilty of brutality.  Secret Service agents evicting him from the Republican National Convention were trying to cover up. The Georgia corporal he shot was a bigot.  I don't think Kovic knows but he just surmises.  This goes on throughout the book and it gets a little annoying.

The Japanese were trying to supply and reinforce their New Guinea forces with the addition of 6,000 troops.  Instead, the Australians and Americans had created an air force specializing in low level strafing and skip bombing.  Out of the 14 ship convoy, the Japanese lost all their transports and only two destroyers managed to escape.  McAulay talks in detail how the Allies managed to sink this convoy, even detailing the strafing details of the Japanese soldiers and sailors in the water.<br />The book was an alright read, but with so many pilots and air crews giving their own stories, this led to confusion.  If five different aircraft hit the same ship, there were five different stories on how the ship was sunk.  Thus if one read this book, one would think the Japanese lost a hundred ships, rather than the 12 which they did lose.  I commend the author on shedding light on a little known battle.	2003-05-19

On June 10, 1944 SS troops of the German Das Reich division drove into the French town of Oradour and massacred 642 civilians.  In the past, this action was cited because of the killing of a Major Kampfe by the French resistance.  In this book, Mackness states the real reason was the French resistance ambushing a convoy of German vehicles which contained half a ton of gold.  The Germans thought the gold could have been hidden in Oradour, and that is the reason the civilians were murdered and the buildings burned.<br />Mackness thought about writing this book as a novel, since he had no proof about the half ton of gold.  He initially was thrown into jail for trying to smuggle a small portion of this gold into Switzerland.  Therefore this book is two stories.  One about the smuggling and subsequent jail time of the author and the second about the massacre at Oradour.  He weaves between these two stories throughout the short book.  It was a good read, but this is not proven history so one should take note.	2003-05-12

This seventies book is about the campaign in Malaya which concluded with the successful surrender of the fortress Singapore to Japanese forces in February, 1942.  The campaign to take Thailand, Malaya, and Singapore took exactly seventy days.<br />Falk is very detailed in his writing about what happened to cause the loss of the fortress Singapore.  In one of the chapters of the book, he details the loss of the British Force Z (Repulse and Prince of Wales).<br />Falk does a good job of telling us why the fortress was weak.  Its defenses pointed toward the sea, and not the landward side of Johore.  Also the state of the British Empire waging a war against both Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, weakened the country to the point where inadequate defensive forces were provided to Singapore.  The result was a disasterous defeat of the British, with many of the soldiers spending years in prison building a railroad (The Bridge over the River Kwai).  Falk spent too much time on detailing what units did what, and not descibing what the effect of the defeat had on World War II.  Otherwise a good read on a great defeat of the British Empire by the Japanese Empire.	2003-05-10

Why?  Because the book loses it theme and goes off about the evils of nuclear war, spaceships, alien civilizations, and all sorts of other wacky stuff.<br />What happened at Tunguska in Russia during 1908 is what concerns me.  Something really destuctive exploded above ground and blew apart several hundred square miles of forest and marshland.  What I got in this book was a chapter about the evils of nuclear war.  Then the book goes off about how maybe an alien spaceship hit Tunguska.  Not any alien spaceship, but a probe.  The author then narrows it down to the star where this spaceship came from.  I thought I was reading science fiction at this point.<br />The reality is Tunguska was probably hit by a comet that came into the Earth's atmosphere and exploded above ground.  The author does convince the reader it was not a meteorite.  The rest about spaceships and nuclear war is so much filler which brought the book out to 200 pages.  Hopefully some author will do a better job writing a detailed book about what really did happen at Tunguska.	2003-05-05

I disgree with some of the previous reviewers.  This is a great read for adventure and it is true.  It competes well with fictional Tom Clancy novels.  A small U.S. submarine under an unlucky Captain sinks the largest ship in the Japanese Navy.<br />Shinano was the sister ship to the battleship Yamato (A Glorious Way to Die) and converted into a carrier, the size of one of our nuclear carriers today.  The Japanese intended to confront the U.S. Navy with the tremendous firepower of the Shinano.  Instead a lowly submarine sinks the Shinano on her maiden voyage.<br />Regardless of whether the submarine captain Enright or Ryan wrote the story, it is great adventure.  Enright is certainly frank in his views, even about his own shortcomings.  Both the Japanese and American sides are presented here and this makes it good reading.  One understands the fog of battle, after reading about the pursuit of the carrier.  A good quick read which is not fiction.	2003-05-03

Melby was a worker in the American Embassy in China during the three year Chinese Civil War.  He gives his perspective along with interesting stories about who lost China.  Who lost China?<br />Well, the Generalissimo and the Kuomintang lost China.  Marshall and the U.S. Ambassador Dr. Stuart tried to get the Nationalists and Communists to form a coalition government, but instead both sides were hell bent on trying to beat the other by military means.  One senses a disgust by Melby for the corrupt Nationalist<br />government and a certain trust in the Communists.  However history will prove him wrong because of the subsequent millions of deaths caused by Mao and his henchmen.  The Kuomintang were certainly corrupt and stupid, but history will record them as less brutal than the Communists.<br />This is a hard book to read.  The reader has to have a certain knowledge of Chinese events and persons in order to understand this narrative.  However one will understand why no Americans lost China, it was the Nationalists who defeated themselves.  Chiang Kai Shek does not come off as a trustworthy person, and he ultimately deserves the responsibility for losing his country to the Communists.	2003-04-26

Ferguson reviews the capture of Hong Kong by the Japanese during December, 1941.  Most people have heard of the Bataan Death March and the capture of Singapore, but few have read the history of the capture of Hong Kong.  In November, 1941 the British sent two Canadian regiments to defend this part of the Empire.  These regiments were poorly trained and armed.  Along with the other British forces in Hong Kong,the Canadians resisted the overwhelming Japanese forces for over two weeks.  Ferguson details the battles and the courage of these forces, along with the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers.<br />If I can fault Ferguson anything, he does not go into detail on what happened in the prison camps which also resulted in a significant number of casualties, and the trials of the Japanese officers responsible for the soldiers who sacked Hong Kong.  It would have made a more interesting book.	2003-04-21

Since the war lasted only 18 days, I found this book about right in how to detail this war.<br />This book was written in 1985, so detailed sources from the Soviet archives were not available at the time.  It also details the war more from an Israeli perspective rather that an Arab one, so it is slightly biased.  Also, at times it was rather dry.

Steinberg was one of those people who helped<br />the inmate leadership run the killing camps.  He was a chemist in one of the IB Farben complexes.  His short but powerful story shows how stronger people were consumed, while a flexible youngster survived the camps by doing what he had to do to stay alive.<br />This should be required reading for those people who deny that the Holocaust happened.  It is also a reminder that the general population should always remember these events.

This is a composite book from ten different authors about ten different Presidents.  Since these are all well known authors, the writers know their subjects and boil their personalities down in twenty to thirty pages.  One cannot get more well known than David McCullough and Steven Ambrose.  The writing is great and flows well.<br />If I have any problem, it is that some of the authors are more generous than others.  Reeves makes Kennedy look pretty low on the morality issue and Noonan inflates Reagan a little too much.  Of course, this is subjective writing, and since the authors know their subjects well, one can probably count on some bias.  All in all a great read on some of our more recent Presidents, with the exception of Clinton and Bush II.	2003-04-14

It almost seems like a travel guide with Burgett saying in essence--I went here and then I went there.  Burgett is a good author, but I think he is trying to capitalize on his combat experience.  His first three books detail the combat experience, but this fourth book could have been cut down to fifty pages, and attached onto his last book.  Because of the publisher, they make Burgett get another book out of very minimal material.  I don't think there is a fifth book here Don, so don't try.<br />That said, Burgett is a great author, so please read his first three books about the Normandy Invasion, Battle of the Bulge, and the Holland Campaign.

The author is the brother of the former U.S. Senator from Nevada, Paul Laxalt.  I took a few tours while I was in Reno (along with some gambling)and when I later read this book, I knew what book my guides had read, prior to doing their job with the tourists.  I doubt if any state's history can be made interesting, but Laxalt does a good job.  Nevada is an interesting state compared to the rest of the nation, and the author relates why: precious metals, prize fighting, easy divorce, legal hooking and gambling.  All in a state that is at heart very conservative.<br />This is a short read, and for those who travel to Vegas or Reno often, a necessary read.  Why did Nevada become the way it did?  The book answers this question and details some of the interesting characters of Nevada (Mark Twain, Bugsy Seigal, along with a number of politicos).  At a little over 130 pages, this is a great read to take on the plane to Vegas.	2003-04-07

Jonas makes the reader know who he is supporting, Avner and his four buddies assigned to track down eleven people who had a hand in the Munich murders.<br />I don't know if you can believe everything in this book.  Jonas in his introduction and footnotes, states that some things were just not reported in the newspapers.  When Avner and his buddies kill three Arabs in a church in Switzerland, and there are no news accounts, I wonder if this ever took place.  Same with his buddies who were killed and the Athens KGB man, this might be fiction.  Without knowing who Avner really is, this might be part true or even a novel.<br />All in all a great read on how Israel dealt with terrorism in the seventies.

For much of this book, I learned much about the history of Afghanistan and the people who make up this troubled country.  Up till the last chapter, it was a really interesting read.  Then Griffiths starts talking about his viewpoint on the Taliban and why the West should negotiate with the Taliban government.  Griffiths states that America is out for revenge following the September 11, 2001 attacks, and has picked on Afghanistan.  I don't know much about Griffiths' politics, but I do know he didn't know anyone who died on September 11, 2001.  Much of what the world knows about the Taliban after they lost control of the country show them to be a narrow minded religious party out to remake the modern world and turn the clock back.  And Griffiths thinks we should negotiate with them.<br />For those who want to read this interesting book, rip out Chapters 14 and 15.  They don't make much sense, so why read those chapters.	2003-04-04

In the book, a heroic Ariel Sharon makes his appearance in one of the central battles for control of the Sinai.  All of the battles are covered in this 100 hour war.  Marshall details the tactics the Israeli Army used in defeating the Egyptians.  Also covered is how the Israeli Army is made up, the training required, and the role of women.<br />What is not covered in this book is the Egyptian perspective, and what the effects of the war were.  This angle was not covered, and one wonders what the reader is missing from this perspective.  I have read more thrilling combat history than that covered in this book.	2003-04-04

S. nuclear submarine.	Unlike the previous reviewer, I found this book a good read for those interested in submarine life.  There were some typos in the book, but the reader could figure out what Polmar is trying to say.  This book was originally written in the sixties, and was brought up to date with other submarine accidents.  What is covered is one of the most tragic U.S. Navy accidents.  Polmar covers the short life of this nuclear submarine, and why she may have went down.<br />By now, most people have heard about the Russian submarine Kursk and her fate.  The U.S. Navy suffered a similar tragedy in 1963 with the loss of 129 men and the U.S.S. Thresher.  What is interesting is the way Admiral Rickover (Jimmy Carter's mentor) is pictured in this book.  It seems Rickover tried to cover up for any failure of the nuclear powerplant in the Thresher.  Polmar does an alright job in making the technical data interesting.	2003-04-04

First off, this is one of the rare books which shows the Libyan leader and what he stands for.  It was written in 1987, and does not take into account Libya's role in destroying Pan Am 103.  Desite being somewhat dated, Qaddafi's biography is depicted here.  For those who want to know why the world should be careful of this dictator, this is the book which shows the terrorism, murder, and cruel behavior of Qaddafi.  From the murder of dissidents and a police woman in London, to the bombing of a Berlin disco, the authors depict the nature of Qaddafi and his regime.  He has much in common with Saddam Hussein, even though Qaddafi hates him.<br />I found the life of Qaddafi interesting.  He sometimes defies description.  He is a womanizer, but believes in Islam.  There are many contradictions in his character.  Nevertheless, he is a threat to the United States and western nations.	2003-04-04

For those people who thought Pearl Harbor brought us into the Second World War, Reynolds argues that FDR's actions were bringing us closer to an alliance with Churchill's Great Britain and Stalin's USSR.  Pearl Harbor was the last action which convinced the American public that war was necessary.  Before that, Reynolds argues that the isolationist mood in the U.S. was high and oppossed to more involvement in Europe.  Roosevelt helped as much as possible through the destroyer deal and lend lease to help Great Britain and the USSR.  If it hadn't been for Pearl Harbor, NAZI Germany may have overwhelmed the USSR and Great Britain.  In this thesis, he also argues that signal intelligence was missed which resulted in Pearl Harbor, but there was no conspiracy.<br />Reynolds book is somewhat dry, but the details show how FDR worked to get us into the good war.  He led the USA into public opinion about the reasons why the country should support the Soviet Union and Great Britain.	2003-03-31

I read this book in a little over four hours.  It is a great experience of the Soviet population in German blockaded Leningrad.  One can read Salisbury's account of the siege, but for those who like reading on a more personal experience, read Wayne's Shurik.  Wayne (a Soviet nurse)finds Shurik in the bombed out rubble of a neighboring apartment block.  It is winter and Shurik is trying to find his mother (who died in the bombing).  Wayne takes in Shurik, and relates the next year spent with him.  Shurik is a ten year old boy and Wayne is 19 and serving in an Army hospital as a nurse.  Wayne exposes the life of the Leningrad civilians.  Life consisted of bombing, artillery fire, starvation, and other terrors.<br />This book relates the personal tragedy of war and how it affects civilians.  Children and women often suffer worse in war than the soldiers.  Far fewer books picture the civilian tragedy.	2003-03-26

As a couple of the previous reviewers have noted, this was supposed to be a good short read of the Balkans.  Unfortunately, it was dry, dry, dry.  The author loves to throw in a lot of ten dollar words in this thesis about the Balkans.  One wonders what his ultimate purpose was in writing this book.<br />I picked up a few themes from his book.  One was that Ottomon Empire and the some of the Communist regimes papered over the ethnic differences.  At the same time, the ethnic differences were not a big deal for most of the time in the Balkans.  Neither were the religious differences, as the population tended to chose what parts of the various practices to follow.<br />For me, this was not a particularly interesting read.  At slighty over a hundred pages, one would assume you could breeze through this book.  But the writing and the words used, resulted in me taking six and a half hours to read this book.  There are more interesting books out there including Misha Glenny with his The Balkans.  I would probably consult that book if I wanted information.	2003-03-24

How does he pick these five top contenders, he does not tell.  Since he cannot dwell on either of these five in great detail, the reader learns only the rudiments of each of these five leading contenders (Nero, Ivan the Terrible, Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein).  As a previous reviewer has already noted, some of the aspects of Hitler's life is open to contention, so one cannot believe all of this story.  Since Myerson does not detail any of his sources, one wonders where he received all the details.<br />This is an easy read.  If one wants to learn any detail of any of these five dictators, one must read elsewhere.  As I said, this is a good summary of their lives, but don't believe everything you read.	2003-03-18

A nice little read of the diplomacy of Bismarck and Napoleon III prior to the Franco Prussian War.  What is so apparrent by this book is how the French and the French government were so arrogant about their power.  Most people subscribe to the fact of Bismarck causing the war.  However this book shows how the inflamed opinion of the French and their government led to the war.  Popular opinion blames the Prussians but it was the French who caused the war.<br />Wetzel shows the French interfering in the affairs of the Spain to place their candidate on the throne.  The Spanish provisional government was not especially interested in their candidates, and ultimately decided on a Prussian prince.  This was even more unacceptable to the French government.  They then demanded the Prussian prince to renounce the throne.  This the Prussians did.  Then they demanded the Prussians apologize for their actions and completely renounce any interest.  When this did not happen, they went to war against a German nation angered by the French actions.  Subsequent actions paint the French as the victims when the opposite was the case.  The French played into the hands of Bismarck.<br />A great read for those interested in the diplomacy prior to the war.  Michael Howard's Franco-Prussian War is also a great read of the war itself.	2003-03-17

I thought this a nice read on the American Revolution in South Carolina.  Edgar turns his pride of his home state into a discourse on how the events in South Carolina resulted in victory of the Continentals in the American Revolution.  He also relates the events of the first civil war in South Carolina between the Regulators and the Moderators.  He backs up his claim on the fighting in South Carolina with the statistics on the casualties incurred in the fighting there.  I certainly agree South Carolina can take pride in the battles fought and won and why they were important to the infant United States.<br />This is a short book and I thought Edgar could have provided more meat to back up his claims.  His use of examples as the melting of the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz, I thought was a bad example in a historical record.  All told a good and quick read.	2003-03-14

Baldwin does an adequate job of reviewing all the theaters of war.  Some histories of the war don't cover the Russian, Italian, Bulgarian, and Middle East theaters, but Baldwin gives all equal weight.  Thus the reader will have an insight into not only the Western Front, but the politics and battles elsewhere.<br />Baldwin states this is an outline history.  This is what the reader will find if he reads this book.  No individual stories will appear here, just the outline of the war.  Baldwin also limits his own opinion in the book.	2003-03-08

I thought Drakulic's writing describe the feelings of someone's whose society has been destroyed and a new one springs up.  Her feelings as well as others are exposed in this book.  This book summarizes the dispair of those who witnessed the Serbo-Croatian War of 1990-1991.  I think the feelings described in this book, might only apply to the minority of the Croatian people.  It certainly conveys a mother's anguish at seeing her child in a country at war.<br />I think this book conveys the human disaster of war.  People suffer in a number of ways.  They may not be soldiers, but they still suffer.  Old ways die, and new ways may not be convenient to old people.  Opportunities arise as can be seen where the woman confiscated another woman's apartment.  War makes people old.  I think all these feelings are conveyed in the book.	2003-03-08

Detzer does a good job of describing how the Cuban Missle Crisis arose in 1962.  The key figures are Castro, John and Robert Kennedy, and Khruschev.  Not only are the policies described but the mounting antagonism of the Cubans toward the United States.  At just under 300 pages, Detzer throughly explains the crisis and how both Robert and John Kennedy gave the Soviets an out in this crisis.<br />Policy makers in government should read this book in order to understand how other governments can react in an international crisis.  If Kennedy had given no way out for the Soviets, we might have had a nuclear war.  As it was, a blockade was imposed on Cuba and the Soviets were given a way out of the mess.  Rather than bomb Soviet missiles in Cuba, Kennedy managed to have them removed through a similar deal on missiles in Turkey.<br />Detzer also outlines why the Soviets wanted the missiles in Cuba, and why they thought the Americans would not react the way they did.<br />Detzer sheds a lot of light on this crisis.  In the current times, more people should reflect on the implications of policy toward other governments.	2003-03-07

Dragnich's view is that the Serbs were the victims since the Ottomon Turks conquered Serbia.  People with common sense would say that this view is not based on facts.  Dragnich defends the Serbs even though most of the facts don't back him up.  He simply ignores those facts, and digs up what facts and statistics do make the Serbs look good.<br />For instance, Dragnich maintains the Serb government had nothing to do with the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand.  Of course he ignores the facts that the Black Hand terrorist group was supported by the Serb intelligence group of the Army.<br />Dragnich states Princip was just a fanatical Bosnian Serb.  He also blames Franz Ferdinand because he should not have ventured to Bosnia during the time because of the Serb national holiday.<br />This is just one instance where Dragnich ignores the facts and says the victims were the Serbs and not the Archduke and his wife.<br />For the remainder of the book, Dragnich portrays the Croats, Slovenes, and Muslims as benefiting from Serb rule.  This would be like equating a colony as a good experience for those ruled.<br />Atrocities, well the Croats and Muslims were more guilty than the Serbs.  This is the context of this book.<br />At the very least, one gains an idea of what the Serbs have in their heads.  This explains what happened in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.  The Serbs say let us take back what we gave them.  It might not be true, but this is how they explain their actions.	2003-03-07

A fascinating account of the war after the war in Indo China.<br />Chanda gives us a wonderful review of the participants on the Vietnamese, Chinese, Cambodian, and American sides.  When South Vietnam and Cambodia fell to the Communists in 1975, Americans in general and the government in particular closed the book on this awful period in American history.  The Vietnamese were gulled into thinking that after their violations of the ceasefire, they were entitled to billions of dollars for rebuilding their shattered economy.  Instead they got nothing and selected the Soviets as sponsers.  This presented a problem to the Chinese who went to the Khymer Rouge as their proxy.  As a result, war followed the war.  Cambodia was shattered by first American bombing, then the Khymer Rouge terror and finally the war with Vietnam.  Both the Chinese and Vietnamese wanted the Americans to come back and serve a role.<br />Nayan Chanda does an excellent and even handed job of presenting the views of all the participants.  This is a wonderful book to read if you are interested in geopolitics.  At 500 some odd pages, this book will take some time to read.	2003-03-06

This is a breezy and glossy review of the life of Anwar Sadat.<br />Unfortunately, it was written prior to his murder, so there is not much critical information of this leader.  At a little over 100 pages, it does not go into great detail on his life.  That said, it does tell the history of Sadat from his humble peasant beginnings to the Egyptian Presidency.<br />I mention that the book is not as critical as it could be since Sadat did engage in guerrilla (terrorist) activity against Farouk's government and the British military.  Sadat was in a group that planned assassinations.  So I believe the book does not give a critical view of his early life.  However, the later part of the book gives us the image of Sadat going against the flow and making peace with Israel.  At that point, the book ends.  As we know, Sadat was himself assassinated...	2003-03-06

His troubles surviving the war are touching.  No one should be made to feel this sense of tragedy.  What got in the way was Shlomo's rationalizing in the book.  Some of these thoughts confused me because they made it hard to follow the story.<br />This book is a good read detailing the suffering of one person.  However there are better books out there.

In my title sentence, I basically give a summary of Shawcross's contention that Cambodia was destroyed by the United States.  I think Shawcross makes good points on why the United States must bear some responsibility in the destruction of this small country.  What is lacking is an even review of all the characters in the history (Khymer Rouge, Viet Cong, NVA, ARVN,<br />and the Thais) of Cambodia.  The Vietnamese Communists have as much a stake in why Cambodia turned out as it did.  I think Shawcross purposely overlooks this and points the finger at what he percieves as the evil doers of American policy--Kissinger and Nixon.<br />I think Shawcross does a good job of relating how the USA tried to salvage the intervention in Vietnam at the cost of destroying a small country.  I think he proves that point.  I also enjoyed his portrayal of all the principal American and Cambodian players in this drama.  As I said, a more critical look at the Vietnamese would give this book a more even outlook.  After I read this book, I understoon why Presidential Administrations did not involve Kissinger in future policy.  Henry comes off as arrogant in the least, evil at the most.

This is by far the most even handed when it describes the atrocities performed by both the Loyalists and Nationalists.  For contemporary writers, it is easy to lambast Franco and his Nationalists for the evils they performed and overlook what the Communists and Anarchists performed on the upper classes and Church.  Goldston does not do this.  He describes both evils and was fair to both sides.<br />This book has both illustrations and pictures and was an easy read of 130 pages.

Not only is the land and naval campaign described, but how things may have been different had the Spanish put a little more effort in the battles.<br />Most Americans do not realize how easily the United States could have lost this war despite the closeness of Cuba and the overwhelming American naval might. Dierks details how if the Spanish naval forces acted differently, this may have prolonged the problems for the U.S. Navy.  Also detailed is the mess which was the land campaign against Santiago de Cuba.  If the Spanish commander had thrown in all his forces on San Juan Hill, the outcome of the capture of the city would be different.<br />Altogether a good read of the campaign, even though it starts slowly.  Dierks shows some insight which I have found lacking in other authors of this campaign.	2003-03-03

His book also refutes point by point the claims of the successive government of Janos Kadar that this was a counter revolution backed by capitalist and fascist elements.  The political police(AVO) are shown in their savagery in first trying to contain the conflict and then succumbing to the Revolution.<br />Tibor Meray was a friend of Imre Nagy but his book in written in an unbiased way.  He even quotes sources from the Kadar government and then refutes their falsehoods.  Meray has much to be bitter about since his friend Nagy and others were executed by the Hungarian goverment.  The book does not dwell on this but the history of the event.  Much is written about the first day, but the last hundred pages of the book detail the defeat and aftermath of the revolt.

Benevolent Assimilation is McKinley's phrase for the civilizing mission of America in the Philippines.  Miller makes a good case that the Filipinos neither needed civilizing or Christianizing since they had both.  What America really wanted was a colonial empire to establish itself as a great power.  McKinley did not know what he wanted, but people made him believe in the civilizing mission of the U.S. government.<br />What Miller demonstrates in this book is that the Philippines wanted independence and not American government.  The revolt which followed the Spanish American War was long and devastated the islands.  Thousands lost their lives, and American troops showed no mercy in putting down the revolt.  The revolt lasted for over three years, and cost the U.S. much in men and treasure.<br />America won, but lost seventy years later in Vietnam.	2003-02-17

As you read, you can tell the side he favored in this war--the Loyalists.  He generally glosses over the abuses the Republican government commited during the Civil War, but expands on the attrocities perpetrated by Franco's forces.

I have seen Bob Greene on some of the news stories on TV.  I like his wit and sentiment.  I was prepared for a great book on the great generation that produced his and my father.  I was disappointed.<br />First, the book is disjointed.  It goes from sentiment to sentiment, and then reverts back again.  In his talks with General Paul Tidbitts, I thought he kept dwelling on the same emotions of a hard military decision.  That decision was made long ago, and why keep hammering away at it.  Bob, just get over it.  The U.S. had to bomb Japan to spare the lives of American soldiers and sailors.<br />Another problem I have with this book is its lack of history. It tells a little of the history of his father, some of Tidbitts, and then a little on the Doolittle Raiders.  Other than that, it is pure sentiment, repeated again and again.  For a 300 page book, this could have been cut to 80 pages.  I read this book, and it was a disappointment.  If one wants to remember the Greatest Generation, read something from Ambrose.	2003-02-14

Fitzpatrick's short book about the Russian Revolution is so concise one has to wonder if she skimped on the facts.  This is not the case.  Anybody reading the book can only remark that thickness is not indicative of weight.  All one needs to know about the Russian Revolution is in this slim volume.<br />Fitzpatrick's main contention is that the Russian Revolution did not end in 1920, but rather in the 1930s when Stalin consolidated his power and put in place a new system which suceeded the Tsarist regime.  Stalin did this by educating a new elite from the working class and placing them in the Party and Government.  Future leaders came from this group.  The two five year plans stabilized the revolution and placed a new order on the country.<br />I also found the characterization of Lenin good.  Lenin put in place a situation which led to the rise of the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin.  Lenin is seen as both good and bad.<br />There are more meaty books about the Russian Revolution.  There is not one which is more concise and explains all the facts.	2003-02-10

With the craze for Ali nowadays, this books points a different perspective on the blood feud between Ali and Frazier.  Ali said some pretty mean things about Smokin Joe, but most were untrue.<br />Frazier comes across as the more admireable of the two fighters, and the one that perhaps Black America should look to as an inspiration.  Ali comes up far short.<br />Frazier came from poor black folks in South Carolina, while Ali had some Irish blood and was raised in a middle class suburb of Nashville.  Frazier worked his way up from the working class, while Ali had a silver spoon placed in his mouth.  Frazier was a law abiding citizen, but Ali evaded the draft laws.  Frazier was near blind in one eye, but continued to fight.  Ali complained when his trainers threw real punches.  Who is the inspiration here.  I say Frazier and not Ali.  Not withstanding Ali's mouth, perhaps more people will give Joe Frazier his rewards.<br />Thanks to Mark Kram for bringing this story to light.	2003-02-10

Junger wrote well in The Perfect Storm, and followed this with a collection of articles written for magazines.  These articles were well written, but they didn't have the pull that The Perfect Storm has.<br />Junger did most of the investigation into these dangerous jobs after he was hurt in a tree accident.  Forest fire fighters were his introduction piece and I was amazed how dangerous this job is. Junger follows with investigations into the conflicts in Afghanistan, the former Jugoslavia, and Cyprus.  Then he makes a stab at whale hunting in St. Vincent.<br />For such a short book, this collection of essays does not hold the imagination of the reader.  Yes the articles are interesting and educational, but one can well read another book and get more interest.	2003-02-10

This is the story of the attack on our country on 9/11/01.  The story goes all the way back to the late 1980's and originates in Afghanistan.  Berstein does a good job of describing how bin Laden and his group of thugs got their grounding in the basics of terrorism.  Not only bin Laden but some of the other members (Atta) are described in their early life.<br />Along with the story of the terrorists, there are stories of some of the victims of 09/11/01.  Bernstein does a good job in describing their lives, so we know what America lost in this attack.  Unlike other journalists, Berstein gives reasons why the FBI/CIA did not pick up on the attack.<br />This is a good summary of the attacks and the reasons they originated.  The title sums up the surprise Americans felt when the attack came.	2003-02-10

This is a good overview of the sinking the Russian submarine Kursk and the general state of the Russian Navy.  With the breakup of the Soviet Union, the defense establishment has received far less attention and resources than before.  This contributed to the sinking of the sub.<br />I was particularly interested in what motivated the claims of the Russian Navy that another submarine collided with the Kursk resulting in her loss.  The facts are otherwise, but the political motivation to blame an external power was there.  Incompetence by either personnel on the Peter the Great in shooting off a missle or in the torpedo technicians on the Kursk (not Navy personnel) led to this disaster.  Old habits die hard in Russia, so someone else to blame was necessary.  Burleson does a good job of writing about this in the book.	2003-02-08

Howarth is a great story teller for historians.  In this book, he shows the Spanish side led by the Duke of Medina Sidonia.  The Duke was a very courageous though inexperienced sailor.  His commanders were also very able.  The problem was the campaign as formated by Philip II.  Philip micro managed but at the same time did not present what the ultimate objective was to be.  Would he name himself King of England?  One has to fill in the blanks, and Howarth does a good job of giving details of what Philip intended to do.<br />Unlike others, Howarth details why the Spaniards were the underdog in this campaign.  The English ships were sleek and maneuverable, whereas the Spaniards were clumsy.  The numbers were not as great as one supposed.  All told, the Spanish were the underdogs since they were operating far from base.  The result were running battles, with the English besting the Spaniards.  On the trip around the isles, poor weather, lack of provisions, and unseaworthy vessels killed more than the battle itself.  Howarth does a great job in describing this agony of sailors and soldiers seeking home, but ultimately killed in Ireland.<br />The only wish for this book is that Howarth could have expanded his study.  This is an interesting subject, but the book was short.	2003-02-07

The book has taken a collection of stories of different types to paint a picture of the Spanish<br />Civil War.  These stories reflect the internationalization of the war with Germany and Italy's active commitment.<br />I learned some things from this book that are missing in other books on this war.  First, Nazi Germany's Naval blockade of the Spanish coast, while actively helping Franco and the rebels.  Also the Loyalists targeting of Nazi naval units, plus their barbarism against conservatives and clericals.  Many contemporary books portray the Rebels as the villians, but perhaps both sides can share this label to an equal extent.  Since these are stories that appear in the newspapers, some of the facts are wrong and this is why I gave it three stars.	2003-02-04

These were two great books about disasters.  Unlike those books, this book is about the experience of the twenty coastwatchers in the Solomons campaign.  It is well written but does not have the intensity of those other two books.  The book is well written and tells about the alert activities of the coastwatchers, along with their guerrilla and rescue actitivities.  The Allied victory at Guadalcanal had much to do with the coachwatchers.<br />This part of World War II might never have been written about were it not for the rescue of the future President of the United States, John F. Kennedy.  Kennedy's part in the rescue shows his leadership abilities. It also dispels the notion of negligence on Kennedy's part in the destruction of the PT-109.	2003-02-03

As the other reviewers have already stated, this is an action packed adventure of a young man fleeing the Nazis.  Leo fled from his native Vienna, to Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, France,and Switzerland.  In this book, he describes the Austrians as welcome participants in the Holocaust and not as the victims.  Austrians treat themselves as the first victims of Hitler's aggression rather than the willing helpers of Hitler.  As he fled, other nations tried to avoid Hitler's refugees.  No one welcomed the outcasts from the Hitler regime.<br />One comment about the nature of this book.  Most of the victims did not know what was going to happen when they embarked on the train journey to the camps.  Leo states it in the narrative.  I don't think even he knew, other than the future was bleak.  It lessens the story narrative as he pictures the death that awaits these people.  This should have been told at the end.<br />This is a great book to read.  It shows the suffering of the Jews and those who opposed Hitler.	2003-01-25

A great read about the little known Communist regime in Romania.<br />After watching the Velvet Revolution in person in Prague, I wondered wheather I should travel to Bucharest to see the effects of another Communist regime.  A month later Nicholae Ceausescu and his wife were dead.  For those who don't know much about Romania, this book gives a political overview of the country's history.<br />Ceausescu was a dispictable little man who had an even more wretched wife Elena.  Not only did he run the country into the ground, but his politics destroyed whatever trust Romanians had in their government.  Both Ceausescus were semi literate who had<br />a penchant for collecting honors, degrees, and loot.<br />This book details how a uneducated man wormed his way into a small Communist party, and eventually ran the country.  It details not only his rise and fall, but also that of the country.  Ceausescu's successors were once his proteges.  For more information on Romania after Ceausescu, read A Hole in the Flag.	2002-12-06

A good book about the end of the Asante Empire.  Edgerton tells the end of this empire from both the British and Asante perspectives.  The Asantes were a militaristic society who preyed on the weaker societies around them, notably the Fante.  The British desired trade and gold, and the conflict was inevitable when the Asante sent armies to conquer the Fante.  This brought the British into conflict.<br />The author takes too much of a nativist perspective in his depiction of the Asante Empire.  This empire gloried in slaves and human sacrifices.  It had a great military tradition, but why would a author try to paint a positive view of a society that sought entertainment value in the putting to death of slaves.  The British may have been interested in conquest and colonization of this land for trade and gold reasons.  They may have been rascist, but the Asante were a brutal society.  The expiration of this empire was perhaps not such a tragedy after all.  The British brought Ghana and the Asante into the modern world.	2002-11-18

Another simplistic story of the Boxer Rebellion in China.  Hirschfeld at least explains the Chinese reason for the rebellion and since this book is aimed at the younger reader, it is fair to both sides.  The one thing I didn't appreciate is the fictional conversations thrown into the historical writing.  This confuses the reader.  For those readers who want a short summary of the rebellion, this is an OK book, for those into more detail, look elsewhere.	2002-10-21

A simplistic book about the 8,000 mile march by Mao and the Communists to escape the clutches of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists.  This book was written for young people, but the book is too simplistic.  If you read the book, you would believe that Mao was a hero, rather than a bloody dictator.  I hope those who read this book also read something about the crimes Mao committed in the course of his career.<br />This book is not critical enough of Mao.  Edmonds seems charmed by Mao.

This is an OK book for those who do not know much about ancient Egypt.  In fact not much is known about Nefertiti other than what people have uncovered when exploring the ruins of this great empire.  Samson does a good job on explaining the theories of Nefertiti and her husband and daughters.  Samson spends less time on Cleopatra, although more is known of her.  For a more detailed explaination of these figures, try something Michael Grant has written.  For those seeking an introduction to these great figures, this is a nice book.	2002-10-12

A good book explaining events of the Italian-Ethiopian War of 1935-1936.  The two main characters are the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie.  Mussolini is striving for glory and land to sustain his dictatorship, while Haile Selassie is doing his utmost to prevent war and keep his country intact.  The supporting characters are Sir John Simon, Sir Samuel Hoare, Stanley Baldwin, Pierre Laval, Anthony Eden, and Franklin Roosevelt are shown in less than favorable light.  Pierre Laval is shown as the grubby little politician he was.  Stanley Baldwin and Samaul Hoare are shown as dupes, and Franklin Roosevelt is shown as an idealist with little backbone.  Anthony Eden at least tried to prevent the aggression, but realized at the end how little support he had from the other politicians.<br />This is a very informative book, but it goes at length into the diplomacy of the great powers before and during the war.  It was very simple to put a stop to this aggression, through military or economic considerations.  The British government would not warrant any talk of war and thus condoned the aggression.  This book affirms why great powers have to confront dictators, rather than appease them.  This is a textbook example of why dictators like Saddam Hussein need to be stopped.	2002-08-23

Barber does a good job of covering the Hungarian uprising of 1956.  He covers events both inside the capital Budapest and the<br />outlying countryside.  Also acknowledged is the internal power struggle between the various Communist factions prior to the uprising.  I found the explanation of the politics of Nagy, Gero, and Kadar good.  One thing not covered in detail was the Stalinist legacy left by Rakosi.  The book should have detailed both Rakosi and Horthy's legacy in Hungary, and why it led to the Revolution.<br />Book was well written using both what Barber witnessed and other external sources.  Probably one of the better summaries of the Hungarian uprising.	2002-08-19

For a photographer, his stories are very good and enjoyable.  Like one of the previous reviewer, I have to agree that Capa does not reveal much of himself.  If you take his stories, he appears to be an alcoholic and irresponsible.  His photos though are world famous.<br />These stories are great to read and the book is not long.

Earlier summaries of the war do not place much emphasis (if any)on the Philippines Insurrection, but to Marrin's credit, he takes one of the five chapters and discusses it.  This did not always show America to be at its best.  The other four chapters were pretty standard, except little asides about nicknames (Yellow Press, doughboys, Black Jack Pershing, buffalo soldiers).  These little asides were interesting and made the book more informative.  For those interested in wanting to understand the war in two hours, this is a worthwhile book.	2002-08-11

He visits such exotoc islands as Sumatra, Java, Timor (now part independent) Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Banda Islands, Seram, and Irian Jaya.  His desciptions are visions of a country with problems, but whose people meet these with a zest for life.  However, Corn does not describe some of the trouble that has just recently resulted in Christians and Chinese being killed.

Forbis does a good job detailing the beliefs of the average Iranian and why the Shah lost his job.  First and Foremost, he summarizes the history of the Iranian monarchy (2,500 years) and the Pahlavi dynasty (50 of those years).  The Shah for all his good and bad are detailed here.  The assessment of the Shah is fair.  He made mistakes and deposited a fortune in his bank account.  He also modernized Iran.  Of note here, Ayatollah Khomeini rose in revolt when the Shah took over the hugh church estates and gave women the vote in 1963.  Forbis takes a look at all aspects of society (religion, women, education, military, agriculture, industrialization) and tells us why the Shah fell.  The aftermath is a society that is regressive and still suffers dictatorial rule (by mullahs rather than a Shah).<br />This is an older book, so for current information you need to go elsewhere.  However, this is good book to read to discover Iranian society at the time of the Shah.	2002-08-10

Mr.Schmidt sheds some light on an unknown war pitting the newly enthroned Iman al Badr against General Sallal.  The Iman had the best intentions of reforming Yemeni society and even admired President Nasser of Egypt.  General Sallal, the opportunist seized power with the help of massive Egyptian manpower and resources.  The royalists fought back, with the help of the Saudi King.  The civil war ends after this book was published, so the reader does not know the outcome of this civil war.<br />The book details a little known war on the Arabian peninsula.  Few people have heard of this war.  What is known is that Nasser waged aggressive war against a poorer nation simply to put his stooges into a position of control.  Kind of makes Nasser's actions in the Suez Crisis look like the hypocrite he was.  For those of you needing a dose of Arab politics, this book show the double dealing nature of the Middle East.	2002-08-08

First of all, let me say that I feel for the Cohens.  This was a very bitter tradegy for them.<br />I had a hard time getting through this book, and evenually returned it to the bookstore.  The reason is that the Cohens are very bitter toward everyone who has tried to help them.<br />They are bitter at Pan Am, the Reagan, Bush, and subsequent Clinton administrations, the town of Lockerbie, and other families that suffered similar losses.  I guess maybe they will be bitter all their life, but for people to read all this bitterness is perhaps a bit much.  Some of these people are as much a victim of the bomb as their daughter was, but yet life goes on.<br />Pan Am was a victim of the bomb and went out of business as an indirect result of it.  The Cohens rejoice when the airline goes out of business.  Thousands of people lose their job, and they rejoice.  Why?<br />Other families disagree with their methods.  They accuse them of money grubbing.  Sad!<br />The town of Lockerbie doesn't choose to honor the loss as the Cohens want, and they become more bitter.<br />When I die, I hope my loved ones move on with their lives.  I hope the Cohens can get over their bitterness, but I doubt this.<br />If the reader wants to do some selective reading, read bits and pieces of this book.  It will inform them of the tragedy of terrorism.	2002-08-05

I am interested in the Third Republic period of France, and this book detailed another scandal from that period.  The book details the life of Therese Daurignac who married a son of the founder of the Republic.  It details how Humbert, his son Theodore, and his wife committed a fraud on the French nation by pretending to be rich when in fact they were peasants with no money.  Eventually, their scheme of borrowing money to pay other creditors collasped, and Therese and her husband were sent to prison.<br />If there is a criticism of this book, it is the brevity of it.  132 pages cannot bring to life how thousands of people were cheated out of their money, so that Therese could live the good life.  For other books about scandals in the Third Republic, read Prisoners of Honor, The Dreyfus Affair by David Levering Lewis and The Panama Affair by Maron J. Simon.	2002-08-04

If you liked his book on the Conquest of Morocco, then this book will also be a good read.  The only criticism I have of this book is that he didn't place any pictures in it, like he had in the Morocco book.  A more detailed map may also have helped.<br />I agree with the previous reviewer about the intentions of the French.  Why conquer an enormous sandpit?  The answer is the French government did not know, and relied on the glory seeking soldiers of the French Army.  The soldiers were interested in the conquest and not the money and lives the government expended. Colonialism failed because it did not pay, and the French experience in the Sahara was a prime example.  Also answered the question why Algeria has a larger share of the desert than her rivals Morocco and Tunisia.  Only later when the French were fighting an independance war was oil in the Sahara found.	2002-08-04

The second is the death of six scientists and three Columbians in the Galeras eruption.  The scientists killed were led by Stan Williams, who also substained very serious injuries.  The three Columbians were local hikers in the area.<br />If the focus was on numbers, Bruce should have concentrated her studies on the Nevado del Ruiz eruption that killed so many Columbians because of the mud slides.  This was not done, but the focus was on diminishing the egotistical Stan Williams who led six of his companions to death.  Both stories are worth a book of their own.	2002-08-01

There has been a lot of trash written about Pinochet, but this book along with Soldiers in a Narrow Land have a very balanced perspective.  As the title states, there were both supporters of Pinochet and the Armed Forces, and there were opponents.  Allende was not skillful in leading his country through the changes of the seventies, so a ruluctant Pinochet and the Armed Forces removed him.  The excesses of the reign of terror following the coup de etat are unforgiveable, but one should remember that in Argentina the dirty war killed close to twenty thousand, where Chile's coup and terror killed 3,000.<br />The authors do a great job describing the successes and failures of the Pinochet regime.  Also a good description of the power struggles within the Armed Forces themselves (Air Force versus Army).  The one thing needing improvement in this book is an update on what has since happened in Chile.<br />Since I am marrying a Chilean, I found this book a great way to know more about this country.  It describes the still powerful emotion in Chile over Pinochet (positive and negative).	2002-08-01

Although Eden was a brillant diplomat, he was not leader material.  He failed to bring the Labour opposition or the Americans into the military component of the war.  With these opponents as well as the Russians and Egyptians, Eden ceased military operations shorly after he began them without getting to his objectives.<BR>This is not one of the better books by Thomas.  First he does little to detail the military operations, but spends a great deal of time on the politics.  Second, he fails to show how the Soviets were hypocrits.

Pipes does a bang up job of placing Communism as a brutal system.  As a conservative myself, I find his analysis not always fair.

Steinman's father served in the Tropic Lightning Division of the U.S. Army fighting in northern Luzon (P.I.).  Even though her father is not a casualty, he suffers the rest of his life from the effects of the war.  He is hard and somewhat bitter.  After his passing, Louise finds the souvenir of the war---a personal flag from a Japanese soldier.  She examines the brutality of the war from both the American and Japanese perspective (Hiroshima, Nanking, P. I, Bataan).  She finds the family of the soldier and returns the flag.  She finds that the Japanese soldier has a human face after all.<br />This is a good emotional read of the effects of war, even if the war was the good war.	2002-07-28

John Talbot does a good job reviewing the reason why this war was fought.  Algeria had been French since the early 1800s, and had a large settler population of one million.  These one million settlers thought of themselves as French, whereas the other eight million people resident in Algeria thought of themselves as Algerians.  Talbot describes the conflict between the FLN and the French Republic.  Also described was the conflict of the OSS with the French and Algerians. Good review of the government program of all four governments of the Fourth Republic, and DeGalle's progress in resolving the Algerian crisis.<br />Talbot is a rather dry writer, so although this book was a good summary of the conflict, it was not a page turner.	2002-07-19

Tute examines one of the overlooked actions of World War Two when the British sink a French battle group before it could fall into the hands of the Germans or Italians.  Not much has been written about this action, since it was the British who were the aggressor in this action.  The main characters in this episode were the British negotiator Holland and the French admiral of the four battleships based in Oran, Algeria.  Tute follows the negotiations through to the deadly conclusion where 1300 French sailors died and three French battleships sank.<br />I liked the way Tute described how the situation came to be with the collaspe of France in 1940.  Some more material about when the British submarine sank the French cruiser would have also helped.	2002-07-18

As one of the previous reviewers describe, read Crassweller's book about Trujillo to really get a good picture of how awful this Dominican dictator was to his people.  For those interested in the assasination of the dictator, Diederich's book describes in minute detail of how the murder took place.  Crassweller's book leaves much of this out.  Trujillo was as bad to his people as Saddam is to the Iraqi people.<br />One good point of this book is the reader's knowledge that Diederich was there at the time in the country.  This is no author piecing something together from written sources, but a news correspondent covering the Dominican Republic during the time of the incident.  The book was very readable.	2002-07-18

Irwin relates his experiences of capturing a large group of German soldiers, along with the monotony of endless hours spent riding in a tank.  Even though this is a first book for Irwin, it is highly entertaining and will keep you interested.  Just wish he had more experiences to relate in this short book.

A great and interesting read about how the Allies conquered Togo, Kameroons, South West Africa, and East Africa.  The Germans started World War I with four colonies in Africa, and short campaigns in three of them resulted in their division between the French and British.  In German East Africa, the battle was long and hard.  A German cruiser was stranded here, and the Allies had to find and destroy it.  The German military commander Lettow-Vorbeck waged a guerilla campaign against the French, British, Belgian, and Portuguese for all four years of the war.  The story of the African Queen also maks its appearance in German East Afria.  This book is the definitive account of the First World War in Africa.	2002-07-10

Unlike what some of the previous reviewers have said, this book is not a complete disaster and it is certainly better that watching paint dry.  Dr. Pleshakov could have given us a better balanced view of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 by viewing the Japanese side.  Also more material thrown in about the siege of Port Arthur as good background before the Second Pacific Squadron put to sea.  The reasons for the war were rather simplistic, so this could have been improved.  I think the editing was horrible, especially when referring to the Russian and English (Bear and Lion, not Bear and Whale)conflict.  This could have been a much better read, but the author focused on the Squardron's stay in Madagascar and Indochina, rather than the reasons for the war, the siege of Port Arthur, and the battle itself.	2002-07-06

Good background material about Barbados and Charlestown's links with the slave island.  One of the previous reviewers called Vessey a Haitan, but his name indicates origin in the Danish Virgin Islands, as Robertson asserts.  Because his origin is so obscure, Robertson puffs up what is known and makes it book length.  More research could have led to a more interesting book.

The seven journeys are:  1) the Silk Road, 2) the Polynesian Triangle, 3) the Pan American Highway, 4) the Burma Road, 5) the Baltic to the Black Sea, 6) the Salt Road, and 7) the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  Terrific writing by all the writers, although I can't say I agree with all their viewpoints.  This is especially the case with Philip Jones Griffiths who wrote about the Ho Chi Minh trail.

The book is very readable, and Anson makes sure to detail his own weaknesses in the book, especially his rocky marriage and use of drugs and alcohol.  He details his coverage of the war.  Also details his views on the Cambodian government and their Vietnamese massacres.  He is sypathetic to the NVA, even though several of his friends were killed by them.

When Italy gets involved in World War II, Iris keeps a small diary.  In the book 1943 and 1944 are revealed as hardship years for the Italian people.  Food is scarce, and airplanes are indiscriminate in attacks on civilians and soldiers.  What is worse are the Fascists who have become vicious in the face of a sullen people.  Origo describes how her and her family managed during these most difficult times.  I feel this book is a good read for those who want to discover how a civilian population copes with war.	2002-06-29

It is obvious the author was seduced by the Communist authorities when he visited Vietnam in 1989.  I say that because when he talks of the effects of war on the south, he mentions the white terror of Diem without mentioning the red terror of the Viet Cong.  The red terror targeted not military targets but teachers and bureaucrats.  Sheehan does not mention that but Diem's terror campaign, which was mild compared to the red terror.  Also when he talks of the 1963 coup against Diem, he terms it the American led coup.  Again another fallacy since the coup leaderes had Washington's blessings, but was not led by Americans.  Another small lie was the Cambodia invasion by Vietanm.  Sheehan wants us to believe that Hanoi was not interested in dominating Cambodia.  Most analysts would view this an incorrect statement.  If you can read through Sheehan's opinions, it gives those interested in the war some perspective of what happened after the war.  Caution is in order for Sheehan's opinions.	2002-06-24

The book summarizes some of the problems associated with the war such as race relations, lack of a professional soldiers and officers, and weapons.  Spector describes that 1968 was the critical year of the war.  America and the Saigon regime won the military battles but lost the political war.

In the book, Stone refutes some of the common perceptions<br />of this war.  The ultimate reason for their defeat was not an<br />unwillingness to fight the war, but the incompetent leadership-<br />both political and military- in the waging of the war.

Rather he delves into what Bismarck actually did and the resulting consequences.  It shows Bismarck as an opportunist who made events beneficial to first Prussia and then Germany.  Bismarck is shown to be self centered egotist.  He parlayed his gifts into a united Germany, but ensured a future World War by his treaty with the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Henry II was one of the true great rulers<br />of his time, defying the Church and France to lead his realm.  Since Barber wrote this book back in the sixties, it is not up to date on new research into Plantagenet rulers.

The French helped but their Army was tired of the war.<br />This is obviously a different picture than what is normally thought of the war.  It is factual but places the perspective onto the British as the ultimate victors of World War One.<br />Also, it disregards Haig's earlier blunders in 1916 and 1917 when<br />he wasted thousands of lives on a few miles of scorched earth.<br />Haig might have been right at the end, but not during the earlier<br />years of the war.	2002-05-23

I found this book very similar in material to Gene Smith's earlier book Maximilian and Carlotta.  I think Ridley followed<br />the same context as Smith, and threw in a little more material on<br />Juarez.  So, if you have read one of these books, don't read the other.<br />Overall, it presents the conflict between the Conservatives and<br />Liberals and Maximilian and Juarez correctly.  It poses Maximilian as heroic and wrong headed while Juarez is portrayed as stubborn and single minded.  Both needed more analization to portray them correctly.  The book was very readable.	2002-05-22

Chevigny does a good job describing the<br />characters in the Russian American company and the difficulties<br />is settling Russian Alaska.  Less of value is the reason why they<br />sold the colony to the United States, since the author is judging from a latter time.  Since this book was written in the<br />mid Sixties, some of the language may be stilted  and the text is<br />certainly dry at time.	2002-05-21

First off, the authors are from the liberal establishment, so there view is the U.S.A. was wrong to bring down the government<br />of Guatemala in 1953-1954.  Even though I believe most of the story, they did not write an objective analysis.<br />The U.S. Government viewed the Arbenz government as tolerating<br />Communists in the McCarthy era, along with nationalizing certain<br />land held by the United Fruit company based in Boston.  These two conflicts resulted in the U.S. government authorizing the overthrow of the Arbenz government and the installation of the<br />Castillo Armas government.  Bitter fruit is a play on words due to the involvement of the United Fruit government.<br />As stated, I think what the U.S. government did was wrong, but I<br />view this book as not being completely objective.  Communists were involved in the government, and Guatemala was like a magnet<br />to Communists in the 1950s.  See Anderson's book on Che Guevarra to note that there were not just a few here.  I think the authors overlook this, and view Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers as too concerned for United Fruit.<br />The book was well written and short enough to read in one or two<br />days.  The book did a good job portraying the actors in this drama, along with the environment in which they operated in.	2001-10-04

After reading this book, I realized how a cornered rat feels when he knows there in no way out.<br />The book details the end of World War II in Italy and the last<br />days in the life of Benito Mussolini.  At first it reports how<br />Mussolini was surrounded by hundreds of faithful, including German soldiers detailed to protect him.  He runs here, then there in hopes of retaining a little more power.  In the end he<br />is caught by the Communist partisans who execute him, rather than<br />have him talk to the Allied governments.<br />At least Mussolini faced his situation in the end with bravery.<br />The book provides a negative view of the the Communist partisan<br />who executed him and other Italian fascists, and the people of Milan who displayed his corpse and others.	2001-10-04

This is a short biography of Germany's Last Emperor, William II.<br />As stated previously, it is short and a summary of his life.<br />The story includes his own downfall, leading Germany to the<br />Weimar Republic and then Nazi Germany.<br />The book does its best work in describing William's early life,<br />and his frosty relations with his English mother and relatives.<br />This led to alienation from the English royalty and prevented<br />Germany from forming an alliance with Great Britain, and a more<br />liberalized regime in Germany.<br />The book describes William's views on Jews, French, Russia, and<br />Great Britain.  This was not a positive side to his personality.<br />Also detailed is his relationship to his mother, wife, and various mistresses, with a possible homosexual relationship with<br />his best friend.  The author does not go into detail into this<br />last aspect, because there is not much evidence.  His choice of<br />people to lead his Empire resulted in the First World War.	2001-09-23

The author details his early life in the south, and his academic career resulting in the presendency of Princeton.  For Democratic party hacks, it was easy converting Wilson into the Governor of New Jersey.  Party hacks again nominated him to the Presidency on the Democratic ticket.  From there, Wilson became his own man, and went liberal.  I liked the fact the book give a brief glimpse of Henry Cabot Lodge, Wilson's Senate opponent.  Both were idealistic, however where Lodge could give and take, Wilson had to have all or nothing.  This was Wilson's undoing and may have been the result of his worsening medical condition.  I wish the book was of longer length with more details.	2001-07-06

A wonderful read about Lincoln's life in the last 24 hours and the conspiracy that resulted in his assassination.  This is a wonderful book, and one only grows to admire Lincoln after reading it.  One also sees how Booth and his assorted idiots planned the killings.  A determined effort by the government in protection for key members could have prevented this.  The President's  bodyguard went off to a bar, along with the other staff.  Bishop researched this book for twenty to thirty years before writing it.  The only criticism is that the beginning drags a little, but otherwise a great read.	2001-05-21

On the Montana Road, the commander Colonel Carrington was  detailed to build and staff three forts in Montana and  Wyoming.  The Sioux and other Indian tribes led by Red Cloud laid seige to the forts.  The Indians laid a trap and when one Captain Fetterman went beyond his orders, he and his troops were killed and their bodies mutilated.  Dee Brown doesn't paint a pretty picture of the Army's decision to blaim Carrington or the Indian habit of butchering people. The only one who comes out positively is Colonel Carrington. I would agree with the earlier reviewer that the book starts out slowly, but it builds toward the climax of the battle and the  aftermath.	2001-05-21

Upon her beginning of the reign, the Empire was confronted by the War of Austrian Succession. This brave woman guided the Empire through very difficult times, and renewed it by organizing the finances and administration.

A great book about the narco terrorism in Columbia. Pablo Escobar kidnaps 9 prominent people and holds them until he gets the government to change the extratadition  policy.

In this book, he makes the Americans look like idiots waging war.  If you read this book, be prepared to see Americans killing Americanc, VC killing Americans, and the wonderful North Vietnamese killing Americans. Since this book came out in 1970, it was understandabe why Derek would be anti-war.  The history of the war is a little different. The kill ratio of Vietnamese to Americans were very different, and the North Vietamese were not angels.  The humor is OK, but this was a tragic war.

If you want a definitive account of the Battle of the Bulge, this is not the book for you.  Burgett's account is a personal view of what his unit went through.  In this account, one views the destruction and killing of war.  Friends of Don's are killed in these battles and a soldier's reaction is to continue and survive.  One wonders how soldiers continued in this environment. I read Burgett's first book Currahee, and found that this book was much more entertaining and true.

In the introduction, he made it certain to the readerwhat he wasn't going to do, which was the entire history of the Ottaman Empire.  What he does is clear up some misconceptions about the old Turkish Empire, and how they related to developments in Western Europe.  If you want a defininitive book on the Turkish Empire, you should read Lord Kinross's The Ottoman Centuries or Palmer's book. Wheatcroft relates the images of the Lustful Turk, and discards those images into the trash can.  What emerges is a very conservative Islamic society trying to cope with the West and not being very successful at it.  The Sick Man of Europe did indeed die, but for the after effects read David Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace.	2001-01-01

I think this story is of interest, but is not as well written as The Perfect Storm  or The Terrrible Hours.  Still the story shows the terrible storms in the Atlantic and the difficulties in baring the elements in the ocean.  They even come across a sea monster, and several Norwegian ships.  I don't believe the sea monster stuff. Once back in New York, there anticipated payback was not to be.  Very few people paid to see their exhibits in either Europe and America.

Sikhs and Muslims turn on one another  when a murder and two death trains arrive in this small town.  What are the  villagers going to do?

The book details the main culprits as the the U.S., Soviet Union, Vietnam, Red China, and France as  the intriquers who eventually pushed this country into the policies  resulting in the genocide of its people. Unlike previous reviewers, I  thought Kamm was trying to put his own personal view on what happened in  Cambodia.  He knew the players in this drama, so why not draw what he feels  is an accurate portrait of them.  I liked the book.  The only negative is  that Kamm has some problems with the English language and this showed in  the reading.  Kamm escaped Nazi Germany, not France as a previous reviewer  has stated.	2000-06-19

Since he had minimal combat  experience, most of his recollections are about his interrogations of  German soldiers and their victims.

During the Mexican Revolution, Woodrow Wilson needed a pretext to seize the Mexican port of Veracruz from the forces of the dictator Huerta. His basic intentions was to prevent the port from supplying Huerta with arms  for his fight with the rebels.  In deciding to intervene, he uses the  detainment of American sailors for one hour as the justification.  Events  then slide out of control with the capture of Veracruz.  Twenty US soldiers  and hundreds of Mexican citizens become the victims of Wilson's policy.  This book portrays Wilson negatively, because his policy was not justified.  Mexicans remember this event more than the earlier wars with the United  States. Although Wilson may have been an idealist, the portrait in the book  is of a self righteous man, not capable of understanding another viewpoint.  Accounts in the book show the American occupation as being progressive and  in the best interests of the people of Veracruz.  Wilson returned the port  to the rebels after nine months.<br />This is a nice read for a little known  chapter in American and Mexican history.  People would be wise to read it,  especially in light of the use of American forces worldwide.	2000-05-29

This is a short book about why Ike did not use the opportunity to capture Berlin in 1945.  This is an earlier book before Ambrose became widely known, and to be honest more scholorly and less reader friendly.  It is a  short read.<br />Ike did not sanction the capture of Berlin for a number of  reasons.  First, Berlin was in the Soviet sphere in Germany, and second  because his troops were not in as good a position as the Russians of taking  the Nazi capital.  The cost in human lives would also be great, especially  if the city would have to be handed back to the Russians.  For these  reasons, Ike decided that Berlin was not worth the risk, and sent his  forces toward Leipzig. Ike made a sound military decision.	2000-05-29

Laffin describes how first French and then Haig wasted the lives of their men in fruitless efforts at dislodging the Germans from their strongest defenses on the Western Front.  Laffin also indicts the commanders in  Gallipoli (Turkey) and Kut (Iraq) in their foolish attempts and the wastage  of their human resources in these campaigns.  Not only were these  commanders stupid, but many were criminally negligent in the use of their  men.  Most of these commanders never saw the front and experienced the  conditions of the trenches to know what they put their men through.  Laffin  singles out Haig as the worst offender.  The flower of British youth was  thrown away on the Western Front. As an American, I now know why Wilson  decided to put Pershing and the American Expeditionary Force under separate  command.  If he had entrusted these men to Foch and Haig, the war  cemetaries in France would be filled with much more American dead.	2000-05-29

Even though he states his story as unbiased, his defense of the Boris III leaves the reader wondering. Boris suceeded his  father Ferdinand after the first World War.  Boris was very inexperienced  when he suceeded, and the government went from far left to far right.  In  the 1930s, a royal dictatorship was established by the King, and the  government went to the far right.  Throughout this story the author defends  the King and lambasts the politicians.  Eventually the country drifted into  an alliance with Nazi Germany due to the economic and political situation  in Europe.  With the outbreak of World War II, the King chose to back Nazi  Germany, and enlarge the territory of the country.  This brought the  country into conflict with the Allies, and the enslavement of the country  by Soviet Russia. Boris III was not the evil ruler like Stalin and Hitler.  His choice brought disaster to Bulgaria. The author's defense of the King  is obvious.  The book could have been more objective.	2000-05-21

Also does a great job in  explaining the various factions opposed to Saddam (Shiite, Kurd PDP, Kurd  PUK, INC, INA)  So many factions resulted in Saddam playing one group off  against the other and staying in power.  Also explains the cat and mouse  game Saddam is playing with the West in his weapons of mass destruction.

Generally the main reason given was that an American invasion of Japan would have cost half a million  American casualties.  The  author also states several other reasons.  Among them:  the American belief  in unconditional surrender, impressing the Soviets, and Truman's racism.  There might be some truth in these areas, however the Japanese military  would never have debated using a weapon like this.  They waged total war,  are we as Americans not supposed to wage total war when the other side is?  Ron, if the bombs saved U.S. lives, I think it was worthwhile using these  devices.
