While William M. Tweed is portrayed in an occasional sympathetic light, Ackerman steers clear of moralizing for the most part. This isn't easy when you consider the scope of the Tweed Ring's criminal activity. In the long run, and perhaps intentionally, Tweed comes off a little better than his ring members, and certainly less devious than others who walked away from their years of crime (read: Jay Gould and Jim Fisk). <br /> <br />The cast of the book reads like a Who's Who of 19th Century New York: Tilden, Nast, Greeley, Bryant, Gould, Fisk, etc. Peppered with a generous heaping of illustrations and photos, the book is well-paced, slowing down only to explain the intricacies of the deceptions and the \\"laundering\\" of the stolen funds.  <br /> <br />More important, the book gives us a rare glimpse of what life was like in mid-19th Century New York: that includes daily life, as well as political. If there is anything negative to say, it's about the subtitle. I'm not convinced that Tweed \\"conceived the soul of modern New York\\". A lot of other people can take that credit (or blame, depending on your point of view). But I'm nit-picking. Treat yourself to this history! <br /> <br />Rocco Dormarunno <br />Author of THE FIVE POINTS CONCLUDED	2005-08-26

David McCullough, one of our premiere biographers, has taken a different and intriguing tack in his book, \\"Mornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt\\". This is a biography of Theodore Roosevelt before he reached any high office, before becoming New York's Chief of Police, before becoming Vice President, before becoming President. <br /> <br />But what's more fascinating is that it is also the story of the Roosevelt family and its closest friends. The characteristics of these people and how they shaped a lot of Roosevelt's personality and outlook are drawn out exquisitely by McCullough. I had never known how much his parents had influenced him, and how hard he took their sudden deaths, as well as the untimely death of his young wife. Surrounded by wealth and advantage, Theodore Roosevelt could not seem escape the ever-present aura of death. His own delicate health--asthma, digestive disorders, etc.--was also a reminder of the sudden end that could come to us all.  <br /> <br />What this did, remarkably as McCullough points out, was fill young Teddy Roosevelt with a hunger for life, nature, and knowledge--and this hunger would shape his adulthood. While the book SEEMS to end abruptly, in reality McCullough had given us what his title had promised, a story of the \\"Unique Child\\" who became one of America's greatest presidents. \\"Mornings on Horseback\\" is a fabulous biography from one of our best writers. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points <br />	2005-07-29

Carl Oglesby's \\"Who Killed JFK?\\" competently explores the main threads of the investigation without bogging the reader down with \\"research\\" or going off on too many tangents. And as the previous reviewer mentioned, Oglesby may wear his heart on his sleeve, but he doesn't bully the reader into accepting his premise.

Callahan and Zingarelli's \\"WHO SHOT JFK?: A Guide to the Major Conspiracy Theories\\" is one of those exemplary books. <br /> <br />Author Callahan tackles the stronger elements behind the assassination conspiracies, and presents them concisely, but in a way that leaves the reader satisfied that he/she understands them. (The section dealing with the complex, multi-personalities that Lee Harvey Oswald's legacy has left us is, to me, the strongest chapter.) Mark Zingarelli's illustrations--they are not cartoons--are witty sometimes, but at others, very, very eerie. Haunting might be the better term.

Professor Weintraub has taken a look at the American Revolution and presented us with the flip-side to the coin, that is, the plight of the Britons--rich and poor--who were dependent on trade with the colonies. And Professor Weintraub approaches the suffering and frustration of these people in a sensitive and, yet, logical way. <br /> <br />The only \\"bad guy\\" emerging out of all this is George III who is depicted as particularly obsessed with showing the colonies who's the boss. (By the way, the colonists are not portrayed as the little innocent angels our [U.S.] history books have claimed they were. They were, in some cases, particularly criminal and not exempt from violence. Weintraub is also correct in depicting the ingratitude of some colonists toward the Redcoats who protected them during the French-Indian war. Still that does not absolve the British from breaking into the homes of innocent people, eating all their food, taking whatever tools, blankets, etc., they wanted, and, in some cases, sexually abusing the women.)  <br /> <br />On the downside, Weintraub tends to linger too long on the colonies' objection to the \\"taxation without representation\\" issue. But, as one reads further into the book, Weintraub s-l-o-w-l-y brings in the other elements of British oppression which are listed in Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, and which led to the conflicts at Lexington and Concord. All the while, an outraged Parliament and British public could only watch impotently.  <br /> <br />It takes a while for this book to strike a balance, but still, Weintraub deserves credit for showing us what the common folk and the politicians of Great Britain were thinking and feeling before, during, and after the war, something I was pretty ignorant of. And as it moves away from its earlier preoccupation with the taxation/representation issue, it brings the real issues of the American Revolution into better focus through both British and American eyes. <br /> <br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS	2005-07-11

And, yet, as Professor Holzer points out, this speech, while mentioned in history books, is rarely given the recognition it deserves. His comprehensive and readable \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that Made Abraham Lincoln President\\", rectifies this terrible oversight. <br /> <br />This is not a step-by-step examination of Lincoln's references in, and the rhetorical craftsmanship of, the speech, although those are explored thoroughly. The book also explores the heretofore unacknowledged campaigning savvy that Lincoln possessed. He knew he had to come to Gotham to convince the Eastern Republicans of his credibility. He knew the importance of the local newspaper printers, like Bryant and Greeley. He understood the importance of having a visual aid, like a Matthew Brady photograph. But, most important, as Professor Holzer takes great pains to reveal, Lincoln did not want to appear to be an abolitionist. That would border on radicalism which would be a guarantee of defeat. <br /> <br />As a bonus, \\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that Made Abraham Lincoln President\\", presents us with a unique view of 1860 New York: the thieves at the docks; the \\"mass transit\\" of the age; the hunger for entertainment, of which political speeches were a significant part; the elegance and extravagance of the rich; and the desperation of the Five Points poor. <br /> <br />\\"Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President\\" is a wonderful book that will please anyone interested in American History, New York City, or oratory. And Professor Holzer deserves our thanks for making it so fascinating. It only reflects his own passion for the subject. <br /> <br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS <br /> <br />	2005-06-20

I might not recommend this book for an introduction to literature or introduction to expository prose because it is too overwhelming, and one would never be able to cover even one-third of the essays. However, in a more advanced class, this would fit in quite well. <br /> <br />I don't always agree with the commentaries that precede each essay, and I don't find all the \\"Possibilities for writing\\" questions after each essay that valuable.

Before I read his monmental book, I have to confess that that was the my limited knowledge as well. People like me, who have had a lifelong interest in American history, but had too many gaps in it, owe Mr. Bordewich a huge debt for bringing this unnecessarily overlooked movement into history's spotlight. Before reading this book, I had never heard of Henry Bibb, Gerrit Smith, Josiah Henson, Mary Ann Shad, James and Lucretia Mott or Levi Coffin (ironic how many lives got their beginnings from a man named \\"Coffin\\"). Now, thanks to this book, I doubt I will ever forget these noble people.    As other reviewers have pointed out, the Underground Railroad was as complex and chimeric as were the stationmasters and conductors who expedited the fugitives. So many of the participants--white and black--had so many different opinions as to the moral and practical implications of the Railroad's use, that it's amazing that the infighting didn't shatter the movement to pieces. Fortunately, as Mr. Bordewich points, they all had a unified goal: to free as many slaves as possible and crush the South's resistance to abolition.    What makes the book so very readable is Mr. Bordewich's blend of political/moral wrangling, biographies, tales of thrilling escapes (and sometimes captures), and the sweeping events--sometimes local, sometimes global--that had an impact on the Railroad's progress. The generous peppering of photos, illustrations and maps make the reading process all the more enjoyable and understandable. Mr. Bordewich is to be thanked for bringing this epic back to life, and it is good to know that publishers are still willing to take the chance onpublishing books that are certainly not guaranteed to be best sellers. I sure hope this book becomes one; it deserves it.	2005-05-06

New York Times writer, Christopher Gray, with the assistance of the untiring researcher, Suzanne Braley, actually breathe life into these buildings. Not only do we learn the who and the when of a building's birth, but also the why and the how. Why were white brick apartment buildings so prominent at one time? How did the Winter Garden evolve from a huge stable? It's the little and, sometimes, epic anecdotes surrounding the buildings that fascinate Mr. Gray which, in turn, fascinate us.

Published on, roughly, the 50th anniversary of the disaster, Stein presents a story of young immigrant girls standing up against sweatshop atrocities, only to find themselves, in the case of the girls laboring at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory, pushed further down. The account of the disaster is appropriately harrowing.  <br /> <br />William Greider's introduction, although occassionally heavy-handed, makes the reader wonder how much things have improved now that we are almost marking the 100th anniversary of that awful day.  <br /> <br />Also, it would be worthwhile to read this in conjunction with David von Driehle's superb \\"Triangle: The Fire that Changed America\\". <br /> <br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of \\"The Five Points\\". <br />	2005-04-03

Scott Fitzgerald is a Midwesterner who came to New York City to try his luck. Many great New Yorkers came from outside the City (PT Barnum, Robert Fulton, Alexander Hamilton, etc.). However, their fresh perspectives of Gotham--something a native might overlook--allowed them to see things in a different way. Nick, the narrator of THE GREAT GATSBY, is also a Midwestern boy who comes to New York. In Jay Gatsby, Nick sees someone alluring, mysterious, dazzling, intimidating, aloof, and shady--all those qualities associated with Jazz Age New York. And the population of Gatsby's parties, like the population of Roaring 20s New York, are money-, power- and sex-hungry, yearning for celebrity, and, in many cases, hollow people who drink too much.<br /><br />For all the drinking, Nick's view (and therefore Fitzgerald's) is incredibly sobering and clear-eyed. Caught up as he is in the excitement, he is often repelled by some of it. THE GREAT GATSBY, in my book, contains some of Fitzgerald's most lyrical writing. In form, character development, and plot, this book stands out as just an important book of early 20th century American literature as anything by Steinbeck, Dos Passos, or Dreiser.	2005-02-17

His sympathy/empathy for Mary (Typhoid Mary) Mallon is evident throughout the text. (His final gesture of burying a gift at her grave was very moving.) He understands Mary's territorial sprayings in the kitchen, and how she felt that no one had the right to prevent her from working in it. And although he feels for her, he is not callous to the havoc and tragedy she created.  <br /> <br />There is also a little bit of a detective story here. And I enjoyed the juxtaposition of the first time Mary was tracked down and the last time. The limited range of the book is the only drawback. I felt as though I had read something that was part of a larger work. In gustatory terms, I felt I had eaten a  tasty main course with some side dishes, but was denied the appetizer and dessert. Again, Mr. Bourdain's final farewell to Mary at the gravesite was moving, but sort of abruptly ended the story. But I'm nitpicking. \\"Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical\\" is a wonderful diversion. <br />	2005-01-29

Russell Shorto's narrative of the Dutch period of New York City (and State) has provided readers with a great insight into a world long ago but not long gone. \\"The Island at the Center of the World: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan, the Forgotten Colony that Shaped America\\", based partly on the research/translating work of Charles Gehring, is a good introduction to this neglected period in America's history, and will also surprise those well-versed in the subject. His thesis, that the New Netherland Dutch influenced the development of American history, society, and law is not entirely new, but he does expand upon our pre-existing notions of that influence.  <br /> <br />But even though not everything here is new to some of us, what the real accomplishment is--and Shorto deserves our appreciation for it--that this book finally makes this history accessible. While other books have covered this ground, they were so bogged down with statistics and numbers that they were almost unreadable. Shorto's narrative style and his ability to bring such colorful people back to life (Hudson, Stuyvesant, van der Donck, et al.), makes his book accessible to those who might not be inclined to buy a book on this subject. On a personal level, Shorto's \\"The Island at the Center of the World: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan, the Forgotten Colony that Shaped America\\", much like Burrows and Wallace's \\"Gotham\\" brought the ancient days of my city back to life. For a moment, as I sat in Bowling Green, I was able to erase the tall buildings and populate that area with trees and small, gable-roofed houses. I could wipe away the old Custom-House and see the fort that once stood in its place. That is how good the writing is.

Of course, the older photos and prints that were created during the bridge's construction marvel the reader, and one begins to realize how massive an undertaking the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge really was. <br /> <br />This is an excellent visual companion to David McCullough's \\"The Great Bridge\\". <br />	2004-10-20

While it's undoubtedly famous for the team whose namesake it adorns, Yankee Stadium was also home to the New York (football) Giants for years, and it was the site for countless boxing matches and non-sporting events. But, of course, it's all about the Yankees and, exactly as Mr. Robinson puts it in his subtitle, the Drama, Glamor, and Glory.  <br /> <br />While not a comprehensive, exhaustive research style book, there is ample information and anecdotes to go along with the countless photographs, some of which are familiar and others which are quite unique. I hope that one day, when Mr. Robinson gets around to it, a newer edition will add one more important event that occurred at the Stadium: the resumption of the World Series in 2001, just weeks after the devestation of 9/11/2001.	2004-09-15

When most people think of the significant battles of the Revolutionary War, they think of Bunker Hill, Saratoga, Yorktown, or Trenton. But New York City, and Brooklyn specifically was the scene for the first great battle.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as Mr. Gallagher sympathetically conveys, the battle was a disaster from beginning to end. Over a thousand of Washington's troops were injured, captured, or killed. It was only with the brave and selfless assistance of the Marylanders, that the American troops were able to evacuate. Mr. Gallagher, with the skill of suspense novelist as well as historian, describes Washington's daring escape from Brooklyn, at night, in an intense fog.<br /><br />I'm just scratching  the surface here. This is a fascinating account of an undeservedly overlooked event of the American Revolution, and Mr. Gallagher deserves utmost credit for preserving its memory.	2004-09-05

Imagine the incredible questions that must have come into the minds of the founders of America once independence had been won! Fortunately, the new nation had a small handful of men who had the vision, pragmatism, intellect and communicative abilities: Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, specifically. With an assist from John Jay, these men mapped out the Federalist plan for the United States in pamphlets and newspaper items which, once collected, became THE FEDERALIST PAPERS.<br /><br />After Charles Kesler's insightful introduction, the reader plunges into these great essays--85 of them. What emerges is an obviously biased but logical argument for a strong central government, a national army (rather than provincial, state-run militiae), and an economy based on commerce, manufactures, and banking. Each essay is a self-contained entity, but the common themes make the collection a seamless (most of the time) and unified whole.<br /><br />Ironically, Madison and Hamilton would become enemies. And over time the anti-Federalists and Democratic-Republicans would endure but the influences of Jay, Hamilton, and Madison had left their marks on the new nation. Any American with an interest in how their country went from independence on paper to independence and success in practice must read THE FEDERALIST PAPERS.	2004-08-27

Using eye- and ear-witness testimony, drawings made from stills of the Zapruder film (which may have been tampered with but is NOT a fabrication, puh-LEEZE, Mr. Fetzer!), and expert analysis, Josiah Thompson's SIX SECONDS IN DALLAS remains the best study of the assassination--and the best proof of a conspiracy--to have emerged from the 60s, or any other decade for that matter. <br /> <br />Don't look for Cuban-exile/CIA/FBI/KGB/Vinnie-Goombatza-crime-family conspiracy theories here. This book is not interested in the whodunnit aspect of the case. It is solely interested in those moments--those six seconds--between the first and last shots that murdered President John F. Kennedy. And in his analysis of them, Josiah Thompson proves beyond a reasonable doubt that a second shooter, and probably a third, took part in the assassination.  <br /> <br />Sometimes, after reading some of the more disappointing books about the JFK assassination (and there are TONS of them), I shake my head and really wonder if anything beyond the Warren Commisssion's conclusions had really occurred. Then I pick up SIX SECONDS IN DALLAS and turn to any page. And there is no longer any doubt that a conspiracy murdered our president. It's a shame that this book is out of print. I hope that some of the publishers who have made a fortune out of the glut of conspiracy books--like Thunder's Mouth Press or Carroll & Graf--will pick up the rights to this great book and publish it for a new generation of JFK assassination researchers. That new generation will need it!	2004-08-20

But as the semester rolled on, and they began to realize how utterly comprehensive CLASSIC WRITINGS ON POETRY is, they became grateful. This is true, especially, when they do the math. This book costs roughly $75. But if I were to have them buy even the paperback versions of the writings on poetry by Aristotle, Milton, Dryden, Longfellow, Whitman, Pound, etc., the cost would be staggering.  <br /> <br />Economic reasons aside, Harmon's CLASSIC WRITINGS ON POETRY offers a great representation of the enduring essays on poetry. Ordered chronologically, each essay is preceded by an introduction by Harmon that sets the stage for the period and the writer. Although the selections are conservative and predictable, they are classics for a reason: they have all endured the tests of time and attack. Harmon's CLASSIC WRITINGS ON POETRY is a great book for people interested in the history of poetic theory, and a valuable tool for instructors of the subject. <br /> <br />	2004-08-17

If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. OF MICE AND MEN is arguably one of the best novels about the hardships of the poor during this time.  <br /> <br />Lennie and George, a pair of drifters, represent brain and braun, respectively. Caught in the whirlpool of economic collapse, the two go from job to job, taking work whenever and wherever they can find it. Along the way, and especially at the farm that is at the center of the book's action, the pair encounter violence, racism, ignorance, selfishness, and a host of other tragic qualities among the poor that are compelled to fight tooth and nail for survival. Steinbeck certainly is not blaming the poor; rather, he is saying that this is what men will resort to when denied good, decent work. And, ultimately, OF MICE AND MEN has given us a glimpse into this tragic time. A highly recommended book. <br />	2004-08-10

If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is arguably the best novel about the struggles of the poor during this time. Focusing on the hardships of the Joad family and their friends, Steinbeck gives us, in microcosm, a look at the entire population of the dispossessed of the Great Depression. The constant hunger, searches for work, violence, betrayals and setbacks that the Joads endure would have produced a grim and depressing novel in a less skilled writer's hand, but Steinbeck does not allow his characters to give in. In spite of all the calamities, the Joads maintain dignity, courage, and hope. Fortunately, for America, the poor did maintain these virtues, otherwise it would have vanished or rebelled, throwing the nation into anarchy. THE GRAPES OF WRATH, however, shows our generation just how close we came.<br /><br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS.	2004-08-10

Why it is that the Manhattan Company Building at 40 Wall is neglected is beyond me. It's not like you can't see it: it's visible from Brooklyn, New Jersey, and the Staten Island Ferry. It's not like it's ugly: it's very beautiful. Finally, Neal Bascomb has given The Manhattan Company Building the attention it deserves, as he describes its rise along with the construction of the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. \\"Higher: A Historic Race to the Sky and the Making of a City\\" is a wonderfully engaging book that tells the stories of the buildings, and the cranks, egos, geniuses, and muscles that went into their respective constructions.

As an adult, I had been through the Center thousands of times and ate many a lunch in the plaza between the two beautiful towers. Although I worked only three blocks north of the WTC, I was nowhere near them on 9/11, and thank God for that. I don't think I could have been able to bear witnessing their destruction.  <br />  <br /> To fill the void, I began reading everything about the World Trade Center that I could. Eric Darton's book, &quot;Divided We Stand&quot;, published before 9/11, was okay but I found the second-person narration and its choppy presentation too distracting. Several other books were published after the devestation, but they all seemed like rush jobs trying to cash in on the disaster. However, &quot;City in the Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center&quot; by James Glanz and Eric Lipton is by far the best of the bunch. Meticulously researched without being too scholarly, the authors present a biography of the center that was filled with controversy, behind-closed-doors intrigues, political wrestling and, ultimately, the construction and engineering marvels that allowed the towers to rise. The pacing is remarkably swift but nothing is glossed over. The final quarter of the book is about 9/11 and afterward. I began this section with dread and was tempted not to read it at all. Fortunately, Glanz and Lipton handled it with incredible sensitivity.  <br />  <br /> &quot;City in the Sky&quot;, like the towers themselves, is a remarkable collaboration: the narrative is seamless--like Burrows and Wallace's &quot;Gotham&quot;. And, ultimately, this book is a lively and poignant tribute to the World Trade Center they must have loved. <br />  <br /> Rocco Dormarunno, <br /> author of &quot;The Five Points&quot; <br />	2004-08-05

Smith played in New York's, indeed America's, development in the first half of the twentieth century. And first time biographer Christopher Finan has conveyed that sense with the skill of a writer of several biographies.  <br />  <br /> What has always struck me as curious is the portrayal of Smith, by other writers, as enigmatic and muckraking (these words appear on the bookjacket). What Finan makes extremely clear is that Smith often wore his heart on his sleeve, his politics were never slick, and his friendships were often based on an almost naive but thorough honesty. What made Smith such an easy target during his career was his openness about his religion, his affection for the working class from which he rose, and his steadfastness to his beliefs, even if they ran contrary to the party's line. If he believed that a certain policy or proposal was the product of a bunch of &quot;crackpots&quot; (one of Smith's favorite words) he said so out of candor, not muckraking or for the sake of political gain. Ultimately, Smith was a firm believer in America, the Constitution, and the democratic process, which Finan clearly demonstrates was becoming almost outdated in an increasingly cynical society. <br />  <br /> But what Finan ultimately gives us is the human portrait of Al Smith. His tight friendships, his quick wit, his extroverted personality, his devotion to his wife, Katie, and his family, his gratitude to Tammany and the district in which he was raised, and his love for The Sidewalks Of New York all shine through some of the more mundane sections of the book. THE HAPPY WARRIOR is a joyous biography. Like Smith himself, it leaves you with an optimistic and grateful feeling, in spite of all the negative moments that could have overwhelmed it. One of the better biographies in recent years. <br />  <br /> Rocco Dormarunno <br /> Author of THE FIVE POINTS	2004-08-02

Too many books either talk down to students or are so cerebral and sophisticated that they leave them dumbfounded or bored or both. Alan Taylor's look at pre-Revolutionary War North American continent is brilliant, engaging, and written with a flair that interested readers and students will embrace.     America's history began well-before the first Europeans arrived, and Professor Taylor goes to great lengths to reinforce that simple concept which most histories tend to ignore. Tracing back to the earliest settlers, Taylor evokes an era that is strangely primitive--strange in the sense that we are conditioned to conceive America as being born modern, as though the pavements, skyscrapers and railroads were already here when the Europeans arrived.    Although a long book, it reads very quickly, and the maps and illustrations throughout are easy to read and, more urgently, relevant.

Did you know that West Orange was the home of Thomas Alva Edison?<br /><br />Lately, I have been spending a lot of time in West Orange, so I picked up this skinny little book to help orient myself to the place. I found out that West Orange was the home of Thomas Alva Edison. Thank God I don't have to rely on this mess to learn anything else about the place.<br /><br />One major problem with this book is that there is no overarching narrative to hold it together. What prompted West Orange's growth? What differentiates it from the other Oranges? So much of this sort of information is left out. The photographs are arranged like a careless photo album with no real substantial text to make you understand why the photos are there in the first place. I showed the book to a lifelong resident of West Orange, and she just shook her head and pointed out a few mistakes that I never would have spotted. An earlier reviewer mentioned that this book was put together by an outside printer and written by an outside writer. It shows.<br /><br />But I do know that West Orange was home to Thomas Alva Edison. What? It wasn't his home? He only worked here? I give up.	2004-07-26

When I bought the book and saw how slim it was, I snickered, &quot;Grad school's gonna be a walk in the park!&quot;  <br />  <br /> Yeah, RIGHT!  <br />  <br /> This densely packed tome is not for the uninitiated and definitely not absorbed in just one reading. On and off, over the last 20 years, I have come back to this book to refresh my memory and, usually, to astonish myself. The book's real strength, besides Professor Fussell's obvious command of his subject, and his ability to convey that command, is in the sprinkling of dozens of anecdotes by and about poets about other poets and poetry. Even at this late date in my life, I can't pretend to understand the entire book but what I do understand I admire and respect. &quot;Poetic Meter and Poetic Form&quot; is not recommended to anyone studying poetry; it is urgently required.	2004-07-23

The Nazis were gone, but still in modern memory. Russia's totalitarian state was a constant threat. McCarthyism hovered over everyone's privacy, as did J. Edgar Hoover. And recent fiction, like Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD and, especially, George Orwell's 1984 presented world views where the human spirit is all but squelched by governments and technologies.<br />LORD OF THE FLIES, in its own way, says, \\"Hold on a second! Humans do need to be regulated. And they do need to protect themselves from each other.\\" His tale is a warning: Humanity, without government, will degenerate into savagery and anarchy. And that is precisely what happens in this book. You know the plot, by now. But what has to be mentioned is that William Golding is a visionary who has the story-telling mastery to convey and do justice to that vision. LORD OF THE FLIES is a remarkable and powerful book, one that should be on everyone's bookshelf.	2004-07-19

I recently found my [very] old high school copy of this book, and I remembered writing a very appreciative report about it for my eleventh grade English class. Not having anything else convenient to read along my subway ride to work, I started reading it again, after 31 years. And now I remember why my eleventh grade report was so glowing.<br />Erich Maria Remarque's ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT grabs you by the throat and stomach and doesn't let go, as you are drawn into the blood- and mud-soaked trenches of World War One. Young Paul Baumer, the protagonist, is at first proud and fearless, as he prepares to make a man of himself in the German army. This bravado doesn't last too long. Each battle grows more and more fierce, until this book becomes an unrelenting apocalypse of graves yielding up their dead in mortar attacks. As Paul moves through the trenches, they are nothing less than Dante's circles of the Inferno. It doesn't take Paul too long to discover that wars are fought not for ideals but for old men hungry for power, and will let the young men of their nations die for that hunger.<br />ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT has earned its reputation not just as a great war novel but as a great critique of humanity's follies and cruelties. This is a powerful book.	2004-07-19

As other reviewers have noted, there is something shaky (and a little shady) about E.D. Hirsch's argument and intention for compiling this book. And there's something a bit presumptuous about the subtitle. But to be honest, I could care less. The real value of &quot;Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know&quot; is as a resource for people who want to know what exactly others mean when they use expressions or make cultural references.<br />It is irrelevant WHY some people don't know these references. Maybe because they're young (although I don't believe it's a generational issue). And the PC will scream and whine that the book doesn't have enough entries about lesser known cultures. The fact is that writers, journalists, politicians, religious leaders, et al., make these references when they are trying to illustrate a point. This book, for whatever its intention, gives the reader/listener a place to turn. And that's enough of a reason. And on that level, &quot;Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know&quot; works just fine!	2004-07-15

Richard Hofstadter's remarkable ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM IN AMERICAN LIFE reflects the Cold War/post-McCarthy era, yet still echoes powerfully today. Why this book has endured for four decades is not only because it still rings true, but also for Hofstadter's iron-clad reasoning. (This is not easy reading--at least for me it wasn't). Hofstadter examines the multi-fronted attacks on intellectuals throughout the centuries: attacks from religions who suspected intellectuals of atheism or worse; attacks from the left; attacks from the right; attacks from the lower class who perceived intellectuals as privileged; and attacks from the upper class who worried about the knowledge/power balance. Yes, Hofstadter does linger long about the anti-intellectual movement of the early 60s, and some of those references are lost to us, but that cannot be helped nor blamed on him. I also enjoyed the distinction between intelligence and intellectualism--very acute.	2004-07-15

Thanks to Evan Cornog's study, &quot;The Birth of Empire: DeWitt Clinton and the American Experience, 1769-1828&quot; the many triumphs of Clinton's career are given the national and historic scope they deserve.<br />NOTE: This is a study of Clinton's contributions to New York's and America's emergence as a world power, especially in terms of an economic power. This is NOT a biography in the ordinary sense of the word. Unlike McCullough's &quot;John Adams&quot; or Chernow's &quot;Alexander Hamiltion&quot;, we do not get a full-length portrait of the man. Partly because DeWitt Clinton was much more reserved and reluctant to show his feelings than others of his time and partly because his diary entries, as Cornog points out, are very mundane, we mostly see the public DeWitt Clinton: DeWitt Clinton the politician, DeWitt Clinton the scientist, DeWitt Clinton the philanthropist, etc. So intensely private in some ways (his mother wondered if he was dead or alive because he never wrote her while he attended Columbia), it is remarkable that he would seek such a public career.<br />But it was to New York's and America's benefit that he did.<br />Although he never achieved the Presidency, he often influenced (directly or indirectly) every President in office during his lifetime. He clashed with some of the mightiest men of his day: Aaron Burr, Daniel Tompkins, Ambrose Spencer, et al. As Cornog points out, not all his confrontations were rooted in ideology; DeWitt Clinton was a political animal, even though the political realm he operated in was rapidly changing, often leaving Clinton behind. Clinton also could often be extremely self-centered, snobbish and vindictive. And, yet, this contradictory man also had long-reaching visions and programs for the benefit of the poor as well as the merchant and upper classes. He supportedfree education for all New Yorkers. He supported artists, writers, and scientists. Most importantly, his dogged determination to get the Erie Canal built provided jobs for immigrants, provided a market for farmers, provided work for New Englanders, and helped build the great cities along the canal's path. And as the canal propelled New York State and New York City into economic powerhouses, it also propelled America's westward expansion and its status as a world-class nation.<br />Well-written and well-documented, Evan Cornog's &quot;The Birth of Empire&quot; captures the feel of the early decades of America, with all its growing pains. And it puts DeWitt Clinton in American history's spotlight where he belongs.	2004-07-13

For too many decades and by too many college instructors, Albert Camus has been clumped together with Jean-Paul Sartre and others under the heading of &quot;Existentialist&quot;. This collection of Camus' notebooks indicates that there were many other things going on in his thinking, and Existentialism was hardly one of them. In fact, several revealing excerpts show us a man who disagreed with it fundamentally.<br />That aside, what it really presents to the reader is that Camus is first and foremost a writer. Whether it's creative writing, critical writing, reflective writing, etc., he was accomplished at all of them. His description of a sunset, quaint as it might sound, is so beautiful it's almost heartbreaking. Meanwhile, his political observations are keen, with a strong sense of urgency.<br />Equally fascinating is to observe his literary works taking shape: to see the mind of a writer putting a major opus together. To me, this is the major contribution of the book. I highly recommend this book to aspiring writers, diarists, or to anyone interested in the mid-20th century thought. That goes for Existentialists too.	2004-07-12

The ultimate &quot;What if...&quot; novel of the post-War era, FAIL-SAFE still holds up remarkably [and tragically] well in the post-9/11 era. Several critics have pointed up the political aspects of this book, but in a way this is more of a sci-fi novel in the sense that the technology of war would safeguard us against danger when the opposite is the truth: reliance upon technology is equally dangerous. Read this novel as a precursor to the film &quot;War Games&quot; or the t.v. movie of early 70s, &quot;Colossus: The Forbin Project&quot;.<br />But even as political thriller, this book is still powerful. All the characters stand up well and are truly believeable. The plot and pacing are gripping. Considering Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler had had no real writing experience previous to FAIL-SAFE, it is just as compelling and well-crafted as anything written by Tom Clancy.

He had also rejected Catholicism, and yet all his characters are dominated by it. DUBLINERS, Joyce's collection of short stories which set the standard for the genre, is filled with characters who come to terrible revelations (which he called &quot;epiphanies&quot;) about how their lives had been scarred by the provincialism of Dublin, the divisiveness of its politics, and the oppression of religion. By extension, this is how Joyce percieved humanity at the dawn of modernism.<br />The stories range from the psychologically simple (&quot;Counterparts&quot; and &quot;A Little Cloud&quot;) to the extraordinarily complex (&quot;A Painful Case&quot; and &quot;The Dead&quot;). But what is common throughout is the feel for Dublin just after the turn of the last century. The readers see the cobblestones, the chimneys, the trams and carts, the churches, and the street lamps. More importantly, the readers feel the tensions underlying the public smiles and infrequent bursts of confidence that the characters exhibit. <br />The extra value of this Viking Critical edition is, of course, the criticism. The valuable notes help make the understanding of the reading much easier. And the critical essays, each single one, provides a deeper understanding of how to put these stories in a larger frame.	2004-07-12

Perhaps this haphazard beginning is what gave the area its combined refined yet anarchic flavor that exists until this day. <br />And this was also the reason for the area becoming attractive to free-thinkers, tourists, bohemians and artists. Complete with maps, illustrations and walking tours of the Village, Terry Miller's &quot;Greenwich Village and How It Got that Way&quot; reveals the extraordinary history and the historic people who made the place their homes. Artists Jackson Pollack and Edward Hopper, poets Edna St. Vincent Millay and Walt Whitman, playwright Eugene O'Neill, and novelist Willa Cather, are just a few of the famous names who lived and created work here, as they created something uniquely American.<br />&quot;Greenwich Village and How It Got That Way&quot; is a great book for people who will visit the village, and is great for New Yorkers, themselves, to learn about this neighborhood that they thought they knew so well.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2004-07-09

(I believe the latter.) I won't go into a discussion of &quot;A Portrait&quot; here because if you are looking at this particular Viking Critical edition, you've already committed yourself to reading it. The value of this edition lies in the critical essays and notes at the end. The notes will help the reader along, as they explain some of the terms and/or conditions that are particular to Joyce's Ireland. The essays are, each and every one, valuable tools. Whether it's an examination of Joyce's life, the creation of &quot;A Portrait&quot;, the influences it would have, etc., every essay is a heavy-weight that enchances an understanding of the book. (At least it did for me.) If you're seriously considering reading &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; this is the edition to use.	2004-07-09

Having said that, this Dover publication is a wonderful assortment of various scenes of New York life over 150 years ago.<br />There are some illustrations that are to be expected: Coney Island in its heydey, the Brooklyn Bridge, the el, etc. But the integrity and importance of the book lie in the unexpected scenes: heavy traffic on Broadway, abuse to animals and children, a football game, an omnibus at rush hour. These are the vignettes of every day life that open a window into nineteenth century New York. Also surprising are some illustrations by a very young Winslow Homer, just beginning to hone his artistic skills.<br />The other value of the book is the terrific quality of the printing. Like most Dover publications, the cover and spine are extremely durable. Also, most of the illustrations are full-page illustration which bring out every detail.

In his brilliant book, &quot;Empire: A Tale of Obsession, Betrayal, and the Battle for an American Icon&quot;, Mitchell Pacelle reveals the intrigues, wheeling-dealing, and financial brawling that surrounds the greatest symbol of America's financial power. Sometimes the depths to which the players sank were as deep as the Empire State Building is high. There are many of the names that you would expect to be involved in this tale: Raskob, Smith, Helmsley, Trump, but there are plenty of surprises (which I won't give away). <br />Mr. Pacelle deserves a load of credit, not just for the research (which is impressive enough) but for the glitzy, brash, and engaging style with which he tells this fascinating story. Only in New York would a story like this happen, and only Mr. Pacelle has told it the way it should.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS	2004-07-07

James Tague is one of the last surviving witnesses to the horrible events of November 22, 1963, and his book &quot;Truth Withheld: A Survivors Story - Why We Will Never Know the Truth About the JFK Assassination&quot; explains with conviction why the murder will undoubtedly recede into history unsolved.<br />James Tague's day began innocently enough, until traffic and his curiosity made him park his car beneath the triple underpass in Dealey Plaza to watch Kennedy's motorcade. As JFK's limo approached him, the shots rang out, and Mr. Tague's cheek was hit. From that moment on, Tague's life--and America--changed forever. Mr. Tague describes in vivid detail his interrogations--by the FBI and the Warren Commission, among others. And Mr. Tague conveys his sense that something wasn't right.

Remember, today will be the good old days in a not-too-distant future. While other history books have tried to make this very point, I think Dr. Bettmann's achievement, and what makes this book more effective in a way, is that he presents his thesis in a style that is enjoyable and humorous. It's a great little book for everyone's history shelves.<br />Note:<BR>Dr. Bettmann wrote about America in American English for Americans: he knows which side his bread is buttered on.

It's a gloriously good-looking book.<br />But more important, Sanna Feirstein has gotten her facts right. When people think of the place names of Manhattan, they probably think of the grid and its numbered roads. Or that Manhattan is so modern, that all its place names begin with the Rockefeller era. WRONG! The island of Manhattan reaches further back in the history of American cities than any other one: the Wall Street area itself existed while Shakespeare's plays were first being produces. Manhattan, especially the older neighborhoods from Houston Street south to the Battery, are filled with twisting little streets whose names resonate with Manhattan's history. This book is where you'll find out why Houston Street is pronounced &quot;HOW-ston&quot;. Where did Maiden Lane get its name from? Who was Barclay? This book will tell all. <br />This is a very informative book. If only it can tell me why New Yorkers pronounce Avenue of the Americas as &quot;Sixth Avenue&quot;.	2004-07-06

Although conceived during the 1920s boom years, most of the construction went on during the earliest years of the Depression, thereby putting the idea of high occupancy in the severest doubt. Its location wasn't ideal either. It was three miles north of the Wall Street district and a mile south of the center of the midtown business center. And it was ten blocks south of Grand Central Station and three avenues east of old Pennsylvania Station. The idea of mooring dirigibles was quickly scrapped after failed attempts. And sure enough, although the Empire State Building did get built, the tenants did not come. King Kong did, but he didn't pay rent.<br />John Tauranac describes all this and more in his exhaustive book, THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING: THE MAKING OF A LANDMARK. Written in an engaging style, Tauranac's book is as elegant and interesting as the subject itself, while his wit is as colorful as the characters surrounding the Empire State Building's creation. The book covers the idea for the building, Raskob's and Smith's supervision, the monumental task of the construction workers, and, most importantly, the survival of the building to become THE emblem of America's cultural and economic reach while become THE identifying symbol of New York City. The generous amount of photographs add to the understanding and enjoyment of the book. Highly recommended.	2004-07-02

BUT I know other published poets and you won't see any of my positive comments around their work, and that's because I consider Giftus' poetry to be that of a truly inspired writer with music coming out of his pen. He has the absolute right to use the words &quot;Sings&quot; and &quot;Songs&quot; in his title.<br />Several of the poems harken back to Giftus' days in Dominica, as he reexamines the joys and the pains of his youth. But it isn't a total introspection, as he applies the same lessons he'd learned to the youthful experiences of his own young children. Many other poems reflect the adult Giftus, now in New Jersey. There's a melancholy longing in these poems but never does he give into self-pity. He always has that music, he always has his island songs to get him through. And we are better for that, too.	2004-07-02

Way back when America was still a conglomeration of British colonies, Greenwich Village was settled by the rich and merchant class of lower Manhattan as an escape from the recurring ravages of yellow fever and cholera. For this reason Greenwich Village was, essentially, never really mapped out; never really settled in accordance to any public plan. Of course, there was no grid plan either. Perhaps this haphazard beginning is what gave the area its combined flavor of anarchy and refinement. Where else would you find a Washington Square Park whose north end was the home to upper or, at least, bourgiose families, and whose south end was a magnet for immigrants not so rich?<br />Focusing on what was arguably the Village's heydays, the 50 years from 1910 to 1950, the late Ross Wetzsteon reveals to us a neighborhood as provincial and insular as any New England town in one way, and as forward-looking and worldly in another. REPUBLIC OF DREAMS is a look at the artists and writers, activists and thinkers, who populated this amazing world (e.g. Gould, Pollack, O'Neill, Reed, Sinclair). And, as Wetzsteon demonstrates, the Village sort of became an image for the entire world on the verge of modernism.<br />Prof. Wetzsteon's style is learned and academic, but far from stuffy or dull. And he peppers the book with anecdotes that are witty and tragic. It is a shame that Prof. Wetzsteon has been taken from us, but at least his REPUBLIC OF DREAMS will be with us for a long while.	2004-07-02

For most, Rockefeller Center makes its impression on people early in their lives. Many of us as children were introduced to it by either a show at Radio City Music Hall or by a visit to the Christmas tree. Either way, the event was usually magical, and Rockefeller Center always seemed to maintain that Art Deco dreamlike place in our hearts. Finally, this book, &quot;Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center&quot; by Daniel Okrent sort of pulls down the facade to reveal the all too human faces behind this self-contained wonderworld. <br />This story isn't too well-known, and the evolution of the site from midtown wasteland to potential opera house to what it is today is strange enough to pass as fiction. Daniel Okrent does a more than efficient job of balancing all the various elements and characters that went into this place: greed, art, revolution, riches, poverty, Luce, Vanderbilt, Rivera, and, of course, the Rockefellers. There are many more characters and events chronicled here--this isn't light reading! But Okrent makes the ride interesting, balancing dry economics with witty commentary (his own and from others). The pacing is actually very swift, and this is a testimony to Okrent's devotion to his subject and his own writing talents. <br />Pick up a copy of this book; you're sure to enjoy it.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2004-06-30

Cudahy's books. &quot;The Malbone Street Wreck&quot; was a sobering look at the disaster that befell the subway line in 1918. And last year's &quot;A Century of Subways: Celebrating 100 Years of New York's Underground Railways&quot; was just the opposite: it was a joyful, admiring look at the making of the subway system in New York, and tracked its progress through the 20th century. <br />I eagerly picked up this reprint of his 1975 book &quot;Rails Under the Mighty Hudson: The Story of the Hudson Tubes, the Pennsy Tunnels and Manhattan Transfer&quot; and was not disappointed. Briefly, this book describes the historical need for these tubes, the technological requirements, the difficulties in construction, and the dramatic effects they had upon completion. Villains and heroes abound, as they will in any tale of expensive public works, but they are relegated to a second-tier, as Cudahy's obvious admiration for this effort takes precedence. Comparisons to the Erie Canal are not far-fetched when describing the success of these tubes, and it is not far-fetched to say that only Brian Cudahy's passion for his subject makes this book one of the greatest about railroads, in general. The smattering of gorgeous photographs are gravy!	2004-06-29

Perhaps this haphazard beginning is what gave the area its combined refined yet anarchic flavor that exists until this day. <br />Luther Harris' book, &quot;Around Washington Square: An Illustrated History of Greenwich Village&quot; is an excellent introduction to the history, myths, lies, and unknown truths about this magnet for the students, the homeless, the artists, and the real estate agents who each value Greenwich Village for their own reasons. The text is very informative, and the illustrations are lush and generous. Broken down into easy-to-handle sections, Harris nonetheless is comprehensive. (He apologies to his readers if any particular individual, group, or building was omitted but he needn't have: just about all the bases were covered.) This is an exhaustive and wonderful book.	2004-06-29

This is not a long journey in length, but it evokes decades upon decades upon centuries of the history of New York.<br />What Lopate has evoked, at the same time, is an awareness that somewhere in our development, we have lost touch with the fact that Manhattan is an island, and that our formidable legacy was derived from the fact that, for centuries, we were a powerful port city. Goods and immigrants arrived to our shores by ship well into the 20th century. And then, for several reasons and not all of them good ones, we began to shun the river, the tidal strait (East River), and our harbor.<br />For the most part though, Lopate delights in seeing the city the way our forebears saw it. And then, sometimes, the effect is enormously sad: specifically, his journey to North Brother Island, the site where the General Slocum burned and partially sank, where so many bodies washed ashore as others died in the island's hospital. This section is eerily poignant and, to me, the best written. Lopate and his companions did not escape North Brother unscathed, physically and emotionally. And I doubt most readers will put down WATERFRONT without feeling unchanged. This is a wonderful book for New Yorkers and/or history fans.	2004-06-29

A FLASH OF GREEN is the precursor to the Travis McGee books, but MacDonald's gift for characters was already shining. Newspaperman Jimmy Wing, on the trail of a story which may ruin a small Florida ecosystem for development (what else is new?) decides to stick around for the ride, to see who's doing what. Chief among the perpetrators is Elmo Bliss--what a great name! And what a great character! I had just as much fun watching him than I did the narrator. Strangely, I felt I knew more about what made him tick, as opposed to Jimmy. (Then again Jimmy is terribly stand-offish). As the plot unwound, I felt that the pacing did, too. But what held this together, as I said, is the characters, and that's a big plus in my book!	2004-06-29

I had only been to the station once or twice but I was too young to remember. I didn't really understand the big fuss about its destruction. And after it was gone, I don't remember there being too much grieving. <br />Now looking back, through films and books, I understand what it was all about. &quot;The Late, Great Pennsylvania Station&quot; by Lorraine B. Diehl is the best book on the subject that I've come across. Her analysis of the rise and fall of McKim's great station is both awe-inspiring and heart-breaking. The smattering of beautiful photographs is a plus, as well. Penn Station's demise, of course, could be regarded solely as a loss for the city but, as Ms. Diehl explains, the real legacy of the destruction was the enormous preservation/conservation movement that followed. In the aftermath, so many other buildings were spared a similar fate. <br />There are those who say that the people behind Penn Station's demolition were justified (Ms. Diehl rightly avoids villifying anyone). The apologists for the destruction claim that Penn Station was too big, in the wrong place, and was in the red. The Empire State Building was erected ten blocks south of the midtown business area and three miles north of the Wall Street district. It was a very big building and rarely had over 50% occupancy until the 1950s, when it finally began earning money. Should it have been knocked down too?	2004-06-27

The reader was given a barrage of facts and statistics, as well as photographs and ethnic break-downs of each of the immigrant groups. <br />While THE BATTLE WITH THE SLUM also includes photographs and statistics, it also reports on HOW these conditions have to be handled, and details the victories Riis and the reformers achieved in ridding the area of its more notorious elements. In almost militaristic fashion, Riis and the reformers battled corrupt local political machines (read Tammany Hall), interested businesses, and greedy landlords. Each neighborhood is practically mapped out like a battlefield. While HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES gives the reader an appreciation for the suffering that the poor, BATTLE WITH THE SLUM gives the reader an appreciation for Jacob Riis and what others like him have done.	2004-06-27

When I first read it, some 10 years ago, I was stunned by not only the story but by the voice of the narrator. Now that I've just re-read it, I found the story more terrifying and harrowing. I imagine that it's twice as frightening for a woman. But as it seems to me that some of our Constitutional rights are quickly being challenged (whether justified or not) there is a new, palpable fear that resonates in the pages of THE HANDMAID'S TALE that wasn't there in the early 90's.<br />I'll get off my soapbox now.<br />THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a gripping and compelling novel of a nation out of control, and of male-dominance. While it is set in the not-too-distant-future, the feel is reminiscent of Nazi workcamps, as the female characters are subject to brainwashing, imprisonment, and sexual predation. No one I know who has read the book, even those of my friends on the far right, felt this to be heavy-handed or didactic. And no one I know who has read the book, put it down without reflecting deeply on our sexual/social relations. THE HANDMAID'S TALE is an impossibly brilliant book.	2004-06-26

This novel is a warped combination of a twisted love story, quirky science fiction, and a murder mystery waiting to happen. In other words, it's a sheer joy. <br />Amis has always had a knack for assembling the most uncharacteristic characters, winding them up, and letting them run amok. In this case, we watch the oversexed but suicidal Nicola Six waggle her charms before the all to accepting attentions of the hoidy-toidy Guy Clinch and the dart-throwing, bigoted, wrong side of any track, Keith Talent. However, Nicola's motives are not what they expect: she is manipulating them to commit a murder, on herself. But, as always, there are complications and twists along the way, and Amis keeps you hanging on for dear life along the ride. LONDON FIELDS is a marvelous example of a writer who has mastered his craft, and I recommend it highly.	2004-06-22

THE QUIET AMERICAN is among the best of Greene's works because it utilizes this strategem the most fully.<br />Set in Viet Nam in the mid-1950s, the atmosphere is one of confusion and forboding. The French invasionary forces in the country are suffering sorely because of native resistance, and things in general seem to be teetering on the verge of explosion. Englishman Thomas Fowler, enjoying his opium-induced haze, is a tough-as-nails but aloof war correspondent observing the chaos. His native-born and beatiful mistress, Phuong, is obviously caught up in the activity. Both are awaiting the arrival of the American, Alden Pyle. When he arrives, several fuses, some quite literally, are lit.<br />Pyle brings with him a kind of ingenuous patriotism for the U.S.A. and part of his mission is to spread the good news about democracy. Along the way, he falls in love with Phuong and, more importantly, he falls deeper into the quicksand of Vietnamese policy and belligerence. As other reviewers have commented, it is quite amazing that Graham Greene wrote this novel in the mid-1950s because he prophesized, in a way, the depths to which America's involvement in Viet Nam would be pulled for the next twenty years. <br />But THE QUIET AMERICAN is not an allegory about European/American entanglements in southeast Asia (although some of that is decidedly there). It is a story about real characters trapped in a milieu that is about to explode. And that makes THE QUIET AMERICAN a gripping, suspenseful novel and is one of Greene's masterpieces.	2004-06-22

Dere has been a lot written about the Noo Yawk accent, but Professon Irving Allen's \\"The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech\\" is one of the first that I know to tackle the individual phrases and words that emerged from Gotham.<br />Naturally, a combination of factors contributed to the genesis of slang in New York, a slang which would spread across the nation. First, because New York has always been such a dynamic city, constantly in change, constantly experimenting, new ideas have always occurred here first and faster. Logically, New Yorkers would create the informal vocabulary accompanying these innovations. Second, because the city was so welcoming of immigrants, the words they brought over, and the words that reflected their cultures, were the natural offspring. Professor Allen touches upon these and other factors but I don't want you to think the book is as dry as I'm making it sound. To the native New Yorker or to anyone outside, \\"The City in Slang: New York Life and Popular Speech\\" is a light-hearted, enjoyable catalog of all those terms and their unique (and sometimes surprising) origins. Why is a police van called a \\"paddy wagon\\"? Find out how the word \\"mooch\\" came about. Discover the real origin of the term \\"rubbernecker\\"--it's not what you think! This is a thoroughly witty and informative book--with several illustrations--that will have you thinking in slang before you know it!	2004-06-18

When was Livingston founded? What prompted its growth? What differentiates it from the surrounding towns? So much of this information is left out. You don't even find out which of the famous colonial Livingstons the place was named after until 2/3rds the way through the book! The second-half of the 20th century section looks like a combination of people's photo albums. Why photos of the police chief or head librarian? I'm not saying they weren't important people but why are they spotligthed over others?<br />Having said all that, there are some photos that illustrate the historic elements--the few existing--that make one realize how far back the place goes. One can seek out those structures that have endured time. But even then, there is no context to put them in. I suspect that residents of the place might find the book interesting, but not many others.	2004-06-18

But what an impression! Set in various parts of Manhattan and  my home town of Brooklyn, I was in awe of this writer's command of his craft and his knowledge of the city. I figured he's spent decades honing his talents. When I arrived at the workshop, I discovered that Bell was NOT from New York City and that he was younger than me. Naturally, I wanted to strangle him.<br />Anyway, THE YEAR OF SILENCE is a wise and sympathetic novel that prompted as many re-readings as there are narrators. Every voice is honest (even the con artist/breaking-and-entering specialist) and, above all, appealing in their own ways. Structurally, the multiple points of view is very effective, especially when you consider the book is set in the city where a person can touch so many lives (and is set in the city where everyone thinks their point of view is so important). However, the fact is that the death of the protagonist, Marian, did affect so many people who, on the surface, seem so disaffected. Marian, herself, is given a chance to speak before her untimely passing. In its way, the novel is a sort of AS I LAY DYING set in 1980s New York City.<br />The strength of THE YEAR OF SILENCE, and I'll repeat this, is the profound appeal, the extreme humanity, of its narrators. I almost wish each one had his or her own novel. My favorite is an invalided old woman whose grandson races her through the NYU area in her wheelchair. Although she had only known Marian in passing, the news of her death prompts one of the most elegant but simple reveries on life, death and old age. THE YEAR OF SILENCE captures New Yorkers in a way that has rarely been done before. Of course, it was written by an out-of-towner.	2004-06-16

Then a friend of mine told me about this book, &quot;To the Moon!: The Honeymooners Book of Trivia&quot; and discovered I was I mistaken about my expertise. <br />John Katsigeorgis has compiled a great list/quiz of Honeymooners trivia and created a thoroughly enjoyable book that any Kramdenophile will LOVE! The questions range from the obvious to the &quot;I should have known!&quot; to the real tough.

Doctorow's THE WATERWORKS is likely to draw comparisons to Caleb Carr's THE ALIENIST. That would be comparing apples to oranges. Carr's 19th Century novels are wonderfully plot-driven with somewhat rounded characters. Doctorow's mystery is more cerebral: to me the solution was less interesting than how the characters got to it. I'm not going to re-hash the plot; there are several other reviewers who have already done so. What I think needs to be addressed is Doctorow's uncanny ability, no matter which of his historical novels you read, to keep late 20th century values out of the minds and mouths of his characters. This is a temptation that's tough to resist, but Doctorow pulls it off every time, and especially here. Considering the narrator is a 19th Century writer (journalist actually), 20th Century Doctorow must have used supreme discipline to ring true to the era. A great virtuouso performance.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2004-06-10

And a lot of the information just touches the surface of some of the historic moments; too many of the reasons for the events that created the history, and their ramifications for the rest of America, are glossed over. That said, this timeline is still of value (especially for the price). It does contain a lot of information, given its size. In that regard, I would recommend this to those who are just starting their voyage to the City's history. I also think that people from out of town would appreciate this compact publication, especially if their planning a trip to the Big Smear.	2004-06-09

BROOKLYN THEN AND NOW is a reminder that Manhattan is not the only place that underwent enormous changes over the last century and a half. Capturing Brooklyn in recent photos and juxtaposing them with shots of the same area 50, 75, 100 or 125 earlier, dramatizes the growth that Brooklyn (the fourth largest city in America before the 1898 consolidation) experienced. It's too bad that you can't &quot;take a look inside&quot; this book on this website, but take my word for it, it's jammed with great photos!	2004-06-09

He's not concerned with whether or not Oswald acted alone, or if he acted at all. In his eye-opening book, &quot;American Grotesque: An Account of the Clay Shaw-Jim Garrison Affair in the City of New Orleans&quot;, Kirkwood is a court room witness of the case against Clay Shaw. In the process, he interviews several key players, including Clay Shaw, Jim Garrison, Perry Russo, and Judge Haggerty. The result is quite the opposite of the case as presented in Stone's film &quot;JFK&quot; or Garrison's book, &quot;On the Trail of the Assassins&quot;. In Kirkwood's book, the case against Shaw is nothing less than a shame and a shameless persecution of an innocent man. Kirkwood doesn't pretend to hide his allegience to Shaw, but he allows the reader to draw his/her own conclusion. Fortunately, the outrage and sadness he feels about the case is hedged with a lot of humor and good old fashioned sarcasm. His parenthetical comments are brilliant! <br />Unfortunately, this book is out of print. However, try to pick up a used copy here, while they are still available.	2004-06-08

His joys and excitement, his pains and despair, are eloquent and sincere. This wonderful collection has all the best poems from LEAVES OF GRASS, which Whitman had written, edited, and rewritten for over 40 years. The great poems, at least to me, are: &quot;Walt Whitman (Song of Myself)&quot;, &quot;Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking&quot;, &quot;O Captain, My Captain&quot;, and &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry.&quot; These and dozens others are available in this fine collection. For readers new to Walt Whitman, this is an ideal place to start.	2004-06-06

It's easy for me to select which poems to discuss. The hard part is HOW to teach them to a group of students who might struggle with Whitman's language and form. Donald Kummings' &quot;Approaches to Teaching Whitman's Leaves of Grass&quot; is a valuable tool in fixing this problem. The book begins with some general approaches to Whitman, including some required and recommended readings. After that, however, come a collection of essays by scholars who have struggled with the same issue of teaching Whitman. The writers range from Kenneth Price to Susan Day Dean. Each essay is brilliant, each approach is easy to use. I have notes squeezed into the margins of each essay, and I consult them each time I teach LEAVES OF GRASS. I am extremely grateful to Mr. Kummings' effort!<br />Rocco Dormarunno<BR>College of New Rochelle	2004-06-06

There is no doubting that James Joyce was one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. His contribution to modern literature is still being felt 60 years after his death. And, yet, his letters, which are as close as we will ever get to knowing what he was thinking while composing his great works, are no longer available in print? <br />Thank God I purchased this book years ago! Richard Ellmann had done a tremendous job of sorting and compiling Joyce's letters in a way that shows us Joyce's thinking as he put together \\"Dubliners\\", \\"Exiles\\", \\"Stephen Hero\\", \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\", \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Finnegan's Wake\\". While some (back when the book first came out) questioned the extremely private/sexual communications that Ellmann included, no one doubted the importance of all the other selected letters. This is a remarkable look into the mind of a great writer, and I hope some publisher will pick it up and reprint it. In the meanwhile, try to get a used copy through Amazon.	2004-06-06

At least, the tone and writing kind of held together, even if all the arguments didn't. This second installment shows just how much Livingstone needed Groden's skills. The tone here is at times shrill, at other times non-chalant. The arguments do not flow; they announce themselves and then go away. I don't know how much Groden was involved in the editing of the first book, but this book is screaming for an editor, a proofreader, and someone to check some of Livingstone's &quot;facts&quot;.<br />High Treason 2 basically covers the same ground as other conspiracy books, including High Treason One. There is absolutely nothing new here. Let me repeat that: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW HERE. The only surprises you might find are some vague comments (what the Warren Report would call &quot;Rumors and Innuendoes&quot;) that seem to suggest things, and then are quickly dropped once the feeble evidence crumbles. There was a conspiracy to kill JFK. This book will not help anyone solve it.	2004-06-06

The first story, as the subtitle indicates, has to do with the Navy's recruitment of the Luciano crime family to protect New York's waterfront (including the Brooklyn Navy Yard) from Nazi saboteurs and u-boats. After all, the government reasoned, who is better qualified to protect the docks than the people who have controlled them for decades? This was, as Campbell points out, very pragmatic. However, from a moral and legal view, this was extremely problemmatic. <br />The second history, however, is an ironic one, so ironic it nearly makes one laugh. Once the Navy paid Luciano and the mob all that cash to protect the docks, one thing was never established: Did the Mafia do its job? In other words, who regulated the Mafia? To whom did the wise-guys submit their progress reports? How many spies and saboteurs did the Mafia catch, if any? Or did they just take the money and run, and hope for the best? Did they even hope for the best? As far as the mob was the concerned, if the docks blew up, so what? What would the government do about it? Sue them for breach of contract? What contract? You get the idea.<br />Much like Christopher Simpson's \\"Blowback\\" which explores the government's protection of Nazis after the war, in order to exploit their intelligence against the Communists, Campbell's \\"Luciano Project\\" is an examination of that old saying \\"All's fair in love and war.\\" But at what cost? Is it justifiable to hire and protect killers (Nazis and Mafiosi did kill people, after all) in order to protect National Security? Is it justifiable to keep such things secret from the public? It's something for every American to think about, especially given what's going on in our post-9/11 country.	2004-06-06

I was just as impressed with this marvelous text, &quot;Saratoga: Turning Point of America's Revolutionary War&quot;. I think that Richard Ketchum has become as important to recounting the critical events of the Revolutionary War as John Keenan has been with World Wars I and II. What impresses me most is his persuasive argument. Any pivotal moment during the Revolution could have been termed a &quot;turning point&quot;. But after conveying the details of the battle, the struggles of the terrain and weather, the torturous communications, the events that led to the battle and those that came later, I cannot argue against his case. <br />Like most historians, Ketchum has that ability to bring the moments back to life, to convery that sense of urgency of the event: and he does it by using primary sources as well as his own research. But beyond that, he uses the language in a way that is easily understandable without talking down to the reader. I wish that could be said of other historians! Pick up this book.	2004-06-04

Hamilton tried to model himself after so many other political thinkers and theorists, and a case could be made that some of his policies and initiatives were anti-Machiavellian. But that's my only gripe, and it's not a major one. John Harper's &quot;American Machiavelli : Alexander Hamilton and the Origins of U.S. Foreign Policy&quot; is a brilliant examination of a facet of Hamilton's career that hasn't been spotlighted. Most biographies of Hamilton and/or the Founders tend to focus mainly on Hamilton's economic prowess and his dedication to a commercial American society versus the more Jeffersonian agrarian society. <br />But Hamilton kept an astute eye on the goings-on in Europe, like the need to trade with Great Britain and the growing horrors of the revolution in France. In one regard, the need to trade with Great Britain was an outgrowth of his economic concerns but, more importantly, to maintain a commercial link with it nearly guaranteed peace with a nation that had so huge a navy. Harper goes to great lengths to emphasize Hamilton's frustration with John Adams' foreign policy. Because of his alleged &quot;monarchist&quot; sympathies, Hamilton was essentially dismissed by the Republicans. He warned that the failure to maintain friendly ties with Great Britain might lead to future tensions. Unfortunately, Hamilton was right and in 1812... well, we know what happened. Fortunately, Hamilton didn't live to see his dark prophecy fulfilled.<br />In any event, Professor Harper's study is worth reading for students of American history and people interested in the tangled world of international policy.	2004-06-04

Edward O'Donnell's SHIP ABLAZE serves as a stinging reminder of not only a catastrophe of enormous proportions but of a deliberate and unjust society determined to forget it. While the tragic event of June 15, 1904, in which over 1,000 mostly German-Americans perished, is the star of the book, Mr. O'Donnell's outrage at the people responsible for it and the court system that allowed all but one of the culpable to go free is palpable. <BR>There is no point in my retelling the sad story; anyway, I couldn't begin to approach Mr. O'Donnell's engaging and gripping style. But the compelling questions that emerge from the pages deserve consideration. How could human beings who are responsible for the lives and safety of other human beings behave so indifferently to their jobs? A more pressing question: are things any better today? <br />At the root of this book, however, is the inevitable question: Why don't more people--especially New Yorkers--know about this cataclysmic event that happened in the East River? Mr. O'Donnell offers a few convincing reasons:<BR>1) the pervading sexism and xenophobia of the times had only so much sympathy for the over 1,000 deaths of mostly female foreigners;<BR>2) unlike the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, there was no overtly political or socio-economic connection to the disaster;<BR>3) the First World War wiped out any sympathy for anything German; and<BR>4) unlike the glamour, wealth, and fame surrounding the victims of the Titanic, the Slocum victims were poor working class hacks (I believe it is also for this reason that the deaths of almost 100 commuters in the Malbone Street subway wreck of 1918 is all but forgotten too).<br />All things considered, SHIP ABLAZE is a sad book, but not morbid. The accounts of the several ways the victims died (burns, smoke inhalation, trampling, suffocation, crushing, drowning, etc.) in that harrowing hour or so isoffset by the many accounts of heroism and selflessness. And now, with the release of this brilliant book, plus several upcoming memorials to mark the 100th anniversary of this calamity, the world will now be reminded of a day that never should have been forgotten.<br />Rocco Dormarunno,<BR>author of The Five Points	2004-06-03

As a novelist, his reputation has been well-established, fortunately. This collection, which incorporates &quot;Twenty-One Stories&quot;, &quot;A Sense of Reality&quot;, and &quot;May We Borrow Your Husband&quot; is a fine sampler of Greene's abilities in the shorter genre. Many of the elements that feature so prominently in his novels also figure in these stories: the spontaneity of violence; ruthless polictics; looming secrets; greed; and the complex situations that life drops on you.<br />Here are some brief looks at my favorite stories:<br />&quot;The Destructors&quot; is Greene's examination of horrific, calculated vandalism in the extreme, made even more horrifying by the coolness with which it is carried out.<br />An event in a man's past comes back to haunt him in &quot;The Blue Film&quot;. Strangely, the haunting specter doesn't frighten him so much as saddens him.<br />&quot;The End of the Party&quot; is a harrowing tale of identical twins playing hide and seek at a party. The ending paragraph left goosebumps on my skin for days. <br />Other stories, such as &quot;A Shocking Accident&quot; and &quot;May We Borrow Your Husband&quot; are superb examples of this great story teller's talents.<br />For those who have never read Graham Greene, &quot;Collected Short Stories&quot; ought to be your starting point.	2004-06-03

It's a shame that Christopher Simpson's \\"Blowback: America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Effects on the Cold War\\" has gone out of print. While portions of this book smack of revisionist history, the truth at the heart of it is nothing short of harrowing and infuriating. Most significantly, it's an important part of post-War American history that needs further discussion: the carte blanche treatment given to some of the Nazi party's worst war criminals in exchange for dubious (at best) information on the Russians. <br />According to Simpson's exhaustive research, brutal mass murderers whose technical and/or espionage value saved them from the Nuremburg trials, were given new lives, lots of money, and immunity in America in order to aid in our fight against the communists. While it seems that some of the information they gave us tilted the Cold War in our favor, the fact remains that these men had the blood of countless concentration camp victims on their hands. The photos of the death camps, including a poignant photograph of four generations of Jewish women in their underwear, moments before their execution, underscores Simpson's outrage at the cheapness America placed on their lives.<br />Lastly, I would point out that the subtitle is slightly misleading. While Simpson does discuss the effects these informants had on the Cold War, the subtext really has to do with the effects they had on American society. And it's not a pretty picture. I hope this book is brought back in print. Until then, picked up one of the used copies available here.	2004-06-03

The marvelous opening passage describes the longings of Hamilton's widow, Elizabeth, for her husband who had died nearly 50 years previously. This romantic image sets the tone for this brilliant book, as it explores the heart as well as the mind of Alexander Hamilton.<br />For those who do not know, Hamilton was not merely a capitalist and economist who happened to die in a duel with Aaron Burr. True, he was the founder of The Bank of New York and was America's first Secretary of the Treasury. But Hamilton was also a tireless abolitionist, a brilliant lawyer and writer, General Washington's right-hand-man, a war hero, founder of the New York Post, and a swash-buckling romantic. Taken on their own, these achievements are amazing enough, but given the enormous obstacles and tragedies he had to overcome during his youth, it's just mindboggling. To take it a step further, he accomplished all this in just 49 years, which was his age at the time of his death.<br />A life as full, as dramatic, as IMPORTANT as Alexander Hamilton's deserves volumes. Ron Chernow's extensive biography is a long book but, even so, the amazing life he is describing requires such length. And, to Chernow's credit, the book achieves just the right balance of admiration and criticism, romanticism and realism, speculation and fact. Hamilton's life swung between often contradictory ideas and emotions, and Chernow presents them all to us, rather than sticking with one overriding image. ALEXANDER HAMILTON by Ron Chernow is perhaps the most important book written about the nascent years of our country since Ellis' FOUNDING BROTHERS, which would make an excellent companion to this book. I would also strongly recommend McCullough's JOHN ADAMS, as well.	2004-06-03

Crime was rampant, every union went on strike every other week, and the threat of fiscal calamity was ever present. At its darkest moment, when &quot;Ford to New York: Drop Dead&quot; hit the headline, something astonishing exploded from NBC studios: Saturday Night Live. Somehow this one show made urban life a little more bearable, and a television legacy was born. And, somehow, New York had saved itself.<br />Authors James Miller and Tom Shales collected nearly thirty years worth of quotes and interviews, and amassed them in this terrific book, &quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests&quot;. For a hefty volume (over 600 pages), the book is a very quick read. While a good deal of time is spent honoring the deceased cast members, the tone never gets maudlin nor nostalgic. In fact, it was refreshing to remember some of Belushi's, Radner's, and Hartman's antics. Not surprising, drugs and ego clashes abounded. Talent + money + 1970s = celebrities on controlled substances, after all. What was interesting were the comments by the guests. Buck Henry has a great story, but I won't give it away here. &quot;Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests&quot; is a fascinating look at one of the bright moments in an otherwise dark milieu.	2004-06-02

Millions upon millions, mostly from Russia and southern and eastern Europe hoped to make a new beginning in the only country that held out that hope: America. And millions of them entered the United States through Ellis Island. There have been hundreds of books on this subject but few very recount the exact words of those who experienced this exodus. &quot;Island of Hope, Island of Tears&quot;<BR>by David M. Brownstone is one of the few to use these primary resources. Much of the material has been seen before, scattered across the pages of other books about the great immigration experience, but I can't think of any one book that put all of it together in one place. <br />Part of what's unique about this book is its candor in revealing how many immigrants were mortally disappointed by the promise of America which never materialized. Another distinguishing feature is the presentation of just about every reason that these people fled their homes and what they expected to find here. Their responses are just as varied as the numbers of small towns from which they'd left. Lastly, of course, is the lucid descriptions of what these people endured during their voyages and the frightful experience and suspense that awaited them at Ellis Island, that old munitions dump by the Statue of Liberty. <br />This is an endearing while also harsh look at an episode in American--and world--history that will doubtfully ever happen again.	2004-06-01

On the surface, it appears that it would make a great story for a film. But this hasn't happened. (I believe there was an attempt to make a film of this, but it was a miserable flop.) Perhaps part of the reason is that the narrative is written with such realism, and is often so cinematic, that it would be redundant. Fortunately, we don't need a visual interpretation. BRIGHTON ROCK casts a cold eye on a low-level urban scene, as gritty as Mean Streets. Much, even too much, is made of the good/evil &quot;Catholicism&quot; of the story. The fact is that Pinkie is simply an evil man. Calculating, cowardly, and over-his-head, he is morally drowing and is pulling down those closest to him. If you've read Greene's short story, &quot;The Destructors&quot;, Pinkie would have easily fit in with that crew. <br />On all levels this is one of Greene's best, if not always appreciated, novels: character development, plot, pacing... nothing is left to be desired.	2004-05-27

With the exception of Central Park, Manhattan has no concern for nature. (Even Central Park is artificial! It looks nothing like the Manhattan that was there pre-1700.) For New Yorkers, the book makes it obvious that you don't have to travel miles away to visit pristine forest! And you don't have to go to Boston or Colonial Williamsburg to see some of the oldest structures in America. It's all here on Staten Island.	2004-05-20

It makes so much sense: just look at some of the background art in this collection and you can see it. (Actually, look at the background cover art, and it looks like Japanese watercolor.) Whatever his pursuits today, Watterson has left us a decade's worth of joy. This collection is just one of several. It doesn't really matter which one you pick up: you will always be guaranteed a few hours' worth of laughter and even a couple of warm tears.	2004-05-20

(In fact, when you read his essays and notebooks, he's probably a critic second and an existentialist an even more distant third.)<br />Set in Oran, the efficient pestilence that is wiping out the population forces the characters to examine their pasts and their present lives. And Camus does a fascinating job of making these characters both real and sympathetic. The novel is also full of stunning images: the frothing rats, the old man brushing his cat while Death looms all around, etc. No, there is not much action in this book but the suspense is nonetheless palpable as you wonder who will be next to succumb.<br />Camus has too often been lumped together with Jean Paul Sartre, and I think this is erroneous. Camus had a belief in the human spirit. While there may be a &quot;benign indifference of the sky&quot; (The Stranger) over all of us, he is not indifferent to what happens in our hearts and minds, and this is what gives human life its worth.	2004-05-20

As a novelist, his reputation has been well-established, fortunately. This collection, &quot;Twenty-One Stories&quot; is a fine sampler of Greene's abilities in the shorter genre. Many of the elements that feature so prominently in his novels also figure in these stories: the spontaneity of violence; ruthless polictics; looming secrets; greed; and the complex situations that life drops on you.<br />Here are some brief looks at my favorite stories:<br />&quot;The Destructors&quot; is Greene's examination of horrific, calculated vandalism in the extreme, made even more horrifying by the coolness with which it is carried out.<br />An event in a man's past comes back to haunt him in &quot;The Blue Film&quot;. Strangely, the haunting specter doesn't frighten him so much as saddens him.<br />Purely-plot driven, &quot;The Case for the Defence&quot; is still a brilliant tale worthy of an Alfred Hitchcock Presents.<br />&quot;Brother&quot; explores the nature of political allegiances and the risks of making them known.<br />Lastly, &quot;The End of the Party&quot; is a harrowing tale of identical twins playing hide and seek at a party. The ending paragraph left goosebumps on my skin for days. <br />For those who have never read Graham Greene, &quot;Twenty-One Stories&quot; ought to be your starting point.	2004-05-19

His short stories are very short, and some of his novels tread the fine line between novel and novella. But what he puts into those brief pages are stunning, and definitely leaves you yearning for more.<br />THE TENTH MAN is probably the one that best exemplifies this feeling. The novel ended so quickly (for me) that I was angry it was over. Not because I felt cheated, but because he had me so taken in by the plot and the tensions created by the choices the characters made, that I wanted it to go on, even just a little longer. But by all means, pick up THE TENTH MAN and just about anything else by Graham Greene.	2004-05-19

But to acknowledge his popularity on this basis alone is very wrong-minded. &quot;The Napoleon of New York: Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia&quot; by H. Paul Jeffers, while not an extensive, exhaustive biography, goes to great pains to make us understand why the Little Flower has achieved mythic proportions in New York's and America's history books. His remarkable achievements, his pit-bull tenacity, and his Herculean ability to face down the pugnancious Robert Moses, all exhibit LaGuardia's unlimited energy, and his all-encompassing love for his city. <br />Coming to City Hall during a record-setting unemployment level and disastrous budgets, LaGuardia faced seemingly insurmountable difficulties the minute he sat behind his desk. As Jeffers rightly demonstrates, this diminutive man would not be daunted or intimidated by any group, government agency, or persons of power when prosecuting his agenda. He personally was responsible for funnelling tons of federal money to the city during the Great Depression. He created jobs on one hand, while eliminating the patronage positions held by the hated Tammany machine. No small task. This is but one example that this book explores. There are dozens of others. Pick up &quot;The Napoleon of New York: Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia&quot; and learn more about this truly amazing New Yorker.	2004-05-16

Author Kirkpatrick Sale has done a marvelous job, in &quot;The Fire of His Genius: Robert Fulton and the American Dream&quot;, of capturing the brilliance and the importance of Fulton's vision. Robert Fulton did not invent the steamboat but he did know how to perfect and sell it. This young man led an incredibly full and active life, considering how young he was when he died.<br />But &quot;The Fire of His Genius: Robert Fulton and the American Dream&quot; also differs from other works on Fulton because of the second half of the subtitle: Fulton's influence on America. Much has been made of the New York City that Fulton lived in, and how his work would be part of that city's transformation from a major city in America to an international cosmopolis. (The creation of the Erie Canal in 1820 would really propel that metamorphosis.) But Sale's book also looks beyond the borders of the East and North (or Hudson) Rivers. It takes a long hard look at the westward spreading nation that needed new forms of transportation and a new navy. How Fulton was inextricably wrapped in both concerns is a major component of this very readable book. It helps complete the picture of an era of American History--and of a great American like Robert Fulton--that sorely needed investigation. We are all indebted to Kirkpatrick Sale for this scholarly examination.	2004-05-16

You might want to petition to have every park and roadway that is named after him renamed! On the other hand Robert Caro makes the case for how and why Robert Moses was able to do what he did extremely understandable, and even, inevitable to a point. <br />In the early years, as Caro rightly points out, Robert Moses' vision helped the city out of its doldrums of the Great Depression. He offered hope and a future when the present seemed so doubtful. At what point did Moses shift from a true visionary to a ruthless, megalomaniacal autocrat? To a neighborhood-squashing tyrant without conscience? There is no one event or series of events to explain this change, and Caro wisely avoids claiming there is. That is not his concern, anyway. What Caro does map out are the paths of destruction that Moses gouged through the metropolitan area. The interviews and extended quotations are very revealing, almost chilling. Moses's sang froid about New Yorkers--and how he cultivated it for half a century--defies reason. Yet this book, &quot;The Power Broker&quot; is as close to an understanding of Robert Moses as we'll ever get.	2004-05-16

This book should be titled, &quot;Ghosts of WEST 42nd Street&quot; because it just about completely ignores 42nd Street east of 6th Avenue.<br />That said, Anthony Bianco's &quot;Ghosts of 42nd Street: A History of America's Most Infamous Block&quot; is a welcome departure from the spate of books about 42nd Street that seem to come out at a rate of one a month. Mr. Bianco's approach is all-encompassing, not just focusing on the crime or the theater, the squalor or the glamour. There is an encyclopedic amount of information here, as he spans the decades. And yet, the book is very compressed and easy to get through. Mr. Bianco's writing is very fluid.<br />The cast of characters is familiar, as are many of the anecdotes. However, there are plenty of tales that will surprise the reader, even one that is very familiar with the history of this piece of midtown real estate. Pick up a copy and you will enjoy.	2004-05-12

Others focus on its history and/or social and economic impact on the city. Many of them are quite good, most are not. However, Randy Kennedy's &quot;Subwayland: Adventures in the World Beneath New York&quot; is a welcome break from all that. Part anecdotal, part instructional, part historic, and part sheer joy, &quot;Subwayland&quot; offers a great deal more than statistics. What Kennedy has proven, in a way, is that the subway system isn't just a transportation option. The subway is a city under the city. Let me take it a step further, the subway is another New York City underneath New York City, complete with its own eccentrics, complexities, codes and rituals, dangers, and attractions.<br />I ride the subways at least 10 times a week, and have done so since I was a kid growing up in the 1960s. There are plenty of others like me in this regard. But &quot;Subwayland: Adventures in the World Beneath New York&quot; will surprise even the most ardent and experienced subway rider. Many times I found myself smiling in acknowledgement, and muttering, &quot;That's right! I never really noticed that before!&quot; There are many great moments like that in this book. I recommend it highly and it makes a great companion to Brian Cudahy's &quot;A Century of Subways&quot;.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of &quot;The Five Points&quot;	2004-05-12

Certainly the chaos surrounding the official break from England has been well-documented in recent books: Ellis' &quot;Founding Brothers&quot;, Chernow's &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; and McCullough's &quot;John Adams&quot; quickly come to mind. However, by focusing on New York's population of many religions and races, its diverse business needs, competing powerful families, wily politicians and volatile citizenry, Ketchum has truly captured the confusion, panic, and passions of the time and place.<br />In an interesting manuever, Ketchum details the workings and feelings of only two of the city's more influential families--the Delanceys and the Livingstons. However, the choice is is a shrewd one, as these clans had their fingers and voices in just about every event leading up to and during the Revolution. Also, these two groups represented the polar views on the break with Great Britain. The letters and diaries of other New Yorkers, prominent and otherwise, really complete the picture.<br />&quot;Divided Loyalties&quot; is a lengthy book, over 450 pages, but much to Ketchum's credit, the pacing is fairly brisk. The peppering of diary entries, letters, and newspaper accounts gives the reader true, first-hand accounts of the passions that swept through what was America's fastest growing city, in what was the newest nation on Earth.	2004-05-11

Instead, Jonathan Lethem's MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN turns out to be an intriguing, original and fascinating novel. Lethem is not afraid to take chances and his gamble paid off here. While I agree that the mystery itself is secondary to the character studies (and a drop disappointing), the resulting glimpses into the short-circuiting manners of a Tourettes' victim is a minor masterpiece in character study. In fact, the other realm described here, the motherless world of orphans, is equally brilliant and convincing. Give this book a read--I highly and hugely recommend it.	2004-05-07

The marvelous opening passage describes the longings of Hamilton's widow, Elizabeth, for her husband who had died nearly 50 years previously. This romantic image sets the tone for this brilliant book, as it explores the heart as well as the mind of Alexander Hamilton.<br />For those who do not know, Hamilton was not merely a capitalist and economist who happened to die in a duel with Aaron Burr. True, he was the founder of The Bank of New York and was America's first Secretary of the Treasury. But Hamilton was also a tireless abolitionist, a brilliant lawyer and writer, General Washington's right-hand-man, a war hero, founder of the New York Post, and a swash-buckling romantic. Taken on their own, these achievements are amazing enough, but given the enormous obstacles and tragedies he had to overcome during his youth, it's just mindboggling. To take it a step further, he accomplished all this in just 49 years, which was his age at the time of his death.<br />A life as full, as dramatic, as IMPORTANT as Alexander Hamilton's deserves volumes. Ron Chernow's extensive biography is a long book but, even so, the amazing life he is describing requires such length. And, to Chernow's credit, the book achieves just the right balance of admiration and criticism, romanticism and realism, speculation and fact. Hamilton's life swung between often contradictory ideas and emotions, and Chernow presents them all to us, rather than sticking with one overriding image. ALEXANDER HAMILTON by Ron Chernow is perhaps the most important book written about the nascent years of our country since Ellis' FOUNDING BROTHERS, which would make an excellent companion to this book. I would also strongly recommend McCullough's JOHN ADAMS, as well.	2004-05-05

In most biographies, this usually translates into a deification of the subject. Not so in Joseph J. Ellis' AMERICAN SPHINX: THE CHARACTER OF THOMAS JEFFERSON.<br />I'll confess that Jefferson has not always been one of my favorite founding fathers. I have always thought of him as duplicitous, racist, anachronistic in his thinking, vain, and cowardly in a way. As a New Yorker, I've always been irked by his bad-mouthing of the city, and by his insistence that the capitol of the new nation be moved from here to Washington, D.C. [Good riddance, by the way. We did just fine without being the capitol city, thank you very much ;-) ] And as I am a devout admirer of Alexander Hamilton... need I say more?<br />After reading Ellis' other great book, FOUNDING BROTHERS, I began to get a more rounded look at Jefferson, one that shed a little more light on the human forces that may have been working on him. Then I read McCullough's brilliant biography of Jefferson's close friend (at times), John Adams. This led me to read this biography, and I am glad I did. I finally was given a better understanding of the sage of Monticello. Ellis does an admirable job of conveying an honest and balanced view of the chief author of the Declaration of Independence, without resorting to hero-worship, as do most biographers. At times, the writing was very moving, especially as Jefferson's loved ones began dying around him. I'm still not crazy about the guy, but I have a better appreciation of him. <br />Ellis' writing is brisk, loaded with telling anecdotes, and never attempts to impress the reader with the research he has done. Other biographers would do well to follow Joseph Ellis' example. And lovers of American History would do well to read this book.	2004-04-26

Scholarly without being dull, authoritative without being smug, Traub vividly portrays the rise, fall, and ambivalent revival of the world's center of amusement and advertising. I say &quot;ambivalent&quot; not because I disapprove of the transition which took place in the 1990s (anyone nostalgic for the &quot;personality&quot; of post 1960s Times Square is oblivious to the misery of the prostitutes and addicts who were stuck there) but because it smacks too much of outsiders moving in. But, as Mr. Traub suggests, we needed people from outside New York to believe that the place could be rehabilitated--we New Yorkers had given up on it after all.<br />All the familiar characters are here (Hammerstein, Runyon, et al.) and some new ones that we don't always associate with the former Longacre Square. And some of the events described in this book will surprise even the most &quot;seasoned&quot; of New York buffs. The book is as entertaining as the place once was and now strives to be.<br />&quot;The Devil's Playground&quot; is the perfect antidote to the many flawed books about Times Square--in particular the error-riddled &quot;Down 42nd&quot; by Marc Eliot. It is well worth the read.	2004-04-25

With the recent glut of books on the history of New York City (which, personally, I can't get enough of), it is refreshing to take a break and read about the history of the state's capitol, Albany--Beverwijck, as it was known way back when. In Janny Venema's &quot;Beverwijck: A Dutch Village on the American Frontier, 1652-1664&quot;, Albany's Dutch years are finally given their just due. Venema's extensive research is evident in just about every paragraph, and is conveyed in a way that most historians strive: fluidly, logically, and at a modest pace. This 500+ page book reads remarkably quickly, much to the author's credit. <br />Many of the issues and personalities that shaped the development of New Amsterdam are echoed here: skirmishes with the natives; desperate moments when it seemed the place would implode; the ubiquitous Peter Stuyvesant; struggles with vice, etc. But what I found surprising is Venema's theme that Beverwijck was just as tolerant of races, just as much a springboard of modern America's ethics as was New Amesterdam. The Brooklyn guy inside me bristled at first, but the evidence is overwhelming. <br />I hope others will pick up this study, as it provides an indispensible look at a time and place that has been unnecessarily overlooked.	2004-04-25

Edo McCullough's &quot;Good Old Coney Island: A Sentimental Journey into the Past: The Most Rambunctious, Scandalous, Rapscallion, Splendiferous, Pugnacious, Spectacular, Illustrious, Prodigious&quot; debunks that view in an educating and enjoyable style. <br />What McCullough makes more than clear is that this five-mile strip of beachfront is as rich in its history as Cape Cod, perhaps moreso. From the early Indian villages to the Dutch settlers to the developers who saw in it a gold mine (once mass transit made the place accessible), Coney Island is a place of a million and one stories and histories. It was a place, as McCullough describes, wherein everything went: recreation, vice, entertainment (high and low), graft and sports. It was The Five Points and Fifth Avenue on a beach. In this sense, it could have only grown in New York because it was so much like it. However, it did offer one thing; fresh seaside air. Funny as it may seem, when the place first became popular, most New Yorkers didn't know how to swim--where could they swim, after all? In the polluted East or Hudson Rivers? By the time the rides and attractions, Dreamland and Luna Park arrived, Coney Island already earned its superelative, surreal reputation for escapism.  <br />What I find interesting is McCullough's choice of the phrase &quot;A Sentimental Journey&quot; in the book's subtitle. Considering the book describes Coney Island warts and all, the sentimentality is often underplayed. And, finally, there is a nice sprinkling of illustrations throughout that helps to bring the now-faded playground of the masses back to life. Everyone will enjoy this book.<br />Rocco Dormarunno<BR>author of The Five Points	2004-04-25

Escher, and this slim volume perfectly expresses why that is so without resorting to pages upon pages of discussions on deconstruction, reality vs. illusion or image vs. icon, and all the other blah-blah-blah that you'll find in other collections. This collection just allows you to turn the pages and enjoy, which I did and you will too.	2004-04-25

Thoughtfully put together by the staff of the New York Times, A NATION CHALLENGED, is a poignant reminder of the events of 9/11/01, events that have been talked about so much that we have run out of words. Fortunately, the expression a picture is worth one thousand words holds true. Each photo speaks volumes from pity to horror, shock to acceptance, destruction to hope. <br />While the compilation is slanted to the devestation that occurred in lower Manhattan, I don't believe that it's disproportionate. What happened here, to us, the carnage and destruction, was on such a huge scale that it merits the extra coverage. Also, so many of the events were captured on film by cameramen, professional and amateur, that there is a vast resource of horrific images from which to choose. Given that, I actually believe that the Times showed remarkable restraint. By no means does this diminish the outrages and sorrows of Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. New York's collective heart breaks for them, too, and the images of those scenes are no less dumbfounding. <br />A NATION CHALLENGED is a professionally approached and executed photojournal. I only hope we'll never need this kind of book again.	2004-04-25

This, as Barnet Schecter's brilliant history, \\"The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution\\", is an undeserved slight to New York. As his perfect subtitle states, New York City was the pivotal center--the \\"heart\\"--of the Revolution.<br /><br />Too much had happened in New York to dismiss its role immediately before, during, and after the war. One example: the Battle of Golden Hill (at the present John Street) in which British troops attacked American patriots occurred more than a month before the Boston Massacre, which has been long regarded as the first skirmish between colonists and the Crown. Mr. Schecter appropriately emphasizes the Battle of Brooklyn (or the Battle of Long Island) and how Washington's strategic (and lucky) evacuation across the East River and through Manhattan turned the tide of the war: the war could've been over then and there had Washington's army been captured. There are more stories, there is more evidence of the critical role New York played during the nascent years of the United States, and, Mr. Schecter has wonderfully captured this undeniable fact.<br /><br />For a complete understanding of New York's role in this conflict, I recommend reading: \\"Divided Loyalties\\" by Richard Ketchum, which presents the political and social tensions of the city in the years before the Revolution; \\"The Battle of Brooklyn\\" by John Gallagher for a detailed examination of the weeks before, during and after this first large-scale confrontation between the British and Americans; and then Schecter's book--IN THAT ORDER. Each book picks up where the previous one had left off. There are other good books about New York's involvement in the Revolution, but these three can give you as close to a complete understanding of it aspossible.<br /><br />\\"The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution\\" is one of those books that fulfills a large gap in our complete understanding of that war and that era in history.<br />For that reason, Mr. Schecter is to be thanked for his contribution.	2004-04-23

There are some funny, some grim stories that are not so well known. Unlike most baseball books, this one doesn't bog the reader down with buckets of stats which are usually included so that the author can impress you. Kahn is on a different level. Keep this book alongside your copy of &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; for a complete view of New York's baseball dominance during this era.	2004-04-23

This could be THE SCARLET LETTER or MADAME BOVARY or WUTHERING HEIGHTS, but Humbert Humbert finds himself in the throes of an irrational passion that can get him in trouble all the same. Let's not kid ourselves, there is a statutory rape going on here, but there is a passion, too, that leads to murder.<br />Whatever the moral calculus may be, the point is that Nabokov uses this obsession as a springboard for a language of passion. The whole novel is a kind of excuse for Humbert Humbert to put his love into words. Even the way his adolescent's name is pronounced is cause for study and rapture. &quot;Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth.&quot; Humbert's linguistic tour de force is what makes his voice as distinctive as Holden Caulfield's or the unnamed protagonist in Ellison's INVISIBLE MAN or call him &quot;Ishmael&quot;. For that reason, among several others, Nabokov's LOLITA takes its place among the best novels of the 20th century and deserves to be read by all who enjoy writing at its most passionate.	2004-04-22

In no particular order:<br />a) the photos are unbelieveably crisp and the printing is of top-notch quality;<BR>b) don't ask me how, but Mr. Cameron makes the city look like a place where human beings actually live and work, rather than making the cityscape look like an architectural diorama;<BR>c) other boroughs are represented! New York is not just Manhattan, as so many other books would have you think.<br />The contrast of the modern skyline with the older photographs is very effective, as others have mentioned. But what is also appealing is the changes of the skyline between the time these photos were taken (ca. 1988) and today, as we New Yorkers would notice. The images of the World Trade Center are poignant, but I'm glad that the publishers did not update the book, in order to remove them. As time takes its healing course, we can look back fondly on those buildings--still with pain, but now with some acceptance. &quot;Above New York: A Collection of Historical and Original Aerial Photographs of New York City&quot; remains a glorious collection that has yet to be eclipsed in quality.<br />Rocco Dormarunno<BR>author of The Five Points	2004-04-20

However, Ralph Ellison pulls off the nearly impossible. Unlike other stories about the suppression/oppression of African-Americans which usually depict the protagonist as a victim of circumstance who is viewed as an enemy of the white people (read NATIVE SON), Ellison depicts the more real and punishing truth. That truth is that the African-American is hardly viewed at all by the white race. The African-American is unseen, his/her needs not addressed, his/her existence not acknowledged. This is a sentiment (if it can be called that) which is echoed in King's &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;.<br />Ellison's nameless and blameless protagonist isn't viewed as a person by anyone. He is seen as a source of entertainment, or a source of athleticism, or a case to be tended to... anything except a human being. Ellison's story is devestating, and yet not fatalistic. The protagonist's continuing sense of decency, self-assertion (in his own way) and humanity is not squelched, even at the end. The fact that he bothers to tell his story indicates a hope for an audience to his drama. Perhaps there is hope for all of us.	2004-04-19

But, frankly, this is a very enjoyable book, no matter how much of this narrative is tongue-in-cheek, and no matter how much he tries to repulse us. Personally, I enjoyed the earlier chapters much more than the later ones. The story of his early childhood rings more of the truth. He may be embellishing the hardship he endured, trying to make himself sound more like a Dickensian poorboy, but I don't think the embellishment is necessarily exaggeration. Growing up Irish where he grew up could not have been easy. Who would brag about such suffering? <br />The later chapters have a more defensive ring to them. Maybe he has a right to such a stance, if he is speaking is truth. But you never know with Mr. Lydon. And by this time, the whole story of the disintegration of the Pistols, and of Mr. Vicious, have entered into rock 'n' roll mythology/legend/hype. Nonetheless, this book reads so much differently than most rock autobiographies, biographies, and histories. First of all, there is no presence of a ghostwriter behind the scenes. This is John, no doubt, and his caustic wit. Also, there is no holier-than-thou or rockier-than-thou or druggier-than-thou tone. Lastly, he allows some other people to speak, although the quotes seem highly selective at times. In any event, he is not hogging the microphone; he's screaming at it, as usual, as he should. I would expect nothing less than that.	2004-04-15

Certainly, the immense financial institutions, the extravagant city lifestyle, and the old shipping and railroad dominance of the city come to mind when we think of New York City's amazing economic influence. But Professor Kessner also makes it clear that other New York trademarks would have been impossible without it: the parks and the Brooklyn Bridge; the philanthropic endeavors and museums (sparked by such men as John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan); even its consolidation of all five boroughs into Greater New York in 1898 is seen as a reflection of the corporate consolidations going on in the business community. This is a fascinating thesis that is easily proved by Professor Kessner's impressive research.<br />What holds the book together and keeps the reader's attention (well, this reader at least), is the cast of irascible characters and their single-minded purpose to make lots of money. Not surprisingly these men progress from the merely greedy to the mercenary and cold-blooded. Compared to Carnegie, Gould, Morgan, and Vanderbilt, men like John J. Astor, A.T. Stewart and Moses Taylor come off looking like Cub Scouts. Carnegie's vicious anti-labor practices, Morgan's tyrannic disposition, Gould's unabashed attempts to own everything, and Vanderbilt's contempt for charity, are brilliantly captured, warts and all, by Professor Kessner. Of course, not everything these men did can be viewed as self-serving greed. Gould did what he did because they system as it existed allowed him to. And had not Morgan reined in the wild and wooly railroad industry, the larger economy would suffer. And his creation of US Steel--which greatly profitted Andrew Carnegie--set the standards for 20th century corporate culture in America and the world.<br />Cementing these tales of unchecked love for Mammon are the stories of labor's attempts to share in the profits or, at the very least, earn a fair wage. The selfless quests of remarkable men like Andrew Green, Samuel Gompers and Henry George make the picture whole. &quot;Capital City: New York City and the Men Behind America's Rise to Economic Dominance, 1860-1900&quot; is a brilliant study, and a testimony to Professor Kessner's dedication and research. I recommend it highly.	2004-04-12

Most tourists to New York are, basicially, exposed to the famous buildings and theaters, maybe an historic landmark. Other tours concentrate on the lures and cultures of certain neighborhoods like Harlem, Chinatown, the Village, Little Italy, etc. Andrew Roth's book says, &quot;You can go see that stuff anytime. But do you want to see where John Gotti and friends shot down Paul Castellano? Do you want to see the gouges on the Wall Street buildings where a bomb went off in 1920? Then open the book and let's take a walk.&quot;<br />For me, the interesting crimes are the less remembered ones to us today, but were amazing sensations in their day: the murder of Wall Street tycoon Jim Fisk; the murder of architect Stanford White; the site where Nan Patterson shot her philandering boyfriend; the spot where Judge Crater was last seen alive. These and other notorious crime scenes are listed on maps and given brief but sufficient text--sometimes with illustrations--describing the crimes and their outcomes. I hope this book is given new life because it deserves it, even if just for its uniqueness. Sadly, the only update that it will need will be the devestation that occurred on the World Trade Center site on 9/11.	2004-04-09

The impossible task of coping with an alcoholic father, the toughing it out in the streets, the quick allies and enemies of childhood, all come together in this open and, often times, funny narrative. Qualities you don't find very frequently these days. The fact is, you have to learn to laugh at life, especially when it tends to frown at you; this is the subtext of BY REASON OF CHILDHOOD. It is a powerfully taught lesson which, to Mr. Connelly's credit, is conveyed to us through this wonderful book.	2004-04-07

Written by an eyewitness/accessory, Noel Monk, TWELVE DAYS ON THE ROAD WITH THE SEX PISTOLS IN AMERICA, is an attempt to chronicle the mess. Whether you loved the Pistols (as I did) or loathed them, there is no overstating the band's importance in saving rock and roll from itself. But that redemption came at a price, as this book shows. Exploited by the record label, mismanaged by everyone, preyed upon by publicity hounds, and too young to defend itself, Mr. Monk makes it plain that the band was doomed from the very moment they landed in America.<br />But like all \\"Great Moments in Rock and Roll\\", history blurs with legend, and sometimes the book provokes skepticism. On the other hand, the book demonstrates a lot of sincerity, and the photos are well worth the price of the book. It's a quick read of a significant moment, not just in punk history, but in the history of rock.	2004-03-29

Sandee and Hartman Brawarsky is gorgeous book, and each of the 212 views are nothing less than breathtaking. It's not only a great coffee table book, but also has very informative text. It is a true glorification of Vaux's and Olmstead's vision and realization of what true civic engineering is capable of, when supported by a responsive government. Of course, there is no substitute for experiencing the park first-hand, but this sure conveys that sense of relief from the city's frenzied pace, and of the park's true beauty. I recommend this book highly.	2004-03-26

While the style of the writing of &quot;Morgan: American Financier&quot; may seem &quot;dry&quot;, we have to remember that Ms. Strouse is not writing a biography of a colorful person like Nellie Bly or William Randolph Hearst. Still, she captures the tensions behind high-stake financing, plutocratic rivalries (Morgan vs. Andrew Carnegie, for example), and the ambitious attempt to rein in the wild speculation of railroad magnates. What makes the text of this book engaging for those not inclined to read these types of biographies, is that Strouse never lets you forget how much is at stake, not just in terms of dollars but in terms of the future of America's economic stability and growth.<br />For me, the chapters on JP Morgan's relationship with his father, Junius, and the internal struggles he had with traditional financing versus the role of financer as corporate director were at times touching and admirable. Specifically, the chapters entitled &quot;Family Affairs and Professional Ethics&quot; and &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; were the most successful and enjoyable. Bottom line: if you enjoy biographies/histories of the people who shaped American capitalism, this is a wonderful book. But even if that isn't your cup of tea, there is a lot of the human element to make this great reading.	2004-03-25

This unblinking look at a part of Civil War history that is often overlooked, captured my attention as few diaries have. (The diary of Anne Frank, of course, being the most engaging and heart-rending of the genre.)<br />The stories of mistreatment of the Union soldiers abound--by other Union soldiers as well as the Confederates! But no scourge was more frightful than the natural ones: the weather, insects, and contaminants were just as unfeeling and effective in their decimation of the prison population. This is not a diary for the weak-hearted. The constant tales of humiliation, hunger, and brutality, along with the growing list of Ransom's associates who were dying all around him, are incessant. Just when things get to their grimmest, the reader is treated to the suspense of Ransom's breakout and escape, which you have to read to believe. Whether you are a devotee of Civil War stories or not, John Ransom's &quot;Andersonville Diary/Life Inside the Civil War's Most Infamous Prison&quot; is a fabulous story of toughing it out in the worst of situations, and a thorough examination of one of the Civil War's darkest times and places.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points.	2004-03-22

But the one book to take a serious look at the Warren Commission's Report, to pick apart its inaccuracies, and to analyze its contradictions, is becoming harder and harder to find. Even Gerald Posner, in his tantrum, CASE CLOSED, could not lay a finger on the late Sylvia Meagher's masterwork. Why? Because it is a precise, unimpassioned, and brilliant piece of exploratory surgery on a very sick Warren Report. This book proves the Commission had a single purpose, and finding the truth was not that purpose. The lack of access to Sylvia Meagher's ACCESSORIES AFTER THE FACT is, to me, a tragic mistake and possible proof of a continuing cover-up.	2004-03-22

George Foster was one of the acknowledged kings of sensationalism when it came to writing about mid-19th century New York City.<br />While the Five Points neighborhood was a crime-ridden, filthy neighborhood, its depiction in Foster's accounts are highly exaggerated. And while crime was an unavoidable element of a New York which, at the time, had no real police force, Foster's essays would lead one to believe that merely walking down the street--any street--was an invitation to mayhem. This was not true then, nor is it now. So why did he write these sketches? Why did he make Manhattan seem so undesirable? Because there was a profit to be made. Affluent New Yorkers bought these types of books to make themselves feel better about their own situations, and it offered them a bit of voyeurism into a dark world that was a part of their island. It also proved popular with people in other cities, as they could read about the terrors of a New York City that was cluttered with &quot;filthy immigrants&quot;, criminals and chaos. And George Foster played it to the hilt!<br />If you can put aside the over-the-top stuff, however, there is much to be learned in these pages. The streets of lower Manhattan were congested, they did smell (think of the wild pigs or of the countless horses that were relied upon for transportation), and the misery of the slums was a given, if you were poor. Foster's language is also an undeniable historic artifact, as it captures the idioms of the day.<br />For my money, the more historic sketches are in the second half of this collection, the streaks of &quot;sunlight&quot;. Here Foster presents a handful of vignettes of every daylife in the growing city. &quot;The Eating-Houses&quot; is a delightful look at how ordinary men and women took their meals. And the &quot;Quarter of an Hour under an Awning&quot; is so lucid, so cleanly written--even with its pickpocket story--that it is the most &quot;real feeling&quot; essay in the book. The sudden storm that breaks out during the afternoon rush hour, the inablility to catch an omnibus (bus) or a hack (taxi) rings true to this day. At times, on my lunch hour, I walk by the street corner near City Hall where this quarter of an hour passed, and can watch it all transpire in my head. With so many of the old buildings still extant in that area, it's easy to do.<br />&quot;New York by Gas-Light and Other Urban Sketches&quot; is a marvelous book about a by-gone era in New York's history, as well as a great insight into the sensational sensationalist that George Foster was.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points and The Five Points Concluded	2004-03-22

It's too bad that this book has become a &quot;hard-to-find&quot; title that's going out of print. &quot;A Short and Remarkable History of New York City&quot; by Jane Mushabac and Angela Wigan is a tight, brisk, roller coaster ride through close to four centuries of NYC history, that is well worth the price. Thirty-something dollars may seem like a lot for a 160-page book that is mostly a timeline, but when you consider that this book is loaded with over 1,500 facts, historic moments and figures and some brilliant illustrations provided by the Museum of the City of New York--many of them that you won't find in the usual NYC history books--the price of roughly 25 cents a page is a steal.<br />It is curious that Amazon is offering Burrows and Wallace's &quot;Gotham&quot; as the Better-Together item with this book. Not that &quot;Gotham&quot; isn't a good book--it is one of THE BEST! It's just that it seems quite a leap from a mostly illustrated 160-page timeline to a deeply serious, scholarly, 1,000 page history. For the newcomer to NYC history, &quot;A Short and Remarkable History of New York City&quot; is a great starting point. But from here I would recommend Eric Homberger's &quot;Historical Atlas of New York City&quot;.

Read the first chapter, where Billy bowls someone \\"to death\\", and I seriously doubt that you will put the book down. Billy is one of the most memorable characters in William Kennedy's galaxy, moreso than Francis Phelan in my book. Billy is a risk-taker, a guy whose heart is in the right place, and a rough-and-tumble sort that relies on his confidence in the midst of trouble. And these are the qualities that make him the inevitable, although unwilling, middle-man in a kidnapping negotiation. <br />Billy's world of gamblers, drinkers, sharks, corrupt Albany lackies, and broken families is dark and smoky but never despairing or hopeless. And Billy's moral calculus is a bright spot in this otherwise bleak setting. For my money, \\"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game\\" is the best of three in the Albany cycle. I found \\"Legs\\" to be slow-going and lacking focus. \\"Ironweed\\" is a sensational book, a close second to this novel, but its plot of two drinkers going from job to job, joint to joint, drink to drink does begin to wear down. \\"Billy Phelan's Greatest Game\\" has a good deal of plot tension, moral conflicts, humor, and a wider array of characters.

Not one of my favorite science fiction books, one of my favorite books period. And what makes it such is its sturdy character development and plot development. All the characters are believeable and likeable. This includes Mike the computer. His desire to understand humor and humans must have been revolutionary for the time the book was written.<br />I have heard of Heinlein's political leanings and how they affected his writing. However, I did not sense that the novel was a veiled attempt at spewing a manifesto. The story is simply about humans wanting to be treated as such, and having to fight for that treatment. Mike's suggestion to &quot;throw rocks&quot; at the oppressors was absolutely brilliant. It made me think of the Biblical line: &quot;Let he who is without sin throw the first stone&quot;. Maybe there's a link, maybe not. I'm sure there are dozens of master's theses out there on this subject. In any event, this is a brilliant work of fiction of any kind! Read it!	2004-03-17

And like NYPD, the book seemed more like a collection of mob anecdotes than an investigation into the &quot;History of Its Rise to Power&quot;. Reppetto is to be admired for trying to tackle such a long history, and to be fair, much of it is told in an engaging style. But it seems like too broad a subject, for any writer.<br />Perhaps if he had just focused on the early mob history, or the history of its real organizing in the 30s and 40s, or the history of its bold, brash decades of the 50s and 60s, he would have forced himself to be more focused and selective. Instead, the book feels watered down. On a positive note, as the other reviewers have mentioned, there is no glamorizing these criminals. They are often portrayed as the vicious and psychopathic parasites they were. The key role that Prohibition played is the strong point of this book, and Reppetto does a fantastic job on discussing that.<br />One last note, this book, like others, fails to emphasize one thing: the Italians did not invent organized crime. The New York neighborhood known as the Five Points was rife with gangs of Irish immigrants, and they, like the mob, worked hand-in-hand with the politicians and judges that were owned by the Democratic political machine known as Tammany Hall. Later, a generation of Jewish immigrants, with names like Zelig, Buchalter, and Rothstein would dominate the crime scene. Reppetto does an okay job of covering these issues, something other mob &quot;historians&quot; neglect. But the reasons WHY the Italian mob became so famous is sort of glossed over. Besides their extreme viciousness, there are two reasons that made the Italian crime world so famous that people think it was the only criminal organization: (1) it existed during an era of mass communication, like movies and radio, so their every atrocity was announced nationwide and it provided fascinating characters for movies; and (2) because it existed in a world of expanding personal communications (i.e., telephones) they could conduct their &quot;business&quot; more effectively and instantly, and keep things organized. Perhaps if Reppetto were to focus just on these elements of the Mafia, we would really have a true look at its rise to power.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2004-03-15

Wisely, Robert Groden has elected to let the pictures, for the most part, do the talking in his book, The Killing of a President: The Complete Photographic Record of the JFK Assassination, the Conspiracy, and the Cover-Up. No crackpot theories, no half-truths supported by whole lies, no official whitewashing. If you look at the pictures--not just of the limousine--but of the crowd, there's no doubt that shots came from several directions. One of the nails on the Warren Report's coffin is the photo of the man sitting on the DalTex Building's fire escape, suddenly leaping to his feet and looking in the OPPOSITE direction of the Texas Schoolbook building during the shooting.<br />There's no denying Groden's position on the conspiracy issue, but he reins in his usual heavy-handed prose and keeps his theory to a minimum. (However, based on other reviewers, it's apparent that there was more than one man involved in the writing of the scant text. Whatever.) AND BE WARNED: Please listen seriously to the other reviewers here when they alert you to the graphic autopsy photos. They are extremely gruesome and not for the weak-hearted.	2004-03-15

Dunlop chronicled the execesses and outrages of upper class New Yorkers (especially the women of the uppermost uppers) at the turn of the 20th century. While hiding behind the facade that the lavish parties and balls they threw and the exorbitant clothes they had tailored for themselves were giving jobs to the lower classes, their effect was to shamelessly display their wealth and, ultimately, enrage a lower class that was finding the economy and job market less and less bearable. Peiss' style is scholarly yet without the distancing effect that that form of writing usually exhibits in less skilled hands. Her knowledge and passion for the subject are easily identifiable in this wonderful book.<br />Kathy Peiss' CHEAP AMUSEMENTS, for me, is the flipside of the situation. The working women of New York, especially immigrant women, needed some way to spend what little leisure time they had with the little discretionary spending they had. Rather than simply identifying the spots like some old guidebook, Peiss explores each type of simple pleasure ground available to the girls, and how and why they became so popular. On a second level, the book examines the social and sometimes political consequences of this class of working women--bachelorettes--and their spending habits.	2004-03-14

I have yet to read any satisfactory rebuttal to their theory over the intervening decades. How best to keep the poor poor? How best to placate them? How best to control the labor pool of American society? Not with riot gear and tear gas (although we haven't been above using that). The best way is with money. Just a little, of course.<br />As the title suggests, the welfare system has played many roles. Certainly, there were good intentions. But Cloward and Piven, as good historians and theoreticians, examined its cumulative effects. Their determination is, in essence, that the American welfare system has served as a stabilizing force--as in retaining the status quo--of that class who relies on it. <br />I am way oversimplifying the case here: there is a lot more to it. <br />No matter which side of the fence you're on regarding the welfare system, Cloward and Piven's REGULATING THE POOR has a solid base in history, statistics, and policy-making that makes their thesis unshakeable. Like I said, over thirty years later, no one has even put a dent in it.	2004-03-09

Peppered with wonderful photos (some that I had never seen before), this 400+ page book moves swiftly. The writing is respectful without becoming sentimental. And Paul O'Neill, who I will always remember as our favorite water-cooler kicking hothead, proves to be a sensitive and articulate commentator.

He is a great craftsman of fiction. Of all American writers, he perfected the use of that stream of consciousness narration we all heard about in English Literature 101. His fascination with the &quot;grotesque&quot; and with the legacy of the Civil War in the South has been covered time and time again. But I think AS I LAY DYING has one other element going for it that doesn't appear as prominently in the others, and that is the power or lack of power of language.<br />The &quot;I&quot; in William Faulkner's AS I LAY DYING, is Addie Bundren. And while the book is about her death and her family's obligation to bury her miles away in her hometown, Addie's voice is only given one chapter, and that chapter is in the dead center of the book. Flares and sirens should be going off. All the chapters surrounding this central one are remarkable examples of inarticulation, including the famous one-sentence chapter from the youngest Bundren, Vardaman: &quot;My mother is a fish.&quot; Addie, however, in her brief chapter, has much to say about everyone, including herself. Her last statement, however, while her devout neighbor tries to force her to repent, points out the impotence of language; that salvation and damnation are just words. Compare this to Dickens' belief in the moralizing power of novels. Dickens believed that his art would have a beneficial effect on his society; think of all the times he addresses his readers and implores them to listen to him and learn. Less than a century later, Faulkner admits that in the end, salvation or damnation is &quot;just a word.&quot;<br />But after having said all that, I don't want you to think that this novel is a mere screen for Faulkner's philosphy. This is a novel, after all, and a great one at that. Quick moving (once you get the hang of the swift shifting from one narrator to the other) and darkly humorous, AS I LAY DYING isloaded with great characters and character studies. It's not without its pathos but given the subject matter, it's to be expected. This is a great place to start, if you've never read Faulkner. Or anything from the 20th century south.	2004-03-01

To try to capture the rhythms and rumbles, slang and swagger of Brooklyn in one paperbound volume would seem to be an admirable but ultimately futile undertaking. However, THE BROOKLYN READER makes a great attempt, and as successful as one as possible. The diverse classes, ethnic groups, and races are represented well here. Most of the eras are also well-established. Every piece in this anthology was written after the Civil War, when Brooklyn was a city on its own. And most of the selections are from the 20th Century when Brooklyn became a borough of Greater New York. While I wish there was something to represent the borough during the Revloutionary era, I realize the pickings are slim and not always interesting.<br />The prose pieces range from fiction (Betty Smith, Cristina Garcia, William Styron, etc.) to the reflective essay (Paule Marshall, Shirley Chisolm, etc.) to notes on making a film (Spike Lee). The styles within these pieces are varied and make for fascinating reading. <br />What's interesting is the smattering of poetry; most of the poems focus on getting to and from Manhattan. Harte Crane's &quot;The Bridge&quot;, Walt Whitman's &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry&quot;, and Vladmir Mayakovski's &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; concern themselves with Brooklyn's symbiotic relationship to its more famous (and not always for the right reasons) sister city across the East River.<br />When I finished this book, I had as good an understanding of my own hometown, as I would have from a nonfiction text. But the enjoyment along the way of these author's voices made the learning experience all the more effective. <br />Rocco Dormarunno<BR>Author of The Five Points Concluded--A Novel	2004-03-01

They would bring with them tasty foods, progresssive ideas, unlimited manpower, and new words for American English. <br />Most popular accounts of the great immigration, before Professor Kessner's book, THE GOLDEN DOOR, stopped at that point, as if there were no distinguishing the causes and effects for these two groups embarking on such a trek. THE GOLDEN DOOR reveals the catalysts, unique to each group, for contributing to the greatest exodus of human beings from one continent to another in all history. The Italians (southern Italians mostly) were victims of criminal real estate deals, outmoded means of crop production, and increasing competition from other nations for garlic, olive, wine, and tomato sales. And, yet, according to Professor Kessner's tireless research, many Italians would return to their homeland periodically, to hand over the cash they earned in New York to their families and do some day-labor work in Italy when the New York job market cooled down. For this reason, Italians did not assimilate to American culture very quickly, and did not feel it imperative to learn English.<br />The Jews, on the other hand, were escaping escalating, violent anti-Semetic movements in much of Eastern Europe. Murders, organized riots, and attacks on Jews (pogroms) became more furious and frequent in the last years of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Therefore, the Jews had to assimilate, they had to learn English, they had to embrace America because they had no homes to return to in the old country. <br />From these seemingly simple scenarios, and a close scrutiny of other important data, Professor Kessner proceeds to extrapolate an astounding insight into a generation of new Americans and their experiences in New York. This is a remarkable, unprecedented, and unsurpassed study into this important time in US history. It ought to be mandatory reading for any student of American history, urban studies, and/or general social sciences.

However, I feel it's necessary to heap more praise on this wonderfully slim tome, even though decades of praise have been lavished on it already. There's a reason why ELEMENTS OF STYLE has been around so long: it contains plenty of precious gems of advice to guide the high school student, while delivering plenty of reminders for the seasoned writer. During my academic career, as a student and instructor, I've had dozens of writing handbooks come across my desks. Since 1976, this is the one book to which I've turned for help, again and again.	2004-02-20

Bly is more than just a tool for business people. Taking a common sensical approach, as opposed to a lofty educated tone, Messrs. Blake and Bly do not restrict themselves to business writing, in spite of the title. For the most part, The Elements of Business Writing is a valuable writing guide for just about all forms of writing. The book is strong on: knowing your audience; clarity; precision; and persuasion. When you think about those four elements, you're thinking about effective communication in general. This is something everyone--not just business people--can use in their daily lives.	2004-02-20

Edward O'Donnell's SHIP ABLAZE serves as a stinging reminder of not only a catastrophe of enormous proportions but of a deliberate and unjust society determined to forget it. While the tragic event of June 15, 1904, in which over 1,000 mostly German-Americans perished, is the star of the book, Mr. O'Donnell's outrage at the people responsible for it and the court system that allowed all but one of the culpable to go free is palpable. <br />There is no point in my retelling the sad story; anyway, I couldn't begin to approach Mr. O'Donnell's engaging and gripping style. But the compelling questions that emerge from the pages deserve consideration. How could human beings who are responsible for the lives and safety of other human beings behave so indifferently to their jobs? A more pressing question: are things any better today? <br />At the root of this book, however, is the inevitable question: Why don't more people--especially New Yorkers--know about this cataclysmic event that happened in the East River? Mr. O'Donnell offers a few convincing reasons:<BR>1) the pervading sexism and xenophobia of the times had only so much sympathy for the over 1,000 deaths of mostly female foreigners;<BR>2) unlike the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, there was no overtly political or socio-economic connection to the disaster;<BR>3) the First World War wiped out any sympathy for anything German; and<BR>4) unlike the glamour, wealth, and fame surrounding the victims of the Titanic, the Slocum victims were poor working class hacks (I believe it is also for this reason that the deaths of almost 100 commuters in the Malbone Street subway wreck of 1918 is all but forgotten too).<br />All things considered, SHIP ABLAZE is a sad book, but not morbid. The accounts of the several ways the victims died (burns, smoke inhalation, trampling, suffocation, crushing, drowning, etc.) in that harrowing hour or so is offset by the many accounts of heroism and selflessness. And now, with the release of this brilliant book, plus several upcoming memorials to mark the 100th anniversary of this calamity, the world will now be reminded of a day that never should have been forgotten.<br />Rocco Dormarunno,<BR>author of The Five Points	2004-02-19

(Even if it's not him, I congratulate him anyway.) The first edition was heavy on the preservation/conservation debate while this one is more reflective and personal. In both instances, however, Mr. Silver has made an incredible contribution to the study of New York history--not just its architecture, but to the thinking that went into the creation of these lost structures, and the lack of thinking that destroyed them. <br />Like Jane Jacobs, Mr. Silver shares a passion for the city and how its monuments, public buildings and spaces, and private residences have a direct and fortifying effect on its citizens. The photographs are stunning, as is the quality of the printing. Mr. Silver's text is equally powerful and just as relevant. At times the effect of seeing these representations of a lost time, and reading about their ends, can be upsetting; the sense of loss is very powerful. But there is a point to all of it beyond the seeming nostalgia: we had better start appreciating those gems of the past that are still rooted in the schist of Manhattan before they wind up in the next edition of LOST NEW YORK.<br />One last note: As rebuilding begins on the site of the World Trade Center (a part of lost New York that wasn't our fault), this book indirectly compels New Yorkers to participate in some forward-thinking. It makes one wonder, not only what was lost to us, but what will we give to future generations? <br />Rocco Dormarunno,<BR>author of THE FIVE POINTS	2004-02-10

All the figures you'd expect are present: Macchiavelli, Luther, Locke, Paine, Engles, Freud, etc. And with secondary sources coming from Fromm, Ulam, et. al, the data is clearly and comprehensively analyzed. What readers will appreciate are the generous illustrations throughout the text which give you some idea how the philosophies/theories/values of the times are reflected in visual media. What some readers won't appreaciate is the single-spaced type that changes font and styles so often that one might get motion sickness. It's a minor point that has nothing to do with the value of the texts presented, but it does interfere with the pleasure of reading. Still, this is a great history book to teach from or just as a casual read/refresher for the history fan.	2004-02-10

But this was not entirely the case. While there are better books containing primary source accounts of New York's history, this collection is both handy and enjoyable. Ranging from the earliest Dutch settlers through the mid-20th century, MIRROR FOR GOTHAM is a rich anthology of first-hand accounts and reflections of people's impressions of New York.<br />The introduction by James Richardson, although cloying and pandering at times, is a good bridge between the time the book was published in the 1950s through the early 90s. The text itself is sometimes repetitive, and the structure of introducing each large section and then each individual entry lends itself to these redundancies. It can be annoying. But if you can get passed this you will be pleasantly surprised by the variety of writers and their comments. Ultimately, the book proves its value as a historical resource and an engaging diversion.<br />Rocco Dormarunno<BR>author of THE FIVE POINTS	2004-02-06

I appreciate the earlier reviewer's complaint about historical inaccuracies--he's right, they are BIG errors. However, as a serious investigation into what New Yorkers put in their stomachs, I was pleasantly enlightened. Turtle Soup?! Turtle Soup?! What the...? <br />I loved the reprints of the menus of hoidy-toidy restaurants. It really gives you a sense of extravagance bordering on gluttony that went on in 19th Century NYC. And then there are the vivid chapters of New Yorkers at play: The Stork Club, The El Morocco, etc. The all-night bashes of the 20th Century, as well as extravagant somber dinners of the 19th Century are wonderfully described. (Note: The number of eateries that were brought down by organized crime seemed a little inflated. I know it ruined many a joint, but all the joints presented in the book? I had a hard time swallowing that. Pun intended.) <br />As a History, no, I would not base a dissertation on it. As a thorouhghly enjoyable look back at a world now long gone and what the people ate and did in it, I wish to pay my compliments to the chefs. Delicioso!	2004-01-31

Upon further reading, I learned that the causes weren't so simple. John Keegan's book, THE FIRST WORLD WAR, is a great introduction to the real tragedy behind the war: the war should never have happened and could've been averted at several points before the actual outbreak. <br />Keegan's premise, simply put, is that the war happened because there was a plan that made it possible to happen--the Schlieffen Plan. Certainly there were extenuating circumstances, and some very real reasons for belligerence but it really puts into perspective how the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was just one in a series of events that sparked the four years of horror. And it was a horror, as Keegan justifiably reminds us over and again. The sieges at Ypres and Verdun, and the slaughter at Gallipoli are brutally recounted. The real tragedy, to me at least, is Keegan's assertion that while the causes of the Great War are several in a series of chain reactions, its effect was to sow the seeds of World War II. Read Keegan's brilliant tome on the Second World War to complete this examination of the worst atrocities of the first half of the 20th Century.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2004-01-26

From the get-go in the early 17th Century, it was a port city. However, no sooner did development expand the city when the East and Hudson Rivers became sewers, dumping grounds for tanners, chandlers, and dyers. By the late 19th Century, the pollution extended all the way out to the Harbor, the Narrows, and then the Atlantic. John Waldman's HEARTBEATS IN THE MUCK traces this sad history and then, to the surprise of many readers, describes the comeback staged by these waterways.<br />In a way, this book is quite inspirational, in as much as that it gives the reader hope that, when confronted with an ecological crisis, local and state governments can and will intervene, even if it needs to be put under pressure. Villains  abound, but so do heroes, and the anecdotes about local seafarers do more than just entertain; they make you proud of them for their determination. <br />Lastly, even to the most seasoned New Yorker, this little tome will provide information about his/her city's remarkably complex network of rivers, streams, \\"kills\\", and canals. Having grown up near the Gowanus Canal, I remember how awful it smelled even on good days. Now, it is so clean, it seems strange. In any event, Mr. Waldman deserves a great deal of credit for his dogged research and his sea legs.	2004-01-21

White	Prompted by his son-in-law to return to New York City to write a magazine article, E.B. White wound up writing one of the most elegant, compact and poignant books on the subject. And although White rhapsodized about the New York of youth, and was a little saddened by the New York he was revisiting in the mid-40s, there is no doubting his love and fascination with Gotham. His descriptions of a walk through The Park in the evening, the sounds of ships' horns in the distance, and the comings and goings of commuters are especially provocative. <br />One of the central theses of this little tome is that so much of the destinies of New Yorkers are measured in inches. He describes how everyday New Yorkers can wind up inches away from a celebrity at a luncheonette, and that at any time you can be as close to or as distant from any significant event or person. He describes the fate of one New Yorker who was crushed by a falling piece of masonry from an old building. If that person had been six inches away in any direction on the sidewalk, that person would've gone on living. A matter of inches.<br />And so it is with this slender volume, which is not even a half- inch thick. And yet it, like the crowded little island of Manhattan, is filled with so much richness, humanity, and life that it draws you in like a supermagnet. And only E.B. White could have pulled off something as beautiful as this book. Buy it, read it.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points.	2004-01-20

She was hesitant to give me this gift because she figured I knew just about everything about the history of Irish immigration to New York. She need not have hesitated. This exhaustive and significant collection of essays and excerpts, brilliantly edited by Ronald Bayor and Timothy Meagher, will offer several nuggets of the Irish experience in NYC that that previously had been ignored, overlooked or misinterpreted. <br />The essays are arranged chronologically from the first Irish to come to America through to the modern era. I particularly enjoyed the sections surrounding the roles of New York Irish during the era surrounding the American Revolutionary War. The discussions about how Protestant Irishmen defended the rights of Catholic Irishmen is extremely interesting and important, as these court decisions cemented the barrier between church and state. <br />Also, the book is sprinkled with dozens of well-chosen and well-rendered illustrations. But this is by no means a coffee table book. It's demanding reading but the pay-off is extraordinary. You will learn a lot about one of the many groups that helped make New York City, and for that matter, America become great.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2004-01-20

However, I became curious to see how Thomas Nast and his times would be portrayed for the 10-14 year old age group. I believe that what they will get out of this book is a keen appreciation of the intense belief and interest people had in civic affairs 140 years ago. Nast's unwavering Republican partisanship, his desire to keep the working man protected from the new income tax, his outrage at the treatment of Native Americans and the Chinese, and his invention of the Democratic donkey and GOP elephant all reveal a man who believed the government (Republicans, in particular) can and should do its utmost to better serve Amercian society. This was not a society as jaded as ours when it came to trusting the government.<br />With the possible exception of Santa Claus, Thomas Nast's most recognizable subject is William Meagher (\\"Boss\\") Tweed. Nast, a devout Christian and staunch Republican, was outraged at the flagrant offenses committed by the Democratic political machine known as Tammany Hall, and especially at its leader, Boss Tweed. Nast's incessant attacks on Tweed and his corrupt ring serve as an introduction to this book, and I think Ms. Pflueger was absolutely on-target to do so. It will draw young readers in immediately, as they and the rest of us grown-ups have an irrational attraction to watching others in conflict. More importantly though, this book will also remind young readers that everybody has a chance to make a difference. Nast took on the most powerful political ring of his times and crushed it. This will drive home the point that all of us have a responsibility to keep ourselves aware of what the government is doing, and that we have the right to protest or support it. By selecting Thomas Nast as her subject, Ms. Pflueger picked the perfect man to best illustrate this valuable lesson.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded, a novel	2004-01-16

In all his works, Jack Finney had that unique story-telling ability to make the reader feel comfortable and entertained. Without sounding condescending, as some writers do, Finney carefully and clearly explains the situation so well, that there is no risk of not understanding him. For Pete's sake, TIME AND AGAIN was loaded with illustrations so that you could see what and where he was talking about. In FORGOTTEN NEWS, Finney employs the same device. <br />Focusing on what was the crime of the (19th) century--the murder of a dentist, Harvey Burdell--Finney explores the lives of the victim, the probable perpetrators, the witnesses, and, most importantly, the life of NYC in 1857. In fact, even before he launches into the narrative, he provides a brief but effective introduction to the world in which Dr. Burdell lived, including the rough-and-tumble world of the Dead Rabbits and Bowery Boys.<br />The narrative itself is easily paced, peppered with humor just at the right moments, as when the grisly events of the murder might be upsetting the reader. The circus surrounding the investigation and trial of the suspect, Emma Cunningham, is mind-boggling even by today's standards. Careful, to avoid jumping to conclusions, Finney is admirable in reining in his opinion. There are hints galore that he thinks Ms. Cunningham committed the murder along with a shady accomplice, but he also acknowledges that there is no evidence. The story of Ms. Cunningham's faked pregnancy and her attempt to acquire an infant to claim is Burdell's, just so that she could continue her pursuit of his inheritance, is so outrageous, so unbelievable that the reader might forget that this is non-fiction. <br />The second part of the book describes the shipwreck of the ????. Just the fact that I can't remember the name of the boat is an indication that that narrative isn't quite as compelling as the murder of Burdell (at least to me). In fact, it was a little anti-climactic. Perhaps it should have come before the Burdell murder. And perhaps it's just me. In any event, track down this book. It is worth the read.

Whenever Ms. Cohen hammers these points home, and she does pretty often, the effect isn't very... well... effective. And the flow of the book suffers a little from this. Two other things hurt the story: one is the long, distracting section on the histories of the Weston and Jewett/Dorcas families in Maine; and the other is the constant need on Ms. Cohen's part to track the lineage of each and every participant in the case. But for the most part, Professor Cohen's telling of the event is engaging, chilling, and compelling. The participants are brought back to life in a way that most historical writers should envy. To me, the most rewarding part of the book was realizing how much the Jacksonian era in New York and America represented a turning point from the colonial to the modern era. This was the dawn of modern journalism and mass media--the pivotal point where newspaper publishers realized that the public wanted more than just shipping and business reports: where publishers realized there was a public at all. And the media circus--a national media circus--which surrounded this case was the first in a long line that goes on to this day. It was also the first time in western history when people no longer lived in the same place they worked, and when the entire apprenticeship culture was being replaced by the more indifferent employer/employee system. All these important factors do figure into the crime. But the most admirable aspect of the book, for me, was that while all this socio/political analysis went on (sometimes at the expense of the pacing) Ms. Cohen never leaves sight of the young girl at the center of it all. Jewett/Dorcas was by nomeans a pathetic babe-in-the-woods, and the author is very careful to avoid this perception. But Ms. Cohen makes clear that Jewett, like any crime victim, didn't deserve the end she met. And like any other human being, Jewett was worthy of justice.	2004-01-13

I don't mean to be glib about this. As one reviewer has noted, Manhattan without fresh supplies of water would've been another unliveable coastal town. <br />Just like DeWitt Clinton's Erie Canal brought goods in and out of the city, the many visionaries (Burr[for politicial and banking reasons] and Colden [for practical reasons]) gave the city an enormous insurance policy for its future which is difficult to ignore. <br />This book is a compelling dedication to the people who saw the need for the reservoir system and made it a reality. Sometimes the book gets bogged down with details, but that's to be expected. What wasn't expected, by this reader, was the author's perserverance and dedication to this important matter, and for that he deserves the highest accolades.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS, and THE FIVE POINTS CONCLUDED, A Novel	2004-01-05

There's no denying that he was corrupt, but as William Riordon recounts, Plunkitt honestly believed that he was not doing the public any harm. In fact, he believed that there was such a thing as honest graft, a sort of victimless crime. Certainly this was a self-serving philosophy, but there is a sincerity in his discourses that defies any trace of hypocrisy. <br />His belief that Tammany Hall was a benevolent organization that served the poor and needy put a bemused smile on my face. After all, Plunkitt doesn't see or doesn't admit to seeing that the robbing of public funds through honest or dishonest graft is what contributed to the social problems, like unemployment, poverty and crime, which for the most part put the needy and poor in their predicament in the first place. But he absolves himself from his actions by his now-famous defense, &quot;I seen my opportunities and I took 'em.&quot; And this is what makes Plunkitt such a congenial and magnetic man, what makes him so damned likeable. You KNOW he's a thief, you KNOW he contributed to the misery of thousands. Yet his playful, plain-speaking style, his candidness about his activities, his wit, and, at times, his goofiness, make him different from other Tammany leaders like Boss Tweed, say, or Charlie Murphy. He's more in line with Big Tim Sullivan or James J. Walker.<br />George Washington Plunkitt was a charmer, no doubt about it. William Riordon was obviously under his spell. And the Johnson/Boswell comparison is very valid. It is difficult to maintain the utter contempt one should have for this thief. And yet... I would have loved to have had drunk with him at Hoffmann's bar and let him speak on for hours. Like Riordon, I think I would have been hypnotized too.<br />NB--Peter Quinn's brilliant Introduction serves the book well.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2003-12-22

Seymour Mandelbaum's study, BOSS TWEED'S NEW YORK, reveals that this is a gross minimalization of the facts.<br />As the title suggests, it was New York's political and economic machinery of the times that made it easy for anyone to loot the public's coffers. Other politicians before Tweed took advantage of this vulnerability. In fact, many New Yorkers bitterly accepted that graft was a way of life. Mandelbaum goes to great pains to explain, however, that it was the degree to which Tweed took advantage of these weaknesses that set him apart from other thieves. But the more interesting aspect of BOSS TWEED'S NEW YORK is the discussion of Tweed's downfall. There was much more to it than Nast's wonderful cartoons or the informant's testimony. Again, as the title explains, it was New York itself--it's changing immigrant make-up, the proliferation of the press, and the compression of communication between political wards--that accelerated his decline. <br />The point is that the real subject of this book is New York City during and just after the Civil War years. It is a provocative and surprising account of the metropolis under unprecedented changes and pressures. Changes and pressures that came so quickly that the mighty Tweed could not keep up with them.<br />And this has been a gross minimalization of Mr. Mandelbaum's thesis. Read it for yourself. You will find it an invaluable addition to your collection of books on political or New York history.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2003-12-22

Hello, Editor?	If you're looking for descriptive battle sequences of the three-day riot which rocked New York City in July of 1863, this is NOT the book to read. Carefully (and thankfully) avoiding the sensationalism that often accompanies discussions of these draft riots, this book was one of the first to identify and discuss the causes (political, social, economic, racial, etc.) that led up to this insurgence. And, for this, Mr. Bernstein has done a more than admirable job.<br />However, and as the other reviewer mentions, the book suffers--really suffers--from a good deal of repetition and a haphazard presentation of statistics and other data. Not that the stats don't belong--they absolutely do--I just wish they had been more smoothly incorporated. This is why the title to this review asks where Mr. Bernstein's editor was. Any decent editor could have made this a more engaging text. It could and should maintain its scholarly style, but it doesn't have to be as dry, distant and self-referring as it is now.<br />My only other critique: Similar riots exploded in Brooklyn during those same days, but little mention is made of that. The reasons for those riots weren't exactly the same. A comparison of the two uprisings would have been interesting. Still, this is a well-researched book but it should only be read for research purposes.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2003-12-22

One concern is that you have to find the book/s that provide/s you with the works you want and, at the same time, you want to try to not break the economic backs of your students. LITERATURE AND THE WRITING PROCESS is probably one of the better collections out there. For my purposes, it has most of what I need: dramas like OEDIPUS REX and MACBETH; short stories by Joyce, Carver, O'Connor, Achebe, Munroe, and Updike; and a vast array of poetry that spans centuries.<br />While the price of this collection seems steep, it works out to be much cheaper than having your students buy a copy of MACBETH, of OEDIPUS REX, of DUBLINERS, of CATHEDRAL, etc. Another advantage of this book is that it provides students with guides on how to approach literature, and how to write about it. Not all of these guides are helpful, and some are extremely weak: this is why I give this book four stars instead of five. Still, I haven't found  much else out there that compares to this book for the price!<br />Rocco Dormarunno.<BR>Instructor, The College of New Rochelle	2003-11-30

Henry is that the \\"surprise\\" or \\"twist\\" at the end of so many of his stories arrive so naturally. You never feel manipulated. They are so simple and logical, like the narrator's tone. It's little wonder that so many consider O. Henry to be one of the founders of the modern short story. And that an annual short story award is given out in his name.<br />His stories, like Horatio Alger's, give us a unique first-hand account of what New York and other cities were like at the turn of the last century. And for that it is a valuable collection as well. <br />The great standards are in this collection, like \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" and \\"A Retrieved Reformation\\". But it's the lesser known, the hidden gems, that make this collection so remarkable. People make much of the fact that so many of these tales were written while O. Henry was in prison for various minor offences and that the stories provided him with bail money. The fact is that the man had a lucid view of human nature and the funny way life infringes upon it. He could have--and did--write so many of these tales outside of the jail cell.	2003-11-18

Movies and television of this period depicted squeaky clean families in their squeaky clean houses (with the notable exception of I Love Lucy and The Honeymooners whose families lived in apartments). In this Father Knows Best world, no one worried about poverty, minorities, or women's rights, and the only evil was on the other side of the hemisphere in the USSR.<br />And then there's the world of LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN. This is the underclass of citizens that the nation preferred to ignore: pimps, hookers, thieves, junkies, drag queens, wife-beaters, and the thousands upon thousands of working class stiffs at the mercy of their union officials or their bosses, neither of which seem to have their best interests in mind. But this is no 'pity the poor' sort of the book, no HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES (although I do wonder what kind of effect this book had upon its release). These characters, and they are fascinating, are not sentimentalized. Selby portrays most of them as brutal, unsympathetic, and as cruel to their own kind as anyone else. Even the drag queens, whom you would think would be a little understanding of each other, turn vicious at their best friends over the slightest insult. While very uneven in terms of pacing and tone, this is still a ferocious book which deserves reading.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points.	2003-11-17

One thing can be said with a certain amount of scrutiny: he distrusted any form of government that claimed to be for everybody and claimed to disperse power among the masses. ANIMAL FARM is his warning.<br />This fable, which is what it really is, condemns what Stalin had made of the Russian Revolution. Truth be told, Orwell was very much aware that anyone with power would have turned that revolution into revenue.<br />But Capitalism is not spared either. When reading this novel closely, Orwell acknowledged that power was always seated where the money was evident. (Why else did the pigs make arrangements for trade with mankind?) This is an excoriating view of politics as power, and how no manifesto or declaration is free from the human greed that will opportunistically profit from it.	2003-11-16

Tracing New York City's history from the days of the Native Americans to its transformation to a Dutch trading post through its last days as England's colony, Professor Kammen's COLONIAL NEW YORK: A HISTORY is one of the more exhaustive studies on the subject ever written.<br />For me, the best parts of the book center on Peter Stuyvesant (whom Professor Kammen refers to as a &quot;loser&quot;--which he is, in ways). His study of the struggles between Dutch and English cultures in Section 7 is among the best I've ever read. While the book tends to sag during the sections about economic growth, it makes up for it in terms of valuable information. I shouldn't even mention that here: this isn't a novel, after all.

Much of what Posner gives us in CASE CLOSED is, for the most part, a re-hash of Warren Commission testimony supplemented with some later interviews. But here and there you will come across moments when you have to nod your head and say to yourself, &quot;I hadn't thought about that. Maybe the _____(fill in a conspiracy theory)__________ isn't probable.&quot;<br />I give the book this much credit: it de-bunks a lot of the kookier conspiracy theories that are out there. As some one who believes there was some kind of limited conspiracy, I thought this was good for one reason: it makes the case for the more logical and probable conspiracy theories that much more compelling. Without realizing it, by knocking down some of the more elaborate theories, the ones he left standing seem to stand taller. It makes you wonder why Posner didn't go after them. (Notice how he knocks one conspiracy writer down after another, but couldn't touch Sylvia Meagher's works or Josiah Thompson's Six Seconds in Dallas.)<br />But the ultimate flaw for Posner's book, looking at it from an Oswald-did-it-alone theory, is that it spends 99/100ths of the time discussing Oswald's profile as an assassin, but only spends two pages (with illustrations) on the single-bullet theory and two pages on Oswald's escape from the sixth floor. These nuts-and-bolts of the assassination are glossed over unconvincingly, which is terribly damaging to his cause. These elements of the murder are the means and opportunity to prove the case against Oswald. It's at this point when Posner's reasoning turns into a tantrum. The tone of the concluding chapter is so defensive that you sense that Posner himself knows he didn't convince the skeptics. To call his book CASE CLOSED, convincing the skeptics should have been his primary goal.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded	2003-11-10

All the elements of a great story are in it: love, passion, hope, tragedy, hope out of tragedy, and finally the affirmation of life's goodwill. The village of Macondo, and the Buendias family that founded, defined, affected, cursed, and charmed it, are in a way a world where all human emotion and meaning coexist or do battle. The power of their passions live on after the deaths of some of their characters in this beautiful dream-logic universe.<br />One warning: there may be confusion when it comes to the characters' names. There are multiple Jose Aurelianos and Remedios, among others. Fortunately, there's a geneaology chart at the beginning of the book to help you along.<br />In any event, don't let the first few chapters intimidate you.

While it started out with promise, the promise was unfulfilled.<br />To me the pacing was interminable. While this book is almost one-quarter the length of UNDERGROUND, it took me three times longer to read. Part of the issue was the utter contempt I had for the main character, Eric Packer. You're not supposed to like him, I know, I know. But there are thousands of characters in literature that you aren't supposed to like but they are interesting, at least. Not this guy.<br />The other issue I have with the book is that it seems so dated. While it takes to task the materialism of the '90s (which seem so far away since 9/11 and the market crash just before it), the flavor really smacks of the Walter Gekko-greed of the 1980s. There's nothing wrong with that but even the dated nature would have seemed extra-dated just five years ago.<br />A long time ago I learned that even your best buddies can let you down. The same goes, it seems, for your favorite writers.	2003-11-07

New York's subway system has been written about, painted, painted on, talked about, griped about, even sung about. (Don't sleep on the subway, darling...) There are a fair number of books about it, most of them are technical. And the technical achievements of the subways system are amazing.<br />But only Brian Cudahy can write with the excitement and enthusiasm for this complex transit system to bring its history and experience to life. The word &quot;Celebrating&quot; in the subtitle is more indicative of his attitude than the bland &quot;A Century of Subways.&quot; He starts with the asphyxiating conditions of Manhattan's streets immediately before 1900, and the need of developers, businessmen, and employers alike to expand into the other boroughs. This system, once built, would ease the overcrowding of Manhattan's slums, provide capital for real estate and housing barons in Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and northernmost Manhattan, and turn places like Coney Island into true party spots.<br />Of course, skeptics did abound: &quot;New Yorkers will never go into a hole in the ground.&quot; And this is where Brian Cudahy then delivers to us the fanfare, thrills and--efficiency (!)--of the first subway ride, as bystanders cheered from clean, beautiful (!!) subway stations. At the center of it all is August Belmont, and the admiration Cudahy has for him is evident. Yet he doesn't resort to worshipping the tycoon/developer.<br />A CENTURY OF SUBWAYS is a fun and educational book. Its tone is miles away from his sober, but equally fascinating book, THE MALBONE STREET WRECK. While this disaster was waiting to happen in 1918, Cudahy, in A CENTURY OF SUBWAYS, savors the joyful moments of 1904.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS CONCLUDED	2003-11-05

As I read along, it became clear that the author had a specific thesis in mind, and that the book was more a study of class/sexual/social relations during this economically volatile era than a scandal sheet. Fine. But as a study, I found the evidence to be slim. What she presents as support for her theory (newspaper accounts) is questionable. Imagine future generations trying to figure us out based on what the New York Post says! <br />Still... Looking at it as a compiliation of social atrocities committed by the affluent in the face of the poor, it's pretty outrageous. I enjoyed the dozens upon dozens of anecdotes, and Dunlop's style is very engaging. Even the footnotes were enjoyable! While I wasn't satisfied with her attempt to neatly tie together all the chapters at the end of the book, I was satisified that I had gotten a better understanding of a decadent, turbulent, and fascinating society.	2003-11-05

And like TRIANGLE, Cudahy's THE MALBONE STREET WRECK does not exploit the tragedy for the sake of sensationalism and profit. It is a sober narrative which actually sends warning signals to the mass transit officials of today. <br />This remarkably short book is very thorough. Beginning with America's pulse during the final days of World War I and the influenza epidemic that scourged the nation and world, Mr. Cudahy then explores the world of 1918 New York. Specifically, he inspects the confluence of forces, such as local politics, labor relations, the profit motive of the train line owners, and others, that led to the placement of an untrained, unqualified transit worker in the motorman's booth of a rush hour train. The result being the violent death of almost 100 people in The Malbone Street Wreck.<br />Mr. Cudahy's research seems conscientious, and where he is unsure of the facts, he tells us so. There is an honesty to his narration that gives the story an almost personal tone. (His mother did lose two cousins in the wreck.) The several maps and illustrations are extremely helpful. And while the photos of the disaster site and wrecked subway cars are shocking, they are not gruesome. And they serve as strong reminders of the imperative for the transportation officials of today to adhere to strict safety standards.	2003-11-05

He had also rejected Catholicism, and yet all his characters are dominated by it. DUBLINERS, Joyce's collection of short stories which set the standard for the genre, is filled with characters who come to terrible revelations (which he called &quot;epiphanies&quot;) about how their lives had been scarred by the provincialism of Dublin, the divisiveness of its politics, and the oppression of religion. By extension, this is how Joyce percieved humanity at the dawn of modernism.<br />The stories range from the psychologially simple (&quot;Counterparts&quot; and &quot;A Little Cloud&quot;) to the extraordinarily complex (&quot;A Painful Case&quot; and &quot;The Dead&quot;). But what is common throughout is the feel for Dublin just after the turn of the last century. The readers see the cobblestones, the chimneys, the trams and carts, the churches, and the street lamps. More importantly, the readers feel the tensions underlying the public smiles and infrequent bursts of confidence that the characters exhibit. <br />The pinnacle of this collection is &quot;The Dead&quot;. A novella, actually, &quot;The Dead&quot; encompasses everything: politics, religion, art, journalism, history, love, and the inevitability of death rendering all worldly things meaningless. This doesn't mean the story is a downer: this death is necessary to making a fresh start. The ending of &quot;The Dead&quot; has been interpreted in hundreds of ways. However, there is no denying that as Joyce &quot;pulls back the camera&quot; from the Conroy's hotel room to the universe above, the writing swells to its most beautiful. To me, this is a movement toward the future, toward change, leaving the living dead behind to a more spiritual life on Earth. <br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points.	2003-10-30

Because the initial chapters are narrated by, Pip, a little boy we watch become a young man? Because there are pirates and bad guys in it? Because there's a sort of love story? I'm sure some high schoolers understand GREAT EXPECTATIONS but the majority of them... I don't think so.<br />GREAT EXPECTATIONS contains many complicated, adult themes and issues that adults will surely appreciate. A virtual encyclopedia of human emotions--fear, child abuse, anticipation, disappointment, love, jealousy, manipulation--this greatest of all of Dickens' novels has everything. And all these ingredients are woven into an incredibly entangled plot, full of twists and turns. On top of all that, the novel is also a virtual encyclopedia of the layout and attitudes of Victorian London. <br />Holding it all together is Pip's incredible perceptions into his world and his emotions. Never before had there been a character so aware of his feelings and, still, because he is human, he allows these emotions to sometimes compel him to do the opposite of what is right and best. Pip does sometimes behave like the child and young adult he is, but that doesn't mean this novel is suitable for anyone of that age.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2003-10-30
920202:US	38610362	RHDO2H8MLOADF	0394743121	705442339	Ulysses (The Gabler Edition)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	World Literature's Greatest Comic Book	These are the things you will probably hear the most about James Joyce's great epic: ULYSSES is hard to read. ULYSSES is a masterpiece of 20th Century literature. ULYSSES requires a deep knowledge of Western Civilization. ULYSSES is the expression of modern man's heroic quest for meaning in a world without heroes or meaning. ULYSSES has to be read along with a dozen other books on how to read ULYSSES.  <br />Much of this is true.<br />But what is omitted by reviewers, time after time, is the warm humor, born of Joyce's compassion for people, that surfaces on every page. From the obvious riddles told to and by the protagonist, Leopold Bloom, to the scholarly puns and tropes uttered by the narrators, ULYSSES can be seen as one great comic book. Listen closely to the words of the one-eyed Citizen in the &quot;Cyclops&quot; chapter. Pay attention to what the soldier screams just before he decks Stephen Dedalus. The dark humor surrounding Paddy Dignam's funeral is hysterical.<br />No, this doesn't mean ULYSSES is light reading--don't bring it along on your trip to the beach or the ski lodge. The novel makes many demands on the reader, as do many of the other works we consider milestones of literature. This doesn't mean you have to read it in a dusty library and takes notes on every page. The book is filled with lightness and life. The fact that it ends with the word &quot;Yes&quot; is the most obvious expression of ULYSSES' life-affirming attitude.<br />Certainly there are devestating moments that wrench your heart: Stephen's run-in with his pathetic father and Bloom's vision of the ghost of his son immediately come to mind. But for the most part, ULYSSES is a raunchy, rowdy, ride that makes the difficult parts easier to bear.	2003-10-30

Doctrow's poignant look at Depression era gangsterism through the eyes of the young boy after whom the book is named. Much to Doctrow's credit, there is no sentimentalizing or romanticizing of criminals here. Almost legendary gangster, Dutch Schultz, who befriends Billy, is depicted clearly as a vicious, sadistic thug teetering on the edge of insanity.     Although it is the Dutchman who takes in the boy, Billy is drawn to Dutch's moll sexually, and to the gang's bookkeeper, Otto Berman, emotionally. Otto is the real key to the book. Billy, like Johnson's Boswell, is drawn to the accountant and his philosophy. Broken down, Otto explains to the boy that things like love, loyalty, knowledge, and spirit are meaningless--none of them can be proven. They are all bound by words. To Otto, words are just words. Numbers, however, are the only true language. One and one will always be two. Numbers never lie. (Spoken like a true accountant.) This has an enormous impact on a young boy whose mother is one step away from the nuthouse, and whose father took off years earlier.     I gave this book four stars because I had just finished re-reading RAGTIME, and this came up a little short. On the other hand, maybe RAGTIME was too high a standard to hold it up to. In any event, this is not your typical gangster novel, as I hope this review has made apparent. It is a complex and profound book and should satisfy the most literary appetite.

I agree that this is an inspirational story for children and early adolescents. The values it imparts--loyalty, work, cooperation, persistence--are certainly ones that we would want our youth exposed to. But it holds something for adults too: and that is  a first-hand glimpse of post-Civil War New York City. The struggle of the orphans, the advantages of the privileged class, the thieves, the confidence men, the unforgiving hardness of poverty in the pre-Jacob Riis days are all there. And that's what makes this book a double winner: it has something for the young and something for the older.	2003-10-27
927449:US	38610362	R2HZ2IT9GSNZ5R	0871138743	758410541	Triangle: The Fire That Changed America	Books	5	57	61	N	N	From Fire to Reform	I normally avoid books that focus on horrific events in history because they mostly exploit and sensationalize the disaster for their authors' obvious motive: profit. David Von Drehle has no interest in exploiting this exceptionally terrible moment in New York's--and even America's--history. His compassion for the victims, his admiration for the reformers, and his loathing for those who caused and profited from the fire is obvious on every page, and in every word.<br />Framed by the scorn and indifference toward laborers before the fire, and the realization of guilt that led to the rush to reform after it, the events of March 25, 1911 are heartbreakingly described by Mr. Von Drehle's vivid prose. But the description of the actual fire is only part of the book. He doesn't linger over the gruesome details to satisfy some cruel, voyeuristic hunger that some readers might have expected. There's just enough narrative to convey the chaos, terror and sadness of the event. To prevent the story from getting too morbid, the author diligently included the many individual acts of heroism by police, firemen, passersby and neighboring NYU students.<br />The main purpose of the book, as the subtitle explains, is to demonstrate how the Triangle catastrophe profoundly affected Tammany Hall, New York City and State government, the federal governemt, the labor union movement, socialists, and Democrats. The dedication of the reformers and labor leaders like Al Smith, Frances Perkins, Robert Wagner, Sr., Clara Lemlich, and so on, is also highlighted. The owners of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, receive the vilification they deserve. And somewhere in the moral gray area are the two most enigmatic figures: Tammany leader Charles Murphy and the attorney for Blanck and Harris, Max Steuer.<br />One last note: the book is a fascinating history of the history of the disaster. By that I mean that Mr. Von Drehle reports how others before him--the newspapers, Attorney Steuer, Clara Lemlich, and Leon Stein--recounted the events of that dark day, and how frighteningly close we came to losing these records (especially Steuer's). It represents the debt we owe to Mr. Von Drehle's dogged research, as well as the debt he owes his predecessors. Amazing.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2003-10-24

Unfortunately, many books objecting to the Commission's findings employ the same tactics and are therefore guilty of the same offenses. And this book is one of the biggest offenders.<br />Each of the short sections focuses on one of the unsettling and unresloved aspects of the tragedy of 11/22/63 that doesn't fit into the Warren Report's findings, and impulsively indicts someone as being a conspirator. When I first read this book back in the early 90's it had a peculiar effect on me. I would finish a section and say, \\"Ah! So it was the Mafia!\\" Only to finish the next section and say, \\"Ah! So it was the Cubans!\\" The next section had me going, \\"Ah! Rogue government agencies working with both elements did it!\\" And so on... Then one section, out of left field, described the wild moodswings of the New York Stock Exchange on the days immediately before the assassination. And I asked myself, \\"Wait a minute. Am I supposed to believe that Charles Schwab was involved, too?\\" Come on. I read the rest of the book with the same skepticism I'd read the Warren Report years earlier.<br />I tried re-reading CROSSFIRE earlier this year and I put it down almost immediately; that's what prompted me to write this review.<br />I do believe there was a conspiracy of some kind. (Gerald Posner's tantrum, CASE CLOSED, only further convinced me that the case is still, indeed, very much open.) But the plot couldn't have involved every right wing group, every government agency, Dallas cops, Corsicans, KGB, Cubans, and the Vinnie \\"Big Nose\\" Goombatz crime family.<br />Unfortunately, the trail to the truth about the assassination is getting darker, colder and lonelier with each passing year. Long ago it had slipped from current events to history: several other assassinations, conspiracies, and tragedies (like 9/11) only relegated the JFK murder further into the shadows of distant memory and, almost, irrelevance.<br />Stick with Josiah Thompson's SIX SECONDS IN DALLAS, if you can find it, and just about anything by Edward J.

These scenes would have been disastrous from the keyboard of another writer.<br /><br />Secrets and codes abound: the numerology surrounding Thompson's home run, the clues of the Zapruder film, the secret of shoe making, computer codes, an artist's secret language, the unfathomable DNA of AIDS... All this make for an intriguing book to say the least.<br /><br />On the negative side, the book does try to cover too much. Whereas a film like Forrest Gump encompasses much of Cold War America, the screenwriters were very selective about what they would use from the novel of the same name: they only used the historic elements that had an effect on Forrest and on the viewer. DeLillo has just about everything here, and this is what I think upset the reviewers who didn't like the novel: 800 pages that can't possibly all be relevant. In a sense, I agree that the parts are better than the whole. But those parts! WOW! Even if this book were half its length, it would still be two times better than everything else out there. Read this book; you'll see why, as of this writing, over 275 people had a strong reaction (mostly positive) to it!<br /><br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points and The Five Points Concluded	2003-10-22
930760:US	38610362	R34VCHJGH925U9	B00006JO2R	684938954	Nypd: A City and Its Police	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Needed Inspiration	I bought this book in a shop in the mall of the World Trade Center; four days later 23 NYPD officers died in and around the those towers. As I prepared to read this book, I grumbled, &quot;There better be no cop-bashing in here.&quot; And at the first sign of negative criticism of the force, I put the book down and didn't start again until two years later. I'm glad I did: I might not have given it a fair reading or review back in 2001.<br />Having said that, Reppetto and Lardner have put together a decent history of the NYPD. And yet, I finished the book with an empty kind of feeling. Considering that Reppetto is a retired NYPD cop, I thought I'd get something deeper, more probing than this. For anyone familiar with New York history or the NYPD, there's nothing really new here. A lot of known ground is rehashed: the Police Riot of 1857, Teddy Roosevelt's reforms, the attempts to fight Organized Crime, and the lurid corruption scandals that seemed to recur with every new generation of cops. The cast of characters can be found in any book on the seamy side of New York City history: Alexander &quot;Clubber&quot; Williams, Detective Byrne, Lt. Becker, Serpico, etc. What I'm saying is that I had expected a book that would explain how the department evolved and detail its daily processes and procedures, and not a collection of anecdotes accumulated over 150 years of department history.<br />What is redeeming is the authors' willingness to admit to these episodes of graft and other crimes. Still, the point is clear that no matter how many corruption scandals have surfaced over the years, the ratio of honest cops compared to the dishonest ones is so disproportionate in favor of honest cops. <br />There are several sections that describe some of the lesser known heroes and heroics of individual police officers. These were enjoyable and, sometimes, inspiring. But nothing could be more inspiring than the sacrifices those 23 police officers made on September 11, 2001. <br />Rocco Dormarunno,<BR>author of The Five Points	2003-10-22

And this new genre, like the first movies and radio programs, fascinated its audience. Riis' sharp essays are matched only by his sharp eye for photography. I don't know which made more of an impact on me: the text or the pictures of unspeakable misery. But I think it's a safe bet to say that Riis' contemporaries were fixated more on the photographs. (After all, Riis turned to photography AFTER his published essays seemed to have little effect.) In any event, the result, then as now, is a provocative, compassionate, and angry work that exposed to the middle and upper classes of his time the effects of their indifference, at best, or the effects of their roles as slumlords and sweatshop owners, at worst.<br />The only jarring aspect of the book is Riis' use of ethnic stereotyping. He makes several not-nice remarks about Jews, Chinamen, Italians, etc. However, we must not impose our early 21st Century values on a late 19th Century man. These types of remarks were commonplace back in the pre-politically correct times. In any event, Riis' overall intention was to help these people get out of their horrid conditions and not to slur their heritages.<br />One last note, Luc Sante's introduction is brilliant and serves the book very well.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded, a Novel	2003-10-22

As the young Oswald stares out the front window, little does he realize how much the rest of his life would be just like this: being carried away by a powerful machine and only catching flickering glances of the things and people along the way. Released very close to the 25th anniversary of JFK's assassination, LIBRA does not attempt to seriously propose a conspiracy theory. What he does do is take some of the facts, some of the tempting coincidences, and several of the possible scenarios, and create a labyrinth of intrigue and a world filled with shadows within shadows. This is a creepy book that haunts you, to use a tired cliche but I can't think of how else to put it. (Apparently the assassination is a favorite topic for DeLillo, as the Zapruder film and discussions about JFK conspiracies reappear in DeLillo's later book, UNDERWORLD.) Underneath it all is a dark struggle between what is planned and what occurs: strategy versus chance, conspiracy versus spontaneity, the best laid plans... etc. In LIBRA, the scales tip one way then the other and, yet, the result is the inevitable tragedy of November 22, 1963. This is what historical fiction should be.	2003-10-22

It doesn't last long on your bookshelf, though; you are always lending it out or re-reading some, if not all of it. Set in Depression-era Albany, IRONWEED is an unforgettable tale of one man's search to reconcile himself with a past riddled with calamity and many loves gone awry.<BR> <BR>The opening chapter, where protagonist Francis Phelan and his friend, Rudy, work as gravediggers for a day is as great a piece of dark comedy as the scene where Hamlet meets the gravediggers. I felt a sort of uneasiness about laughing at all of Francis Phelan's wisecracks, though. We know that they all stem from a life filled with pain, alcoholism, terrible coincidences, and frustrated dreams. Yet, he is a generous man. He will give those even more down-and-out than himself the last bite of his sandwich or the last sip from his bottle of cheap wine. And it is this sort of attitude--slivers of hopefulness out of seemingly permanent bleakness, generosity out of poverty, humanity out of an unfeeling world--that gives the book its life, humor, and appeal.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points.	2003-10-21

The book would have been best served if it had ended in 1898, at the time of the consolidation of the five boroughs into New York City. (This was what Burrows and Wallace did when writing GOTHAM, a book of similar length.) I also agree with other reviewers that a few maps and illustrations would've benefitted the work. But give the guy a break.<BR>THE EPIC OF NEW YORK CITY is as good an introduction to the long, complex history of the city as anything else out there. In fact, it's better than most, in spite of its few historical errors. This is an enormous subject that would've daunted most historians. Mr. Ellis' passion and fascination for NYC history is evident on every page. <BR>THE EPIC OF NEW YORK CITY is written in short, digestible chapters that make for sprightful, snappy reading.

This is the third novel in this series that I've read (yes, I read them out of sequence) but predictable patterns are developing. In the three novels I've read, the murderers were well-known society figures and almost all the victims were females. It becomes pretty obvious, early on, who the killer is and which female character is going to get killed off. (My only regret is that Sarah's neighbor, the extremely annoying Mrs. Elsworth, isn't one of those female victims. Am I the only one who is irked by this character?) But, like the old Columbo tv shows, there is an enjoyment in finding out how Sarah and Frank will catch the killer. In that sense, this installment in the series is recommended. The vivid descriptions of Coney Island during its heyday are particularly enjoyable. Pick up this book. Like a scary Coney Island ride, you know it will end okay, but its the bumps and turns along the way that make it worthwhile.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2003-10-15

Instead, I was reading stories about compassion, good-natured friendships, and even salvation and forgiveness. Sure there were still the choppy sentences, quick observations, and weighty silences. But it was different. Many of the stories, not all, ended with an unusual (for Carver) sense of closure, even understanding. As so many reviewers have noted, the title story is just glorious. The narrator, a sarcastic and distant husband, finds human contact in the strangest circumstance. And when he does, he simply states, &quot;It was like nothing else in my life up to now.&quot; Simple, but it leaves a serious lump in my throat each time I read it.	2003-10-03

What they will discover is a career on the cusp of change, just before the author's life was tragically cut short. The stories are presented in chronological order. The opening dozen stories or so are classics of minimalist style which reaches its peak with the devestating 3-page story &quot;Little Things&quot; in which a child is literally torn apart by its parents divorce. <br />But Carver's tone and style changes in the stories that follow. &quot;What We Talk About When We Talk about Love&quot; and the gut-wrenching &quot;So Much Water So Close To Home&quot; take on a new level of story-telling where Carver gives us a more intimate look at his characters. The last two of the previously published stories are nothing like the earlier stories. In &quot;Cathedral&quot;, a typical Carver married man--distant, cynical, and slightly smug--makes surprising contact with another human being, presumably for the first time, in the most unlikely of situations. It is almost a salvation. &quot;A Good Small Thing&quot; (which was a revision of an earlier story called &quot;Scotty&quot;) is nothing less than a masterpiece. In Carver's earlier career, this story would have ended bitterly and, perhaps, indifferently. Instead, this story ends up with an astonishing flavor of hope, forgiveness, and even closure. The seven &quot;New Stories&quot; at the collection's end just drive home the fact that Carver was really moving forward or at least in a new direction.

No wonder my thoughts about this book are fragmented and ambivalent. I wish the book had been written in a few separate complete sections, something like Part One--The History of New York Real Estate, Part Two--The Forces Behind the WTC's Creation, Part Three--The Rockefellers, Part Four--The Builders... You get the idea. Instead, the book, while it does offer several fascinating and provocative sections, they're spread out among so many other topics and diversions, that I lost my patience several times and had to put the book away for days at a time. The only section that was complete was the most effective, and that was the discussion about the now-lost Radio Row and the neighborhood around it. I would recommend the book just for that section, and for its studies of August Tobin and the Rockefeller clan. But I couldn't in good conscience give it a higher rating than the one I gave it. I was that divided.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points	2003-10-03

First off, I am a great admirer of David McCullough's histories. Second, I have published two novels which are set in New York during the mid-19th Century. But what probably makes it hardest for me to be objective is that I have walked over that bridge for my own personal pleasure so many times over the decades that I consider it an old friend. It's my bridge.<br />Having said all that, I can say that Mr. McCullough has written a history that is not only about a bridge and its builders, which are fascinating subjects in their own right, but it is also about what New Yorkers were thinking back then. This was still a horizontal world; the era of early skyscrapers was a few decades away. Because of this and the rapid growth in population after the Civil War, Manhattan was mostrously choked by block after block of four- and five-story tenements, warehouses and factories. The need for a reliable means to get to the vast open spaces of Brooklyn was urgent. Ironically, however, it wasn't the horizontal--the length of the bridge--which stunned the witnesses to the construction. Instead they marvelled at the height of the towers and the height of the roadway over the East River.<br />Not as ironic, however, were the people who didn't marvel at the bridge's beauty and the strength of its construction. They were too busy licking their lips, wringing their hands and wondering how much of the bridge's budget would make its way into their wallets. The elements of corruption, then as now, always lurked near a great public work in New York. McCullough covers this tainted side just as carefully as he reports on the glory of the growth of the bridge. Heroes (the Roeblings) and villains (Tweed &amp; Co.) abound, while New York's most beautiful and efficient structure comes to life.<br />I've been as honest as possible. I recommend this book highly to anyone with an interest in engineering, New York history, or just a good story with great characters.<br />Rocco Dormarunno<BR>Instructor, College of New Rochelle	2003-09-26
962226:US	38610362	R2HNJFZ80RTXN5	0743223136	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An Overdue Tribute	Undeservedly, John Adams has not been given his own spotlight on history's stage. Perhaps he is overshadowed by the presidents who came immediately before and after his presidency (i.e., Washington and Jefferson). After all, Washington was an unwilling demigod in his time, and Jefferson was so intent and so good at building his own legacy while building his beloved Monticello that no one could compete. Adams' signing of the disastrous Alien and Sedition Acts has outweighed his many positive achievements, and this, too, further pushed him into the recesses.  <br />Even though Adams was aware that he possessed a great intellect and a strong will, he was resistant to vanity. Compare this to the glory/publicity seekers, like Hamilton, Franklin, Burr, and others, it becomes obvious that Adams was more focused on other, more important matters. He didn't even write his memoirs, as was customary back then. But thank God that he and his beloved wife, Abigail, wrote each other so often. These letters are some of the linchpins of David McCullough's brilliant biography which finally brings to light the great man who served as the young nation's second president. <br />I won't attempt to summarize the book or go over the details of Adams' life and politics. What I think is important to know is that this is a biography of intelligence and passion. We get alternating glimpses of John Adams the statesman, John Adams the loving parent and husband, and John Adams the melancholy loner. McCullough brings all this to life. The generous amount of illustrations served its purpose of making me see the human beings behind the words and documents. I can't say enough about this book except it deserves to be read, and that John Adams didn't deserve to wait so long to have such a tribute paid to him. Now, when I teach this part of American history to my classes, I always make sure to give John Adams equal time with Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Hamilton.<br />Rocco Dormarunno, author TheFive Points and The Five Points Concluded	2003-09-26

Some of this is familiar ground: the Burr/Hamilton rivalry; moving the nation's capitol from NYC to DC; the almost revered presence of George Washington no matter what the situation, etc. But some things had a very new spin on our perceptions of early America--I don't know if Mr. Ellis is the first to rename the \\"Founding Fathers\\" to \\"Founding Brothers', with the sibling squabbling it implies, but it certainly fits. Also the nagging issue of slavery and how the determined efforts to avoid confronting it would consequently bring the country to Civil War decades later, is a dark theme running throughout. This is an accomplished book that I would recommend to anyone interested in this period.	2003-09-25

Professor Spann's book fills that void. <br />Because of its powerful financial ties to the South's cotton industry, as well as its immigrants' fierce mistrust of emancipation, the City was undoubtedly the 'northernmost southern city'. On the other side of the coin, New York City stood to make fortunes on the war industry, and the Republican controlled State government was going to do its best to support the Union's effort. Because of these facts, the City was doomed to tear itself apart over and again throughout the conflict: the Draft Riots of 1863 being the most famous incarnation. Professor Spann's book not only covers these crucial elements, but features many others: the power of a manipulative press, the efficient rabble-rousing on both sides of the issue, the paranoia, the race/class/ethnic tensions, etc. <br />So, why four stars instead of five? Purely subjective reasons. First, the book makes several references to other works in order to just shoot them down. (The air of superiority crops up too often.) Also Professor Spann makes the point, several times, that the press--and the diaries of George Templeton Strong--were strongly biased and unreliable. Yet, the author often cites these works to shore up some of his arguments. I'm sure Professor Spann has a reason to trust certain articles or entries, I only wished I had. Still, this is a great read and a fascinating history that deserves attention	2003-09-17

Like Caleb Carr and Jack Finney, Victoria Thompson is one of the few writers to successfully utilize and represent this world without imposing our 21st Century values on it. <br />Murder on Mulberry Bend, specifically, best captures this fascinating cityscape. The unlikely team of midwife Sarah Brandt and Detective Sergeant Frank Malloy is a pleasure to watch interact. The tensions between them--romantic and professional--really come to a crisis point here. The murder mystery element of the book is what we've come to expect from Ms. Thompson: twisting, suspenseful, and completely satisfying. But this story gives us an added bonus: we get a very compelling hint as to who may have murdered Sarah's beloved husband, Tom. Read it and enjoy!	2003-09-12

But be warned: this is no Introduction to New York History 101 book, and definitely should not find itself on the top of any coffee table. This is a studious and sophisticated account of Gotham's fluid and, as the title states, unending role in the modern world's intellectual and cultural history. Fortunately, Professor Bender's ideas are clearly and reasonably presented, making for smooth reading.<br />One of the major riffs throughout the pieces is that because New York City was relieved of the duty of being the nation's capital, and because of the new talent and diversity that free market capitalism attracts and needs, the city has always been at the forefront of America's and the world's aesthetic and technological development. These elements also make the city so chimeric that it's never the same city from one day to the next. (Unfortunately, the events of 9/11/01 would seem to refute this. Those terrorists and their backers saw the city as the fixed center of America's wealth, greed, and power. Professor Bender's introduction acknowledges that the effects to New York of that day are still unknowable.) <br />This critical examination into the world that is New York is not only testimony its greatness, but also to the pride and passion Professor Bender has for it.	2003-09-10

For so many years I had read about the Native Americans who occupied this city, but the illustrations, maps and photos that accompany this complex narrative give it new, more vivid life for me. The experiences of the Dutch, African-Americans and British that followed are given a face, so to speak, by the detailed, but lively, narration. The graphics, especially of the extreme southern tip of Manhattan, are generous, clear, and highly educational for newcomers to and veterans of this history. (By the way, as a Brooklynite, I want to kiss the authors for covering all five boroughs, and not just focusing on Manhattan, as do most histories of NYC.) This is a book that can be enjoyed on so many levels. It is a great introduction to a relatively--and undeservedly--obscure subject.	2003-09-10

Mr. Mike Wallace is one of the few people who knows both and he has published a small book which should go a long way to save NYC from any more damage, and help it get back to the prestigious position it deserves. Mr. Wallace argues the case that the Federal Government must intervene on NY's behalf on a scale as great as FDR's WPA program. While such Federal intervention is hated by Wall Street and rural America alike, the book reasons that no other institution has the resources AND THE OBLIGATION to help America's greatest city. I am oversimplifying terribly the argument that Mr. Wallace puts forth, and there are a couple of arguments which seem to be a little too candy-coated. Still, I urge everyone to please pick up this book and decide for yourself. My only hope is that the people who can lead this charge (Mayor Bloomberg, Gov. Patkai, Senators Schumer and Clinton, President Bush) will be brave enough to do so. This is the time for courage.	2003-08-12

Re-reading Asbury's classic &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; was sort of like re-reading Homer's &quot;Iliad&quot; with its litany of battles and combatants, and because of its epic sweep. But also like &quot;The Iliad&quot; beware that these stories are terribly difficult to verify, and many border on myth. Having said that, I would still recommend this book to anyone wishing to get a sense of what 19th Century downtown NY was like. And I would also recommend it for the joyful flavor beneath Asbury's story-telling.	2003-06-04

The story of how Scorsese and his team captured, very accurately for the most part, the way The Five Points looked is itself worth the price. If there is anything negative to be said, it's that some of the photographs are not of the best quality. But I'm nitpicking. Treat yourself to this superb book!	2003-06-04

I am happy to say that Burrows and Wallace's GOTHAM was worth every second I spent poring through its pages. BOTH TIMES! GOTHAM is very compelling and very witty, and, at the same time, terrifying and troubling when you read about some of the atrocities committed on this tiny island. The treasure-trove of illustrations along the way only add to the enjoyment of the narrative. I can't recommend it highly enough. To me, however, the book is an important reminder that the history of New York City is richer, older, and more complex than the other US cities we tend to think of as historic, like Boston, Philadelphia, or DC. The history of New York City, laden with hope and tragedy, friction and cooperation, tolerance and intolerance, greed and charity, has never been given the majestic yet human voice it deserves, until now. GOTHAM lets you celebrate the history of New York as you learn about it. To me, that's worth every second of reading.	2003-01-29

While loaded with gorgeous illustrations, this is no coffee table book. This is a fact-filled guide to assist the serious student and amorous admirer through the intricacies of the greatest city on Earth. And unlike most books about New York City, this encyclopedia actually covers the other four boroughs, not just Manhattan! The enormous effort that went into this book will be gratefully acknowledged by anyone who reads it.	2003-01-29

I have a problem with his fundamental belief that life in New York City was more vital and enjoyable in the 19th Century than in the 20th (he seems to ignore the rampant disease, poverty, corruption and crime of that alleged Gilded Era), but if you just read it as fiction, it's unsurpassed fun.
