Her father decides to have the house remodelled and engages the services of genius architect Erik D'Anton, who has very strict conditions for his participation, one of which is that he will only visit at night. Watching from the window as he arrives, Marisa first notices the black Lamborghini, and then the cape that the visitor wears. Once he's inside and she is introduced, she realises why he is so reclusive. His face is ruined, destroyed by an accident when he was seven. He wears a mask to cover up the fact that he has no nose and his skin is puckered and discoloured. <br /> <br />Marisa is drawn to this enigmatic, disfigured stranger who speaks only in a whisper, and demands that her father invite him to dinner. Erik, who never accepts social invitations, agrees, because he is equally drawn to Marisa. That dinner-party begins an at first covert, and later open, relationship between the two. <br /> <br />This book reads like a thirteen-year-old's attempt at novel-writing. We have the poor, reclusive hero with the tragic past, the man no-one can reach. We have the beautiful, pure young maiden who is the only one to see past the scars and into his soul. We have Erik falling deeply in love with Marisa, pining for her, driven desperate by his love for her. We even have Marisa ending up seriously ill in hospital as a result of pining for Erik - and, naturally, her illness brings him back rushing to her side. And, after her father dies tragically, of course Erik puts his own needs aside and is there for her, even braving the stares of all and sundry as he ventures out - horrors! - in daylight. And, of course, he then marries her. <br /> <br />Oh, the melodrama! Oh, the self-indulgence! Oh, the Mary Sue effect! (If you don't know what a Mary Sue story is, Google it. It will sound surprisingly like this book).  <br /> <br />It's all so improbable. I mean, really! A 31-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl? Doesn't that strike anyone as ever so slightly... sick? Almost paedophilic, even. Especially as she was 15 when they first met. Whether she was 16 or 17 when they first had sex I don't recall, but either way had I been her father or her housekeeper I'd have called the police. But apart from that, what on earth would this intelligent, professional *adult* see in this spoilt, over-indulged child? That baffled me until, as the book dragged on, I realised that Erik is little more than a child himself. He hides from the world, stuck in his own little universe of self-pity. It's no wonder that he has his `assistant', Raskin, to look after him; he's not safe to be let out alone. <br /> <br />In fact, even ten, fifteen years later, when Erik and Marisa have been married for well over a decade, it's quite clear that neither of them could manage without Raskin and Kitty. Those two are the nursemaids looking after two mentally stunted thirteen-year-olds in adult bodies. Oh, poor me! Nobody loves me! Everybody hates me! I hate myself!  <br /> <br />Certain parts of the book had me rolling my eyes even more than others. When Marisa phones Erik, early on, to ask why he's avoiding her and asks why he hates her, I couldn't believe that he wasn't repulsed by her childish behaviour. But, no, he beats himself up for making her unhappy and actually invites her to spend time with him. And when she turns up in her *nightgown* night after night he never even comments, let alone suggests that she might consider dressing more appropriately.  <br /> <br />Then there's the whole question of Erik's face. Hasn't he ever heard of plastic surgery? Prosthetics? Sure, he had 22 skin grafts when he was a kid. But that was more than 20 years ago by the time the book starts. Isn't he aware of the advances in medical science? Does he really want to hide from the world that badly? Or is it that Vale Allen will stop at nothing to produce this pale travesty of Phantom of the Opera? <br /> <br />Oh, and then there's Marisa's problems with contraception. Hasn't Erik ever heard of condoms? <br /> <br />I agree with at least one other reviewer that it's astonishing this teenage diary fodder ever saw the light of day. What a waste of paper! <br /> <br />- wmr-uk <br />	2005-10-09

Beatrice, almost on the shelf at 23, has come back to London for what will be her fourth season after two years spent at home. This year she has to marry. Her father has made it clear that he wants her out of his care. She's finally resigned herself to giving up her dreams of love and romance, and is resolved to stop refusing suitors for whom she feels little more than liking. This year, she will find a husband. <br /> <br />Charles Summerson, Marquis of Pelham (Charles, not Derek as Ms Klausner says in her review) is Beatrice's next-door neighbour. He has no wish to marry. He's a rake and enjoys that state of being. He also enjoys staring at Beatrice's ankles from the upper-floor window as she lies on the grass in her garden reading. We can guess what's coming.  <br /> <br />Why did I throw the book across the floor? Because I am tired of coming across authors who write in this period of history and can't do even basic research. In fact, some of the errors in this book don't even have anything to do with history. If Elliott can't be bothered to get things right, why should I bother reading her book? Especially as I'm getting jerked out of it every few lines. <br /> <br />Charles is NOT Lord Summerson. He is Lord Pelham. His mother is the widowed Lady Pelham, not Lady Summerson or, heaven forbid, Lady Cynthia Summerson. His *sister* is correctly styled Lady Lucy Summerson: Lady Firstname Lastname is either an unmarried woman or a married women who outranks her husband (being the daughter of an earl or higher) so she carries her title into the marriage. <br /> <br />Beatrice's brother does NOT have a title. If he's the son of a viscount, then he's the Honourable Ben. And she's the Honourable Miss...  <br /> <br />Her aunt Louisa is Lady Sinclair. Not Lady Louisa. PLEASE get this right! <br /> <br />Charles' mother, a marchioness, asking Beatrice to call her by her first name? Please. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br />Charles, contemplating seducing an unmarried woman of his own class? He's not suicidal. Nor does he want to get married. He'd know very well that Beatrice is best avoided. Sure, he could flirt with her, but he'd take his sexual pleasures elsewhere - with married women or widows who are fair game, or with professionals. It just doesn't make sense that he'd plan to seduce Beatrice. <br /> <br />I'm now wishing that I'd left this book on the shelf instead of wasting good money on it. Still, the used bookstore will take it!	2005-10-06
45395:US	52631742	RQOQ4Y14BNFQQ	0821779427	995150613	One Night To Be Sinful (Zebra Debut)	Books	1	29	43	N	N	Should have picked a different period to write about	This debut novel seemed to offer an interesting premise: an English nobleman, as a favour to his best friend, takes the position of butler in the household of his friend's sister, Lady Abigail Wolcott, in order to find out what's behind the strange and dangerous happenings there. And Garver overcame my initial objection - how on earth would anyone mistake a marquess for a butler? - by making it clear that Calvin Garrett, the marquess, did not grow up in wealthy circumstances.  <br /> <br />The lead characters, Calvin and Abigail, are well-written. Abigail is independent, determined not to be dependent on anyone, and especially a man, ever since she was dumped by her fianc after becoming crippled in an accident he caused. Calvin, determinedly single though fond of women, thinks that he's entering the household of a middle-aged spinster and is taken aback to discover that his new employer is young and beautiful, despite the limp and the ugly leg-brace. The sexual and romantic tension between the two is well-portrayed and given time to develop. <br /> <br />But even with that promising start, the book has already started to go downhill. First, what unmarried lady lived alone in the eighteenth century without attracting the wrong kind of attention and being shunned by her neighbours? What kind of butler mucks out stables, drives a carriage, works in the fields and helps in the kitchens? What kind of aristocratic household gives its staff bedrooms suitable for guests rather than in the servants' quarters - and puts a male servant in a bedroom directly opposite that of the lady of the house? In what Regency-era household did servants eat with their employers, even with guests, and address their employers by their first name?  <br /> <br />There is far too much first-naming in this book in any case; while I might accept that Abigail has fallen into the habit of calling her women friends by their first names, why on earth would she use first names with a couple she has only just met? A couple who are clearly her social inferiors, so there is no way that they would be so familiar with her.  <br /> <br />And there were all the smaller errors: for example, Abigail is referred to as both Lady Abigail and Lady Wolcott, though she is unmarried so certainly cannot be the latter. The same is true for another character in the book, referred to by two different titles. The British title is marquess, not marquis - and we're never told what Calvin Garrett is marquess *of*. American expressions appear here and there, especially in dialogue: `off of', `you folks'. The assumption that Sheffield is a day's journey from London, when it would have been close to three. The lack of a personal maid for Abigail. The lack of servants to answer the door and announce Calvin when he calls on Abigail's ex-fianc in London. And so on. <br /> <br />I could have forgiven most of that on the basis that this is a debut novel and no doubt Garver will learn to do her research in future. But then it just got silly. Cardboard cut-out villains and melodramatic plots which I just couldn't take seriously for one second. And the totally predictable `event' which prevents Calvin telling Abigail about his true identity, leaving her to find out for herself and throw the predictable fit and order him out of her life. Yawn. As if I didn't see that one coming from 100 pages away.  <br /> <br />And the final straw... Calvin is *not* actually a marquess. Newsflash, Ms Garver: titles can only pass to *legitimate* offspring. Calvin's parents were not married to each other so, no matter the lack of alternative heirs, there is no way on earth that he could have inherited the title. I was dumbstruck by such an amateurish mistake. Where was Garver's editor? Do publishers simply not care any more?  <br /> <br />There may be those who would tell me that I should just enjoy the book at face value and stop nitpicking over errors, but that misses the point. Minor errors I can ignore. But when an author gets truly significant facts wrong that just insults my intelligence. When an author makes mistakes she could have avoided by doing a bit of simple research, it jolts me out of the story and tells me that she just doesn't care - about her readers, about her writing. And that is an author I don't care to read again. <br /> <br />- wmr-uk <br />	2005-09-19

There's a new magic show in town, and no-one can even begin to figure out how the mysterious Valerian does his amazing tricks. Daisy, a Las Vegas cop, goes to his performance out of curiosity and is as baffled as everyone else - and completely drawn, for no reason than she can imagine, to the handsome, enigmatic Valerian. <br /> <br />As he is to her - but then, he knows who she is. She is the latest incarnation of his beloved Brenna, killed seven hundred years ago. Ever since his creation as a vampire, he's encountered her about once every century, only to lose her again shortly afterwards. The omen of her death is always the same: a ruby ring, sent to her by an unknown donor. <br /> <br />This time, Valerian vows, he won't allow it to happen again. But the danger is even more apparent than usual, because someone is killing women all over town. Women he knows. The message is clear: his enemy is out to get him and, very soon, he will kill Daisy. Just so that the message comes across with no doubt whatsoever, warnings are being left for Daisy too.  <br /> <br />So far so not bad. Valerian, unlike a lot of vampire characters and in particular unlike the execrable, insipid Aidan in Lael Miller's appalling Forever and the Night, is not whiny. He likes being a vampire. He's perfectly happy with his life as it is - well, apart from the fact that he wants Brenna, now Daisy, back. A plus point for that. I liked Daisy too: she's resourceful, intelligent and doesn't swoon when she discovers Valerian's true nature. <br /> <br />But from there on the book takes a nosedive. Valerian sets out to find the vampire responsible for all the murders, the one who killed Brenna in each of her incarnations. This sends him on a search through time as well as most of the world, and this makes some of the plot from then on just silly. There's this, for starters: once Valerian finds out who his enemy is, why does he then have to beg for favours from all and sundry to find out where the othervampire currently is? And to get powers to kill him? Why not just go back in time and kill the guy before he ever becomes a vampire? That's a TSTL moment to start with. <br /> <br />But anyway, he finds the guy and they talk. They're going to fight and they agree some rules for the fight and the outcome, but then... nothing. Absolutely nothing. Days, even weeks go past and we're waiting for this big fight, and *nothing* happens. Now, given that the other vampire is very keen to kill Valerian and claim Daisy for himself, this makes no sense whatsoever. Nor do the deals Valerian makes with characters such as Nemesis and Dathan. The plot with Nemesis, whereby Valerian asks for the power to kill the other vampire in return for agreeing to accompany Nemesis to the pits of hell, seems only to be there to add extra unnecessary angst: the reader is supposed to be in agonies fearing that Valerian will die. But Nemesis in the end has *nothing* to do with Valerian killing the other vampire. The whole sub-plot was pointless. <br /> <br />There were other irritations - Valerian's brother being called Krispin instead of Crispin, which would have been more appropriate for the time; the human Valerian somehow managing to have enough energy to make love when he's half-dead from blood loss after being stabbed in the stomach; Valerian never once biting/drinking from Daisy; and Daisy *still* being condemned to die and reincarnate over and over again. I don't call that a good outcome. <br /> <br />Two stars for the non-whiny vampire, but otherwise this is going into the recycling pile. <br /> <br />- wmr-uk <br />	2005-09-17
52183:US	52631742	R2XZC8A7259EE3	0312934327	592337269	Sins of the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 8)	Books	3	13	15	N	N	Entertaining but frustrating	In Sins of the Night we're introduced to a new Dark-Hunter character, rejoicing in the somewhat unlikely name of Danger. (Her real name, Dangereuse, is no less likely, as it happens). She's based in Mississippi, and Dark-Hunters in the area are rebelling against Acheron. He's a Daimon in disguise. He's going to betray them all. He's going to kill them. He'll send his messenger of death, a man in a white suit, to murder them. So, they are arguing, they need to join with the Daimons and fight Acheron. <br /> <br />Danger isn't sure what she thinks of all this - but she knows exactly what's happening when a man in a white suit mysteriously appears in her home. She knows that he's come to kill her. So she kills him first... and is then astounded when, after turning to dust, he strolls back into her living-room. <br /> <br />Alexion is no ordinary man. In fact, Alexion isn't even his name; it's his title. He's Acheron's right-hand man and enforcer. When Dark-Hunters step out of line, Alexion is sent in to kill them. The only problem with this is that it's the first time we're seeing Alexion! He supposedly has lived in Kalosis with Acheron and Simi for centuries - so why has he never appeared in earlier books? Why, in fact, were we told in Dance with the Devil that when a Dark-Hunter goes bad there is a complex judging process?  <br /> <br />Okay. So, if we can overlook the reversal of Kenyon's own canon, Sins of the Night becomes the usual fun and excitement we can expect from Kenyon. Alexion and Danger are highly attracted to each other, but Danger is wary of casual sex and won't start a relationship which has no future. They both know it has no future because Alexion can't survive on Earth, in the guise of a mortal man, for more than a couple of weeks. Alexion is a former Dark-Hunter, the first to become a Shade (his story is told in the short excerpt at the back of the book, though it would have made FAR more sense for this to be a prologue. Some readers will have read this already, on Kenyon's website). Acheron saved Alexion from eternity as a Shade, but imperfectly. We're never told what form he has in Kalosis - a plot hole, in fact, because someone (no spoilers here &lt;g>) who has known him on Earth sees him in Kalosis and recognises him immediately. The body he uses in Mississippi - his own body when he was alive - is temporary.  <br /> <br />Alexion, however, hasn't had sex in over two hundred years, and he pursues Danger with determination. At the same time, though, there are Dark-Hunters willing to kill, and Alexion and Danger must fight them with no help whatsoever from Acheron - which is another part of the book which fell flat for me. Why would Acheron simply ignore their requests for help? Oh, sure, to make Kenyon's planned conclusion fall into place, but it felt forced for me. As did the sudden discovery that Dark-Hunters who become Shades aren't damned, doomed to walk the earth for eternity, unseen, unheard, forever hungry, thirsty and in pain. No: Dark-Hunters Acheron likes get something resembling a life back again. Only Dark-Hunters he doesn't like remain Shades. So is it really such a big deal? And maybe the rogue Dark-Hunters have a point, after all, if Acheron is really so prone to acting on whims and personal feelings.  <br /> <br />Not the best Dark-Hunter novel by far - I'd probably still place it above Night Embrace (Talon's book, which I really didn't like), but I'm hoping that the next book will be better - and will let us find out what's happened to Nick since Seize the Night. <br /> <br />- wmr-uk <br />	2005-09-15

Inspector Adrian Phillips tries to keep the peace along with his fellow police officers, but he has, in many people's eyes, become one of the enemy. <br /> <br />The enemy are the Yama, otherwise known as demons. The demons have fantastical powers, and also a very hierarchical structure. Their aristocracy, the daimyos, do not mix with humans unless they can avoid it - like Lord Herrington, the Yamish ambassador to Avvar. Some of the rohn, the Yama underclass, are criminals but, because of their powers, they are difficult for the human police force to subdue. Because of that, Adrian has been enhanced by demon technology: he has implants which allow him greater strength, speed and so on. But these implants now have made him a near-outcast. His wife threw him out, and he's almost a pariah at work. <br /> <br />One night, pursuing a missing child whom no-one else seems to care about, Adrian is attacked and almost dies. His rescuer is a beautiful young woman, Roxanne. She too is an outcast: Adrian assumes that she's a prostitute, but she's actually the illegitimate daughter of a famous music-hall singer. They begin a relationship, but Adrian is convinced that once Roxanne knows about his implants she won't want to be with him. However, he doesn't know about her own secret, the secret she doesn't know herself until her father shows himself in her life. <br /> <br />Against the backdrop of an inventive twist on Victorian society - the atmosphere is so vividly written that I almost felt myself walking down cobbled streets lit by gaslight - and several, in the end integrated, side-plots involving a doctor experimenting on missing kids, political plots involving the daimyos and Lord Herrington's conflicted loyalties, Adrian and Roxanne's romance is played out with sensuality and emotion. Holly is definitely an author to watch!  <br /> <br />- wmr-uk <br />	2005-09-15

Try this book. Works like a dream. <br /> <br />Seriously, I bought this book because I love romance and also enjoy some elements of the supernatural, such as vampires. The book seemed to offer the right sort of combination - or so I thought. I was wrong. <br /> <br />Susan Krinard's Kiss of the Wolf started vaguely promisingly, but I quickly found it increasingly difficult to turn the pages. LA plastic surgeon trying to find herself goes to the Louisiana bayou - well, naturally, where else would she go? - and stumbles into a mystery involving a dead distant relative to whom she bears an uncanny resemblance.  Like you do. And, of course, she also encounters a couple of werewolves and a murdering thug in nice-guy clothing. Falls into bed with Werewolf 1 not long after, despite his surly behaviour, and promptly falls in love with him and realises how much she loves the bayou despite there being not a lot of need for plastic surgeons in deepest Louisiana. Yeah, right. Yawn. <br /> <br />Novella 2 appeared to offer a little more promise. Tanith Lee's Shadow Kissing was apparently about a haunted apartment, yet it wasn't really. Though there was a seemingly self-propelling statue, also bearing a striking resemblance to a character in the novella. Between irritating minor characters (including one with the unlikely name of Cinnamon) and a so-called hero who was a complete jerk, I don't know what there was to like about this. Plus, although Lee got some of the English nuances correct, there were several references that jarred given the setting was London and the characters English. <br /> <br />And finally - yes, finally I got close to the end! - there was Novella 3. The Devil She Knew, by Evelyn Vaughan. Mercy of mercies, this one was about 40 pages shorter than the other two. Woman finds a strange fire in her walk-in closet. Like you do. Woman figures out within about ten seconds that she's got a portal to hell in her bedroom. Of course!Naturally, that's the first conclusion one would jump to. And when she calls her friendly maintenance man - whom we progressively discover manages, and in fact owns, her building - he naturally jumps to the same conclusion. This one went on and on, despite being shorter. But once the author got over wasting pages and pages on irrelevant, boring stuff (such as lunch with the heroine's family) and they suddenly, by amazing coincidence, figure out who's behind it and go visit the guy (hey, did you curse me with the fires of hell? Um... maybe), everything is skimmed over so quickly that it's completely unclear what actually happened. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money. This one is going straight to the recycling pile, and all three authors are on my `forget it!' list! <br /> <br />wmr-uk	2005-08-15

Greatly enjoyed Miss Wonderful. Was excited when I discovered that Mr Impossible is a sequel to Miss Wonderful, with one of Alastair's six brothers as the hero. And yet... and yet I was bored and struggled to finish the book. <br /> <br />Why? Because it's less of a romance novel than it is a guide to Egyptology in the early nineteenth century. It's less of a romance novel than it is a mystery/thriller. Sure, there was a romance between Daphne and Rupert, but it's squeezed in between so much else that it's hard to follow. If I omitted everything about the pyramids, papyri, cartouches, the desert, gangsters, descriptions of sandstorms. and some quite gruesome descriptions of torn-apart mummies, people being fed to crocodiles, scapegoats being savagely beaten and beheaded, I'd probably be left with a romance novella of about 40 pages instead of a 300-page novel. <br /> <br />Daphne Pembroke would, in these days, be a professor at a university, heading excavations to Egypt and giving lecture tours. In the early nineteenth century, she is what's known as a bluestocking. She hides her knowledge, using her brother Miles Archdale as cover - he publishes her pamphlets under his name and so on. Her marriage, to a man much older than she and who was threatened by her intelligence, taught her that men do not like, approve of or feel attracted to women who are interested in scholarship. This is a plotline which should interest me - and did, but Chase went over the top in including the results of her research in this novel. <br /> <br />Rupert Carsington is supposedly a hellion/troublemaker/useless waste of space and has been attached to the foreign office to get him out of the way. He was sent to Egypt pretty much because it's as far away from civilisation as he can be sent. His basic sense of ethics gets him into trouble when he saves a man from being beaten to death; for his interference he is thrown into a prisonin Cairo, from where Daphne rescues him on condition that he help her find her brother, who has been kidnapped - supposedly for his Egyptian knowledge. <br /> <br />Rupert is supposed to be all brawn and no brains. That's certainly not true - he demonstrated a lot of intelligence and understanding, and a sharper mind than many men with whom Daphne has come into contact. We're never told what he did to be sent abroad - why not? This, surely, is relevant?  <br /> <br />I liked Rupert. I liked Daphne. I just didn't like their `romance', such as it was. I see, however, that Chase is probably going to write the story of the eldest son Benedict next, so as long as she doesn't set that in a North African souk I'll be back to read it. <br /> <br /> <br />wmr-uk <br />	2005-06-05

Magical tales of love and seduction, the cover promises. Stories of sirens and other daemon lovers. On the back cover, we're told `Prepare to be seduced by powerful magic... twenty-two tales of unearthly temptations wickedly concocted by some of today's most potent literary conjurers... Lie back, relax and submit to the darkest delights you have ever experienced.' <br /> <br />Can I sue for misrepresentation?? <br /> <br />To say that this book failed to live up to expectations is putting it mildly. I should have known when the editors' introduction put me to sleep after only a page. Then I began reading the novellas... and couldn't believe what I was reading. The first was just weird, and with a writing style which completely failed to capture my attention. The second had a potentially interesting story, but written in such awful purple prose that I wanted to scream at the author to learn to write. And then there was Joyce Carol Oates' effort... WHAT the heck was that supposed to be? It had no beginning and no ending. It just started and finished. As for the content, I was left shaking my head, and even after I read the final half-page again was still baffled as to what it was supposed to be. In the authors' notes at the end of the book, I discovered that this was actually part of a novel. Huh? What was the point of that? I thought this was supposed to be a collection of novellas, not extracts! <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Oates' contribution was not the worst, or the most boring. Several others nearly sent me to sleep; others still left me rolling my eyes or wondering where the ending was when I read the final line. Why do these writers not seem to have a clue how to finish a novella? Is the reader supposed to invent an ending? And then there were the stories which just made me go `Huh? What the hell was that all about?' - Persephone and The Light That Passes Through You being examples. O For a Fiery Gloom and Thee and Taking Loup had me skimming after a few tedious paragraphs. <br /> <br />A small handful of stories were somewhat enjoyable - The Eye of the Storm, though it took too long to get going and ended too soon; A Wife of Acorn Leaf and Stone had potential, but again was under-developed. The Scent of Bitter Bark and Clove and The House of Nine Doors both needed to be full-length novels; both were promising, but ended far too soon and with inadequate character development.  <br /> <br />Don't waste your money. This book should be advertised as offering Tedious Unfinished Meanderings of Weirdness and Drug-Induced Insanity. <br /> <br /> <br />wmr-uk <br />	2005-04-06

For, even as she knows she should cut him dead, she thinks he's the sexiest, most attractive man she's ever met. Even as they argue, even as he shows her how much he disapproves of her, the two of them realise that they find each other irresistible. <br /> <br />But it's not as simple as that. How can it be? There's Tabitha's family to think about, plus over two thousand years of conditioning on Valerius's part, training him never to care about anyone, never to get involved. After all, nobody has ever cared about him, so why risk rejection? Plus, any time he did try to help someone - Zarek, his family's slave Agrippina, others - he ended up hurting them. Sometimes killing them. He can't possibly take that risk with Tabitha, even if she does seem to be the only person he's ever known who actually *likes* him.  <br /> <br />But they don't have a choice about getting involved with each other. For Daimons are on the march, more dangerous than ever. One in particular wants revenge on Tabitha and her sister and is determined to kill them all. Acheron is worried and instructs Valerius to protect Tabitha, while he himselfprotects Kyrian, Amanda and their daughter - after all, Kyrian is mortal now. However, some evils appear to be too great for even Ash to handle... or are they? <br /> <br />Yet another tortured hero in this book, which I adore. What's even better, though, is that we get to find out more about Ash. In particular, we learn what I'd been guessing at: he's no simple Dark-Hunter, even if he was once a mortal. I won't spoil the exact nature of that revelation; read it for yourself. There's also a fascinating development regarding Nick the Squire, which again you'll have to read for yourself. In all, a gripping, exciting and very satisfying Dark-Hunter novel, and Kenyon is still keeping me hooked on the series. Can't wait for Acheron's own story, coming when, Kenyon?? <br /> <br />wmr-uk <br />	2005-03-10

Her partner, Stormy, is coming with her, and Maxine is desperately trying to persuade her old friend Lou to join them. A former cop and 18 years older than Max, Lou claims to be too old and burned-out to be of any use to Max. However, Max has been in love with Lou for years and is determined to prove to him that her feelings are real. <br /> <br />She persuades Lou to help them move, but no sooner do the three arrive in Maine than another old friend calls them for help. His teenage sister has disappeared and he needs them to find her. They travel to Endover, New Hampshire, and find themselves in the middle of what almost seems like Zombie-ville. It doesn't take Maxie and Lou long to realise that there's a vampire around. Their previous experience with vampires has taught them that not all of the breed are bad, but this one seems to be a rogue. He's holding Jason's sister captive, has the town in his thrall and seems keen on killing Lou and capturing Maxie and Stormy. In the meantime, Stormy seems to be suffering from some sort of mental disturbance - could she have been possessed by some figure from the vampire's past? And who is this vampire, anyway? <br /> <br />Blue Twilight is a direct continuation of Embrace the Twilight, the story of Morgan and Dante. Shayne has now returned to finish the story of Maxine and Lou, who were by far the more interesting characters in Embrace the Twilight; in my review of the earlier book I mentioned my frustration that Max and Lou's relationship was left in limbo. Well, now, finally, three books later, Shayne has at last given us that closure. But only in part. Because the vampire, who calls himself the Prince, was introduced right in the prologue to the book and is clearly a fascinating character. We learn his identity in the final chapter. But we don't get his story here. For that, we have to wait for Twilight Prince, not available until 2006. And so, yet again, I'm frustrated by a Shayne novel.  <br /> <br />At least I enjoyed Blue Twilight, so the frustration's not as intense as with Twilight Hunger, which I thought was poor. But still, I'm left feeling that - despite Lou and Maxie's relationship apparently resolved - I've been teased. The book felt short; a lot more could have been covered in here. We could have had the vampire's story too. Instead, we got half a book, and that's just not good enough. <br /> <br />wmr-uk <br />	2005-03-08

Now Dominic needs Devon's help: he's disappeared in Napoleonic France and hasn't been heard of for three months. Devon's vow - that he would come to Dominic's aid even if he has to come from the pits of hell - is about to be fulfilled. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Julie de Valm is on the run; her father revealed himself to her as a spy for the English just before he told her to get out of Paris and killed himself. She has to make contact with the Limping Man - whom Dominic recognises as Dominic. Together, they travel back to Paris and have to find and rescue Dominic - and even then their troubles are not over, since they still have to escape from France. <br /> <br />I did enjoy this book, but found it far from engrossing. Early on, when Devon allowed himself to be diverted from his search for Dominic to chase after the Gypsy boy (who turned out to be Julie), it seemed as if his loyalty to the man who'd saved his life and who he declared to be his closest friend was not so great. It was, after all, purest chance that Julie turned out to be a link to Dominic's whereabouts. Later, I felt that Wilson was glossing over too much detail - the journey back to England, Devon's decision once they got there, and in particular Avon and Emily. Why on earth does Avon not want to see Emily - the wife he adores and from whom he's been parted for four months, thinking he'd never see her again - once he returns home? Why, when she turns up at his estate - and how did she know he was there? - does he let her think that Julie is his mistress? That seemed like hurtful power-play of the worst kind, and not in character for the man we met in The Heart's Desire. And then Wilson simply glossed over the aftermath of that, providingus with no Emily and Dominic scenes.  <br /> <br />Still, Devon and Julie make a good couple, and the book is eminently readable. But after The Heart's Desire it's somewhat disappointing. <br /> <br />wmr-uk <br />	2005-02-27

Did I read a different book from everyone else below? <br /> <br />This book was AWFUL. From terrible grammar to inability to manage point of view to silly characters to ridiculous, unbelievable plots to, ultimately, a book which made me want to scream. I actually felt like throwing it away after only three pages. I should have done it then, actually; by the time I made it to the end of the book I swore I would never read anything by this author ever again. <br /> <br />Lansdowne invents new speech verbs all over the place. 'He nodded' is supposed to be a speech verb, as is 'she smiled' or 'he sighed' and similar non-speaking actions. Ms Lansdowne, if someone nods at me I don't hear entire sentences! Not unless s/he SPEAKS at the same time!  <br /> <br />And her perspective is all over the place. I no sooner get used to being in one character's head when, hey presto, I'm in another. And another. And yet another. I'm getting dizzy trying to take in so many people's points of view! Has Ms Lansdowne ever heard of picking a viewpoint character and *staying* with that character for an entire scene? Try it. It's refreshing. And easy on the reader, too! <br /> <br />The characters. What an idiotic assembly! So Whit is supposed to be an amateur detective, yes? Therefore, one assumes, sharp-witted, intelligent and not easily fooled? So why does he allow his mother to pull stupid tricks on him all the time? Why is he apparently taken in by the incredibly thin tale dreamt up by the clichd runaway heiress? And why does he not get impatient by Honor's continued butting in to his plans? As for the clichd runaway heiress, I was rolling my eyes. Apart from the simply incredible plot at this point, I couldn't understand why everyone didn't just tell her to grow up and stop being so pathetic (as well as telling so many lies).  <br /> <br />There are times when I wish that Amazon would allow reviews to give a zero-star rating. This is one book which definitely deserves it. A true stinker.  <br /> <br />wmr-uk	2005-01-29

Acknowledged by his father, nevertheless he is still a bastard and heir to nothing. At the tender age of sixteen, he encounters a beautiful young girl, a guest at his father's home, Jeanne Morrisette, the daughter of a French nobleman. They fall in love - but Jeanne, persuaded by her worried father that Robert couldn't possibly love her, cruelly rejects him, saying that she could never love a bastard. Devastated, Robert runs away and joins the army as a common soldier instead of accepting the commission his father would have bought for him. <br /> <br />Many years later, they meet again in Portugal; Robert, now promoted to Captain, is carrying out commissions for Wellington while recovering from a battle-wound. At a ball, he meets the Marquesa, the beautiful widow of a Portuguese noble whom all the British officers fall over themselves to impress... and realises that she is his Jeanne. And, since she is French, she's probably a spy - so, when Wellington instructs him to work with the Marquesa, he is very wary of her.  <br /> <br />And thus begins a sort of 'road story'; they have to travel some distance together, and en route she - not having recognised Captain Blake as her Robert - tries to seduce him, while he refuses to play her games of flirtation. Then, when  under Wellington's orders Robert has to travel into Spain and allow himself to be captured by the French, Jeanne ingratiates herself with her French compatriots - again on Wellington's orders - to make Robert's treatment worse. It's a complicated - and, at this point, somewhat incredible, plot. <br /> <br />But what I disliked more than the plot in this book were the characters of Robert and Jeanne. I had little time for Jeanne because although she had plenty of time, once they had fulfilled their mission, to tell Robert the truth about herself, she persisted in allowing him to believe the worst about her. Robert I disliked because he seemed occasionally to behave violently purely for the sake of it. As for romance, there was none of it in this book beyond the first chapter. What Robert and Jeanne had between them was lust, not love. <br /> <br />As Balogh's books are always better-written than most authors' work, it was still very readable and had enough interesting material to keep my attention, but while this will remain on my Balogh bookshelf I'm unlikely to want to read it again.  <br /> <br />wmr-uk	2005-01-05

Much as he loves Lucien and his bride-to-be, Kate, their demands are really intruding on his calm, ordered life. Now things are about to get worse: Kate's cousin Terri is flying in from England for the wedding and she needs somewhere to stay. In Bastien's penthouse.     So not only does he have to listen to his brother spouting about love and weddings incessantly, he's going to have to put up with sharing his home for the next two weeks. That would be bad enough for anyone used to living on his own; but considering that Bastien is a vampire and needs to drink blood regularly in order to remain healthy, it's a recipe for disaster. Oh, not that he actually drinks from humans - these vampires have it all sorted. Owning their own private blood-bank helps.     This is the third in Sands' vampire series, following Lucien and Kate's story in Single White Vampire and Etienne and Rachel's in Love Bites. Unfortunately, it feels as if it were written by a completely different author. Tall, Dark and Hungry has none of the frothy humour of the first two books. Instead, it is boring, repetitive and flat. It was a real struggle to finish. There's no humour this time - there are attempts at it, but all so ponderous that none of them work. Instead, as another reviewer comments, we are treated to page after page of descriptions of things we really don't need to know. Information is supplied in a mundane, uninteresting manner. Trivial details are given the importance of earth-shattering events. The book was incredibly disappointing.    Even the minor characters were tedious; I liked Chris, Kate's fellow editor, in Single White Vampire, but in this book he's a whiny pain in the [...]. And yet Terri notes, by the time of the wedding, that he's a nice guy! Excuse me? He's been nothing but a nuisance to all of them, whining and moaning and accident-prone as hell, complaining about absolutely everything and getting up everyone's nose. And yet she says he's nice? Um... how? As for Vincent, the campy actor, he had his moments but overall I could have done without him.    And then the Big Misunderstanding... big yawn here.     Sorry, Ms Sands, but this book was a flop. If there is another book in your vampire series - and I would like to read Lissianna and Greg's story - please rediscover your earlier flair.	2004-11-26

His friend Eustace, Earl of Devere, is pestering him to spy on the woman whom Eustace's family want him to marry - an heiress, but he's never met her and she could be ugly, or a shrew. Anxious to escape his sister, Nez agrees to help Eustace, and duly assumes the role of a chocolate-selling merchant and has an accident in his carriage - but worse than he'd planned - outside Libby Ames' home. She takes him in and, with the help of the local doctor, squire's son Anthony Cook, nurses him. <br /> <br />What Nez doesn't know, though, is that Libby has a cousin, Lydia, with whom she and her mother and mentally-handicapped brother live. Lydia, who has just departed for Brighton, is the heiress. Libby is ineligible; her mother was the daughter of a tobacconist, and her father was disinherited and disowned for marrying her. Between them, Libby and the doctor discover that Nez is an alcoholic - he drinks to forget the horrors of Waterloo - and so, while the injuries from his accident are quickly healed, they make him stay so that they can wean him off alcohol. <br /> <br />And so the `chocolate merchant' and Libby spend time together, and become close. Libby also spends a lot of time with the doctor - Anthony - during this time, and the overweight, bumbling, somewhat ugly man she's always seen as a figure of fun turns out to be solid, dependable and an excellent listener, as well as a cool hand in a crisis. A kiss from Nez appears to seal Libby's fate... until Anthony kisses her too. And then all is revealed about Nez's identity, and Libby receives two proposals... one later amended to a proposition once the duke discovers Libby's ineligibility. <br /> <br />But which man does she love? And, assuming that Nez changes his mind, whom should she marry? <br /> <br />It is extremely difficult to `cheer' for one suitor over another; Carla Kelly does an excellent job of making us like both. Both have flaws: the duke's pride, the doctor's tendency to secretiveness and withdrawal. Both have positive, even heroic, traits. One can offer Libby so much more, in terms of material things, than the other, while the other cannot even offer dependability in terms of always being there when she needs him - he is always on call, to the point of sometimes not sleeping for days on end when needed by patients. Nez would cherish her; Anthony is practical and would see her as a partner and helpmate.  <br /> <br />A memorable, out of the ordinary novel about characters who ring true and who stayed in my head for hours after I had finished it - highly recommended. One of Kelly's best! There is a sequel: One Good Turn - and, as at least one other reviewer has commented, it makes no sense at all that her publisher did not include this with LLM instead of Miss Chartley's Guided Tour. <br /> <br />And speaking of which... MISS CHARTLEY'S GUIDED TOUR <br /> <br />Miss Omega Chartley, a schoolmistress, is changing jobs and has several weeks in which to make the journey from the south-west to the north, where her new school is located. So she embarks on a guided tour, something which she has promised herself for some time to do. Unfortunately, her plans are very soon disrupted when she helps a young boy to escape from a Bow Street Runner and finds herself penniless and on the run. She and the boy fall in with a wounded former soldier and his adopted daughter, and the four of them go in search of the boy's uncle, a viscount.  <br /> <br />The viscount turns out to be Matthew Bering, Omega's former fianc and the man who ditched her at the altar eight years ago. She never knew why he had failed to turn up for their wedding; he never explained, nor replied to any correspondence subsequently. She has told herself for years that she hateshim. Yet when she sees him again she falls in love with him all over again.  <br /> <br />What was his reason for abandoning her at the altar? How does he feel about her now? Is there any possibility of a second chance for the two of them?  <br /> <br />As is her usual habit, Carla Kelly creates convincing and likeable characters, and this is as true of her secondary characters as much as the hero and heroine. I found myself at times warming to Omega's soldier companion, Hugh, even more so than to Matthew, and hoping at one point that Omega would marry Hugh. <br /> <br />My main problem with Miss Chartley's Guided Tour is that Matthew's explanation for his jilting of Omega, when we finally hear it, sounds very far-fetched - and Matthew's own reaction to the events of eight years ago, the way he has closed himself off from the world, just sounds like the behaviour of a coward and an idiot. Did he question nothing? Was he so wrapped up in his own feelings that he never gave a single thought to how he had hurt Omega? When he heard about her father's death and *knew* that she was left penniless, did he have no feelings at all? The way he lives, cloistered in his country estate and with an entire wardrobe of clothes ordered especially for Omega kept in his closets, reminds me somewhat of Miss Havisham in Dickens' Great Expectations: this is a man who is shutting himself off from reality and living in some sort of cobwebby fantasy of the past. To me, that's not a romantic hero. <br /> <br />However, the writing itself and the other characters merit three stars; Matthew is simply one of Kelly's less successful heroes.  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Kelly's and haven't read either of these two, you'll want to get this anthology. If you already have Libby's London Merchant, then this book probably isn't worth buying just for Miss Chartley's Guided Tour. <br /> <br />wmr-uk <br /> <br />	2004-11-08

Lauren, just starting college, is wary of men and of love. She's been burned too many times before. She also knows that men hate competitive women who can beat them at anything they like to feel good at. Yet the first time she meets Ben she's pitching to him in softball. She strikes him out... and he isn't angry! Gradually, that first encounter leads to friendship, and before long he's the best friend she's ever had. He gets along well with her family too, especially her favourite brother, with whom he has some shared history. But can he be trusted with her heart?    This is a sweet, romantic story of best friends learning to become more. As we read, we discover that it's not only Lauren's past which threatens the trust between them, and that love is never just handed out on a plate. Will Ben and Lauren have a love beyond tomorrow?    I found this book hard to get into at first; it is a Mormon romance and, as such, laden with references to the Mormon faith and living it on a daily basis. As such, Klingler caters very well to her intended audience, who will, I am sure, love it. For those not part of the Mormon church, or who aren't accustomed to overt religious references in their romance reading, these parts may jar - especially when we see that if Ben wants to marry Lauren his family will not be allowed to attend the ceremony. But it's easy enough to whizz past them and enjoy this book for what it is: a well-written romance debut by a promising author.     I hope to see more from Klingler and particularly hope that she publishes a mainstream romance.    wmr-uk	2004-11-08

Until then, she is subject to the whims and wishes of her guardian, Trent Severn, whom she hasn't seen for fifteen years - since her father's funeral, in fact. Severn himself seems to take no interest in her or her affairs, refusing most of her requests with curt letters signed with almost insulting politesse. <br /> <br />However, an unexpected meeting between the two makes Amy realise that Severn isn't quite the unfeeling, harsh guardian she thought he was - and he realises that she isn't the child he, for some reason, still believed her to be. However, anguish and heartache in Trent's past make him convinced that he would be a disastrous husband for any decent young woman, and so he tries to marry Amy off to his best friend.  <br /> <br />Thus far, not bad - the characters are reasonably sympathetic and, apart from problems to be returned to below, the story is entertaining.

Quite apart from the fact that this type of 'biscuit' is an American invention which never found its way across the Atlantic, did they exist in 1816?  <br /> <br />Trent Severn is not a credible character. He is supposedly a gentleman, and yet he has three businesses: a shipping line, a foundry and a legal practice. Gentlemen did not engage in trade. Tradesmen did not mix with the gentry. It was as simple as that. He might know members of the gentry and nobility; he might do business with them and even, in rare circumstances, enter their homes. But never would he mix with them on equal terms. And as for suggesting to Lord Marsh that Draco run his foundry... that would have been an insult. <br /> <br />Trent, in his legal practice, apparently represents female clients in divorce cases. What universe are we in here? Divorce in the nineteenth century was, first, extremely rare. Second, divorce cases were argued in Parliament, in the House of Lords. Only (very wealthy) husbands could sue for divorce; wives could not, and wives had no voice in the proceedings. And, while on the subject of marriage, married women could not, in law, own property, so how could Trent tell Amy that, when they married, she would own half of the businesses?  <br /> <br />Incidentally, Trent is also considered dissolute and scandalous - because he's had five affairs in ten years. Is that all?! In the Regency period, that would have been nothing at all remarkable.  <br /> <br />Does Miller know much about Regency life and customs? The comment is made in passing that Lord Vair's daughter, aged 17, had a few years yet before she would need to come out. Girls - young women - could come out at as young as 16! The norm was 17 or 18. Amy, at almost 25 and never 'brought out', was very definitely on the shelf. The manners and behaviour of characters generally is also wrong: Diana, Draco's sister, for example, is far too openly rude, as are other characters. Subjects which would never have been topics of conversation for women - and especially unmarried women - are openly aired in front of them. As just one example, gentlemen would never mention to a woman that a duel was to take place. <br /> <br />Further on the subject of manners, the lack of chaperonage isn't credible. Nor is the continual usage of first names; in an era where even married couples did not always use each other's first name, this casual familiarity from first meetings is simply wrong and, like so much else, jolted me out of the story time and again. <br /> <br />Finally, Miller needs the services of a good copy-editor! First, the Frenchman is not a Compte - unless Miller intended to suggest that he is an accountant! - he's a Comte. Second, there are tense switches - into present tense in narrative; there are many errors in punctuation; and also errors in grammar: for example, 'felt badly' instead of 'felt bad'. Presumably Miller did not mean that Trent has no sense of touch? <br /> <br />Avoid this book.  <br /> <br />wmr-uk <br />	2004-08-31

But, although she was fond of Stephen and they spent many hours together talking and playing chess, she wanted excitement, and so she accepted the proposal of Hal Gardeyne, a noted Corinthian and son of a viscount. Now, Laura is widowed, and Stephen, now an MP, wants to try again. So he finds an excuse to visit her home one month away from the end of her period of mourning, hoping to get in first and begin courting her before a more dashing man can cut him out once more. <br />Laura, now mother to the three-year-hold heir to the Caldfort title, is terrified that her brother-in-law, vicar of the Caldfort living, plans to bring about the death of little Harry in order to inherit the title himself. But she can?t take Harry away from the Caldfort estate, cold and unwelcoming as it is, because his grandfather won?t allow her to take him away for more than a few days at a time. So she?s trapped there. When Stephen arrives, she is nursing Harry back to health after a poison scare - was it deliberate or accidental? So she is in no fit state to welcome a former suitor, especially a man whom she laughed at when he proposed to her during her engagement to Hal. <br /> <br />But the discovery of a possible claimant to the Caldfort title, who would displace not only Harry and his uncle but the current holder too, affords Laura an opportunity to get away from Caldfort. She decides to investigate to find out whether Henry Gardeyne, her husband?s cousin, really is alive, and Stephen, seizing an opportunity, comes with her to help her. And thus begins a journey through the West Country, some of it in disguise, taking in Redoaks and Crag Wyvern, meeting again Nicholas and Eleanor and David Kerslake, soon to be Earl of Wyvern.  <br /> <br />The dramatic plot to this book really doesn?t hold the attention. I was not at all interested in whether Jack Gardeyne really was trying to kill his nephew, nor in thequestion of whether the other Henry Gardeyne was really alive. The sneaking around, rummaging through other people?s correspondence and listening through walls and doors was not only uninteresting, it was somewhat distasteful - and surprising, given Stephen?s position as an MP and lawyer and the efforts of the other Rogues, in earlier books and spelled out in this book, to keep Stephen away from anything questionable. The fact that this part of the plot moves very slowly does not help. <br /> <br />I?m still not sure whether I liked Laura or not. Is she sensible, intelligent and thoughtful, or a flighty flibbertigibbet? She doesn?t seem to know herself, and I acknowledge that this is part of the journey: she married young, at 18, when she was flighty and valued title and good looks above character. She seems to have become sensible enough for Stephen, and I did enjoy their philosophical conversations. But she kept changing her mind about herself and her intentions, which was frustrating.  <br /> <br />I did like Stephen, whom I didn?t know very much about; his role in previous Rogue books has been limited. Some reviewers seem to be complaining about the lack of sensual content; I?d strongly disagree here. There is quite a bit of sexual tension, which is enjoyable, and the sexual content is about right. For me, St Raven was overly laden with sex scenes, and less interesting as a novel as a result.  <br /> <br />It was also good, as always, to see Nicholas and Eleanor again; disappointing not to see other Rogues, however - no advance on Hal and Blanche?s story here - and somewhat irritating to have the Kerslake/Wyvern connection, since Demon?s Mistress (Con?s story, set at Crag Wyvern) is my least favourite Rogues novel and I really disliked the characters and setting. I even find myself hoping here that Beverley isn?t setting up David Kerslake as a future hero... <br /> <br />Overall, far from Beverley's best - some of the other Rogue books are far, far better than this one. <br /> <br />wmr-uk <br />	2004-07-31

In leasing her first premises, she meets good-looking Rob Smith, ostensibly a carpenter, and they start an affair. But Rob is not the carpenter he appears; he's a former Marine and former owner of his own computer business, gone into hiding after a family tragedy. They start to work together when Rob offers his investigative skills to help Val in her quest to prove a man on death row innocent of the murder of a cop.<br />The romance in this book is very flat. Val and Rob have sex - wham bam - and then they have sex again, and again, and then Rob is suddenly talking moving in and even marriage. Wait a minute... where's the wooing? Where's the heartfelt discussions? Where, for heaven's sake, is the *romance* which Putney includes in spades in other novels? Val apparently has a problem with commitment, but this is told to us - in fact, we're beaten over the head with it - rather than it being shown. And a two-year-old could have worked out why she has this problem; yet it seems to come as a massive discovery to both Val and Rob. Well... duh! I felt like saying.<br />Sorry - there was really no romance in this book worth talking about. At least, not between the two main characters. The love story which does provide some interest, however, is that between Kendra, Val's assistant, and the man on death row, Daniel, the father of Kendra's now-adult son. <br />As for the preachy part, this book is a polemic against the death penalty. Now, I should have no problem at all about that, since I am vehemently opposed to capital punishment and find it abhorrent. Putney should have been preaching to the converted here. And yet I felt patronised, lectured to and bored by this part of the book. Sure, all her arguments resonate with me - but that's not why I buy aMary Jo Putney romance novel. I did find the plot itself, as regards the attempt to prove Daniel's innocence, interesting but, again, I didn't buy a crime/detective novel. I thought I was buying a romance novel.<br />I have now read three contemporary novels and one novella by Putney, and in every case they failed to live up to the standard set by her historical romances. Put this next to Thunder and Roses, or The Rake, or The Wild Child, and it pales drastically by comparison. Dull characters, next to the vibrance of Nicholas or Reginald or Clare. Preachy plot, next to her emotional, heartrending plotline about the effect of alcoholism in The Rake. <br />This was a huge disappointment. And, since I see that Putney now appears to be venturing into paranormal in her latest novel, I am not sure that she will be on my auto-buy list any more either. Such a shame, when about a year ago I'd have rated her as one of my top three favourite authors. <br />wmr-uk	2004-07-04

This book is the story of a divorced woman (Saskia) and her four daughters, in which one daughter thinks that she's pregnant when she's right on the point of dumping her much-older boyfriend, two other daughters have both lost men they thought they cared about, and the youngest daughter thinks that Saskia's boyfriend is actually her father - which makes her real father, who wants Saskia back, pretty fed up.<br />Well, that's sort of a summary, anyway.<br />To me, the story was thin; but, worse, it was full of contrived plot devices, one-dimensional characters (especially the love-rats), predictable plot twists and sheer unbelievable coincidences. The contrivance through which Kelly's pregnancy test gets mixed up with Saskia's, and the one in which Barney uses the word 'termination' to suggest ending his and Kelly's relationship - which she thinks means he wants her to get an abortion, despite her not even having told him that she is pregnant - were both beyond any credulity. And these appear within the first couple of chapters... it's pretty much downhill from there.<br />But even then this could have been a readable yarn, suitable for whiling away a long journey or an afternoon on a beach. However, the author's appallingly poor grammar and punctuation kept jerking me out of the story. Has no-one ever taught her how to punctuate dialogue? The dialogue should only end in a comma if it is followed by a speech verb - not if the narrative does not include a speech verb. This, repeated at least once on almost every page, was the most distracting of many grammatical errors. Then Higgins managed to get her characters' names mixed up; at one point Richard, the ex-husband, is called Dave (the name of another character). At that stage I felt like throwing the book across the room: if the author can't be bothered to care about her characters, why on earth should I?<br />Not worth the purchase price.<br />wmr-uk	2004-06-18

The fact that I've only heard of about three of the authors is beside the point - and as it happens, the novellas by those I've heard of aren't any better than the others in the collection anyway.

Tortured hero, strong, determined heroine	Emily, Lady Harland, has lost two brothers and a husband to the war against Napoleon. Her surviving brother is paralysed, an invalid. Her father, a general, is still involved in the war effort although they're now back in London. So when she hears the idle, indolent and supercilious Duke of Avon mocking the English troops and suggesting that Napoleon should have been allowed to run free on the Continent, she is furious - and lets him know her views in no uncertain terms. And when he informs her that the severe limp she sees him walk with is only an affectation, she is incensed and dismisses him as a worthless fop. Only, once he leaves, she notices that there is blood on the handrail where he had walked...<br />Dominic Maitland, Duke of Avon, is indeed a cripple, and has been since birth. He is also up to his neck in the war effort himself behind the scenes: he decodes encrypted messages and is in charge of a network of couriers. The night Emily meets him, he has just come from a rendezvous with a courier which went badly wrong, and he was nearly killed. His business with her father is to establish the source of a leak in the war office, for which her father is responsible. <br />Avon has long decided never to marry, and never to fall in love. After all, who could love a cripple like him? And anyway, his father always told him that his crippled leg was hereditary - so why have children only to pass that on to the next generation? Furthermore, he detests feeling pitied, so he avoids friendship - the person he is closest to is Moss, his valet, who is more like a father to him than his own father was.<br />However, he is deeply attracted to Emily, and she to him. He tries to scare her off by indicating that all he wants from her is sex - but she refuses to be completely scared off. And when Avon starts spending a lot of time at her home, working with Devon, her brother, they are thrown more into each other's company - and then when Emily and her father save Avon's lifeand he has to stay with them in order to recuperate, feelings grow even stronger and he finds it impossible to deny what he really feels for her. But he still won't marry her... and then things get worse when, under severe stress and worry, Emily says something unforgivable to him about his limp. Can these two ever forgive each other and find love?<br />This is an amazing, gripping and so well-written book - Gayle Wilson is a real find! I would put this on a par with the better long Mary Baloghs, and I'm now off to get hold of as many other Gayle Wilsons as I can. Excellent!<br />wmr-uk	2004-06-06

Katherine, Fintan and Tara grew up together in the small coastal Clare town of Knockavoy, in the 1960s and 1970s; they're now all in their early thirties and living in London. Katherine's the only one not in a relationship, but she claims to be perfectly happy as she is - far happier than Tara, who's lived with Thomas for the last two years. Thomas is mean and cruel to Tara, but she won't leave him because, she insists, she's in the Last Chance Saloon. At her age, and with her overweight figure, she'll never find another man.<BR>Katherine thinks that no man is far better than one who isn't faithful or kind or loving; we gradually find out that she's had more than enough experience of the other kind. And that's why, when the handsome, charming and genuinely *nice* Joe Roth asks her out, she's needlessly cruel to him. Last chance saloon? She couldn't care less.<br />Until suddenly it's *Fintan* - Fintan, the golden boy, blissfully happy with his boyfriend Sandro - who's really in the Last Chance Saloon. Fintan is very seriously ill - not with AIDS, thankfully, but with Hodgkin's Disease. And it's very possible that he might die... Suddenly, life begins to look very different to both Katherine and Tara, and they start to re-evaluate their priorities and what they want out of life.<br />There are some wonderful secondary characters in this book, too: Sandro, Fintan's boyfriend; Joe Roth; Fintan's family, the O'Gradys - especially Milo; Liv, Katherine and Tara's former flatmate; and the egotistical Lorcan, whom we all want to see come a cropper before the end of the book. In this, as in so many ways, Last Chance Saloon is reminiscent of Maeve Binchy at her best. (Oh, and to the reviewer who thought the character names were odd: these are all quite normal Irish names).<br />Ever since Watermelon, I've been waiting for Marian Keyes to write another book genuinely worth reading. I loved Watermelon: it was funny and poignant and romantic. Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married wasa mistake: it was juvenile and tedious. Rachel's Holiday was better, but it felt as if a serious subject was being trivialised - though that may have been the first-person narrative. Last Chance Saloon, however, at last shows what Keyes is really capable of. <br />I preferred the third-person narrative in this book, and the fact that, as a result, Keyes gave us a rounded picture of both Katherine and Tara - a less rounded picture of Fintan, but then it was interesting to view him through others' eyes. In many ways, he is a pivotal character in the plot development.<br />Next up: Sushi For Beginners, which I really hope is as good as this book! I think, in Marian Keyes, we may have found Maeve Binchy's successor for modern Ireland. <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-31

She's far from the type of woman whom the known rake, Lord Edmond Waite, would be interested in - and yet, stranded alone together in Vauxhall Gardens in the middle of a thunderstorm, they discover each other in the most intimate way possible.<br />How could this have happened? This is exactly what Mary asks herself once she's home again. She hates men of Lord Edmond's type; he was a rake in the worst possible sense, and she was well aware that only a few months earlier he'd been involved in a scandal with another woman, who had apparently almost run off with him while engaged to another man. But Mary is terrified of thunderstorms due to a childhood trauma, and she knows that she can't exactly blame Lord Edmond for making love to her; in her terror, she had pleaded with him to do it. But it will never happen again. He is not her type. He is everything she despises... and yet. And yet she is powerfully attracted to him, as she has never been to any other man. Not even Marcus, the Earl of Clifton (hero of A Counterfeit Betrothal), who was her close friend for so many years.<br />As for Edmond, still stinging from Felicity's rejection, he is equally determined that Mary is not his type. Despite the fact that being with her haunts his dreams, he knows very well that he doesn't belong in her world, and he can't imagine her wanting to belong in his. And yet he is still attracted to her: Mary, the mousy bluestocking, a type of woman he tells himself is beneath his notice. He can't seem to stop himself coming up with excuses for them to meet, and when they do, he can't prevent himself baiting her just to see her shaken out of her studied politeness. <br />No, Edmond and Mary are worlds apart... or are they? For Mary, little by little, begins to discover that Edmond is not the ignorant,heartless, Philistine rake he pretends to be. She gradually discovers, to her shock, that he can be hurt. That *she* can hurt him. And also that he has a knowledge of culture and literature better than her own - but why does he try to hide it? And what is the mystery surrounding his brother's death, when Edmond was only eighteen, and for which the world - including Edmond himself - holds him responsible?<br />Is Edmond really such a notorious rake as he appears? <br />Can Mary use her engagement to another man to put Edmond out of her mind and make him keep away from her?<br />This is in many ways an unforgettable book, and Edmond is one of my favourite 'tortured' Balogh heroes. We begin by disliking him - and for anyone who read the first book in this linked trilogy, The Trysting Place, the dislike is even greater. But by even a quarter of the way into the book, we find our perceptions changing. We haven't even found out any of Edmond's secrets by this stage, which is what is so skilful about Balogh's writing. She can make readers feel empathy even for a character we should dislike. But as we learn more and more about Edmond, discovering along the way that he is compassionate, sensitive and capable of showing great nobility, we long to know the real secrets of his past - and for him to find the happiness he deserves.<br />A keeper, this book, if you can get your hands on it.	2004-05-23

Elizabeth Rossiter is a governess working in a small town in the south, well away from London and polite society. And that's the way she likes it. Nothing unexpected ever happens; she takes care of her charges, who will soon be launched into Society, and her employers treat her as a member of the family. She's safe.<br />Even when the new owner of the local big house, Ferndale, arrives to view his property, Elizabeth has no notion that her life is about to be completely disrupted. And why should it? William Mainwaring, the new owner, is perfectly polite and amiable, if a little shy in company. Interestingly, he seems to show a partiality for Elizabeth, despite her position as governess.<br />But Mainwaring has company on his visit to Ferndale, and one of his guests happens to be Robert Denning, Marquess of Hetherington - a man whom Elizabeth had hoped never to see again. And she'd been successful for more than six years. Until now; until he'd appeared without warning in the place where she'd found sanctuary. And then he seems to be around everywhere Elizabeth goes, giving her disapproving looks, making pointed remarks about mercenary behaviour and even, at one point, warning her off Mainwaring in such terms as make it clear that Hetherington believes that she's only after Mainwaring's money. And, even more insulting, Hetherington even tells Elizabeth that if she needs money she only need apply to him and he will supply it - the implication being that he would be relieved to be able to pay her off. <br />What was Hetherington and Elizabeth's past relationship? Why does he hate her so much? Why are her feelings for him so clearly torn between hatred and a deep, deep longing? What about Mainwaring's interest in Elizabeth?<br />Balogh's talent as a storyteller, always obvious, is even more clear in A Chance Encounter. She keeps readers guessing about Elizabeth's past and what Hetherington has to do with it, and when the truth was revealed some way into the book I was stunned. Nothing I had read so far had led me even to suspect the revelation, and yet when I re-read the earlier portion of the book nothing argued against it either. It was a masterful piece of writing. <br />Balogh is also an expert at writing stories which pull on the readers' emotions, and this book is a classic example. It's angsty, it has moments of humour, it's suspenseful and it's heartwrenching. I couldn't put it down from the moment I started it. <br />Unfortunately, like most of Balogh's early Regencies, it's out of print; until her publisher sees sense and starts to re-release her earlier work, the only way you can get hold of it is to pay an inflated price to get it second-hand. And yet it's worth it! Oh, and if you do get a used copy, it won't be mine - that's staying right where it is! <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-23

Alice Penhallow has known Piers Westhaven almost all her life. They were children together: she, Webster Penhallow and Piers. At seventeen, she married Web, and not long after Piers himself married. But Piers' wife died in childbirth, and Allie herself is now widowed.<BR>In London to visit her family, she meets Piers again and he confides in her that he has decided to remarry. He has his eye on several young debutantes, and Allie despairs because he's making the same mistake as he did the first time: thinking of marrying a young featherhead he has nothing in common with. Piers jokes at one point that he should marry Allie, but before she can give any kind of embarrassed reply he assures her that he didn't mean it; he tells himself that he wouldn't degrade her like that.<br />This is one of the earliest clues that Piers and Allie's feelings for each other are not as straightforward as we're led to believe. And soon it's confirmed: she's been in love with him since she was fourteen, and he fell in love with her a year later. But she thought that he would never look twice at her, and he thought that he was too wild and unconventional for her. And anyway, his best friend was also in love with her, so Piers let Web court her instead. And now they're both so used to hiding their real feelings that neither realises the truth.<br />Piers, having been amusing himself with a young and apparently shy debutante, suddenly discovers one night that he'd been suckered well and truly: baited and hooked and reeled in on a trap which could have been set by a professional. He has compromised Cassandra Borden, and will have to propose marriage to her. Shocked, horrified and very sad, he finds himself outside Allie's house late at night. She sees him and invites him in; he confesses what happened and, in a very poignant scene, they recognise that they have to say goodbye. Once he's married, their friendship cannotcontinue.<br />But a hug goodbye turns into something more, and suddenly Piers is in Allie's bed, and they are both discovering lovemaking as neither has ever known before...<br />In the morning, though, nothing has changed. Piers still has to marry Cassandra, and Allie leaves for Bath; they manage to persuade each other that it meant nothing more than the comfort of old friends for one another. But inwardly, it meant everything to both of them. Must they be separated again, permanently?<br />This is a very moving, as well as amusing in places, story of best friends who shoud have been lovers long ago, but missed out. It's also a story about how love can sometimes be even better when it comes somewhat later in life. And this book is most definitely a Balogh classic. If you can get your hands on it, don't let it go! <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-23

So he retreats to Graystone, in the north of England, intending to try to forget Elizabeth and avoid polite society. However, he reckons without the inhabitants of the local town, who are determined to include him in their activities; after all, while he may not have a title, he is certainly one of the wealthiest single gentlemen around at the moment, which makes him extremely eligible and desirable.<br />Lady Helen Wade, youngest daughter of the Earl of Claymore, hates the sort of 'proper' behaviour required of a young lady of the ton, and she avoids any kind of interaction with Society as much as she can, simply by slipping out and running to her favourite place, in the woods by a stream on Graystone land. Although she's almost twenty, she does her best to pretend that she won't have to secure a suitable marriage some day; in fact, it's clear that Helen hasn't really grown up yet.<br />One day, William Mainwaring comes upon a young woman sitting by the river on his land, 'learning water', as she tells him. She's wearing a faded dress which is unfashionable and far too short for her; unsurprisingly, he takes her for a village girl. Helen, realising his mistake and the impropriety of her presence in his land and in his company, allows him to carry on believing that she's a simple country girl, and tells him that her name is Nell. <br />'Nell' and William become friends, actually seeking each other out as escape from their mundane and unwelcome daily lives; they discuss poetry and landscapes and nature, and find themselves becoming drawn to each other. Attracted to each other. Until the inevitable happens...<br />William thinks that Nell is a village girl. So it never occurs to him that, since he realises he needs to marry and he's actually considering one of her sisters as a potential wife, that he could marry Nell instead. And anyway, he's not in love with her, is he? He still loves Elizabeth! Nell knows that she needs to tell William the truth; after all, she's spent time with him under false pretences. But good intentions go their usual way, and very soon it's too late. William has left, and Nell is... well, Nell has to grow up very quickly in a very short space of time.<br />This represents the early part of The Wood Nymph; the remainder of the book is set mostly in London, and readers will need to read it for themselves to find out what happens. All I can say is that this book satisfies my desire for closure for William Mainwaring completely. A wonderful book, and well worth the 'collectible' price I paid for it. <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-23

But Balogh's done it, and more than once too. The Secret Pearl opens with Adam, Duke of Raybourne, emerging from the Drury Lane Theatre, parting from his friends, and seeing a sad-looking prostitute standing in the shadows. Something makes him approach her; despite the fact that she isn't throwing out any lures to him at all, he hires her. And, despite the fact that sleeping with prostitutes isn't something he makes a habit of, he takes her to a room in a run-down inn to use her.<br />This, we find, is Fleur's first night as a prostitute; having gone two days without food and unable to get a job, she has decided to sell the only remaining asset she has: herself. Her client, though, makes the experience almost as bad as it could possibly be: he is clinical and direct about what he wants, and - not knowing that Fleur is a virgin - he hurts her. <br />Afterwards, Adam does feel some guilt, and he feeds Fleur as well as giving her three times as much money as she asked for. And then he sends his secretary to ensure that she is offered a job - as governess to his daughter. His motives, he assumes, are simply philanthropic: he hates the thought of a gentlewoman down on her luck having to survive on the streets, and he feels guilty for not having realised before it was too late that she wasn't accustomed to her trade.<br />So Fleur takes up residence in the Duke of Raybourne's estate, delighted to have found a refuge both from her life in London and from the horrors from which she ran in the first place. Until the Duke of Raybourne comes home, and she discovers that he is the same man who fills her nightmares, the man who hurt her, the man who, in her dreams, rapes her nightly. Andyet, as the days go by, he is also the man who comforts her, who protects her and who offers her a safe refuge.<br />And there are many more complications in what is already a complex story: Adam, of course, is married, and he is an honourable man who will not betray his marriage vows, despite his lapse in London - the only time he has ever been unfaithful. And Fleur is running from a murder charge. And her tormentor is even closer than she imagines. <br />Balogh creates a wonderful, believable portrait of what seems to be an impossible relationship. Adam, appallingly scarred both internally and externally as a result of Waterloo plus private torments, and who was cruelly rough with Fleur when he hired her as a prostitute, does not seem to be the ideal romantic hero - and yet he is, in every way. Fleur, a possible murderer, a prostitute, does not seem to be the ideal heroine, either - and yet she isn't at all what she seems, although she did certainly sell herself on the streets. But how is it possible that she could fall in love with the man who haunts her nightmares? How could a decent, married man fall in love with another woman? But Balogh pulls it off so convincingly that I could barely put the book down.<br />The Secret Pearl is a classic which will have you reading breathlessly, eager to find out what happens next. It's poignant, heartwrenching and utterly romantic, and it's a classic. I can't for the life of me imagine why Balogh's current publisher hasn't tried to reissue this; it would be yet another best-seller for her. As it is, the best you can do is to buy it second-hand, if you can get hold of it - and that's not easy, because those of us who do have it will NOT let go of it! <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-23

This anthology has three of my favourite Regency writers as contributors, so it should be good, I thought. However, I quickly discovered that two of the novellas inside had also appeared in a later anthology, Captured Hearts. So if you've read that, then you've already read the Layton and Balogh contributions to this anthology.<br />And, as it happens, by far the weakest and least enjoyable story in this is the Layton one, Buried Treasure. Layton departs from her usual Regency genre (why then is she included in a *Rakes* and Rogues anthology?) to produce a rather tedious story about a not-very-likeable pirate and the somewhat boring woman who falls in love with him and whom he intends to seduce and desert. I didn't enjoy this the first time, and didn't bother reading it the second.<br />I enjoyed Melinda McRae's Sweet Revenge more than I expected. David, Lord Denby returns home after a long absence, knowing that his childhood sweetheart, Chloe, is now widowed. He and Chloe had been secretly engaged years earlier, but then he'd gone off to fight in the Napoleonic wars and had been rumoured killed in action. Griefstricken, Chloe had married his cousin Jonathan. Not long after, David had returned home safely, and he'd seen Chloe's action as betrayal. He hadn't seen her since. Now, however, she was widowed and he's out for revenge. He will make her fall in love with him again and, if possible, seduce her - and then desert her. But will his resolve hold when his own feelings may not be as full of hate as he thinks?<br />Mary Jo Putney's The Devil's Spawn is not her best work by far. The plot's a well-worn one: Dominic, Lord Chandler, asks his sweetheart's father for permission to pay his addresses. The father rejects him and goes further: lets Roxanne believe that Dominic has been bought off. This same plot was used in a novella in the Captured Hearts anthology. Years later, Dominic returns, with an elaborate plan to kidnap Roxanne and marry her - he has no idea of whatshe believes about him. It's the really ridiculous nature of this plan, which involves pretending to be a Polynesian savage, which destroys the crediblity of the story. Added to that, there is another cliched revelation in the novella, and an abrupt and unconvincing change in characterisation.<br />Anita Mills' A Good Woman, set in Texas as opposed to Regency England, is also surprisingly enjoyable. Jack Morgan, former bank robber, is being released after eight years in prison. His only wish is to find the money he buried before being arrested, but a woman with two children and clearly in desperate circumstances catches his attention and he helps her out by paying for a night's accommodation and food for her. The next day they're on the same stagecoach to Huntsville. Beth tries to ignore the drunken, untidy man, while Jack is tired and irritated by the children. However, neither can prevent their decent natures wanting to help the other, and when they arrive in Huntsville Jack sacrifices the remainder of his cash to stop Beth's home being repossessed. Then, when Beth sees the way the sheriff is harassing Jack, she offers him a home. Can the lonely, tired widow reform the cynical ex-con who claims not to have a heart?<br />And the best in the collection is Mary Balogh's Precious Rogue, which I'd read before. Patricia Mangan is a poor relation, treated as little better than a maid by her aunt. Joshua Buchanan is a guest at a house-party, and the favoured suitor of Patricia's cousin. However, Buchanan - as Patricia discovers when she sees him enjoying the attentions of a married lady guest - is a rake, and he's actually only leading her cousin and aunt on. He has no intention of proposing. However, the rake and the little shadow find themselves having sparky conversations... and the rake finds himself increasingly concerned for the fate of his little bird, as he calls Patricia. And soon he cannot even carry on his usual games with discreet women, because all he can think about is Patricia...<br />The best novellas in this anthology, as is always the case with anthologies, needed to be longer. The other two would have been best omitted. This gets three stars for Precious Rogue; on average, the rest of the anthology merits two. <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-23

December 28, 2002	Eight years ago, Max, then Viscount Evendon, was engaged to Judith Blakeford. But, with a month to go until the wedding, she eloped with Andrew Easton. Judith found her fiancé cold and forbidding, whereas Andrew tempted her with romance and passion. Yet marriage disillusions her: her husband is a drunken debaucher who spends most of his time away from her and their children, engaging in seduction.<br />Eight years later, Judith, now widowed, returns to London, and encounters her former fiancé once more. Max, now the Marquess of Denbigh, has nursed a desire for vengeance for the entire eight years since she ran off, leaving her father to break the news that he'd been jilted. His once-time love for Judith has turned to hatred, and he wants revenge.<br />Max ensures that his and Judith's paths cross as frequently as possible, doing his best to charm his way into her children's good graces and those of her sister-in-law, Amy - that seems to be the easiest way to get Judith to spend time with him. When he succeeds in getting her to accept his invitation to spend Christmas at his estate he knows that his plan is succeeding. All he needs to do is to make her fall in love with him, the way he once loved her, and then abandon her, just as she once abandoned him. Then his revenge will be complete.<br />But this is Christmas, a time for love and peace and forgiveness, not a time for darkness and hatred. Can Max really sustain his desire for vengeance in the face of the woman he still loves? Can Judith overcome the memory of her fear of Denbigh and her guilt for what she once did to him - and her conviction that he means only to hurt her? Can these two people ever learn to trust one another?<br />This is a lovely book, and one of Balogh's better Christmas novels, a period she does so well. Its theme is very seasonal, with love, forgiveness and hope at the core of the book, and a cast of supporting characters who are alone and in need of love. There is also a very sweet secondary romance featuring two characters both of whom thought themselves never likely to fall in love or marry. The book is very hard to find, but well worth it! <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-23

Newly widowed, Felicity, Lady Wren finally gets the chance to have a London Season for herself. She was married at the age of 18 to a man in his late fifties, because her family was practically bankrupt and they needed the marriage settlement to save them. At the time, she'd been in love with her childhood friend, Tom Russell, and both of them had been devastated that Felicity had to marry someone else.<br />However, time passes and heals many wounds, and now that Felicity is free again at the age of 26 she's matured and she feels that Tom would have been the wrong man for her. He's a country farmer, after all, and she likes Society life. She wants a man who is not only charming, handsome and close to her own age - all of which Tom is - but who is also wealthy, titled and who enjoys Society life. <br />In London, she meets Lord Edmond Waite, a handsome sophisticate who is obviously attracted to her; unfortunately, she discovers very quickly that he wants her as his mistress, which is something she's definitely not interested in. So how to make him come around to the idea of marriage?<br />Simple - make him jealous.<br />And how better to do that than to enlist the help of her oldest friend, who most conveniently has followed her to London and is squiring her and her younger twin sisters about?<br />So Tom agrees to pretend to be a devoted suitor, and of course they have to be very convincing in order to make Lord Edmond believe that he really has competition. The only problem for Felicity is: is she risking awakening old feelings by getting so close to Tom again? Is she absolutely sure that what she once felt for him is dead?<br />This is another Balogh classic, which I was delighted to find. As usual, she creates some very believable and entertaining characters - in particular, I loved the secondary characters of twins Lucy and Laura, and their suitors. And as usual, Balogh doesn't write a one-dimensional villain; I'm looking forward to seeing his story in the third book of the trilogy to which this belongs! <br />Admittedly, at first I thought that Felicity was rather shallow, with her desire for a life of froth and pleasure and her wish to marry a titled, wealthy man (who cares about love?). But then I realised that her nature at that point - or at least what she believes to be her preferences - were very much influenced by her sudden freedom from a marriage to a man much older than she was. It's a classic case of someone thinking that they know what they want, only to discover, when they have it, that it wasn't what they wanted after all.<br />If I had one criticism of The Trysting Place, it's that Tom is just a little bit too perfect. He agrees to everything Felicity asks of him, including pretending to be engaged to her; he's always there when she needs him; and, even though he's deeply in love with her and the thought of seeing her married to another man almost kills him inside, he's still unselfish enough to help her get what she thinks she wants. Once or twice I wanted to scream at him to develop some backbone... but then he is a pretty unselfish character.<br />As this is an early Balogh, there's a minor niggle in the shape of titles used incorrectly: for instance, Lord Waite is not the same title (and therefore person) as Lord Edmond Waite, and likewise Lady Dorothea Page may not also be addressed as Lady Page. However, Balogh doesn't make these errors in later books. <br />All in all, definitely a keeper and one of my favourites of the early Baloghs. <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-23

Emily and the Dark Angel is one of Jo Beverley's earliest books, and is part of a series which began with Lord Wraybourne's Betrothal, and continued with The Stanforth Secret and The Stolen Bride. Not knowing that these books were linked, I read Emily... before Stanforth; I hope that by listing the order here other readers may be helped. (And I hope that some day I can find a copy of The Stolen Bride; I want to read Randal and Sophie's story!)<br />Emily is a spinster, in her late twenties, who has been looking after her invalid father for many years. Since her soldier brother was posted as missing, believed killed in combat, she has also been running the family estate. Her home is on the edge of Melton Mowbray, a very popular area with the hunting fraternity, situated as it is in the centre of several hunts. (This is the one thing I dislike about the book: I loathe foxhunting).<br />Piers Verderan, known as Ver to his friends, is there for the hunting, and because he's just inherited the estate next to Emily's. They meet first just as he's been ejected from his (ex-)mistress's establishment, colliding with Emily just as they're both showered in poudre des violettes. Ver offers to escort Emily to her destination, since the collision has damaged the heel of her boot.<br />She doesn't trust him; and why should she? He's called the Dark Angel for a reason; he is likened to Lucifer. Stories about his criminality and dastardliness abound. And yet he is kind, he comes to her rescue on several occasions, and he makes her feel good about herself for the first time in many years. He makes her feel desirable. He tells her that he loves her.<br />But can Emily believe a man who has a reputation for breaking hearts and never remaining faithful to a woman; a man who is reputed to have abandoned his own mother to a life of poverty? Can she be brave enough to listen to her heart above the warnings of her brain and members of her family?<br />Emily and Ver are hugely likeable characters, both with enough emotional depth to hold my interest. There are also some great secondary characters, including some I really want to read about: Lord Randal Ashby appears in this book, with his wife Sophie (and I want to read their story!), and Emily's brother Marcus looks as if he could benefit from a book of his own. Note to self: check if Beverley ever did write Marcus's story...<br />Highly recommended, if you can get hold of it! <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-23

She doesn't want to get married, because her own experience of marriage is disastrous: her parents separated when she was four and neither has seen the other since then. Talking to some friends, a scheme is borne: if Sophia pretends that she wants to marry someone her parents will find ineligible, but is of perfectly good ton, then maybe they will have to join forces to talk her out of it.<br />Step forward Lord Francis Sutton, youngest son of a duke - a duke who happens to be the Earl of Clifton's (Sophia's father) oldest friend. Sophia and Francis have known each other since they were very young children - and unlike characters in another author's books I've been reading recently, these two really do sound as if they've known each other all their lives. Francis and Sophia have quarrelled all their lives, too, and even in agreeing to pretend to be madly in love they fight. It's already apparent that this pretend engagement is going to be a lot of fun - and that Sophia and Francis are actually not as indifferent to each other as they pretend.<br />And now we meet the principal characters of this book: Sophia's parents, Olivia and Marcus. Although they're the parents of a debutante, they are actually relatively young still: Marc is 40 to Livy's 36. But they haven't seen one another for 14 years. Olivia rejected Marc after a stupid mistake of his: drunk, he slept with a prostitute because his friends were egging him on, and he compounded his error by telling Olivia. At her young age at the time - just 21 - she'd put him on a pedestal and couldn't cope with discovering that he was human. She didn't know how to rebuild their marriage at the time, so she told him that she couldn't forgive him.<br />So how do Marc and Livy cope, meeting each other after all this time? Has time healed the wounds? Are they now two strangers? Or can they be indifferent to each other, behaving like polite acquaintances? Or is it possible that they are each still in love with the other?<br />We get two love stories for the price of one in A Counterfeit Betrothal. Frances and Sophia's is fun all the way; extremely humorous, and it's entirely obvious that the two of them have bitten off far more than they can chew in pretending to their families that they are madly in love and can't wait to be married. But... is it really all a pretence? Is it possible for two people to be quite so convincing? And will they actually be able to extricate themselves before they really find themselves in front of a vicar? But then, as Francis keeps telling Sophia, they're both headed for Bedlam anyway.<br />And then, in stark contrast, Marc and Livy's story is utterly poignant. Their separation left each of them bitter, Marc because he'd pleaded with Livy for six months to forgive him, and Livy because of Marc's betrayal. Seeing each other again is unbelievably painful for both. Being together, pretending to be the happily married couple for friends and relations - and especially in front of Sophia, so that they don't spoil her engagement and wedding plans - takes its toll on both. Is it too late for them? Once the wedding - what wedding? - is over, will Olivia just go back home and never see Marc again?<br />It takes a very good, very believable, angsty romance to make me cry. This one did. It takes something special in a book to make me think and obsess about the characters when I'm not reading it - I do have to work sometimes! - but this one did. Unfortunately, like just about all of Balogh's early Regencies, it's out of print. But if you can get hold of it second-hand, grab it.

I found this story profoundly irritating, largely because of the very distracting use of dialect. When American writers set out to write Scots, they seem to take it as a challenge to prove that they can write phonetic dialect - but it's never consistent and always distracting. I was also bored because the characters aroused no interest at all in me. They seemed one-dimensional and boring. I found myself counting the pages remaining until it was over.<br />Lynsay Sands' Bitten was somewhat better, though not up to the standard of her new vampire series. Emily, shipwrecked, is saved from drowning and wakes up in a strange castle.

She is convinced, as she explores, that she's being watched - and so she is, by Julian Lathrop, who seems to know rather too much about the history of the area and of her family. By the time she realises who and what he is, she is deeply in love with her. The problem is that Blayne fails to show the reader why she loves Julian and why he loves her - we're just told. There is far too much telling, far too much description, in this novella, and not enough dialogue and introspection. Even an important, climactic moment, which should be terrifying for Georgiana, is ruined by insufficient showing of her fear.<br />And finally, there is Kate Huntington's The Awakening, which I did like for the most part, with one rather large exception. Thalia Layton's aunt, her only relative, is very sick, and so Thalia has journeyed north to visit her - Cordelia was shunned by Society years ago for running off to live with her lover, Adrian Lucerne. However, Thalia finds that Cordelia wishes she hadn't come - and that Adrian Lucerne seems to be at least 30 years younger than she had expected. And she is very, very drawn to Lucerne, despite his obviously still being her aunt's lover. What I really found distasteful about this book was Thalia and Lucerne acting on their attraction while Cordelia, whom both of them loved and who was jealous of their feelings for each other, was lying on her deathbed - and how they made love within an hour of her death. <br />Not a keeper, this collection.<br />wmr-uk	2004-05-09

This is the second in Lynsay Sands' vampire series, which began with Single White Vampire. However, it's actually set *before* SWV, so could be read before it. The reviewer below is incorrect, actually: in SWV, Etienne was engaged to Rachel; in fact, Lucerne and Kate attend Etienne and Rachel's wedding. <br />Etienne is 300 years old, born a vampire into a family of vampires. He's not too worried about being single, since he's sure that he'll find his one true love some day. But suddenly he has to make a choice. He's only allowed to `transform' one human in his lifetime, and most vampires use that one transformation for the woman - or man - who will be their soul-mate. But his life has just been saved by Rachel Garrett, a mortician, who jumped in front of him when a madman was about to try to bleed him to death. Unfortunately, Rachel is the one who's got hurt, and she's dying. So what does he do? Let her die - or `waste' his one opportunity, transform her, and risk remaining single and alone for eternity?<br />So he transforms her, and he and his family smuggle her back to his house. And, when she wakes up, he knows he will have to deal with her reaction to having been turned into a vampire without so much as a by-your-leave. And that's probably going to be the least of his worries, he thinks - apart from anything else, regardless of how many times he begs them, his family will probably ignore his wishes and tell her just how much of a sacrifice he's made for her. And that, he knows, is the last thing Rachel will want to hear. Coming to terms with being a vampire is one thing; discovering that the man in whose house she is staying has given up his chance of a lifetime's happiness is another. And the last thing Etienne wants is for Rachel to feel guilty.<br />But guilt is the last thing on Rachel's mind when she wakes up. She is a vampire?! And she has to learn to drink blood? YUCK!! Okay, so she doesn't have to suck the necks of strangers, but even the bags Etiennekeeps in his fridge taste disgusting. How on earth is she ever going to survive? Not to mention the fact that these new people in her life are just plain scary - Etienne actually sleeps in a coffin! And his cousin delights in serving up doctored drinks designed to make her behave completely out of character. And, as if all that's not bad enough, the man who tried to kill Etienne and almost killed her is still on their tail. This vampire life isn't looking like a lot of fun so far... But then, sex is pretty terrific, so maybe it has its compensations?<br />Another highly amusing vampire story from Ms Sands - I'm already looking forward to book 3, Tall, Dark and Hungry.<br />wmr-uk	2004-05-09

Dominic Wyndham, to all intents and purposes a dissolute aristocrat and younger brother of an earl, with little purpose in life beyond drinking, gambling and indulging in seemingly-pointless wagers, is shocked to be told, without warning, that his estranged wife is dead. Shocked enough to hide his real grief and pain behind a mask of cold, sardonic humour - which, in turn, shocks the young woman who has travelled from Scotland to deliver the news.<br />Catriona, the bearer of the news of Harriet's death, is not surprised at Wyndham's reaction; after all, Harriet, whom she'd known for some time, had made clear to her that Wyndham was a wastrel and a harsh, unkind man. Harriet herself had left Dominic after their wedding night, claiming that he'd done depraved and humiliating things to her. As such, Catriona is fully prepared to believe the worst of Dominic - an impression which isn't changed one bit after their encounter later that night. She sneaks into his room to talk to him, to plead with him to come to Edinburgh with her because Harriet left a child, a son, whose care Wyndham must assume. However, Catriona is well aware that the boy isn't Wyndham's son - and she is surprised when he states that he could not possibly be the boy's father. All the same, he tells her, he will travel to Edinburgh to see to the child's future - on certain conditions.<br />Those conditions are that Catriona must travel with him to all intents and purposes as his mistress. On the way, he says, they will indulge in sin - one deadly sin for each day on the road. \\"Every day you will be besieged by a man who has a great deal more experience in the game than you do. I shall seduce you,\\" he promises. \\"You will fall in love and I shall break your heart. I guarantee it.\\"<br />Yet he also promises that he will do nothing without her consent - so to an earlier reviewer, I point out that Wyndham fully understands that `no' means `no'. Nothing is done with Catriona without her express consent - infact, at times, her pleading. <br />For reasons of her own, Catriona desperately needs Wyndham to come, and so she agrees to his terms - showing no fear, but also desperately trying not to show him how truly tempted she is by him. By his seductive voice, by his beautiful hands, his handsome body and face, his touch... and his kisses. For she cannot afford to lose her heart, and never to an Englishman. Besides, Wyndham is a scoundrel and a rake... isn't he?<br />Wyndham is, in fact, far from being either, as any reader who hasn't already read Illusion will find out gradually as the book advances. Nothing he does is without a cause: to help a friend, to try to win back the wife he has persuades himself he loves, for the sake of his country. As for Catriona, he is tempted by her and intrigued by the mystery she presents, for he knows very well that there is something else behind her thin story about a fatherless, motherless boy. And so they embark on an intimate journey together, facing danger, facing trials... and facing temptation. But in the end, whose heart is most at risk? Catriona's - or Dominic's?<br />I didn't find this book quite as compelling as Illusion; the dramatic plot wasn't as gripping as that in the earlier book - the need to rescue the baby didn't really have the same interest for me. Yet Dominic and Catriona are similarly complex and driven by demons as were Nigel and Frances in Illusion - and fans of the earlier book will get the opportunity to see them again in this. So still a five-star review, but Illusion definitely has the edge.<br />wmr-uk	2004-05-09

I *like* vampire romances - but I seem to dislike McAllister's writing intensely. So - I gave it a try anyway.<br />Well, just as with Men In Kilts, I cannot fathom how on earth any man alive could possibly like the heroine, let alone fall in love with her. Joy is infantile, incredibly irritating, has a motormouth that just won't shut up (it's amazing how her equally irritating, motormouth friend Roxy gets a word in edgeways), continually adds two and two to make twenty and generally gets in the way at every turn. I'd think any sane man would be running away from her as fast as he could - but no. Two decent men, and one hammy pretend-vampire, fall in love with her. Puh-lease!<br />The book is supposed to be about Joy and Roxy on a hunt for vampires and ending up in a Goth festival and finding some - or maybe just one. Well, the false trails McAllister laid didn't work for me; I knew which character would be the genuine vampire as soon as he was first mentioned, and I was right. No suspense there.<br />Then there's Christian - or CJ Dante, author of the vampire novels Roxy quotes at every breath. He is the only interesting character in this book - and stupid Joy fights him off to be with Raphael instead. Okay, I still don't know what Raphael sees in Joy anyway, but even with a book written in the first person, so we get full and detailed insight into Joy's thoughts (definitely TMI at times), it's not clear - other than lust at first sight - why she *loves* Raphael. She certainly likes Christian and is very drawn to him - and why would she be able to share his thoughts if she's completely indifferent to him? <br />Oh, and there's the sex scenes. Why, oh why, does Joy have to babble her way through them? And why on earth do her moronic, inane ramblings not put Raphael off her permanently? Not to mention Christian, who we are told is able to see into her mind at all times - including when she's intimate with Raphael. Definitely TMI here, and about as exciting as yet another of Joy's tedious, unfunny monologues.<br />We also have - again - the stereotypical one-dimensional jealous-bitch woman, not to mention sundry other uninteresting characters, not to mention the over-the-top Miranda the witch - sorry, Wiccan. Blech.<br />And then there's the scene right out of Phantom of the Opera. Once it began, I suspected exactly how it would play out, and I was right. Exactly according to the book/musical. Does McAllister think her readers don't know the original?<br />I did like Christian, and would like to know what happens to him - but not enough to torture myself through another exposure to McAllister.<br />wmr-uk	2004-05-05

It's a combination of spy thriller and romance, and Ross Ewing manages to keep the reader guessing until a considerable way into the story exactly who the villains are. The hero, Nigel Arundham, Marquess of Rivaulx, is suave, sophisticated, dangerous... and tortured. Just my kind of hero!<br />Okay, the story. Frances Woodward, orphaned in the Far East and held captive in a harem, is a very great prize since she has been trained as a concubine, with no thought in mind but how best to serve a man. On her return to England, she became the property of Lord Donnington - a man believed by Rivaulx to be a traitor. Rivaulx intends to expose Donnington's treachery, and as part of an elaborate ruse he wins Frances from him in a card game.<br />But, as Frances discovers, Nigel doesn't want her for himself. Again, she is to be used as a pawn in the greater game Nigel is playing: to expose all of the traitors working against the Crown and in support of Napoleon. In any case, she quickly learns that Nigel would have no interest in her anyway; the woman he loved, the woman who had been his companion while they had both been working as spies in France, was brutally murdered and he blames himself for her death.<br />And then Frances has to accompany Nigel to Paris, again as part of an elaborate ruse to enable him and his associates to spy. Once there, however, Frances finds herself continually questioning what is real about Nigel and the life they're leading, and what is illusion. <br />What is most fascinating about the book is the way Nigel himself, truly a master of illusions, gradually becomes revealed both to Frances and the readers. And equally, how Frances herself, the virgin concubine, learns that love and lovemaking need not be activities in which women are always subordinate to men and in which women's needs are unimportant.<br />As well as being a terrific, spellbinding story, Ross Ewing's writing compels and made this reader gasp in admiration. Unlike some reviewers, I *liked* Nigel's love of poetry and liked the way he frequently spoke elliptically. Her style of writing is a breath of fresh air for a reader bored to tears with mediocre historical writers. I can't wait to read Flowers Under Ice, the sequel - and her newer books under the name Julia Ross. Ross/Ross Ewing is now on my must-buy list!<br />wmr-uk	2004-05-05

American mystery writer goes to conference in Manchester, England. Makes fool of herself. Meets Scotsman. Makes fool of herself again. Scotsman for some reason then invites her to dinner, doesn't get put off by her inane conversation, sleeps with her. And then... invites her to meet his son and takes her back to his farm with him? Why?<br />Anyway, once they arrive at the farm - only three chapters into the book - all we are left with is boredom for the reader. Events and characters which were of no interest whatsoever to this reader. We have the stereotypical one-dimensional vindictive ex-girlfriend, and the equally one-dimensional jealous son. And we have sheep. Lots of sheep. Described in tedious detail, as is the occupation of farming them.<br />This is supposed to be a comedy? Well, some of it is admittedly farcical, but not farcical in the sense of being humorous. No, it's farcical in the sense of `some editor actually let this rubbish get published?' We have three whole pages of ridiculous, over-the-top hysterics derived from the fact that Americans call trousers `pants' while the British (and the Irish and the Australians and other great chunks of the English-speaking world) consider `pants' to be underwear. Is there an American alive who doesn't actually know this? <br />Oh, and what about the romance? What romance? To this reader's eye, Kathie (the heroine, whose name bears a very strong similarity to that of the author) hears a Scottish accent, puts it together with her mental fantasies of Scotsmen derived from her love of Scottish romances (no doubt written by Americans who have probably never visited the place) and the Highlander film/TV series, and falls in lust. Now, what might have been interesting would have been a novel based on Kathie's experiences of living in the highlands of Scotland, without her cable TV, without broadband Internet, without takeout food at the dial of a telephone, without a Starbucks and a WalMart on every corner,without a power shower, air-conditioning, double-glazing, draught-proofing, wide roads and all the conveniences of modern American city or town living. How long would her lust for a busy sheep-farmer really last under those circumstances? And yet, other than a trip in the mud, we don't see Kathie having any problems adjusting to her new life. Cooking on an Aga rather than a modern stove? Doing without a microwave? Having the locals treat her with genuine suspicion because she's from foreign parts, rather than the silly plot with the ex-girlfriend stirring hostility, which is what we got. That might have made a better novel. <br />As it is, the `romance', such as it is, is completely unconvincing. We are told that Kathie fell in love with Iain, but not shown, and we aren't shown *why* she would fall in love with him. The realities of day-to-day life with a farmer are glossed over, such as what Kathie does with her time while he's out all day in the fields - and how she copes with very early starts in the mornings. And as for Iain himself, what he sees in Kathie is something we will never know. Her inanities aside, she seems to cause him nothing but problems, and other than the sex it's hard to see what he might have got out of it. <br />Reading this book was a big mistake... Katie McAllister is now on my `never again' list. <br />wmr-uk	2004-05-01

Lady Cynthia, recently widowed and wealthy, was married for eight years to a man twice her age. Now that she's free again, she wants a younger husband, someone who will give her the family she longs for. Her own family wants her to marry her step-cousin Robert, Marquess of Monroyal, who is her best friend - but she thinks he doesn't really want to be married to her, even though he actually proposes, and she enlists his help in finding her an acceptable husband.<br />Monroyal entices a young, penniless soldier, younger son of an earl, into playing cards with him, and soon Captain Brain Sheffield is in debt to Monroyal to the tune of fifteen thousand pounds. Not a problem, Sheffield is told by Cynthia's father; there is a way in which you can pay your debt. Cynthia offers to give Sheffield the fifteen thousand if he will give serious consideration to marrying her.<br />And so, after much contemplation and changes of mind on Sheffield's part, he accepts the money, yet even then he cannot make up his mind whether to marry Cynthia or not. It doesn't help that he then discovers Monroyal is Cynthia's cousin, which makes him believe that he was set up - which he was, though by Monroyal and not Cynthia. And this is one aspect of the book which is quite distasteful: Monroyal, exceedingly rich in his own right, takes a very large sum of money from his cousin. She never finds out that the gambling debt was to him, which leaves him in the position of having deceived her quite badly. And second, Monroyal actually chose Sheffield to be Cynthia's suitor: why then does he bait the man every time they meet and act as if he despises him?<br />Though I cannot blame Monroyal for despising Sheffield. This reader does, too. The man is weak, vacillating, stupid and mistrusting. At every opportunity, he will choose to believe other people rather than his own wife - and when he believes that the baby she carries is her cousin's and not his own that is, to me, the last straw. Add to that Cynthia then finding him in the middle of an orgy, with a half-naked woman on his lap (and the reader also knows that he has slept with a prostitute the night before) and I cannot see why or how she could ever forgive him. The man is a waste of space.<br />I couldn't at all see why Cynthia didn't simply marry Monroyal. Their relationship is extremely close, much more so than friends, and yet it's not a relationship of siblings either. He flirts with her; he is physically affectionate towards her and she to him; he makes it clear that he finds her attractive (and even offers to become her lover), he kisses her and, while she's shocked, she doesn't find it distasteful. Even after her marriage, Monroyal is the man she confides in, looks for at every family gathering, writes to regularly and so on, even though she claims to herself that she loves her husband.<br />In addition, all the chemistry in the book is between Cynthia and Monroyal, not Cynthia and Sheffield. In any scene both men are in, it is Monroyal, not Sheffield, who attracts attention and interests the reader. He is the one we are told is devastatingly attractive, charming, very protective of Cynthia and so on. Had I not already read Monroyal's own book, written after this one, I would have been expecting Sheffield to die in some way and that the book would end with the two cousins together. As it happens, Oliver has to have her characters make some very unconvincing moves to bring about a resolution - in particular Monroyal, whom I cannot believe would have persuaded Cynthia to accept Sheffield's apology.<br />Like Oliver's later work, this book was a mistake. Two stars only, and both of those are for Monroyal!<br />wmr-uk	2004-05-01

A Comfortable Wife pre-dates the Cynster series by some years, and thus carries much more in the way of an authentic `feel' about it. It is also far less formulaic than her later work. In that case, it should be much, much better as a novel - and yet it is not.<br />Antonia Mannering has been shut away in the country taking care of her sick mother for many years; thus, she is in her mid-twenties and still not presented and has not been in Society much at all. Now orphaned, she is visiting her godmother, the Dowager Countess Ruthven - who is stepmother to Antonia's childhood friend Philip, Lord Ruthven (*not* Lord Philip Ruthven, as the cover claims). Years ago, Philip and Antonia used to play together, but will he still remember her when they meet again? Antonia has decided that she would like to marry her old friend, and that she would make him the sort of comfortable wife he needs. In his early 30s now, he is a rake, but he needs to settle down and have an heir for his estate.<br />Philip, on first seeing Antonia again, is struck by her beauty and remembers how much he enjoyed her company. Reluctantly - for he suspects a plot - he is drawn to spend more and more time with her, and realises that he wants to marry her. (He's fallen in love with her, but - as with many of her other books - Laurens fails to *show* him falling in love, realising he's in love and deciding what to do about it). The proposal comes less than halfway through the book. Result: romantic tension at an end.<br />Antonia agrees to marry Philip, but only if he will keep their engagement a secret until she's been to London for the Little Season. As she explains, she's been out of Society for so long that she has no idea how to behave. She's worried that she'll be a bad wife to him, that she will somehow disgrace him by not knowing how to behave. Thus we have half a book-full of misunderstandings, mishaps and pointless silliness while Antonia finds her way through the traps of the Polite World. And just as we think the torture is over, yet another pointless misunderstanding occurs.<br />Laurens would have been better off making this book a novella, lengthening the courtship in the first few chapters and eliminating just about everything after the couple arrives in London - it would have been a far better story that way.<br />wmr-uk	2004-04-21

This book, however, is one of her earlier romances, written at a time when she was still trying to stay true to the Regency period.<br />This is somewhat reminiscent of Georgette Heyer's Regency Buck, in that we have an arrogant, rakish lord who discovers that, along with the title he has recently inherited (in this case, Duke of Twyford), he has also inherited some wards. Here, his wards are four beautiful sisters, all unmarried, all wealthy and all, he knows, who will be the targets of every rake in town. He himself is hugely attracted to the eldest Miss Twinning, Caroline, and finds himself plotting to make her his mistress. Were she really his ward, it would be contrary to any sense of honour - even his honour - to seduce her, but under the terms of her parents' will, she is of age and so not his ward. Yet he pretends to her that she is, so that he'll be free to be with her without any suspicion.<br />There are four romances in this book but, as some other reviewers have noted, none of them is really satisfying. In an attempt to fit them all in, Laurens rushes through crucial developments - such as her heroes actually realising that they are in love with the women they're pursuing. Even Max - Twyford - whose story is the main one appears to fall in love without the readers ever realising how this momentous event happens. One minute he is pursuing Caroline in order to make her his mistress; the next (and this is quite early in the book) we see him musing that seducing her is no longer his primary aim. Why not? What made him fall in love? We don't know, because Laurens doesn't show us. Similarly with Lord Darcy, the suitor of Sarah Twinning: Sarah rejects his attempts at seduction, and he gives up, retiring to his Irish estate in order toshow her that he's lost interest. And yet he comes back and pursues her again. Why? With what object? <br />This book does show signs of the pattern Laurens fell into with her Cynster books: her heroes all seem to fall in love too quickly, without any showing on Laurens' part of why and how this happens. Given the rushed nature of the individual love stories, which does leave readers unsatisfied, she would have been better advised to have made it a four-book series, culminating in Max and Caroline's story. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining read, and definitely far, far better than the majority of her later work.<br />wmr-uk	2004-04-21

Christmas with the cousin who loathes them	Genova Smith, spinster daughter of a naval captain, is befriended by the Ladies Trace and taken with them as their companion to spend Christmas at Rothgar Abbey, home of their great-nephew the Marquess of Rothgar. On the way, they are obliged to take a baby into their care, to be handed to its father at the next inn. The `father' turns out to be the Maquess of Ashart, their other great-nephew, who strenuously denies all responsibility for the child. Genova doesn't believe him, however - and Ash's behaviour is very strange, given that he freely admits knowing and having been intimate with the child's mother.<br />Ashart, who has been in some disfavour with the king of late, suspects a plot to discredit him - and he thinks that the plot originates with Rothgar. So he takes advantage of having been caught in a compromising position with Genova to claim that they are engaged, since this gives him an excuse to accompany his great-aunts to Rothgar Abbey.<br />Readers of the Malloren series will be aware that Rothgar's mother went mad and strangled his younger sister. Ashart is the nephew of the late Marchioness of Rothgar, and his grandmother, by whom he was brought up, was her mother - and it is the Dowager Marchioness of Ashart who feeds the hatred within Ash for the Malloren clan. So Ashart is far from kindly-disposed towards his cousin.<br />Rothgar, on the other hand, sees his cousin's presence in his home as an opportunity to heal the rift, putting past enmities behind them. As he says to Bryght, he wants to make a proper cousin out of Ash. But will he succeed?<br />As for Genova, while on the one hand Ash infuriates her, on the other hand she has never before been so attracted to a man. The kisses he trades with her for guineas (for the child's upbringing) make her burn in a way she has never experienced. Yet he's a marquess and she's a nobody. He also confesses to her, as they become closer and become friends, that he has to marry for money - in fact, she's well aware that his chosen bride is also at the Abbey. So their relationship has no future - unless she's prepared to accept his offer to make her his mistress. <br />This is another excellent book from Beverley, offering what many of her loyal readers have been asking for: a further visit to the Malloren clan. It was good to see many of the family in their married state - again, disappointingly, Fort has a very minor role. Given his animosity to the Mallorens, I've always wanted to know what made him change his mind and tell Elf that he loved her. Ash is a worthy new hero, and Genova just the match for him. Again, however, I wanted to know why Ash changed his mind in the end, something we just didn't get to see. Still, highly recommended!<br />wmr-uk	2004-04-18

In this latest of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series, we meet again Wulf Tryggvason, whom we encountered very briefly in Talon's story - in fact, we have the same phone conversation again, only this time from Wulf's point of view. A tiny bit repetitive, but I can live with that. Wulf is a Viking, tricked into becoming a Dark-Hunter twelve centuries ago, and one who carries one additional curse: no-one who is not a Dark-Hunter or an Apollite or of his own family can remember him five minutes after they leave him.<br />Then he meets Cassandra Peters - who does remember him. They share several highly erotic dreams - and then he discovers that she's half-Apollite. An Apollite, who is destined to die on her 27th birthday, unless she decides to become a Daimon. And she's already 26... <br />If she becomes Daimon, Wulf will have to hunt her down and kill her. If she doesn't, then she'll die. And, as if those aren't difficult enough things to contend with, two more problems get thrown into the mix: Cassandra is the last living heir of Apollo, and if she dies, or dies without leaving an heir, the world will end. And then Acheron informs Wulf that Cassandra is pregnant - and he's the father.<br />The fascinating thing about Kiss of the Night is the insight we get - as does Wulf - into the Daimons. Thus far, the equation has been simple: Daimons are demons. Killer vampires who must be eliminated for the safety of humankind. But what makes an Apollite turn Daimon? Well, could it possibly be the thought of dying a long and painful death at the age of 27? And are all Daimons evil? Well, we meet one who isn't - and that's a story I sense hasn't finished yet. <br />Of course, there's also more Acheron, and yet more intriguing hints about who he is, the kind of powers he has and the real power-balance between him and Artemis. In previous books, he's had to dance to Artemis's tune rather more than the other way around, but here he's more forceful than he has been. I have the sneaking suspicion that Kenyon intends to wait as long as possible before giving us Acheron's own story, though. <br />Good book - not a five-star like Zarek's story, but very readable.<br />wmr-uk	2004-04-17

This, the direct sequel to that book and which ties up the loose threads which Shayne left dangling, sees her in her early twenties. She's still not-quite-human, not-quite-vampire, but changed in strange ways since her kidnap and torture by Frank Stiles, the remaining DPI agent and vampire hunter.<br />But Stiles' quest has now changed: he wants immortality, and he believes that Amber - or more specifically her blood - can give it to him.<br />Then Amber discovers that Will Stone - one of the loose ends from Embrace the Twilight: Will is Sarafina's partner, but he's mortal and cannot even become a vampire, so what future does their relationship have?  - has cancer and doesn't have long to live. The vampires work out that Stiles has managed to create some sort of formula, using Amber's blood, which seems to be able to cheat death, at least temporarily: is it possible that this could help Will? But for that they need to find Stiles and get the formula from him. Not easy.<br />Amber, on her way to be with Will and Sarafina, runs into a wild-looking vampire - literally. She knocks him down with her car. Edge, a 50-something-year-old vampire, has been tracking Amber because she, he knows, can lead him to Stiles - and he has his own reasons for wanting to meet Stiles again. Years earlier, Stiles brutally murdered Edge's companions, several teenage vampires, and Edge wants revenge.<br />He's sworn never to love again. He believes that he isn't capable of it - and that he can simply use anyone he needs to without a shred of remorse. And so he plans to use Amber - and, if necessary, he will seduce her to gain her trust and compliance. <br />But it's never as simple as that, as Edge discovers once he and Amber have made love...<br />There are lots of other threads in this book, such as Edge's `creator' - who abandoned him at the instant of his creation -being Dominic O'Roarke; Dominic arriving and meeting Dante for the first time since their separation a couple of hundred years ago; the question of Will's illness, and so on. We also meet characters from most of Shayne's other books, a principal exception being Damien, unfortunately. <br />Can Stiles be found? Will he give up his secret formula? Can he finally be killed and will he stay dead? Does Will live? And can a vampire ever make a woman pregnant? Read the book and find out!<br />One little niggle: at one point, Amber reflects that part of the reason why she's so strong is that the blood of several vampires, including some very old ones (Rhiannon in particular) is in her veins, as a result of their blood combining to make Jameson a vampire. But Amber was conceived months before Jameson was transformed, so this simply can't be the case.<br />wmr-uk	2004-04-08

A mistake for Putney and Beverley	With talents such as Mary Jo Putney and Jo Beverley on board, this should have been an enjoyable and entertaining read. Instead, I was bored stupid.<br />I've never read anything by Bujold before, and never will again after her contribution to this anthology. I couldn't read past the first dozen pages - the story was dull and the writing poor. The continual asides to the reader also irritated me.<br />Putney's contribution was far from her best, and Asaro - another writer I hadn't come across before - did nothing for me. Beverley's piece had promise, but half the time it was very difficult to work out what was supposed to be going on, and while I did like Jen and Dan, there was far too little romance to suit me. As for the final piece, about Robin of Locksley and Marian, that was simply a waste of pages.<br />The only story with any real merit in this anthology was Jennifer Roberson's tale of a dead man sent back to Earth to help his widow fall back in love with the man she'd loved and lost before he married her. I did enjoy that, but wanted a happy ending for Nick too.<br />This anthology isn't worth its purchase price, however, with only one halfway decent story in the entire collection.	2004-03-21

This is the third (or fourth, if you count Fantasy Lover, as I do) of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series, and if you've read Talon's story you'll be familiar with Zarek, the surly, murderous Roman ex-slave. Zarek has been banished to Alaska for the past 900 years for burning down the village he was supposed to protect, and killing everyone in it. Acheron managed to persuade Artemis to give him one more chance, and in Midnight Embrace Zarek joined the other Dark-Hunters in New Orleans. But there he made a serious mistake: killed two police officers in full view of mortals. Now he is back in Alaska, knowing that he won't go unpunished - someone, soon, will be sent to kill him.<br />And then it happens: he's been tracked down by Thanatos, the killer of Dark-Hunters. In trying to escape, he is hurt and thinks that it's all over, but then he wakes up in a comfortable bed in a warm house, with a  beautiful - and blind - woman taking care of him. Pretending that she cares about him and wants to look after him. She has to be pretending, doesn't she? After all, no-one has ever really cared about him. No-one has looked after him. Everyone he's ever known has betrayed him or used him to gain pleasure from his pain.<br />What Zarek doesn't know is that Astrid is a judge: an Olympian justice who has been ordered by Artemis and Acheron to judge and pass sentence on Zarek. Artemis, of course, wants him dead, but Astrid suspects that Acheron really wants her to find him innocent. And yet, in all her centuries of judging Astrid has never, ever found a single person innocent of the crimes alleged against him. Zarek, too, seems like a hopeless case. He rejects her, threatens her companion (a wolf who is actually a shapeshifter), has no manners or social graces, refuses to answer her questions. And she knows about his past, his murderous acts.<br />And yet... there's something about him...<br />Gradually, Astrid begins to learn about Zarek's past. The illegitimate son of a Roman officer, he was the household whipping-boy. His father, his half-brothers and all the servants treated him cruelly and mercilessly. By the time of his death, in his late twenties, his body was so scarred and misshapen that Artemis, without even asking had `healed' his wounds and given him a `normal' appearance. But no-one had ever thought to show Zarek kindness, or teach him how to behave with courtesy. He has been rejected by his own kind, the Dark-Hunters, every bit as much as in his life he had been rejected by mortals.<br />But, as Astrid finds herself falling in love with him, she wonders how she can possibly find him anything other than guilty for the crimes of his past. Unless... is it possible that they weren't his crimes at all?<br />Zarek's story is heartwrenching. But in Dance With The Devil we also find out much more about Acheron, so much so that I can't wait for his story. Just who - or what - is Acheron? What happens to him when he loses his temper and even gods quake before him? I both liked and hated him in this book: after all, he's known the truth about Zarek all along and still abandoned him to 900 years of painful exile. <br />But I see that Kenyon isn't planning on satisfying our curiosity any time soon; the next book in the series is about Wulf, Talon's apparent friend mentioned in Midnight Embrace (I say apparent because, although Talon claimed Wulf as his best friend, he barely thought of the man in most of the book). There's also a very strange extract from something else at the end of this book, completely unexplained in any way - although it's called A Dark-Hunter Christmas, it makes no sense on its own and it's clearly part of a long story, there is no publication date or any other information given.<br />Loved Zarek; roll on Acheron!<br />wmr-uk	2004-03-13

He can only watch and try to warn her as she is betrayed by her younger sister and her lover, taken as a sacrifice to a waiting vampire - who doesn't kill her, but turns her into a vampire. <br />Back in hospital in the US, Will is still haunted by the dreams he's had of Sarafina. He still believes that they were no more than dreams, until one day he startles a man called Jameson Bryant who is stealing blood. Bryant reminds Will of the vampire Bartrone he had seen in his dreams... and when Bryant confirms that he is indeed a vampire, Will begins to wonder whether Sarafina might actually exist. And when, a few weeks later, Bryant hires Will to `babysit' his daughter, Amber Lily, the first child born to vampires, on her trip to New York, Will seizes the opportunity to ask for help to find Sarafina.<br />She exists, but is now an embittered, cruel woman, having been betrayed or abandoned by anyone she ever cared for: her sister, her lover, the vampire Bartrone who ended his existence by walking out into the sun, and later her great-nephew Dante, who rejected her in favour of Morgan. Now, Sarafina creates human slaves who do her bidding unquestioningly, including feeding her on demand. She also selects mortals whom she considers unworthy and feeds from them. When Sarafina discovers that Will, whom she'd thought of as some godlike or supernatural creature who loved her, is a mere mortal man - and not even one of the Chosen, at that, so he cannot possibly be with her for eternity - she turns vicious, threatening to kill him unless he leaves her alone.<br />Later, when she sees Will tailing two young women, one of whom is a vampire, she suspects him of being either a pervert or with the DPI, and she kidnaps him, attempting to turn him into another mindless slave. And, while Will is thus distracted, Amber Lily is kidnapped...<br />I hadn't expected to like this book. I hated Sarafina in Twilight Hunger, and it took a long time for me to warm to her in this book, though I did (mostly) in the end. What really made this book for me, apart from Will, whom I liked very much, was the role played by characters from previous Shayne novellas, principally Jameson and Angelica and Roland and Rhiannon. The story is still quite dark, made more so by Sarafina's behaviour, hence four stars rather than five, but the scenes with other vampire characters made up for a lot of that.<br />There are several unresolved threads in this book, which I hope will be resolved in Shayne's next, Edge of Twilight, which is principally about Amber Lily. Certainly, with Embrace the Twilight, Shayne seems at last to have discovered how to write a full-length novel about her characters without boring readers!<br />wmr-uk	2004-03-13

Having lived through part of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the era of the Founding Fathers, civil wars in England and the USA, world wars and the opening night of The King And I, he knows his history - and so ten years ago he started writing accounts of the periods he's lived through. Not as dry and dusty as most history books, they sold really well. And then, as his siblings started to meet the partners of their dreams and, as well as the usual agonies associated with love and marriage, had to deal with the issue of exactly when to tell their loved ones that they are centuries old and drink blood in order to live - that in fact they are vampires - Luc turned to writing their stories as well.<br />Unfortunately - or fortunately in one respect! - his editor assumed that he'd switched to writing fiction. And his books have been marketed on the romance list. And now Luke Amirault, his pen-name, is a best-seller, and his new editor, Kate Leever, is pestering him to do some publicity. Nothing much. Not too onerous Just a few interviews. A couple of TV appearances. An international book-signing tour. <br />Luc's responses to Kate's letters are short and to the point. <br />\\"Dear Ms Leever,<BR>No.\\"<br />Knowing that her job depends on getting her elusive author to drop the surly, uncommunicative and downright hostile approach he's taken and become just a bit more grateful to the publishing company which has brought him fame and fortune, Kate turns up unannounced at his house, determined to get him to change his mind.<br />Panicked - he can't, after all, afford to let Kate find out the truth about him, and she's already getting suspicious on discovering that his siblings and their spouses have the same names and occupations as the characters in his books - Luc agrees to just one interview. The Romantic Times one his mother suggests. But what his mother has omitted to tell him is that the RT event is not an interview - it's a five-day *conference*! In the US, while he lives in Canada!<br />And so a very hungry vampire - after all, he can't take blood past customs - turns up at a romantic fiction conference. And Luc, despite being babysat by two editors - Kate and her male colleague Chris - finds temptation all around. Imagine what Kate thinks when she returns to their suite to find Luc, to whom she is more than a little attracted,  nibbling Chris's neck! Or her thoughts when he swiftly turns his nibbling to her...<br />What with jewelled codpieces, raids on blood banks, a vampire fancy-dress party and interfering vampire siblings all over the place, this book is a riot. If you never knew that vampire romance could be funny, this is the place to start! And Sands is continuing the series; Etienne and Rachel's story is now available in Love Bites.

I don't read much literary fiction, mainly because much of it is more about the style with which the novel is written or the allegories or hidden meanings which readers are supposed to detect, cleverly hidden as they are among the novel's usually rather thin storyline. When I read fiction, I read it for the emotional involvement with the characters, and thus my preference is for authors who can invoke emotion with their words.<br />The reviews carried on this book's jacket appear to promise such emotional involvement: we are told that it is `haunting' and `magical', `unbearably poignant' and `steeped in atmosphere'. Maybe it's me, but I didn't see any of that. What I did see was a not-very-well-fleshed-out story about a young Dutch girl with an unusual fascination with colours and imagery, employed to work as a maid in the household of the seventeenth-century painter Vermeer. The household is fraught with traps for the unwary, where no matter what she says Griet may end up in trouble with someone. And yet through all of this, for a character we are meant to believe is uncertain, alarmed, unsure of her status, Griet appears remarkably calm and even capable. She chooses meat better than the household's existing cook; she can even cook better, too! And she can apparently teach Vermeer himself how to give his paintings that extra touch they need to make them unique.<br />But it is the emotions which are the least convincing. Chevalier always tells, rather than shows, when it comes to Griet's emotions. For instance, Griet is subject to the lecherous desires of van Ruijven, and also to his stolen touches. She tells us (very briefly) that she dislikes it, but the few mentions are very dispassionate. Even more emotionless is Griet's courtship with Pieter the butcher. In the accounts of the time they spend together, it appears as if Griet barely tolerates him - and yet this relationship appears to be serious. With Pieter she experiences her first kiss, and this barely ratesa mention; more intimacy is described as if the narrator is a detached, uninterested observer rather than the active participant.<br />In fact, the whole book feels written from a perspective of emotional detachment. I didn't find myself caring about the characters at all, which led to a sense of scepticism about the interest which Vermeer himself is supposed to show in Griet - whether real or just as the potential subject of a painting - and about Griet herself as a credible character. Whether I would have finished the book had I not been reading it to while away a train journey I don't know, but it certainly didn't interest me enough to consider re-reading it, or going to see the film.<br />wmr-uk	2004-03-12

I came to it with high hopes... but was disappointed.<br />The Dark-Hunters are the same: they're still great characters and I love Acheron just as much here as in Night Pleasures. Talon... didn't do it for me. Nor did Sunshine, as it happens. She was just too flaky for my liking. What made the book worth finishing were the sub-plots: mainly Acheron, including his relationship with Artemis and Styxx, but also Zarek and Valerian. Now those stories I will read!<br />But Talon. He's cursed that any woman he falls in love with will die, so he has indulged in one-night stands for fifteen hundred years. And he doesn't even seem to put up a fight with Sunshine? Fifteen hundred years of controlling his feelings, and he goes completely out of control after one night? He tells her that he loves her while still telling himself and everyone else that he doesn't? That just doesn't convince me.<br />What really made me dislike Talon and Sunshine's story, though, was the reincarnation plot. Sure, I know I'm reading a fantasy/supernatural novel, but I have my threshold, and reincarnation goes way, way beyond it. As soon as I realised that was where Kenyon was going, she lost me in terms of her lead characters.<br />A further niggle related to her use of ancient language. Talon's a Celt, true. His sister Ceara (should be Ciara?) speaks to him in what is clearly Gaelic - okay, the languages are related, so that's not too much of a problem. But Kenyon gets the fadas (accents) backwards, and the use of the language is stilted. Ceara wouldn't call Talon `my bráthair'! She'd call him simply `bráthair' or `mo bráthair' - it just doesn't make sense to use Gaelic for half of the phrase.<br />Anyway, one so-so story out of the way; Zarek's is next, and since I found him much more interesting than Talon, that one should be better.<br />wmr-uk	2004-02-28

Invitations to her soirees and entertainments are richly prized, and no-one is allowed in without an invitation. She is disturbed, therefore, to see a handsome, self-assured gentlemen there one evening to whom she knows she did not issue an invitation. Gideon Ravel attempts to charm her, but she is suspicious.<br />Yet Gideon keeps visiting her, often appearing unannounced - how does he get past her servants? - and appears interested in the amulet she wears around her neck. He's not the only gentleman interested in it, however: Tristan Soltern, whom she likes even less than Gideon, attempts to buy it from her. Which of the two should she trust? Can she trust either? And what secrets is Simone hiding herself?<br />Gideon is a rather tame vampire, I have to admit. Sure, he has some abilities, but he doesn't behave like a vampire in the traditional sense. He lusts after Simone, but he never seems even remotely tempted to bite her. Has his two hundred years behind the veil emasculated him entirely? I wouldn't want him to be the kind of vampire Soltern is, of course, but a little bit of danger about him wouldn't have gone amiss. As it was, he was far more of a guardian angel than a real vampire, of whom Simone should have been wary as much as she was attracted to him.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a massive plot spoiler on the back cover of the book; whoever wrote that description should be fired! The information on the cover is not revealed until 3/4 through the book, and itdid spoil my enjoyment. Don't read it!

The man she'd loved all her life married someone else a couple of years ago, and the men she'd turned to after losing Damon have all abandoned her for other women - though she's self-critical enough to admit that at least some of it is her own fault. So when her father brings her a proposal of marriage from a man she has never met, she's just desperate enough to escape the whispers to accept.<br />Miles Croft, recently returned from the wars and sold out of the army, needs a wife. Money isn't an issue; what he needs most of all is someone who has a secure position in Society, so that she can launch his younger sister Camille and provide a steady influence for his younger brother. His mother, cowed by her second husband, has neither the confidence nor the influence to help - so his choice of wife is crucial. Lady Annabelle appears to fit the bill in every respect.<br />So a marriage of convenience, entered into not because either character even likes the other. Annabelle, on her wedding night, is shocked to discover that her husband actually intends to consummate the marriage *now* rather than waiting until she feels ready to do so - and, although the act is mildly pleasurable for her, the pain she feels doesn't recommend lovemaking very much to her.<br />But then, the very next day, as they journey to Miles' holiday home in Devon, Annabelle is taken ill. She has influenza, and is very badly affected, almost dying. A quack doctor has her head shorn and cuts and bleeds her; that, combined with an alarming degree of weight loss, robs her of her good looks and turns her in appearance into a skeletal, bald, pock-marked child. Miles has stayed with her throughout, out of pity and a sense of responsibility, but it is during this time that the couple actually become close - far closer, it seems, than they might have become had Annabelle not been ill.<br />But then, how can she re-enter Society with her looks gone? How can she possibly help Camille? And be the kind of wife Miles needs? Annabelle fears that he will never see her as attractive again, let alone want to make love with her and give her children. But does Annabelle's only interest for Miles lie in her looks?<br />Contrary to another comment, Miles does not lose all sexual interest in Annabelle while she's recovering; he does want her, but he's afraid to hurt her or get her pregnant before she is strong enough to carry a child.<br />This book continues Edith Layton's C series, and readers of that series will recognise Annabelle as the capricious, selfish woman rejected by Damon, Rafe and Drum, and in whom Eric Ford pretends an interest order to help Rafe. Can she be redeemed? I really wasn't sure - but then Layton confounded all my expectations and made me like Annabelle. It is her illness which makes all the difference: robbed of her beauty, Annabelle has to fall back on finer qualities, which make her a much more likeable person. <br />You will also get glimpses of characters from previous books in To Marry A Stranger, and there is hope that Eric Ford may get his own book next.

But, despite his kindness towards her, he treats her like a little sister.<br />Eric, though he does his best to hide it, is in love with Camille too. He won't act on his feelings, however, because he suffers from recurring bouts of malaria and, as he sees it, there is no guarantee that he will live a long life. He can be struck down by an attack at any time, and although he's recovered each time so far, it's not guaranteed. He feels that it wouldn't be fair to Camille to let her tie herself to a husband who could be an invalid, or worse.<br />Enter Nell Baynes, a woman every bit as beautiful as Camille feels herself plain - and Nell's cousin and guardian, who begins a courtship of Camille. Jealousy finally prompts Eric to tell Camille how he feels about her - but with about 150 pages of the book left to go, what kind of spanner is going to be thrown in the works?<br />This would, in my opinion, have been a much better book without the dramatic plot and the involvement of the secondary characters, Nell and her cousin. There was more than enough material for Layton in dealing with Eric's fears about his illness and Camille's lack of self-confidence and, instead of introducing irrelevant and uninteresting characters, she could have spent more time showing the development of Eric and Camille's friendship and Eric's growing realisation of his feelings for Camille. I would have enjoyed the book far more had Layton developed the plot in that way.<br />Nevertheless, as always it was good to see characters from previous books, though as in each case Layton seems to focus on Drum and Rafe and their spouses, with brief glimpses of Gilly and Damon. While Ewen Sinclair, one of my favouritecharacters from the series, does make an appearance in this book, it's almost entirely offstage, and Hathaway Wycoff is only mentioned. More of these two in future books, Layton! Although, since Gilly's younger sister Betsy seems to be of marriageable age now, I suspect that her story is about to come - and if that's the case, we'll have to see more of Ewen. Or so I hope!	2003-12-27

I don't dissent from one word of her review. I'll just add that if you're a fan of Balogh, as I am, and you occasionally like a change from her beautifully angsty and introspective romances, you'll enjoy this one thoroughly.<br />Josephine and Paul make a delightful couple, falling in love at the same time as they continue to squabble and tell each other off. He tells himself that she is so completely unsuited to being a duchess and that he's appalled at the knowledge that her madcap escapades, and his own stupidity in going along with them, means that he's going to be tied to her for life. Josephine thinks, at times, that Paul is no better than any other man, always wanting women to obey him without question - but then he is so nice and so kind and he has saved her not only from the evil Mr Porterhouse, but also from the lecherous and horrid Duke of Mitford, who is waiting at her father's home to force her to marry him.<br />Throughout this caper, we can sense Paul falling more and more deeply in love, and at the same time wondering how on earth he will ever be able to confess his true identity. As every day goes by, and as every opportunity is missed, surely Josephine's reaction will be worse? <br />A delight of a book, even if it won't be re-read as frequently as Balogh's heartwrenching novels. <br />wmr-uk	2003-11-16
908383:US	52631742	R1S6I4CVTWRDKK	1903809983	4565942	A Life Inside: A Prisoner's Notebook	Books	5	10	10	N	N	If you only read one prison diary, make it this one	In the early 1980s, Erwin James - a pseudonym - was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was in his early twenties at the time. What his crime was we are never told, and nor is it relevant to this account, although James himself never tries to minimise it, making clear that he believes that he deserves his punishment. We're also told that he had a `tariff' of twenty-five years, later reduced to 20. In 2000, James began writing a series of fortnightly columns for the Guardian newspaper, on life as a `lifer' in the prison system. It is these columns, or those printed up to January 2003 (James continues to write for the Guardian) which are published in this collection.<br />James, in his first couple of years writing for the Guardian, was not paid; a note at the bottom of each column read: `Erwin James is serving a life sentence. He has not been paid for this column'. At that point, the fee went to charity, but once James was moved to open conditions and permitted to engage in paid employment, the fee was held in trust for him. Surprisingly, in 2003 the Press Complaints Commission criticised the newspaper for running the column and for paying a serving prisoner for writing; given the plaudits the newspaper has received, and which have been lavished on this book, by people such as Martin Narey, Director of the Prison Service, that decision by the PCC was astounding. <br />In his columns, James shows the reality of life inside high- and medium-security prisons in a way other, more high-profile, prison memoirs fail to do. We meet fellow prisoners - all pseudonymised - and experience their hopes and disappointments through the clarity of James' writing. He doesn't look for sympathy, and it's clear that he supports the aims of the prison system, but at the same time his accounts leave the reader understanding that it is possible to believe both in the merits of prison as a rehabilitative function and in the need for comprehensive reform. The book is entirely devoid of self-pity; instead we find often harsh accounts of prison life, but interspersed by humour and `human interest' stories. <br />We meet Cody, who for the duration of the 20 years he spent `inside' has protested his innocence; we learn that he has just been released on licence and given leave to appeal. But James also ensures that we understand the unpredictability of the appeal system - it seems as if Cody has little chance of success. (In fact, a recent Guardian column revealed that Cody was successful after all, though given his state of health he may not have much opportunity left to enjoy his freedom).<br />The effects of the iniquitous tariff system are shown when, in 1994, lifers were finally told the tariffs which had been set by the Home Secretary in their cases: prisoners who had been making progress towards rehabilitation suddenly learned that they faced twice as long remaining on their sentence than they'd anticipated, or in some cases that they would never be released. Some of those receiving bad news on that occasion then committed suicide. Similarly, highlighting another area ripe for reform, James tells us of lifers released on licence who had been recalled to prison for a minor misdemeanour - or, in one case, having been prosecuted for something for which the jury took eight minutes to acquit! - and then faced many more years in prison. <br />Occasionally, James gives advice to other prisoners as to how to survive a long stretch inside. One thing he doesn't say, but which comes across very clearly from this account, is that without hope it's simply not possible to survive. His preferred piece of advice, however, is: `Learn to live where you are, and not where you think you want to be.'<br />James is now, as he was at the date of the final column in this book, in an open prison, in paid employment. In due course, therefore, he should be released on licence and, as Ian Katz, the editor of the Guardian supplement which publishes James' columns and who writes aforeword to this book, notes, he now as a `well-established career as a writer and journalist'. I hope to read much more of James' work in future, once he is released - and I hope that the Guardian also recognises its responsibility towards the man who has written for the newspaper for the past three years and enhanced its reputation in the process. <br />wmr-uk	2003-11-08

Ever since, she's tried to forget him and fall in love with someone else, but she can't get him out of her mind.<br />For his part, Perryn can't imagine why he's so intrigued with Fenella, especially as he knows that she isn't the lady of his dreams. He's still searching for the golden angel who rescued him from the pit of despair five years earlier, when he was grieving for the death of his lover. So why does his Fennel, as he calls her, matter to him so much?<br />Someone else thinks she knows, and so when Perryn and Fenella are guests at her house party Mrs Altringham devises a plan to throw them together. She holds a charity treasure hunt, in which her guests must pair off and spend two weeks travelling around the countryside in coaches, collecting items to sell for charity. The best collection will win a prize. Fenella, being naturally competitive, wants to win - but is appalled when her host's machinations pair her up with Perryn, with whom she fights almost every time they meet, and whom she has an almost irresistible desire to kiss. Can they possibly spend two weeks in close proximity without killing each other?<br />The romance is actually quite well done; Fenella and Perryn go through appropriate phases of impatience and irritation with each other, moments of inexplicable desire, and spend time getting to know each other very well - enough to learn some surprising things about each other. But the setting is so incredible that I can't rate this book any higher than two stars.<br />First, a lady and a gentleman - not related to each other - alone in a carriage for hours at a time? Where were the chaperones? This is simply not possible. Equally, where were the chaperones at the houses the teams visited? Men and women seemed to be alone together without a single person batting an eyelid. <br />Second, it's equally impossible that the teams could have been out every day. Carriage-travel was exhausting in the early nineteenth century; the roads were dusty and full of holes, and no matter how well-sprung a carriage was, there is simply no way that Mrs Altringham's guests would have turned out day after day to travel from place to place. And travelling on the day after a ball (which would have ended late) and on a Sunday? Simply not possible.<br />Third, how could Perryn have possibly held a ball at his country estate four days into the expedition? Fenella notes that he would have needed at least two weeks to organise it - and yet he, like her, didn't know that they would be going on the expedition, and ending up at his home, until the night before they left. Silly plot hole, that.<br />The narrative is not, as another reviewer suggested, in any way reminiscent of Jane Austen. I was jolted out of the story on several occasions by Americanisms and anachronisms in narrative and dialogue, and by grammatical errors. There were also elementary errors in word usage: King, `disinterested' does not mean *un*interested! <br />The subplot regarding Fenella's brother seemed forced and unnecessary. Finally, it was very strange that we never learned Perryn's first name! <br />wmr-uk	2003-11-07

In the first, the vampire is a lady, Anna; an actress in a travelling company owned by her own creator, Vladim. She is on a quest for revenge, but also longs to be mortal again. When she meets the descendant of the man she loathes, can revenge be defeated by love? And can a mortal love a vampire?<br />In the second story, Stanislaus is a Transylvanian, born a vampire. In London as part of the Russian Tsar's entourage, he meets Aphrodite, a young woman who seems to attract trouble, and he is drawn to her and must protect her. But can she accept him for what he is?<br />The best in the collection is about Stanislaus's cousin Sergio. A much older vampire, he has for over a century been searching for an ancient manuscript which will reveal to him the secret of how to become mortal again. This search becomes all the more urgent when he meets Tamsin and falls in love for the first time: he will not marry her and watch her grow old and leave him while he remains forever young. But Tamsin has a secret of her own...<br />This is a collection of vampire romances, and therefore right up my street, I thought when I ordered it. Unlike some other reviewers, I'm not a fan of Christine Feehan or Laurel K Hamilton, so I was not looking for violence and danger; I wanted romance. <br />However, the first story was very disappointing. Quite apart from the surprise of encountering a vampire who can go out in the daylight and who eats and drinks normally, and never drinks blood, the story simply didn't hold my interest. One star, perhaps.<br />The second two were considerably better, although I was still taken aback by some of the variances from generally-accepted vampire writing - again, the vampires can go out during the day and eat normally. I would have also preferred both of these stories to be longer, and therefore perhaps to have been the only two in the collection, since the first was so poor. Inboth, the conflict between the characters was resolved far too quickly and too easily, clearly to fit the constraints of a less-than-100-page novella.<br />Oh, and the area of London is Piccadilly, not Picadilly!<br />wmr	2003-09-28

Want to hear more about her vampire heroes? Well, this book does offer the opportunity - at least, in part. But it falls far short of the original Wings in the Night stories and of the initial follow-up volume, At Twilight.<br />In this collection, we have a new novella, Run from Twilight, and another reissue, Twilight Vows. In Run from Twilight, Mary is being targetted by a serial killer. Michael Grey appears from nowhere, it seems, and he claims that he's protecting Mary - but is he the killer? Michael is a vampire who was mortally wounded at the height of Al Capone's `reign' in Chicago, but he was transformed at the point of death by Cuyler Jade of Beyond Twilight. The most melodramatic point of this book is when Michael's wife, Sally, shoots herself in front of him, apparently unable to reconcile herself either to his death or to his `resurrection' as a vampire. <br />The Michael and Mary story certainly has its moments, and it was intriguing to see that the investigation organisation Mary contacts is run by Maxine, Lou and Stormy, the more likeable characters from Twilight Hunger. Disappointingly, still Shayne hasn't furthered the romantic plot regarding Lou and Maxine. Anyway, I was enjoying Michael and Mary's story until suddenly - WHAM - it was over, at a point where I was expecting at least 20 more pages to finish the romance and the general storyline in a more satisfying manner.<br />Twilight Vows, the reissue, is set in Ireland - and it's advisable to read this *before* reading Twilight Hunger, given the major spoiler in Hunger which affects this novella. Rachel Sullivan has been fascinated all her life by the legend of the two vampires who once lived in the castle. However, she never expected that one of them, at least, was still alive. So when Donovan O'Roark walks into her pub, she is astounded. Even then, though, she takes him for a descendant of the original Donovan - until, after she follows him to the castle and wangles herself an invitation to stay the night, she discovers the truth: he really is a vampire.<br />Like most American authors writing Irish characters, Shayne wildly exaggerates Irish speech rhythms and dialect; as an Irish person I felt embarrassed reading it. No-one says `Lord `a mercy'; the expression is `Lord have mercy'. Many of her other faintly-phonetic renderings fall short of the mark. And I wonder who advised her on Irish names? Donovan is never, in Ireland at any rate, used as a first name; it is a surname. And Donovan's surname is properly spelt O'Roarke. <br />Again, as with Run from Twilight, this novella was over-short. Donovan went from denying that Rachel meant anything to him to realising that he loved her in far too short a time, and we saw nothing about his own feeling about her in years gone by, given that he'd watched over her since her childhood. Shayne did this much better with regard to Eric and Tamsin in Wings in the Night. Again, the story needed another 20 pages or so at the end to finish it properly, too. <br />Overall, this collection needed at least another 50 pages to be worthwhile. The stories in Wings in the Night worked because they were long enough to cover what needed to be covered; the romances were satisfying, and we also saw more of the characters in later books, which equally helped to round off the stories. These novellas, as well as being too short, gave us far too little of characters from earlier books (nothing at all in Twilight Vows), so that hook wasn't present either.<br />A very disappointing sequel, just as Shayne's Twilight Hunger, her first novel-length story - was disappointing. I just hope that her latest offering, Embrace the Twilight - another novel-length story, is better!<br />wmr-uk	2003-09-25

This is the third book in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series. Sookie's boyfriend, Bill, has been rather odd lately: distant and uncommunicative, and certainly not as affectionate as she needs him to be. And then suddenly he announces that he's going away, he can't - or won't? - tell her why, and that if for some reason he doesn't come back she is to hand over certain documents to Eric, his vampire boss. <br />Next thing, Eric arrives on Sookie's doorstep and tells her that he's afraid that Eric is dead as the result of a dispute with the king of Louisiana. Which - apart from anything else - tells Sookie that Bill lied to her, as he'd told her that he was going to the west coast. Plus, Eric tells Sookie that the reason Bill left her in the first place was that he'd hooked up again with a former girlfriend, another vampire. And that he'd left instructions with Eric to give Sookie a payoff.<br />Well, Sookie is, not surprisingly, furious. She goes, at Eric's request, to Louisiana to try to find out what's going on, and is assisted by a rather nice werewolf, to whom she is attracted - well, our Sookie seems to find herself being attracted to a lot of strange men, as we've seen, what with kissing Eric in book 2 and Sam in book 1.<br />Anyway, Bill, of course, isn't dead. But - and this is one of my problems with the book - he has treated Sookie abominably. In fact, in this book I liked Eric an awful lot more and I found myself wishing that Sookie would dump Bill for Eric. Although I've finally accepted that Harris isn't writing a romance series here, and there was far from enough romance in this book to keep me happy, there were some scenes with Sookie and Eric which were verging on the romantic - and Eric takes far better care of Sookie when she's hurt (and even when she isn't) than Bill does. Bill, it's clear, is simply taking her for granted.<br />The book is somewhat inconclusive in the end, however, which does indicate that there will be a fourth, at least.However, I will have to read the reviews of the next book before deciding whether to buy it. Club Dead was unevenly-written, shorter than either of its predecessors and contained developments of the characters which I didn't like - and I now no longer like one of the principal characters in the series. So Harris has some work to do if she's going to keep me as a reader.<br />wmr-uk	2003-09-18

His conviction occurred as a result of new evidence indicating that there had been a conspiracy, instigated by Archer himself, to 'prove' that he could not possibly have been with a prostitute on the night in question. <br />Convicted of perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, Archer was initially sent to Belmarsh, a high-security jail in London, pending recategorisation to a lower-security prison based on being assessed as low-risk. He spent a period of just over a month in Belmarsh, and this diary - written while in prison - is the result.<br />In reading it, one has to learn to ignore the continual hard-done-by attitude of Archer. He consistently pleads his innocence, despite his guilt being indisputable, and complains about the 'bias' of the trial judge. We are treated to a stream of commentary about the judge's summing-up, and as if that's not enough, Archer tells us all about the letters he receives sympathising with him and agreeing that he has been treated unfairly (he doesn't mention any correspondence which says that he got what he deserved!). He also name-drops constantly in relation to 'famous' people who are apparently on his side.<br />He also has to name-drop in relation to fellow prisoners, so we hear about Ronnie Biggs, the Great Train Robber, who is also in Belmarsh, and also Barry George, on remand at the time awaiting trial for the murder of Jill Dando. In this respect, it is hard to understand how the book got published; it is apparently against Home Office rules to identify serving prisoners in this way.<br />All that aside, there are some telling insights into prison life which deserve wider reading. For instance, Archer puts forward a vigorous argument against sending those convicted of minor offences and serving short terms to a high-security prison such as Belmarsh. The young man serving six weeks for breaking a red light is a telling example: he is being put under severe pressure to murder the witness in another prisoner's trial, once he is released. Another short-term prisoner was persuaded to try heroin for the first time while in Belmarsh, and within a couple of days is addicted: so when he is released once his six weeks are up, how will he fund his addiction?<br />There are certainly lessons to be learned about the prison culture and the criminal justice system from Archer's book, and given the author's reputation as a novelist, this book is sure to get a wide circulation. However, it is far from being the best critical account of prison life in recent years; I would recommend that anyone wishing to read a less egotistical and melodramatic account might look for Erwin James' A Life Inside, available from amazon.co.uk	2003-09-01

But, as with all anthologies, quality varies and in the end it's not worth the purchase price.<br />Amanda Ashley's Masquerade is better than a number of her longer novels, though it contains yet another tortured vampire who tries to give up the woman he loves because he won't `subject' her to what he is. Jason loves Leanne, but has only approached her because she was in danger. He can't resist spending some time with her, but he knows that it's only a matter of time before he must send her away for her own good. Anyone who's read any of Ashley's novels will know how the story goes. What set this one apart for me was the allegory with the Phantom of the Opera musical. Ashley draws comparisons between `Phantom' and Jason's existence as a vampire. Enjoyable - perhaps 3 stars.<br />It's really unfortunate that the longest story in this anthology was also by far the worst. Christine Feehan's Dark Dream was appallingly bad. The protagonists meet and `fall in love' in the space of about an hour, right at the start of the book. Oh, sure, Sara is scared of Falcon at first because she thinks he's a vampire (he isn't; he's some sort of weird sub-vampiric species Feehan has invented for her books, which I've never read); but within seconds she `sees' into his eyes and she `knows' him as someone she's known in her dreams for years. And then they're apart for the vast majority of this 150-page novella. The rest of the story is a vampire hunt: it's violent and ugly and unutterably boring. There was far too little interaction between the protagonists, and I wasn't convinced that they were in love. Oh, and just how many times does Falcon have to `exchange' with Sara before she's converted?! Awful.<br />Finally, Rhonda Thompson's Midnight Serenade is somewhat different: Rick is a werewolf, and Stephanie is an environmentalist whose job is studying and filming wolves in the wild. This story felt rushed; I would have liked to know much more about how Rick became a werewolf, and I would also have liked to see the protagonists get to know each other better - it was more like falling in lust than in love.<br />Overall, this isn't a collection I'd read again. <br />wmr-uk	2003-08-13

This book is the sequel to one called Cassandra's Deception and, while it might be helpful to have read that before this one, I had no trouble working out the plot of the earlier book. It's summarised several times before the half-way mark of Belle's Beau.<br />Belle and Cassandra are identical twins who were separated as infants (in what seems to be quite an incredible set of circumstances). Belle was brought up by her reclusive grandfather, and Cassandra by an aunt and uncle who live mainly in London. On meeting again, the twins performed a switch, which eventually resulted in Belle's being invited to London to be launched for a Season. And this is the story of this book.<br />At the same time as Belle arrives in London, Lord Ashton (*not* Lord Adam Ashton!), a viscount, arrives home from the wars determined to marry. He remembers a young lady whom he talked to while recuperating in Bath the previous year, and he wants to meet her again with a view to marrying her. Unfortunately for him, that was Cassandra. And when he sees Belle, of course he thinks that she is that lady...<br />So he pursues Belle in the belief that she's the one he spent hours with the previous year and should have proposed to. And the big misunderstanding of the story is based around the fact that, since Belle never refers to Bath and looks bemused when he mentions the city, Ashton must have meant nothing to her. <br />There is an unsatisfactory sub-plot based around Belle feeling that she never quite manages to match up to Cassandra, but this is never resolved; in fact, a pivotal scene is broken off part-way through and we are never shown the resolution.<br />And even when all the mistaken identity stuff is finally sorted out and it looks as if all is well, Buck throws another very silly spanner in the works. By that stage, I was rolling my eyes in disbelief.<br />The other question is: just which twin is Ashton in love with? Cassandra is the one he really knows, and for most of their courtship he thinks that Belle is Cassandra. They may both enjoy riding, but I never got the impression that they had much in common otherwise. <br />Irritating elements: Buck's continual use of `misses' when `young lady' would be the appropriate term, and her very, very repetitive prose, telling us again and again things we already know. She mentions something in narrative, then says it again, and then - in case we still haven't got the message - a character says it in dialogue. That just got tedious.<br />A one-time skim-read only. <br />wmr-uk	2003-07-29

Mary has fallen from grace and has been banished to Italy until she's fit to be seen again. The only problem is that no-one will agree to take the visitors to the Villa of the Three Fountains.<br />It is the mid-1800s, and Italy is divided, parts of the country under Austrian rule. And part of the problem is that the locals in Modena don't know whether Cordelia and her companions are in league with the Austrians; of course, that's not helped when a couple of Austrian army officers offer to escort the women to the villa. When they arrive, they find that the villa is occupied - by the Count of Albion, an Italian nobleman who claims that his father and grandfather owned it before him.<br />The Count reluctantly agrees to let the women stay, but Cordelia realises very soon that there's something extremely odd about him. They have a strange mental connection which very soon has her visualising herself in bed with him, making love with him... and allowing him to bite her throat. And she's not even afraid of the idea of it!<br />The Count, for his part, is desperately fighting his attraction to Cordelia; the last time he slept with a woman, he killed her, and he doesn't want that to happen to Cordelia. Unfortunately, she's come to him during his 'in heat' period, when he desperately needs to mate and to procreate. Can he keep himself away from her?<br />In the background to this novel is the struggle for independence against Austrian rule, and the Count is deeply involved here, though not in the way he may initially appear. This is an interesting and intelligent aspect of the story, which makes it even more disappointing that it simply vanishes as the story concludes. Cresswell also omits to provide any sort of closure for Cordelia's cousin Mary; she simply disappears from the narrative after a while. This sloppiness prevents this book getting a higher rating. Incidentally, I also agree with another reviewer about the idiotic character names.<br />Cresswell's vampire mythology is rather different from that of any other writer I've come across, and I'm not entirely sure that I like it. Her vampires, as we discover at the beginning of the book, are actually aliens from another planet. They don't appear to need to avoid the daylight. And, most strange of all, they can reproduce, as long as the woman they mate with survives the encounter. <br />Anyway, this is a readable book, but not a keeper for me.<br />	2003-07-04

She's far from the type of woman whom the known rake, Lord Edmond Waite, would be interested in - and yet, stranded alone together in Vauxhall Gardens in the middle of a thunderstorm, they discover each other in the most intimate way possible.<br />How could this have happened? This is exactly what Mary asks herself once she's home again. She hates men of Lord Edmond's type; he was a rake in the worst possible sense, and she was well aware that only a few months earlier he'd been involved in a scandal with another woman, who had apparently almost run off with him while engaged to another man. But Mary is terrified of thunderstorms due to a childhood trauma, and she knows that she can't exactly blame Lord Edmond for making love to her; in her terror, she had pleaded with him to do it. But it will never happen again. He is not her type. He is everything she despises... and yet. And yet she is powerfully attracted to him, as she has never been to any other man. Not even Marcus, the Earl of Clifton (hero of A Counterfeit Betrothal), who was her close friend for so many years.<br />As for Edmond, still stinging from Felicity's rejection, he is equally determined that Mary is not his type. Despite the fact that being with her haunts his dreams, he knows very well that he doesn't belong in her world, and he can't imagine her wanting to belong in his. And yet he is still attracted to her: Mary, the mousy bluestocking, a type of woman he tells himself is beneath his notice. He can't seem to stop himself coming up with excuses for them to meet, and when they do, he can't prevent himself baiting her just to see her shaken out of her studied politeness. <br />No, Edmond and Mary are worlds apart... or are they? For Mary, little by little, begins to discover that Edmond is not the ignorant,heartless, Philistine rake he pretends to be. She gradually discovers, to her shock, that he can be hurt. That *she* can hurt him. And also that he has a knowledge of culture and literature better than her own - but why does he try to hide it? And what is the mystery surrounding his brother's death, when Edmond was only eighteen, and for which the world - including Edmond himself - holds him responsible?<br />Is Edmond really such a notorious rake as he appears? <br />Can Mary use her engagement to another man to put Edmond out of her mind and make him keep away from her?<br />This is in many ways an unforgettable book, and Edmond is one of my favourite `tortured' Balogh heroes. We begin by disliking him - and for anyone who read the first book in this linked trilogy, The Trysting Place, the dislike is even greater. But by even a quarter of the way into the book, we find our perceptions changing. We haven't even found out any of Edmond's secrets by this stage, which is what is so skilful about Balogh's writing. She can make readers feel empathy even for a character we should dislike. But as we learn more and more about Edmond, discovering along the way that he is compassionate, sensitive and capable of showing great nobility, we long to know the real secrets of his past - and for him to find the happiness he deserves.<br />A keeper, this book, if you can get your hands on it.	2003-06-08

Regular readers of Jo Beverley will have met Tris Tregallows, the Duke of St Raven, in her last book, Hazard. In one of his appearances in that book, he plays the highwayman, Le Corbeau, and that is how we first meet him in his own story. He holds up the carriage in which Cressida Mandeville is travelling and is immediately intrigued by what is obviously a lady in distress, travelling under duress with her escort. And yet a lady who does not wish for his rescue.<br />Cressida, in a desperate attempt to regain her family fortune, has agreed to accompany Lord Crofton to an orgy. In return for partnering him there and sacrificing her virginity to him, he has promised to return to her some ivory erotic statues - within one of which is hidden the precious gems which will recoup her father's gambling losses. She had a cunning plan to escape becoming Crofton's mistress too, or so she thought. But all of her plans are destroyed when the highwayman steals a kiss from her and then rides away with her into the night.<br />When she discovers that her abductor is the Duke of St Raven, she is no less furious. But Tris offers to help her regain the statuette. The only problem for Cressida is that she will need to accompany him in order to identify exactly which statuette it is that she needs. And so she has to dress as a houri and attend an orgy.<br />This is just the beginning of a chase around different parts of the country, at different times, in search of the statuette, and of course the beginning of Tris and Cressida's relationship. It's an exciting, and at times passionate, story, which also - unlike books by other authors set in the same era - faces head-on the realities of life within polite society. Being a duke involves sometimes onerous responsibility. It means not being able to behave exactly as one wishes in every matter. Being a young lady, especially one of not particularly goodfamily, means that one cannot put so much as a little finger wrong, otherwise one is ruined. And never can the duke and the unfashionable gentlewoman meet on anything even approaching equal terms. <br />I didn't enjoy this book quite so much as Hazard, and I think part of that was the fact that Hazard focused solely on Anne and Race's relationship, while in St Raven there is the plot of the statuette and the sub-plot of the highwayman Le Corbeau. For me, these distracted from what I really wanted to read about, although I accept that Cressida and Tris could never have met except under this sort of circumstance. They didn't move in the same milieu. Cressida is the daughter of a nabob, a gentleman who made his fortune in trade in India and, although now knighted, is certainly not of haut ton. The family normally lives in provincial, unfashionable isolation in Matlock, Derbyshire. <br />And this is largely the conflict in the story: how can Cressida and Tris be together when he is so far above her in status? How could she cope with being a duchess when she hasn't been raised to it? It was interesting to see the other side of the coin immediately after Hazard, in which a duke's daughter finds a way to be allowed to marry a social nobody. I was pleased to see that the example of the Marquess of Arden, who married a governess (Beverley's An Unwilling Bride) was cited, although it appears that Beth Arden has had some problems being accepted into Society - going to tell us more at some point, Beverley?<br />It felt to me as if Tris fell in love with Cressida very quickly - too quickly, almost. Admittedly, the main conflict of the book related to their disparity in social standing, but I didn't really feel that I'd seen them fall in love - not in the way I saw Anne and Race or Lucien and Beth fall in love. This is probably the main reason why St Raven gets four stars rather than five.<br />I was also hoping for further glimpses of Anne and Race in this book; it seems as if they may well face problems of acceptance, and I wanted to know that their married life has begun well and that they have plenty of friends who will champion them - Tris being one, but the Rogues in addition. However, Anne and Race were only ever mentioned in passing. I would love to see the two couples meet!<br />Finally, who is Caradoc Lyne? He's clearly a friend of Tris's, and possibly someone who travelled on the Continent with him. He appears to be employed by Tris in some capacity, or at least dependent on him; Tris gives him things to do and asks him to find things out. His role in Tris's life is never explained. Will we see him again? The hero of a future novel, perhaps? This dedicated Jo Beverley reader is waiting with her fingers crossed!	2003-06-04
1141064:US	52631742	R3SZ4E3ZTYEIRJ	0060002050	10081740	On a Wicked Dawn (Cynster Novels)	Books	1	25	41	N	N	Yawn, yawn and yawn again	I didn't think the Cynster series could hit a lower nadir than Scandal's Bride, but On A Wicked Dawn does it. The book is stretched to at least twice its natural length, and staying awake while reading it was a real chore. As a 60-page novella, it might have been worth reading, but as a 400+-page novel, it is a waste of good trees and ink. Ms Laurens should have taken the advice of other Amazon reviewers and stopped writing this series once the original six books were published.<br />Amelia Cynster, unlike her sister Amanda, had decided to continue looking for her future husband within the ranks of those men attending Society events. It was already obvious from On A Wild Night who her choice would be: Lucien Ashford, Viscount Calverton - so old and so close a friend of the Cynster family that we didn't know he existed until On A Wild Night. So much an old friend of Amelia's that we don't even get any sense that they've known each other for years, either. <br />Amelia, obviously not at all stricken with shyness or reticence when it comes to approaching men, lies in wait for Luc outside his home one night. When he finally rolls home drunk in the early hours, she strikes. (And again, how was it that her family had no idea that she was out? Would the faithful footman really not tell anyone where she'd been? Would no-one notice that a servant was absent?). Amelia tells Luc that she knows he's in financial difficulty and that her dowry could rescue him. And she proposes.<br />No dragging out of the will-they-won't-they here: Luc accepts immediately, but says that he wants a proper courtship. We know that Luc loves Amelia, but had never imagined that she might be within his reach. (Why the heck not? He's easily high in status enough for the granddaughter and cousin of dukes). Amelia loves Luc, but never thought he'd looked at her - again, why not? She'd spent a lot of time with him in On A Wild Night. <br />The rest of the book is a long, slow progress towards marriage (achieved by halfway through), and then yawn-inducing, mundane post-marriage scenes, including the inevitable, and by now extremely tedious, lengthy sex scenes. By now I not only skim them; I skip them. There is nothing worth reading in these twelve-page excerpts from porn novels. We're supposed to be able to tell from these scenes that Luc and Amelia love each other, but all we see is graphic, acrobatic sex involving a variety of different positions, as if Laurens wants to impress us with her knowledge of the Kama Sutra.<br />The `reason' why the book is stretched out so long after the wedding has to do with the `need' for Luc and Amelia to tell each other that they love the other, and for Luc to tell Amelia the truth about his fortune. (The highly ironic thing here is that it is the Duke of St Ives who lectures Luc about the need to confess his love to Amelia, while St Ives himself has never told his wife the same thing). The `control' thing as an explanation for why neither was willing to say the L word was really not at all convincing. Both characters came across as idiots unable to see what was under their noses. <br />As for the characters, of course Luc is not a Cynster, but we'd never know it. Just like all the Cysnter males, he won't show that he's vulnerable. Just like all the Cynster males, he won't tell his chosen woman that he loves her. Just like all the Cynster males, he throws his weight around and becomes overweening in his protectiveness. And Amelia... Little Miss Perfect! As soon as she marries, she becomes the perfect matriarch and wife, knowing just what to do and what to say in every situation. Hardly realistic, when she's just taking over the reins of running a household! And she's far better than Luc's mother at advising his sisters, which she does at every possible moment - and yet there is not even the tiniest bit of resentment or jealousy from Luc's mother. Suuure!!!<br />Yes, as ever, there is a mystery plot: someone is stealing valuables from the ton. I guessed who the thief was as soon as the plot was introduced; there is an early scene with the thief talking with Kirby, who is apparently some contact of Edward Ashford's (banished in the previous book). The identity of the female thief was immediately apparent, and so the delay in unmasking her was pointless. That scene, in any event, was about as incredible as much of the rest of the book.<br />None of the Cynster books `fit' properly into the Regency period; the ever-present pre-marital sex alone indicates that, as well as the lack of adequate chaperonage for the heroines and their completely unlikely behaviour. This book is no exception and is in some ways even worse: an unmarried young lady able to sneak around and sleep with her suitor at a house party? Where was her mother? Other Society matrons? Her maid, come to that? <br />I gather that there is now another book in the series, but I have no intention of buying it and no desire at all to read it. In fact, I'll be getting rid of the nine Cynster books I bought, in some moment of madness when I thought that they might actually be worth reading, just as soon as I can... I believe there's a charity shop collection due soon! <br />This book is one to avoid!<br />wmr-uk	2003-04-29

She doesnt want to get married, because her own experience of marriage is disastrous: her parents separated when she was four and neither has seen the other since then. Talking to some friends, a scheme is borne: if Sophia pretends that she wants to marry someone her parents will find ineligible, but is of perfectly good ton, then maybe they will have to join forces to talk her out of it.<br />Step forward Lord Francis Sutton, youngest son of a duke - a duke who happens to be the Earl of Cliftons (Sophias father) oldest friend. Sophia and Francis have known each other since they were very young children - and unlike characters in another authors books Ive been reading recently, these two really do sound as if theyve known each other all their lives. Francis and Sophia have quarrelled all their lives, too, and even in agreeing to pretend to be madly in love they fight. Its already apparent that this pretend engagement is going to be a lot of fun - and that Sophia and Francis are actually not as indifferent to each other as they pretend.<br />And now we meet the principal characters of this book: Sophias parents, Olivia and Marcus. Although theyre the parents of a debutante, they are actually relatively young still: Marc is 40 to Livys 36. But they havent seen one another for 14 years. Olivia rejected Marc after a stupid mistake of his: drunk, he slept with a prostitute because his friends were egging him on, and he compounded his error by telling Olivia. At her young age at the time - just 21 - shed put him on a pedestal and couldnt cope with discovering that he was human. She didnt know how to rebuild their marriage at the time, so she told him that she couldnt forgive him.<br />So how do Marc and Livy cope, meeting each other after all this time? Has time healed the wounds? Are they now two strangers? Or can they be indifferent to each other, behaving like polite acquaintances? Or is it possible that they are each still in love with the other?<br />We get two love stories for the price of one in A Counterfeit Betrothal. Frances and Sophias is fun all the way; extremely humorous, and its entirely obvious that the two of them have bitten off far more than they can chew in pretending to their families that they are madly in love and cant wait to be married. But... is it really all a pretence? Is it possible for two people to be quite so convincing? And will they actually be able to extricate themselves before they really find themselves in front of a vicar? But then, as Francis keeps telling Sophia, theyre both headed for Bedlam anyway.<br />And then, in stark contrast, Marc and Livys story is utterly poignant. Their separation left each of them bitter, Marc because hed pleaded with Livy for six months to forgive him, and Livy because of Marcs betrayal. Seeing each other again is unbelievably painful for both. Being together, pretending to be the happily married couple for friends and relations - and especially in front of Sophia, so that they dont spoil her engagement and wedding plans - takes its toll on both. Is it too late for them? Once the wedding - what wedding? - is over, will Olivia just go back home and never see Marc again?<br />It takes a very good, very believable, angsty romance to make me cry. This one did. It takes something special in a book to make me think and obsess about the characters when Im not reading it - I do have to work sometimes! - but this one did. Unfortunately, like just about all of Baloghs early Regencies, its out of print. But if you can get hold of it second-hand, grab it. You wont want to let it go.<br />Just perfect!<br />wmr-uk	2003-04-27

Newly widowed, Felicity, Lady Wren finally gets the chance to have a London Season for herself. She was married at the age of 18 to a man in his late fifties, because her family was practically bankrupt and they needed the marriage settlement to save them. At the time, she'd been in love with her childhood friend, Tom Russell, and both of them had been devastated that Felicity had to marry someone else.<br />However, time passes and heals many wounds, and now that Felicity is free again at the age of 26 she's matured and she feels that Tom would have been the wrong man for her. He's a country farmer, after all, and she likes Society life. She wants a man who is not only charming, handsome and close to her own age - all of which Tom is - but who is also wealthy, titled and who enjoys Society life. <br />In London, she meets Lord Edmond Waite, a handsome sophisticate who is obviously attracted to her; unfortunately, she discovers very quickly that he wants her as his mistress, which is something she's definitely not interested in. So how to make him come around to the idea of marriage?<br />Simple - make him jealous.<br />And how better to do that than to enlist the help of her oldest friend, who most conveniently has followed her to London and is squiring her and her younger twin sisters about?<br />So Tom agrees to pretend to be a devoted suitor, and of course they have to be very convincing in order to make Lord Edmond believe that he really has competition. The only problem for Felicity is: is she risking awakening old feelings by getting so close to Tom again? Is she absolutely sure that what she once felt for him is dead?<br />This is another Balogh classic, which I was delighted to find. As usual, she creates some very believable and entertaining characters - in particular, I loved the secondary characters of twins Lucy and Laura, and their suitors. And as usual, Balogh doesn't write a one-dimensional villain; I'm looking forward to seeing his story in the third book of the trilogy to which this belongs! <br />Admittedly, at first I thought that Felicity was rather shallow, with her desire for a life of froth and pleasure and her wish to marry a titled, wealthy man (who cares about love?). But then I realised that her nature at that point - or at least what she believes to be her preferences - were very much influenced by her sudden freedom from a marriage to a man much older than she was. It's a classic case of someone thinking that they know what they want, only to discover, when they have it, that it wasn't what they wanted after all.<br />If I had one criticism of The Trysting Place, it's that Tom is just a little bit too perfect. He agrees to everything Felicity asks of him, including pretending to be engaged to her; he's always there when she needs him; and, even though he's deeply in love with her and the thought of seeing her married to another man almost kills him inside, he's still unselfish enough to help her get what she thinks she wants. Once or twice I wanted to scream at him to develop some backbone... but then he is a pretty unselfish character.<br />As this is an early Balogh, there's a minor niggle in the shape of titles used incorrectly: for instance, Lord Waite is not the same title (and therefore person) as Lord Edmond Waite, and likewise Lady Dorothea Page may not also be addressed as Lady Page. However, Balogh doesn't make these errors in later books. <br />All in all, definitely a keeper and one of my favourites of the early Baloghs.	2003-04-25

So she decides to go on her own husband-hunt, choosing the sort of location where men go to get away from husband-hunting women. <br />Thus it is that she ends up in a gambling den, challenged to a game of whist by a notorious gamester. A mysterious stranger steps from the shadows and offers to partner her and together they win. It's only afterwards that she discovers his identity: Martin Fulbridge, Earl of Dexter, who has been away from Society for ten years due to a scandal in which he might have seduced an innocent girl and murdered her father.<br />Of course, he didn't do it, as we're assured as soon as we meet Dexter, and of course if he wants to aspire to Amanda's hand he needs to prove it - so thus we have Laurens' usual dramatic plot. And once again this plot feels as if it was buttoned onto the story as an afterthought because she ran out of things to write about - other than occasional references to `the scandal' and Dexter's need to clear his name, there is no mention of it for a couple of hundred pages, and the resolution is all dealt with in a great hurry.<br />Why only one star? Well, to begin with I find it impossible to believe that this book is set in Regency England. I could just about believe it of Georgian England, but not the 1820s. Where was Amanda's chaperon? Regardless of how long she'd been `out', she couldn't get away with running around gambling dens, orgies, meeting men at five o'clock in the morning and even going to what appeared to be brothels unnoticed. And, by the way, if she had been `out' for that long, I couldn't see her or her sister still being sought after other than for their dowries: they'd be considered on the shelf by their age, 23.<br />Second, I had thought that this book might be somewhat different from others in the series, in that the Cynster character is female; perhaps a hero not of that family might be an interesting character, for a change. But no; Dexter is depressingly Cynsterish in his traits: uninterested in marrying until he meets Amanda, whereupon he immediately wants her; he pretends he's not pursuing her, but his manner is oppressively protective; he proposes marriage - which she refuses - and insists that she will be his wife, and then conspires to ensure that she has to accept him by enlisting the help of her family. Yes, I've been here before. Yawn.<br />Annoying errors riddle the book. First, Dexter introduces himself to Amanda in the gambling den as `Martin'. Of course he wouldn't; he'd have introduced himself as `Dexter'. Second, at one stage he is introduced at a party as `Lord Martin Fulbridge, the Earl of Dexter'. Incorrect; he is Lord (or the Earl of) Dexter. His first name is Martin and his family name Fulbridge, and so if he wanted to be relatively incognito he could introduce himself as Martin Fulbridge, but never `Lord Martin'. <br />And what's with all those irritating sentence fragments and verbless sentences? This is a habit of Laurens' in her [romantic] scenes (of which, again, there are too many to be convincing for the period, and they are too long to be interesting), but in this book they seemed even more noticeable than usual. I note that she's finally using `disinterested' correctly, but she's now using `evocative' incorrectly. Apparently, Dexter's kisses and caresses are `evocative' - of what, Ms Laurens? The word isn't an adjective akin to `sensual' or `arousing'!<br />I have Amelia's story already, though I don't expect much from it; I can't see me buying anything else by Laurens after that.	2003-04-21

Mary has fallen from grace and has been banished to Italy until she's fit to be seen again. The only problem is that no-one will agree to take the visitors to the Villa of the Three Fountains.<br />It is the mid-1800s, and Italy is divided, parts of the country under Austrian rule. And part of the problem is that the locals in Modena don't know whether Cordelia and her companions are in league with the Austrians; of course, that's not helped when a couple of Austrian army officers offer to escort the women to the villa. When they arrive, they find that the villa is occupied - by the Count of Albion, an Italian nobleman who claims that his father and grandfather owned it before him.<br />The Count reluctantly agrees to let the women stay, but Cordelia realises very soon that there's something extremely odd about him. They have a strange mental connection which very soon has her visualising herself in bed with him, making love with him... and allowing him to bite her throat. And she's not even afraid of the idea of it!<br />The Count, for his part, is desperately fighting his attraction to Cordelia; the last time he slept with a woman, he killed her, and he doesn't want that to happen to Cordelia. Unfortunately, she's come to him during his `in heat' period, when he desperately needs to mate and to procreate. Can he keep himself away from her?<br />In the background to this novel is the struggle for independence against Austrian rule, and the Count is deeply involved here, though not in the way he may initially appear. This is an interesting and intelligent aspect of the story, which makes it even more disappointing that it simply vanishes as the story concludes. Cresswell also omits to provide any sort of closure for Cordelia's cousin Mary; she simply disappears from the narrative after a while. This sloppiness prevents this book getting a higher rating. Incidentally, I also agree with another reviewer about the idiotic character names.<br />Cresswell's vampire mythology is rather different from that of any other writer I've come across, and I'm not entirely sure that I like it. Her vampires, as we discover at the beginning of the book, are actually aliens from another planet. They don't appear to need to avoid the daylight. And, most strange of all, they can reproduce, as long as the woman they mate with survives the encounter. <br />Anyway, this is a readable book, but not a keeper for me.	2003-04-07

Now that the Bar Cynster members are all married off, Laurens turns her attention to other characters in their environs, and her first - and very welcome - choice is Chillingworth. Of course, this development was trailed very clearly when, at the end of All About Love, the Duke of St Ives declares Chillingworth to be an honorary Cynster. He's determined not to go the same way as his friends, however, when it comes to matters of the heart.<br />So, yes, it's another hero who is determined not to fall in love. But Chillingworth seems to mean it; he has decided to contract an arranged marriage with a suitable female, and preferably the sort who will be indistinguishable from the wallpaper in his various homes. If she happens to come with strategically-important land, such as the segment which was cut out of his own lands some years ago, so much the better. Such as his distant cousin, Francesca Rawlins.<br />Francesca, he believes, is quiet and dull; the kind of woman he can marry, bed and then leave safely buried in the country while he carries on with his normal lifestyle. What Chillingworth doesn't know is that the young woman he saw wasn't Francesca but her cousin Frannie (why Laurens felt the need to give the two women such similar names is beyond me. It certainly wasn't necessary for the plot).<br />Anyway, Chillingworth and Francesca marry, and are very attracted to each other - this is not the kind of marriage Chillingworth was looking for, however! He's determined not to fall in love, and so his behaviour towards Francesca is very odd; he keeps sending her mixed signals. He's warm and passionate in bed, and yet very distant elsewhere. She, on the other hand, is finding her new husband more and more irrestible. But if he doesn't want her, is there any hope of happiness?<br />My sneaking liking for Chillingworth in the earlier books was confirmed in All AboutPassion, and I also liked Francesca very much. This is quite a bit better than a number of the other books in the Cynster series, largely because it's *not* a carbon copy of the other books. It's still similar, but at least this time I didn't feel as if I was reading exactly the same book yet again. This could have been a very enjoyable and interesting study of an arranged marriage which turned out to be something other than what Chillingworth had intended. But, as usual, Laurens had to bolt a dramatic plot onto it, in this case murder attempts. The villain, as ever, was predictable, and in this case it was a particularly offensive use of stereotypes. I wish this book had been purely about the relationship; if it had been, I would have rated it more highly.	2003-04-05

They first meet when she almost kills him, which I suppose is one way of leaving a lasting impression.<br />There is a murder plot: the old friend whom Rupert - Lucifer, as were supposed to call him - has come to visit has just been killed. And Lucifer knows that Phyllida knows something about the murder, just as he later discovers that her life is in danger - which gives him a very good reason to insist on protecting her. And, being a Cynster, he does a lot more than just protect her. Which begins to sound somewhat familiar...<br />Heres the formula for any Cynster book: Alpha-male hero, dead set against marriage, does his best to escape the plotters among the rest of his family. And then, when he least expects it, he runs into an unusual woman, very different from the run-of-the-mill female in that shes independent and confident, and immediately he falls in love and wants to marry her. Said female, on the other hand, does not want to marry him - for various, usually not very convincing reasons. Cynster male then exerts multiple powers of persuasion, some not exactly fair, but the one thing he refuses to do is to *tell* her exactly why he wants to marry her. So if shes holding out for a declaration of love, shes unlikely to get one, and this is what carries the story, which could really have been over within 150 pages, on to close to 400 pages.<br />Oh, and theres always some sort of mystery/murder/crime plot, which generally gets far too much time and attention devoted to it, and which is usually pretty much paper-thin.<br />But clearly the formula works, since Laurens seems to be selling millions of the books in this series. This ones okay, although the murder plot dominates rather too much and at least some of the links werefar too obvious from the beginning. If Id read it as a stand-alone novel, since I did quite like Phyllida and Lucifer Id probably have given it a three or four; however, it really feels as if Im just reading the same book over and over again. <br />Chillingworths up next in the series; with any luck, as hes not actually a Cynster, Laurens might not follow the formula for once.	2003-03-25

Now, I *like* independent-minded women, but somehow whenever Laurens writes them, the heroine seems to lose all of her independence and common sense whenever the hero comes into view. Falling in love's one thing, but this is ridiculous!<br />Okay, so we have, this time, Rupert Cynster, yet another cousin, and this one goes by the nickname Gabriel. Gabriel's big interest is money: investments of the stocks and shares variety. So when he is approached by a woman dressed in black and fully veiled, who introduces herself to him only as The Countess, recently widowed, it's not only his sense of chivalry which is piqued by her request to him to help her family from becoming destitute as the result of a scam.<br />Under the Countess's disguise is Lady Alathea Morwellan, who is neither a widow nor a countess; she is the daughter of the earl who made the unwise investment. Apparently, she has known Gabriel from childhood, but she chose not to approach him as herself for two reasons. First, she was embarrassed at the thought of revealing the full extent of her family's misfortune to him, and second, she wasn't convinced that he would help if he knew it was her.<br />This is one aspect of the story which was poorly done. Alathea, Gabriel and his brother Alasdair grew up together, but yet we only discover this a few chapters in; it almost felt as if Laurens had decided to add this element as an afterthought. Gabriel and Alathea's awkwardness around each other felt similarly unconvincing. I can understand buried attraction making them prickly, but this wasn't two people secretly attracted to each other striking sparks whenever they met. This was two people who seemed genuinely to hate each other. And I can't believe that Gabriel, highly experienced lover, doesn't recognise sexual attraction when he encounters it. He's over thirty, for heaven's sake, and he doesn't realise that's why he and Alathea are prickly around each other? Nope, that didn't work for me.<br />Anyway, Gabriel begins to find out information for the Countess, but insists on claiming a reward for every discovery: a kiss. And so it's not long before things go far beyond kissing. Again, two things strike me as extremely unbelievable here. First, why would Alathea let things go that far? I can't buy the 'carried away by passion' explanation - not even the first time, let alone on subsequent occasions. It didn't make sense for the character as established. And second, yet again, how is it that Laurens' female characters never seem to suffer the consequences of their actions? No precautions are taken, and yet Alathea is supremely blithe in her conviction that nothing will happen.<br />Another difficulty for me was caused by Laurens' apparent lack of understanding of what 'step-siblings' are; Alathea keeps referring to her step-sisters and brothers, so I assumed - since the Earl was her father - that these were all the children of her stepmother's previous marriage. But no; her 'step-brother' was apparently the Earl's heir. In other words, they were her *half*-siblings. Talk about unnecessary confusion! And why on earth didn't her editor spot this?<br />Oh, and the discovery of Alathea's identity, when it happened, was just so predictable - Laurens, couldn't you at least have *tried* to make it less obvious to the reader? I felt that I was being bashed over the head with what was about to happen; it was as obvious as those seventies detective series where ominous music plays as the camera pans on a particular scene or item. The discovery would actually have been enjoyable had it come as a surprise, but as it was I was just counting pages until it happened.<br />There is, as ever, a dramatic plot to the story; it holds the attention for a while but, like most of Laurens' mystery/detective plots, it does tend to take over and get tedious. It's a good means of getting the protagonists to work together, but it did mean that I was flicking quickly through several pages from time to time.<br />I'm marking time through the rest of the series now, since I already have the books, but have already decided not to bother buying the newest Cynster release. After book after book of repetitive plots, I want some better-written, more varied reading!	2003-03-19

Elizabeth Rossiter is a governess working in a small town in the south, well away from London and polite society. And that's the way she likes it. Nothing unexpected ever happens; she takes care of her charges, who will soon be launched into Society, and her employers treat her as a member of the family. She's safe.<br />Even when the new owner of the local big house, Ferndale, arrives to view his property, Elizabeth has no notion that her life is about to be completely disrupted. And why should it? William Mainwaring, the new owner, is perfectly polite and amiable, if a little shy in company. Interestingly, he seems to show a partiality for Elizabeth, despite her position as governess.<br />But Mainwaring has company on his visit to Ferndale, and one of his guests happens to be Robert Denning, Marquess of Hetherington - a man whom Elizabeth had hoped never to see again. And she'd been successful for more than six years. Until now; until he'd appeared without warning in the place where she'd found sanctuary. And then he seems to be around everywhere Elizabeth goes, giving her disapproving looks, making pointed remarks about mercenary behaviour and even, at one point, warning her off Mainwaring in such terms as make it clear that Hetherington believes that she's only after Mainwaring's money. And, even more insulting, Hetherington even tells Elizabeth that if she needs money she only need apply to him and he will supply it - the implication being that he would be relieved to be able to pay her off. <br />What was Hetherington and Elizabeth's past relationship? Why does he hate her so much? Why are her feelings for him so clearly torn between hatred and a deep, deep longing? What about Mainwaring's interest in Elizabeth?<br />Balogh's talent as a storyteller, always obvious, is even more clear in A Chance Encounter. She keeps readers guessing about Elizabeth's past and what Hetherington has to do with it, and when the truth was revealed some way into the book I was stunned. Nothing I had read so far had led me even to suspect the revelation, and yet when I re-read the earlier portion of the book nothing argued against it either. It was a masterful piece of writing. <br />Balogh is also an expert at writing stories which pull on the readers' emotions, and this book is a classic example. It's angsty, it has moments of humour, it's suspenseful and it's heartwrenching. I couldn't put it down from the moment I started it. <br />Unfortunately, like most of Balogh's early Regencies, it's out of print; until her publisher sees sense and starts to re-release her earlier work, the only way you can get hold of it is to pay an inflated price to get it second-hand. And yet it's worth it! Oh, and if you do get a used copy, it won't be mine - that's staying right where it is!	2003-03-16

So he retreats to Graystone, in the north of England, intending to try to forget Elizabeth and avoid polite society. However, he reckons without the inhabitants of the local town, who are determined to include him in their activities; after all, while he may not have a title, he is certainly one of the wealthiest single gentlemen around at the moment, which makes him extremely eligible and desirable.<br />Lady Helen Wade, youngest daughter of the Earl of Claymore, hates the sort of `proper' behaviour required of a young lady of the ton, and she avoids any kind of interaction with Society as much as she can, simply by slipping out and running to her favourite place, in the woods by a stream on Graystone land. Although she's almost twenty, she does her best to pretend that she won't have to secure a suitable marriage some day; in fact, it's clear that Helen hasn't really grown up yet.<br />One day, William Mainwaring comes upon a young woman sitting by the river on his land, `learning water', as she tells him. She's wearing a faded dress which is unfashionable and far too short for her; unsurprisingly, he takes her for a village girl. Helen, realising his mistake and the impropriety of her presence in his land and in his company, allows him to carry on believing that she's a simple country girl, and tells him that her name is Nell. <br />`Nell' and William become friends, actually seeking each other out as escape from their mundane and unwelcome daily lives; they discuss poetry and landscapes and nature, and find themselves becoming drawn to each other. Attracted to each other. Until the inevitable happens...<br />William thinks that Nell is a village girl. So it never occurs to him that, since he realises he needs to marry and he's actually considering one of her sisters as a potential wife, that he could marry Nell instead. And anyway, he's not in love with her, is he? He still loves Elizabeth! Nell knows that she needs to tell William the truth; after all, she's spent time with him under false pretences. But good intentions go their usual way, and very soon it's too late. William has left, and Nell is... well, Nell has to grow up very quickly in a very short space of time.<br />This represents the early part of The Wood Nymph; the remainder of the book is set mostly in London, and readers will need to read it for themselves to find out what happens. All I can say is that this book satisfies my desire for closure for William Mainwaring completely. A wonderful book, and well worth the `collectible' price I paid for it.	2003-03-16

I didn't find the story remotely funny and, in fact, I found that the way the heroine was portrayed was tantamount to mocking the afflicted.

Richard Cynster, half-brother of the Duke of St Ives (who goes by the improbable soubriquet of Scandal, but with a brother called Devil what can you expect?!) travels to Scotland to the reading of the will of his mother's husband Seamus McEnery - complicated family relationships here, to be explained later. There, he meets and is instantly attracted to Catriona Hennessy, his late stepfather's ward. Catriona is undoubtedly a lady, so he can't seduce her; and since he has no wish to marry, it seems that the relationship will go nowhere.<br />Then the will is read... and McEnery's offspring will only inherit if Richard Cynster agrees to marry Catriona Hennessy. Note the wording: if he agrees to marry her. Nothing says that she has to marry him. Nothing says that a wedding has to take place. In other words, there's a simple way out of this situation: all Cynster and Catriona have to do is pretend. He can say that he'll marry her, and the lawyers are satisfied. Then the two of them can ride away and never see each other again.<br />And so, of course, the two of them get married. Less than a third of the way through the book, in fact. And bang goes any sense of tension, suspense or indeed, any point in reading any further.<br />What I didn't like about this book:<br />The plot is *identical* to the three Cynster books I've read already, starting with The Promise in a Kiss. Male Cynster meets woman, decides he wants to marry her; she refuses him; he makes her change her mind; she marries him; boring post-marriage incidents, including the introduction of an A-plot. And, of course, lots and lots of lengthy sex scenes. Sensuality is all well and good, true, but in its place and not over-done. I wasn't aware that it was possible to have an eleven-page sex scene outside a porn novel, but Laurens achieves it time after time. I really don't want to read the same book over and over again!<br />The weird `Lady of the Vale' witch/wicca nonsense. I want to read a romance novel, not abook about some weird-in-the-head woman who believes that her entire life is governed by some `Lady' who speaks to her in her dreams. Keep psychic nonsense out of romance novels, please!! And I couldn't believe that Cynster actually took her seriously!<br />The story of Richard Cynster's place in the family, which is explained to us early in the book. This has bugged me ever since I read The Promise in a Kiss. There is *no way* that Helena, the duchess, would have taken in her husband's bastard and brought her up as her own son. There is no way that the Helena of Promise in a Kiss would have tolerated Sebastian's infidelity. I also can't believe that a bastard would have been accepted in society to the extent that Richard is.<br />And doesn't Laurens know anything about inheritance and paternity law?? Richard Cynster's mother was married to McEnery. This means that IN LAW Seamus was Richard's father. IN LAW Richard is McEnery's eldest son and therefore inherits everything unless the will makes special provision for unentailed property.<br />Oh, and in which dictionary may I find `witchy' as an adjective? The word does not exist!!<br />The title's rather derivative, as well - the second in the series (if we count Promise in a Kiss as the first) was called Devil's Bride. But this book does have a lovely cover design. Shame about the content!	2003-03-14

Books	5	9	19	N	N	Refreshing and direct: Mooreï¿½s polemic hits the spot	This book has hit the best-seller slot in several countries, and has also just won the non-fiction Book of the Year prize in the UK. I can see why. Its not that anything Moore says is especially new or challenging - at least, not to a UK reader. Over here, many of the things he discusses, and in particular the sad state of electoral practice in Florida, has been very widely reported.<br />What is really refreshing about Stupid White Men is that it emerges from the US, where much of this sort of dissenting view is stifled: by the media, by politicians, by conservative thinkers. In a land which prides itself on its Bill of Rights which, among other things, guarantees freedom of expression to its citizens, critics of government policy are being silenced. Academic critics of American foreign policy, for example, are witch-hunted and hounded out of their jobs.<br />In such an environment, it is amazing that Moores book got published, and indeed in his foreword he explains the way in which his US publisher attempted to censor, and then bury, his book. Interestingly, once it shot to the top of the best-seller list, they were happy enough to print additional copies; it just shows that the almighty dollar is supreme, after all.<br />Of course, much of what he says can be applied to many Western democracies, which means that at times its hard-hitting. But its good to reflect and be critical of the world around us, and to look for ways in which we can change that world. Moores book should be compulsory reading for anyone whos not happy about the state of the world today and wants to know why. Buy it!	2003-03-08

Book 4 in the Cynster series - or Book 5 if, like me, you count The Promise in a Kiss as Book 1 - features Vane's younger brother Harry, known as Demon. After seeing three of his fellow Bar Cynster members happily chained in marriage, Harry knows that he'll be next if the women in his family have anything to do with it. So he decamps to his stud at Newmarket, a place where he's very sure he won't encounter any marriageable women.<br />A new jockey at his stables catches his attention - the jockey's bottom, in particular. It's not a man's rear. And he's right: the jockey is actually Felicity Parteger, the ward of his nearest neighbour. She's investigating a race-fixing scandal - the obligatory Laurens A-plot and this time, thankfully, one which doesn't take over the story. The last time Harry - Demon (I really think these nicknames are silly!) - saw Felicity, she was in pigtails and still obviously a teenager. Now, she's 20 to his 31, and she's beautiful. Not only is she beautiful, but he's attracted to her.<br />To my relief, this story proceeds a little differently to the four earlier books. Harry actually *fights* his attraction to Felicity - Flick, as he calls her - and he doesn't propose until almost half-way through the book. Very sensibly, Flick turns him down. She's been in love with Harry all her life, but she knows that he doesn't love her. He proposes for reasons to do with propriety and also, as she knows, because he finds her attractive. But she will only marry for love.<br />How their courtship develops, against the backdrop of the A-plot and, eventually, the London season and the rest of Harry's family, is generally well-told. This time, Laurens develops the romance steadily and well, instead of marrying her characters off in the first half of the book and thus taking away any romantic suspense. This is *definitely* an improvement on the earlier books, and I really felt as if I was reading a love story.<br />I also liked Flick a lot. She's an independent young woman with a mind of her own, and she's determined not to be pushed around by Demon. She has a sense of humour and intelligence coupled with innocence, but she won't let Demon use his greater experience and age to get the better of her. One of Laurens' better heroines so far.<br />But there's still the unanswered question of how Laurens' heroines manage to escape pregnancy while they're blithely and happily having sex with their men before marriage. <br />Laurens' choice of nickname for her hero here led to a lot of distracting repetitions, too: \\"Demon leashed his demons...\\" and similar phrases occur throughout. And she *really* needs to look up `disinterest' in a dictionary. It does *not* mean `lack of interest'; it refers to a state of non-involvement or objectivity.	2003-03-03

She's said all I would have said, and more. <br />The virgin hero - Ralph, here - doesn't bother me in the slightest; it's not the first Balogh I've read where that was the case. Gerald in A Precious Jewel was also a virgin, though there Prissy was the one with the experience. I did find both Georgiana and Ralph rather immature at the start of the book, but then that's to be expected: he was barely 21 and she was 18. They did mature very nicely, and Ralph in particular turned out to be a hero I liked very much.<br />Georgiana's solution to the problem of their marriage was ingenious, and not one I was expecting at all. Nicely done! <br />The second secondary romance, between Roger and Vera, was lovely - so much so that I wanted *more*. Really, this should have been a book on its own; I wanted to know what had happened to make Vera so cynical about men and so unwilling to believe that Roger might be interested in her. And why did Roger, considered a rake by his contemporaries, have such moral standards when it came to affairs? They were fascinating characters, and their story should have been a sequel to this one. <br />Very enjoyable; not quite a 5-star, but definitely a keeper!	2003-03-03

Vane Cynster, Devil's cousin and closest friend, has his turn at meeting his match in this book. An enforced stay at his godmother's house brings him into contact with her niece, Patience Debbington, and a mystery: who is the magpie thief stealing all and sundry, and who is the Spectre who appears at night, in shadow, and appears to haunt the place? The primary suspect is Patience's young brother Gerrard, but Vane doesn't believe that for an instant. His godmother begs him to stay and sort it out, and as he is already very intrigued by Patience he agrees.<br />Patience is alarmed by Vane and does her best to avoid him; she's also worried about the effect he's having on Gerrard. ... <br />The plot of this book follows exactly the same direction as Devil's Bride. Vane - determined not to marry - encounters a woman and knows that he's met his fate. He wants to marry her. He proposes; she refuses him. He determines to persuade her through sensuality and at the same time find out why she won't marry him. And in the background there is a (not very interesting and pretty transparent) mystery plot - again, I'd worked out who was behind it pretty early on; ... Maybe Laurens wanted him to be seen as an idiot?<br />I found Vane's approach to Patience unconvincing; in one scene - when he'd just met her - he was aware that she had the power to attract him in a way no woman had before. And he was determined to resist that: he didn't *want* to marry. And yet barely a half-dozen pages later, with nothing having happened in the meantime, he was suddenly reconciled to his fate and determined to marry her. ... <br />And Patience's antipathy to Vane in the beginning was simply not explained until some way in the book. I can accept her stereotyping him as a certain type of man - and not being told what she meant by an `elegant gentleman' until almost halfway through the book did not help! - but we need to know *what* stereotype she's using, and why it bothers her. That took some time toconvey.<br />Again, a lot of detailed sex scenes, which is fine if you like that kind of thing; they're too numerous and technical - as well as lengthy - for my preference. I prefer my lovemaking scenes to focus on the emotions rather than descriptions of sex organs. Of course the extent and locations of Vane and Patience's amorous encounters are all wrong for the period, and I'm not sure why Laurens seems to assume that engaged, or near-engaged, couples of the - quite Puritanic, remember! - Regency period would naturally have sex. This has come across in three of her books now; her heroes seem to make an automatic assumption that an engagement means free sex. ... <br />I do have the rest of the Cynster series and will keep reading - Laurens has a readable style, even if I do skim some scenes - but I do hope that she varies her plots for later books.	2003-02-16

Her horse bolts and she's left alone with no way of helping the man... until a tall, dark and handsome stranger arrives. He takes her and the injured man to a cottage, whereupon Honoria discovers that her rescuer is the injured man's cousin, and he introduces himself as Devil.<br />The following morning, the shooting victim dead, Honoria finds out that `Devil' is actually Sylvester, the Duke of St Ives. And he discovers that her name is really Anstruther-Wetherby; she's of very good family indeed. Given that he's already attracted to her, the fact that he's compromised her is, from his point of view, very convenient. <br />But Honoria has other plans. She has no intention of marrying anyone, and especially not an arrogant duke who simply announces his plans for her. And she wants to travel to Africa and explore the continent; a husband doesn't figure in her plans at all. So they seem to be at an impasse... except that Honoria can't seem to help getting sucked into the duke's family, especially given their grief at young Tolly's death. Her skills with young girls come in very useful indeed.<br />And when everyone in the family, let alone Society in general, assumes that Honoria will marry Devil, how can she fight that? When his kisses heat her blood and make her want more, she realises how attracted to him she is too. So what of her own plans? Can she become Devil's Bride?<br />This is an enjoyable romp in most respects; however, there are a number of irritating elements which prevent it getting a higher rating. First, those names!! What on earth possessed Laurens to give her heroes names such as Devil, Scandal, Gabriel, Lucifer et al? What's the point? As someone else pointed out, they don't seem to do a lot to deserve them, and anyway it just sounds ridiculous. (Speaking of `Scandal', incidentally, since I read The Promise In A Kiss before reading this book, I was curious to discover where Sebastian's illegitimate son came from. The story of his arrival - and of Helena's unquestioning, even delighted, acceptance of him - is simply ridiculous and lacks all credibility).<br />Second, while I know this is Stephanie Laurens and not Jo Beverley or Mary Balogh, the behaviour of her characters as regards sex is not credible either. Sneaking around the house - in London and at Somersham - at night to bed-hop is ludicrous. Okay, Devil doesn't have a valet, but what about Honoria's maid? What about the footmen who may well do night duty? What about other occupants of the house hearing footsteps or other noises? I couldn't suspend credibility for that illicit lovemaking at all.<br />Third, I don't know where Laurens gets her ideas from about mourning, but deep mourning was for six months, and half-mourning for a further six months after that. There is no way at all that the family would have been preparing for a ball within six weeks of Tolly's death.<br />Fourth, the murder plot was so transparent even I could figure it out, and I'm no good at all with whodunits. I think I'd worked out the identity of the murder within about 30 pages. So then it got quite boring waiting for the characters to catch up with me - and when Laurens made it clear about 3/4 way through that Devil knew who it was but she kept it from the reader, I was shaking my head. Did she really think that people wouldn't have guessed it? As for the motive, again that was easy.<br />And fifth, the book really lost momentum after Devil and Honoria married. The only thing to sustain the plot from then on was the identity of the murderer, plus further attempts on Devil's life - that took up close to half the book, which was tedious given that by then the romance element had been wound up. Poor pacing there.<br />An entertaining light read, but no more than that.	2003-02-13

I liked a couple of her other regency romances and decided to give this series a try. The Promise in a Kiss was written last, but is a prequel to all the other books, so it seemed to make sense to read it first. And that would have been okay, except that Laurens has a family tree right at the very start of the book. From that I learned two things which made this a doomed romance from the start.<br />One, Sebastian, the Duke of St Ives, has an affair resulting in an illegitimate child while he's married to Helena. So how can I believe in Helena and Sebastian's love affair after discovering that? I can see why people who have read the entire series also have a problem taking this book seriously.<br />Second, the family tree shows Sebastian as dead. Now this, I expect, applies to the later books in the Cynster series - but still, even before I've *read* his story, I know that Sebastian dies within about 30 years of the end of his book, leaving his Helena a widow. <br />It's difficult to get facts like these out of your mind when reading a romance novel, let me tell you!<br />Anyway, the book itself. Laurens is no Balogh or Beverley, my favourites of this genre, and she does tend to go overboard on the intimacy/sensuality in a manner which simply isn't right for the period, but it's done tastefully. Sebastian and Helena met for the first time when she was seventeen and he stole a kiss. They meet again six years later and know each other instantly. Helena thinks that Sebastian is a confirmed bachelor and enlists his help in finding a suitable husband; he knows that she's going to be his wife and he uses every trick he knows to persuade her.<br />There is more to the story: a conniving guardian, threats, blackmail, a daring rescue and other such dramatic elements.

1247362:US	52631742	R3M4GY62FQQMJI	0312979983	76852490	Night Pleasures (Dark-Hunter, Book 2)	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Thoroughly enjoyable escapist fun	I very much enjoyed the first book in Kenyon's series, Fantasy Lover, and so decided to give this a go since it's about Kyrian of Thrace, Julian's best friend. And I didn't regret it.<br />Like Julian from Fantasy Lover, Kyrian is also an ancient Greek. He was a prince and a war-hero, but he was horribly betrayed by the wife he loved dearly, and was tortured and crucified by his Roman enemy. Except that he struck a bargain with Artemis to become a Dark-Hunter and thus achieve immortality.<br />What's a Dark-Hunter? Immortality sounds like a pretty good deal, yeah? Well, not really. A Dark-Hunter is a little like a vampire, except that they don't have to drink human blood (though they do like the taste of it). They can only exist in the dark, that's true, and they can't easily be killed. Their role is to find and kill Daimons, who are vampires of a sort, but only live 27 years unless they steal a human's life - and soul - to give themselves a longer life. So Kyrian has been tracking and destroying Daimons for centuries. Until he meets one who is cleverer than most.<br />And this is how he meets Amanda: she has been kidnapped by the Daimon Desiderius, because of her hidden psychic powers, and Desiderius hopes to use her against Kyrian. Unfortunately for the Daimon, Amanda and Kyrian are immediately attracted to each other. However, there are a few problems. First, Amanda's sisters are vampire-hunters and they all assume that Kryrian is a vampire. Amanda refuses to believe that she has any special powers, and anyway she doesn't want her nice, normal life disturbed by a sexy ancient Greek. She's not sure that she can trust any man, after her ex-fiance rejected her - and anyway, after his wife's betrayal, Kyrian has no intention of trusting any woman, ever again.<br />And, worst of all, as a Dark-Hunter Kyrian has no soul. He can't fall in love (or so he thinks) and he can never build a relationship with a woman. <br />Kenyon's writing is fast-paced, highly amusing in parts and also poignant. She has a great line in secondary characters, in particular Nick the Squire, Ash (Acheron) the leader of the Dark-Hunters, who I hope will get his own book in due course, and Talon, the hero of Kenyon's next book. <br />Not five stars because the crucial denouement felt glossed over somewhat, and because I wanted to see more of Julian and Grace than I did.	2003-01-30

Ardeth, a graduate student, is kidnapped one day as she's already terrified about some friends of hers who have disappeared. She isn't killed, as she fears, but thrown into a cell to be the food source for a vampire, Dmitri Rozokov, who has been a prisoner since he woke from a hundred-year sleep a couple of weeks earlier. But being fed on every night can't really do a lot for someone's health - how long can Ardeth stay alive? Or will she choose some other way of surviving?<br />This book isn't a love story. Get that idea out of your head straight away. If you want a vampire romance, go somewhere else. There is a nice kiss while Ardeth is still a prisoner, but that's about it for romance. For example, after Ardeth's transformation and their break for freedom (referred to in other reviews), they go on a killing spree, and then Baker refers, in ONE SENTENCE, to them having sex among the dead bodies. Nope, not one bit romantic.<br />In any case, Ardeth and Dmitri then spend much of the remainder of the book separated. The body-count increases from then on, and the violence and brutality continues. Not a pleasant read.<br />This book won't be staying in my house, and nor will I be reading anything else by Nancy Baker. I like vampire romances, but this certainly doesn't qualify.	2003-01-26

Many of Beverley's fans don't like this novella because of the age gap between the hero and heroine, and so I wanted to see what I thought. But first, the other three stories.<br />We begin with Janet Dailey's Castles in the Sand. This is a tale about a couple who were in love as teenagers, but were separated by time, events, misunderstandings and simply growing up. They meet again at a time of trauma - the father of one, and the mentor of the other - is seriously ill. However, I didn't find myself at all emotionally engaged with Bridget and Reese's story. I think this was because Dailey skipped over long periods in time, and so we'd have a development at the end of one chapter, only to find that the next chapter jumped forward several months - the emotional impact was lost. Extremely forgettable.<br />Debbie Macomber's The Marrying Kind could have been good - but wasn't. Katie and Jason were married as teenagers, but Katie's parents didn't approve of Jason and they took Katie away and made her annul the marriage. Now, ten years later, Katie and Jason meet again, three days before his wedding to someone else, and find that they're still in love. Okay... a well-worn premise, but I usually like Macomber so I expected good work from her. Instead, I got a plot which has been done many times before, and a hero I didn't particularly like. The way he treats his fiancée is particularly abhorrent, and the rather convenient manner in which she turns into a selfish harridan wasn't at all convincing.<br />Rebecca Brandewyne's Hasten Down The Wind has been described by another reviewer here as a history lesson disguised as a romance, and I couldn't have put it better myself. Instead of focusing on Elizabeth's relationship with Chaingo, the novella gives us lots and lots of information about the outlaws - and it's all incomplete too, as if the reader is expected to know all about the period and the characters. I couldn't follow the detail of the events at all, and certainly have no interest in re-reading the novella.<br />However, Beverley's Forbidden Affections certainly didn't disappoint. Anna is a fan of Gothic romances, and when she discovers that her new London home has a room decorated exactly as the heroine's room in one of her favourite author's books, Forbidden Affections, she is curious. Discovering a secret doorway, she explores the house next door, owned by a mysterious nobleman who is believed to have killed his former mistress. But the Earl of Carne is nothing like she imagined, and she finds herself working secretly with him to clear his name. Along the way, she falls in love - but he is 30 to her 16, and even if her family would agree, Carne can't reconcile with his conscience the idea of marrying someone so young. <br />The reason some of Beverley's fans dislike this novella is precisely the notion of a 16-year-old marrying a man so much older. But, having read Forbidden Affections, that aspect doesn't bother me in the least. Anna may be 16, but she's no child. She's actually far more sensible and mature in her outlook than her older sister, who is 19. Carne does recognise this, even while he's telling her that he's too old for her and that she'll meet someone younger in time. And he doesn't rush into anything where Anna is concerned; he takes his time, which shows some degree of consideration. <br />I enjoyed the Beverley novella very much and for me it compensates for the remainder of the anthology. But if you're not a fan of Beverley or of Regency romance, give this one a miss!	2003-01-13

Despite my hesitancy about anthologies normally, since I love Christmas stories I got hold of several of the Signet seasonal anthologies. For every good one - this year's volume, for instance - I suppose there has to be an absolute stinker, and this one is it. Even the good writers this time have produced duds, and overall the collection is so bad I'm trying to forget I read it.<br />We begin with Nancy Butler - variable to good usually - and The Merry Wanderer. Butler tries to merge Arthurian legend with Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, and it simply doesn't come off. The story feels completely wrong for the period, and I found myself rolling my eyes as I continued to read. I couldn't wait to get to the end of it.<br />Better things had to come, I thought, and so I started on Emma Jensen's The Wexford Carol with high expectations. I do enjoy Jensen very much as a rule, and her Irish settings are usually very well done. Lizzie, trying desperately to save the family home which is falling down around her ears, is horrified when she discovers that her father's heir has sold it, and that the new owner is sending his agent to inspect it. The agent seems unable to recognise any of the delights of Hollymore. Captain Jones, or more properly Lord Rhys Edward-Jones, seems unable to find joy in anything - can Lizzie, and the atmosphere of Christmas, do anything to change him? This one is better, but felt over-contrived in places.<br />Edith Layton's High Spirits just didn't do anything for me. Arabella finds Society balls and functions unbearably nerve-wracking, so she takes to swilling brandy before she goes, and from time to time during each evening. Uhh... didn't anyone *notice*? Why wouldn't dance-partners or her chaperones have smelt the brandy on her breath? It's not as if she chose a drink which didn't have a strong smell. I found it incredible that the hero only noticed when he kissed her. Furthermore, it was very clear that Arabella was well on the way to becoming an alcoholic: would she have been able to stop drinking as easily as all that?<br />Barbara Metzger's The Christmas Curse was mildly amusing, but definitely forgettable. Two ghosts, cursed to haunt Worth Keep until one of their heirs falls in love and proposes to his love at a certain time and in a certain manner, try their best to bring about this happy event. Let's just say that a huge amount of suspension of disbelief is required.<br />And finally, Andrea Pickens, of whom I expected much, presents A Gathering of Gifts. A young lady is injured on Lord Kirtland's land, and he is obliged to offer Lady Emma a room under his own roof until she can be moved. She sprained an ankle - couldn't they have strapped it up and taken her home slowly in a carriage? Anyway, Emma is a spoiled brat who deserves no sympathy whatsoever. She treats her hosts as unpaid servants. Kirtland's infatuation with her makes no sense whatsoever; I simply couldn't believe it. And Emma's own rehabilitation was too little, too late, and entirely unconvincing.<br />The only novella here worth a second read is Jensen's Wexford Carol; the others weren't even worth the first read.	2003-01-13

Alexander Claybourne lives alone in an isolated house in a small town. No-one sees him during the day. He doesn't socialise, and no-one knows anything about him. There are rumours that he is a vampire. One day, an eight-year-old girl, Gail Crawford, comes to him and asks him to save her sister, in a coma in hospital following a road accident. Since he's a vampire, as she believes, then if he gives her some of his blood she will live.<br />Is Alexander a vampire? Does his blood have mysterious qualities? He doesn't actually know what his blood will do to Kara, but feels compelled to help her all the same. And once he has done so, he feels drawn to her and unable to stay away. He visits her, and they talk on several occasions - and fall in love.<br />But when Kara gets out of hospital and is sent for further blood tests, Alexander realises that by giving her his blood he might have saved her life, but he has caused problems not only for Kara, but also for herself. They have to go on the run, in fear of their lives. And Alexander has to tell Kara the truth about himself - will she still want him?<br />Yes, he's not a vampire: he's an alien, as many other reviewers have pointed out. (Oh, and this happens not very far into the book; certainly not close to the end, as other reviewers claim). Umm... so what? That made no difference to me. My two-star rating isn't because Alexander isn't a vampire; it's because of the quality of the book. Making him an alien was definitely different, and in a better book it would have made for a very interesting storyline. As it is, Ashley's alien is, as Kara herself says, something of a cross between Superman and the Highlander (not a lot of originality in characterisation, really), though he doesn't seem to possess much of Superman's morality. This alien is predisposed to violence, and a lot of it.<br />Why didn't I like this book? Well, the weak, whiny characters were a major part of it. Take Kara: she kept changing her mind about whether or not she trusted and loved Alexander. And when he told her that he was an alien, she actually ran away and threatened to turn him in to the doctor she knew would cage him like a labrat and would drain his blood for financial gain. Is being from another planet such a dreadful thing that Alexander deserved to be treated worse than an animal?<br />Then there's Alexander: throughout the book, one minute he is telling Kara that he loves her and will never let her go, and the next he is telling her to leave him, to go away, that they can't be together. They even undergo a marriage ceremony according to the rites of his planet, and he explains that in his culture the custom is marriage for life: a soul-bond. And then the next day he tells her that she has to leave him and start a new life without him?! Make up your mind, man!!<br />Then there's the thriller/danger plot. For me, that went on too long, was too brutal and really wasn't interesting. I'm interested in the romance, not extraneous elements. If you want a love story, this isn't really for you. If you like thrills and danger and struggles to escape, then maybe it is. This plot simply occupied far too much of the book for my liking.<br />Ashley has simply never written anything else as good as Embrace The Night, and on recent evidence she's not going to.	2003-01-06

She is only outside his home out of sheer nosiness, incidentally. Sheldrake therefore is obliged to offer Olivia and her sister Susannah his hospitality - and not just overnight, since the local doctor says Olivia cannot travel until after the baby is born. Sheldrake and Olivia are thus thrown together at close quarters.<br />The first ludicrous element is that Susannah - only sixteen and an avid reader of Gothic novels - has told Olivia that Sheldrake is rumoured to have murdered his stepfather. And instead of dismissing this as unsubstantiated gossip which is highly unlikely to be true, Olivia actually believes it. Hence the sightseeing trip to his house. After Sheldrake rescues her and opens up his home to her, Olivia treats him with unmerited suspicion and is downright rude to him. Sheldrake, unbelievably, is nothing but polite to this unhinged, nasty woman and even finds her attractive!<br />Even more ludicrous, though, is the very swift development whereby Olivia does a volte-face and decides that she needs to remarry - and that Sheldrake is the only possible candidate. Uhh... how so? So she decides to pursue him, but only if she can believe that he is innocent of murder. So, incredibly, she asks him outright if he killed his stepfather, and when he tells her not to believe everything she hears, she sneaks into his study, breaks into a locked desk drawer and actually reads his private correspondence! <br />Sheldrake catches her in the act - but instead of throwing Olivia and her sister out of his home, or letting her remain on sufferance until after her baby is born, he actually continues to be nice to her and even courts her. Unbelievable!<br />Susannah is no better: she tells perfect strangers that Sheldrake murdered his stepfather.<br />I didn't like Olivia in the least - sillyimmature, self-absorbed, a dramatist and fond of ordering people around in a house not her own. I simply couldn't believe that Sheldrake would show the slightest interest in her, and that's one of the reasons I couldn't finish the book. I had no wish to see those two end up together. <br />Besides these flaws, the book is also full of Americanisms - and modern Americanisms at that - in dialogue, such that I kept getting jerked out of the (not very gripping) story to wince at dialogue I could not imagine any character of that era actually speaking. There were also grammatical errors, such as tense switches. Oh, and Mindel obviously doesn't know the difference between the title of `Lady Olivia Beresford' and `Lady Beresford'; she makes the error of assuming that these are the same title in respect of two different characters. <br />I bought this book on the strength of cover quotes from Maggie Shayne and, impressively, Jo Beverley. Admittedly, these referred to Mindel's first book, to which this appears to be a sequel. However, I can't believe that there could be such a massive difference in quality between the two. Incidentally, the hero of her first book appears as a minor character in this; from what I saw of him, I loathed him.<br />Not recommended at all.	2003-01-05

This year Signet's Regency anthology is genuinely worth the cover price, despite the absence of stars from previous years such as Mary Balogh - but it does have Carla Kelly, and the Edith Layton's not bad either this time. Layton's anthology novellas have a tendency to disappoint. <br />We begin with Layton's The Amiable Miser. Joy, orphaned in her teens, has lived with her miserly uncle for several years, and she works in his bookshop, mainly because he realised that a pretty young woman would bring in customers. One of Joy's innovations is a romance section: Minerva Press books for the ladies, run as a circulating library. As a result, a number of local ladies meet there regularly to swap recommendations. The hero comes into the picture when Lady Gray, a regular, is ill and her nephew Niall returns a book on her behalf. Joy's uncle engages in a bit of matchmaking by ensuring that Joy and Niall have to spend some time in each other's company. This is an enjoyable little story, although I'm not really convinced that it's all that credible. <br />A Home for Hannah is second; Barbara Metzger borrows what is now a very over-used idea, that of the poverty-stricken hero. Gregory, Viscount Bellington, has inherited the family title and estates, but his late father and brother gambled all their money away. So he needs to marry someone wealthy in order to survive and rescue his estates. Unfortunately, his proposal to an heiress is interrupted by the appearance of a child who is Gregory's image. Everyone thinks that she is his illegitimate daughter; Gregory realises that she must be his brother's child from one of his many liaisons. The only person who will help Gregory with Hannah is Clare Haney, sister of a neighbour. Is it possible that together they could make a home for Hannah?<br />Amanda McCabe's A Partridge in a Pear Tree is an unusual and delightful short story. Lady Kirkwood is trying to decide which of her relatives to make her heir. So she decides to hold a houseparty, and to give the guests a challenge: find the gifts of the eponymous Christmas song. Allison Gordon and William Bradford form part of one of the teams, and come up with some extremely imaginative ways of meeting the challenge. The story is a lot of fun and has some delightful moments. The only thing which bothered me was that I really couldn't see Allison and her sisters leaving their mother alone in the family cottage for Christmas.<br />Sandra Heath's The Solid Silver Chess Set is the poorest of this collection. The chess set of the title is being carried by an elf as a gift from one elf lord to another, and the elf is present as part of the need for intervention between the two estranged lovers of the story, Philip, Earl of Allensmore and Julia Talbot. However, I found Philip and Julia - especially Julia - rather immature and unconvincing as lovers; both were too quick to jump to conclusions, and Julia especially came across as extremely fickle.<br />Finally, the gem of the collection is Carla Kelly's No Room at the Inn. Kelly specialises in unusual situations and heroines, and this novella is no exception. Having been brought up as the daughter of an earl, Mary now discovers that she was adopted shortly after her birth and is in fact the illegitimate daughter of a courtesan. The true circumstances of her origins having emerged because her grandmother traced her, Mary's adoptive parents had to tell her the truth - and effectively evicted her from their home. So she is now travelling to her grandmother's home, escorted by the family solicitor and his wife and children. Her new status is evident in the way the solicitor now treats her. Brought up as a lady, but now the bastard daughter of a nobody, where does Mary belong? But when her party is forced to seek shelter at the home of Joseph Shephard, son of her `father's' estate steward, she realises that there is indeed a place where she belongs.  <br />With one excellent and three very good stories, this is acollection I'll certainly want to keep.	2002-12-31

On the way to pawn her one valuable, a small pearl ring, she was mugged, but rescued by what appeared then to her as a knight in shining armour, a tall, handsome man who escorted her on her errand but also sent the family a Christmas goose and redeemed Mary Ann's ring. Ever since that day, she has been in love with her mystery rescuer.<br />Lionel St James has been disowned by his family as a result of a foolish scandal when he was twenty. Penniless and without expectations, he makes his living as a gambler and is unwelcome in polite society. Seven years after rescuing Mary Ann, however, he gatecrashes a ball given by her now brother-in-law, Lord Blakely, in order to see what his young acquaintance has made of herself. Seeing her again, he falls in love. But, even though Mary Ann and her family make him welcome, Lionel knows that he is completely ineligible.<br />Unable to resist the persuasions of his family, Blakely invites Lionel to spend Christmas with them all at his country estate, but warns Lionel off Mary Ann - not that Lionel intended to make any advances to her anyway, because of his situation. His own family doesn't recognise him, after all, and other members of Society turn their backs on him when he enters a room. But this is Christmas, the time of peace and forgiveness, after all: can miracles happen?<br />This is an interesting tale of a tarnished hero who - as readers guess right from the beginning - is not as evil as he's been painted. The heroine is delightful: sparky, intelligent and compassionate, with a strong streak of determination. There are some interesting secondary characters too, including the heroine's sisters and brother-in-law and the hero's half-siblings.<br />Despite all that, I don't feel that the book is one I'll consider among my favourite Christmas stories. There were a few niggles, such as a sense that Huntington thinks - it was never precisely specified - that disinheriting Lionel also means that he cannot inherit his father's baronetcy, which of course isn't correct. Barbara, the lady Lionel is supposed to have ruined all those years ago, is just a little over the top. And there are rather too many secondary characters in the background to keep track of - characters from earlier books by Huntington, perhaps? It certainly seemed as if the reader should know about them and that therefore Huntington felt that they didn't require introductions. <br />Still, this is considerably better than the average Zebra Regency.	2002-12-31

This anthology suffers from both of these problems, and as a result is really not good enough to be considered a keeper.<br />The first story is Barbara Metzger's Little Miracles, an unusual tale centred around a poor and run-down parish church and the few remaining church mice, who try hard to hint successive vicars in the direction of St Cecilia's riches. Evan, the current vicar, is in love with Alice, daughter of the local squire. But his stipend is a pittance and the vicarage has a hole in its roof; how could he ever ask her to marry him? It's a sweet story with amusing moments, but too short for real character development.<br />Allison Lane's The Marriage Stakes is typical of this author; the characters are all far too informal with each other, and minor characters are one-dimensional caricatures. She uses a plot device which appears in many other novels, where the hero holds a house party in order to choose a bride. The heroine, Sophie, who has been offered shelter after her carriage met with an accident, somehow manages to spy on the various eligible young ladies and report back to Westlake. None of this is at all convincing, and there are a number of scenes which are simply embarrassing to read.<br />The Gift of the Spoons, by Nancy Butler, is an unusual story and I'm not entirely convinced that it works. It helps if you believe in magic and healing and psychic powers, which I don't. Christopher Herne's son is dying, and as a last resort he is tracking down a woman he's been told about, who has healing powers - Pippa Spoon. Unfortunately, the woman he finds is the original Pippa's daughter. Still, he persuades her to come home with him to treat his son. Lots of strange goings-on and fits of temper from Christopher, and the factthat he never calls his son by his name, make this a difficult novella to like. The resolution is also too quick, and the diagnosis pretty much incredible.<br />On to Diane Farr's Reckless Miss Ripley; shades of Georgette Heyer's Friday's Child here, but done very well in Ms Farr's usual style. Fred Bates is hurrying home to spend Christmas with his family. He's feeling very sorry for himself, and guilty, because the family's new state of poverty is all his fault. Taking shelter from the snow at an inn, he encounters a young lady travelling alone; it transpires that she's trying to get to Bath to stop her friend Harry from marrying someone else. Claudia persuades Fred to drive her to Bath, and a delightful story ensues.<br />Finally, we have Edith Layton's The Christmas Thief. Max Evers has lost all his money and can't even afford to buy his niece a Christmas present. Unable to come up with any other solution, he decides that he will steal something for her. But committing a crime turns out to be not as simple as he'd envisaged. This novella was a disappointment: there are too many unconvincing events and leaps of logic and I simply can't see how certain things would have happened. The element of romance is also far too brief: the heroine gets perhaps half a dozen pages in a 60-page story.<br />Overall, just about so-so.	2002-12-29

Mark Juan Carlos Renfrew, Earl of Everdon, is known throughout the ton as Don Juan, and with good reason. He is a rake who has had affair after affair, although he is a married man. But his transgressions aren't without cause: after all, he married very young, and his wife ran off with another man within six months of their wedding. Now, though, he has just heard that she is dead, and he needs to find another wife in a hurry, before the matchmaking mamas hear that there's a new matrimonial prize on the market. Everdon's mother has a solution: propose to her young friend Lady Deirdre Stowe.<br />Deirdre is not considered to be a great prize on the marriage mart; she is not especially attractive, with too large a nose, and she has a tendency to dress in styles and colours which don't suit her. But this is all part of her plan; she is in love with a penniless mathematician of whom her parents don't approve. She has, however, struck a bargain with them: she will undergo one more season and she will not turn down any respectable offer of marriage she might receive. However, if she receives no offers, they will allow her to marry her Howard. This, then, is the reason for Deirdre's unbecoming apparel and her failure to make herself attractive. But then Everdon proposes, and she's in trouble... <br />She can't refuse him because of her promise to her parents. So they come to an agreement: she will accept his offer and they will enter into a sham betrothal, and at some point Everdon will contrive to be discovered in compromising circumstances, which will give Deirdre a good reason to end the engagement. <br />Everdon doesn't particularly like the plan, especially as it will leave him without a fiancée and at the mercy of the sharks in the marriage mart again. He likes it even less once he meets Howard Dunstable and sees how the man treats Deirdre, forever complaining, failing to pay her any attention and clearly intending to treat her as an unpaid housekeeper once they're married. And as soon as Everdon actually kisses Deirdre he knows that she's never known passion - and that he wants her for his own. But how can he convince her that he isn't the irredeemable rake she believes him to be - and that they are meant for each other?<br />This is an enjoyable book; not as good as Beverley's best early Regency, Emily and the Dark Angel, but considerably better than most of the others from that era. There are familiar characters here too: Everdon's cousin is Ian Renfrew, the Daffodil Dandy first introduced in Emily and the Dark Angel, and Everdon first dances with Deirdre at a ball held at the Ashbys' home. The romance is sweet and certainly convincing; both characters have much to gain from knowing and loving the other. Appearances can be, and are, deceiving on both sides. Was Deirdre's attachment to Howard convincing? I'm not sure. <br />I was puzzled as to why Everdon's friends called him Don - yes, his nickname was Don Juan, but as he and they would have been well aware, Don is not a name in Spanish, it is a title and form of address for the nobility. Was it intended to be short for Everdon, as well as being part of his nickname? That would have made some sense, but should have been explained.<br />An enjoyable book, which I'll certainly want to re-read.	2002-12-29

Eight years ago, Max, then Viscount Evendon, was engaged to Judith Blakeford. But, with a month to go until the wedding, she eloped with Andrew Easton. Judith found her fiancé cold and forbidding, whereas Andrew tempted her with romance and passion. Yet marriage disillusions her: her husband is a drunken debaucher who spends most of his time away from her and their children, engaging in seduction.<br />Eight years later, Judith, now widowed, returns to London, and encounters her former fiancé once more. Max, now the Marquess of Denbigh, has nursed a desire for vengeance for the entire eight years since she ran off, leaving her father to break the news that he'd been jilted. His once-time love for Judith has turned to hatred, and he wants revenge.<br />Max ensures that his and Judith's paths cross as frequently as possible, doing his best to charm his way into her children's good graces and those of her sister-in-law, Amy - that seems to be the easiest way to get Judith to spend time with him. When he succeeds in getting her to accept his invitation to spend Christmas at his estate he knows that his plan is succeeding. All he needs to do is to make her fall in love with him, the way he once loved her, and then abandon her, just as she once abandoned him. Then his revenge will be complete.<br />But this is Christmas, a time for love and peace and forgiveness, not a time for darkness and hatred. Can Max really sustain his desire for vengeance in the face of the woman he still loves? Can Judith overcome the memory of her fear of Denbigh and her guilt for what she once did to him - and her conviction that he means only to hurt her? Can these two people ever learn to trust one another?<br />This is a lovely book, and one of Balogh's better Christmas novels, a period she does so well. Its theme is very seasonal, with love, forgiveness and hope at the core of the book, and a cast of supporting characters who are alone and in need of love. There is also a very sweet secondary romance featuring two characters both of whom thought themselves never likely to fall in love or marry. The book is very hard to find, but well worth it!	2002-12-28

Occasionally even those stories by favourite authors suffer from anthology-itis: they are too short for good character and plot development.<br />Here is an excellent idea, however: a collection of Christmas novellas by one of the best authors of the Regency/historical period, Mary Jo Putney. All but one of the novellas are reprints of stories previously published in earlier multiple-author anthologies, but since I hadn't read any of them that wasn't an issue for me. The single new story is a contemporary novella, a sequel to The Spiral Path, Putney's most recent contemporary novel.<br />A Holiday Fling, the contemporary story, is the first in the collection. Jenny Lyme and Greg Marino were minor characters in The Spiral Path, and we didn't see them interact with each other. In this novella, we discover that they had been lovers more than ten years earlier when working on a movie, but their lives had gone in separate directions. Now Jenny needs Greg's help to save her village's community centre, and so he flies to England to spend Christmas with her. The attraction between them is as strong as ever, and they are unable to stay out of each other's arms. This time, though, is it just another holiday fling, or can they make a future together?<br />The Christmas Cuckoo is a tale of mistaken identity and belonging. Major Jack Howard has returned from the wars because he has unexpectedly inherited an earldom. Unwilling to comply with his great-aunt the countess's dictates as to how an earl should dress and behave, especially since he knows very well that she resents the fact that he has inherited the title, he jumps on the first stagecoach out of London. En route to its destination, he gets drunk and is mistakenly left behind at a stop... where he is found by a young woman expecting her brother's friend Captain Jack Howard. Meg had high hopes that Captain Jack would fall in love with her sister Phoebe, but finds herself falling in love with Major Jack instead. The mistaken identity ensues since Jack is too drunk to realise that Meg has the wrong Jack Howard, and soon he is in the welcoming warmth of a loving family for the first time in his life. Is it too much to ask to enjoy one happy Christmas? <br />In Sunshine for Christmas I found a surprise, and very welcome, sequel to The Rake. Ally's former fiancé, and the man who broke her heart and sent her running away from her family, was left lonely and devastated at the end of the book, for he really had loved Ally and he had to live not only with the knowledge that he had lost her through his own fault, but also the guilt of knowing that it was his careless words which had sent her fleeing from her home and into hiding. Miserable and unable to bear the joy of Christmas all around him, Lord Randolph travels to Italy. There, he meets Elizabeth Walker, an unfashionable woman old enough at thirty-something to be considered unmarriageable. Yet she interests him in a way that no-one else has ever before. Can these two lonely people overcome the differences between them to find a future together?<br />The Christmas Tart is probably the weakest in the collection. Nicole, a French émigrée of good family working as a seamstress is falsely accused of theft by her employer. She is fired, without references, and all her money confiscated. As she contemplates the very few options open to her, she is mistaken for a prostitute by two gentlemen, who buy her as a present for their friend Sir Philip Selbourne. Can Nicole sell herself to survive? Would Philip want a barely-willing sacrifice in any case? What will Nicole do, alone and penniless at Christmas?<br />Finally, the treat of the anthology is The Black Beast of Belleterre, a Beauty and the Beast fable. James, Lord Falconer,is very ugly. He knows, because his father always told him so, and an accident when he was a child made him even more so. Now that he is an adult and inherited his father's estates, he always wears a hooded cape so that no-one can see him. His neighbour is a gambler and in debt to James. When James hears that Gardsley is about to sell his beautiful daughter to a pox-ridden old man, he offers to take Ariel in cancellation of Gardsley's debt to him. But he cannot bear to allow a young woman as lovely as Ariel to see his ugly face, so he hides himself from her... until Ariel decides that she wants to get to know her husband. Can she get past his scars, mental as well as physical, to make this a marriage of love as well as expediency?<br />My only complaint about this collection is its price; it's a trade paperback rather than standard size, and thus more expensive. This was bought for me as a surprise, and very welcome, Christmas present, but anyone considering buying it for themselves might want to be sure that they hadn't read any of the novellas before.	2002-12-28

So much so that I am tracking down her out-of-print backlist and buying second-hand copies at large multiples of their cover prices. Therefore I would not usually write negative reviews of one of her books. This time I have to.<br />On other occasions, a Balogh book has hooked me right from the first page. I'm sucked in and can barely put the book down. A Gift Of Daisies felt nothing like a Balogh book. Reading the first few pages, I actually had to look again at the back cover to check that it was actually Rachel who was the heroine, not her much nicer and more interesting friend Celia...<br />I can't recommend A Gift Of Daisies in any way, and will probably hide it at the very back of my Balogh collection so I'll never be tempted to read it again.	2002-12-05

This is an incredibly boring book, riddled with errors and inaccuracies, and which shows no concern at all for the manners of the period. I'm well aware that Hendrickson is considered an expert on the Regency period, and another book of hers I've read is considerably better than this. All I can suggest is that she clearly had an off-day when she wrote this book - or her publisher has put her name on something written by someone else!<br />The romance, first. Lady Jocelyn meets Peter, Lord Leigh again five years after rejecting his proposal on the apparent grounds that, as a mere baronet at the time, he wasn't good enough for the daughter of a marquess. Now he's a baron and wealthy. Instead of shunning her, though, he is openly affectionate and attentive towards her. Leigh was so particular in his attentions that I actually wondered if he was attempting to get revenge by compromising Jocelyn. Apparently not. Apparently Hendrickson thinks that it was perfectly acceptable behaviour for a gentleman to: call a lady by her first name at all times; wander in and out of her private apartments without permission and without any servant or fellow (female) guest in attendance; wander off alone with said lady for hours and hours at a time, even returning late for dinner on one occasion; kiss said lady in a passionate manner normally reserved for a courtesan, and to do so on some occasions in full view of other guests. These are just some examples of Leigh's very unlikely behaviour towards Jocelyn. Her reputation would have been ruined in a matter of hours, let alone days - and the consequence wouldn't have been a wedding, but the assumption that Jocelyn was already ruined.<br />There is another unmarried woman who is a minor character in this book. I actually had to go back to the beginning of the book to check her marital status, because she behaved as if she was a daring widow, frequently sneaking off alone with men, practically propositioning the hero and other men, and in the end declaring her intention to go and live on the Continent since her relatives had been disgraced. A single woman? With whom would she propose to live? <br />Which brings me to another point: the complete lack of any chaperonage in this book. Unmarried female characters, of whom there were several, were left to do whatever they liked, and were left alone with gentlemen on many occasions, even being kissed in view of other people from time to time. Several reputations would have been ruined in this book, were the other characters not apparently all blind.<br />And there are secondary characters to extremes: far too many to keep track of, and none of whom aroused even the remotest interest for me. Quite simply, the characters were either cardboard cut-outs, or ridiculously exaggerated caricatures as in the case of the French cousins Henri and Pierre, and Suzanne.<br />And then there was the mystery plot: the theft of a necklace. Now, several times Jocelyn and Leigh discuss who would have a motive to steal it; who would benefit most from the proceeds of its sale. And yet earlier in the book we are told that the necklace is unique, so much so that it could not be sold in one piece - it would be recognised. So why do the characters assume that it would be sold? And the eventual thieves seem completely inconsistent in their motives, saying in one minute that it was stolen to allow another woman the right to wear it (how? Would it not be recognised instantly?) and the next that they needed the proceeds of its sale.<br />I was tempted to throw this book away after only one chapter, but persevered in the hope that it would get better. It didn't, and it represents three hours of my life that I won't get back! It is one of the most boring so-called romances I have ever read, and the anachronisms, together with errors in word usage (what on earth is a 'roughish' look??) and the grammatical mistakes with which this book is riddled, made it almost impossible to concentrate on the story. Despite earlier, better experience with Hendrickson's work, I don't think I'll be reading anything by her ever again. I'm very surprised to see an author of Anne Barbour's calibre writing here in support of a book as bad as this.	2002-11-24

Kate Corbet is a poor relation, living in the house of her wealthier cousins, the Swansons. Unlike many other historical novels, the Swansons aren't evil; they simply have three unattractive daughters to marry off, and so Kate and the youngest Swanson, Sibyl, are kept out of sight. At a ball one night, however, they overhear a plan to trap Sir Alasdair St Erth into marriage. Kate engineers a way to help him escape from the trap, only for Sir Alasdair to accuse her of trying to trap him herself.<br />After this inaupicious meeting, Alasdair finds himself wanting to apologise, so he tracks Kate down... and discovers that she is a distant cousin of the Scalbys, a couple on whom he's plotted revenge for years. He blames them for his father's ruin and suicide and, we suspect, probably more too. He has the evidence to destroy them, but he wants to do it publicly, and he thinks that Kate would be the perfect means of getting close to them. So he suggests a deal to Kate: pretending that he needs help to be rehabilitated into polite society, he offers to squire her around to social events she won't get a chance to go to otherwise, if she will help to make him respectable.<br />Is Alasdair being fair to Kate? His best friend, Leigh, continually urges him to think of her and draw back before Kate gets hurt. In particular, Leigh says, what if she falls in love with him? She won't, Alasdair says - but can he guarantee it? He thinks he can guarantee that he won't have any feelings for her greater than fondness - but can he prevent himself?<br />The scenes of dialogue between Kate and Alasdair are tremendously enjoyable, and their first kiss - when it finally comes - is explosive. Kate is a fascinating heroine, worldy-wise in so many ways and yet naive in others. Alasdair is coldly cynical, and of course he is using Kate in quite a cold-blooded way, and yet he gradually reveals that he does still have a heart - and a soul.<br />Where the book began to lose its way, for me, was close to the end, and this is why it gets four stars rather than five. While the final chapter or two of the book - where we finally see Alasdair make his choice between revenge or love, and he almost makes the wrong one, as another review notes - are very well done indeed, the three or so before that just feel like filler, as if we're marching time waiting for the final denouement. Nothing much happens, and I wondered what the point was.<br />Layton again gives much detail about the London underworld, a feature of some of her earlier Signets and, of course, Gilly's story from her C series. Here, too, I felt that some of it could have been trimmed; we don't need quite so much extraneous information.<br />In terms of secondary characters, I liked Leigh and Sibyl very much indeed, and I'm hoping that Layton plans a book - or books - about them. However, I see that her next book is about neither. Still, we can hope!	2002-11-20

He expects to be shunned, though since he's wealthy, has a lofty title and is looking for a wife he expects that he won't be shown the door everywhere he goes. His money, if not himself, will be welcome.<br />His town house is a mess; it's been empty for eight years and is falling apart inside. Tregarron hires Buchanan and Buchanan, architects, to set it to rights. What he doesn't know is that plain and freckled Cate Buchanan is the real architect, while her uncles are merely a front for her business. Cate knows that if anyone finds out the truth, the business will be destroyed, so she goes to great pains to prevent Tregarron from finding out. She shouldn't really be seeing much of him - yet for some reason he keeps coming back to the house, and anyway, Cate's younger sister and the patronage of the Hythes (from Best Laid Plans) militate against Cate avoiding Society entirely.<br />For his part, Tregarron can't understand his fascination with Cate. She has a sharp tongue and she is not at all pretty. And yet he finds himself irrestibly attracted to her...<br />I do enjoy heroes with a murky past and tortured soul, and Tregarron is certainly that. He's also chivalrous even despite himself, which endears him to me even more. As for Cate, she's amusing and entertaining, far from being a simpering heroine. These two make a great couple.<br />Some nitpicks: Tregarron is a Cornish name, and yet his main country seat is in Wales? One or two anachronisms crop up here and there in dialogue. More importantly, Jensen has a habit of glossing over some interesting and important detail, so after what was a (very nicely) slow-moving romance, it's all tied up in about three pages at the end. Likewise, she doesn't tell us just when and how Tregarron worked out that Cate really was the architect, nor how he guessed who was sending the apparently threatening notes -for something which was causing pain and fear to both Cate and Tregarron (both of whom thought the notes were aimed at them), this element was skimmed over far too quickly.<br />Nevertheless, a very enjoyable book; it's a shame that Jensen's more recent work isn't up to the standard of her earlier novels, such as this and His Grace Endures.	2002-11-16

This anthology has three of my favourite Regency writers as contributors, so it should be good, I thought. However, I quickly discovered that two of the novellas inside had also appeared in a later anthology, Captured Hearts. So if you've read that, then you've already read the Layton and Balogh contributions to this anthology.<br />And, as it happens, by far the weakest and least enjoyable story in this is the Layton one, Buried Treasure. Layton departs from her usual Regency genre (why then is she included in a *Rakes* and Rogues anthology?) to produce a rather tedious story about a not-very-likeable pirate and the somewhat boring woman who falls in love with him and whom he intends to seduce and desert. I didn't enjoy this the first time, and didn't bother reading it the second.<br />I enjoyed Melinda McRae's Sweet Revenge more than I expected. David, Lord Denby returns home after a long absence, knowing that his childhood sweetheart, Chloe, is now widowed. He and Chloe had been secretly engaged years earlier, but then he'd gone off to fight in the Napoleonic wars and had been rumoured killed in action. Griefstricken, Chloe had married his cousin Jonathan. Not long after, David had returned home safely, and he'd seen Chloe's action as betrayal. He hadn't seen her since. Now, however, she was widowed and he's out for revenge. He will make her fall in love with him again and, if possible, seduce her - and then desert her. But will his resolve hold when his own feelings may not be as full of hate as he thinks?<br />Mary Jo Putney's The Devil's Spawn is not her best work by far. The plot's a well-worn one: Dominic, Lord Chandler, asks his sweetheart's father for permission to pay his addresses. The father rejects him and goes further: lets Roxanne believe that Dominic has been bought off. This same plot was used in a novella in the Captured Hearts anthology. Years later, Dominic returns, with an elaborate plan to kidnap Roxanne and marry her - he has no idea of whatshe believes about him. It's the really ridiculous nature of this plan, which involves pretending to be a Polynesian savage, which destroys the crediblity of the story. Added to that, there is another cliched revelation in the novella, and an abrupt and unconvincing change in characterisation.<br />Anita Mills' A Good Woman, set in Texas as opposed to Regency England, is also surprisingly enjoyable. Jack Morgan, former bank robber, is being released after eight years in prison. His only wish is to find the money he buried before being arrested, but a woman with two children and clearly in desperate circumstances catches his attention and he helps her out by paying for a night's accommodation and food for her. The next day they're on the same stagecoach to Huntsville. Beth tries to ignore the drunken, untidy man, while Jack is tired and irritated by the children. However, neither can prevent their decent natures wanting to help the other, and when they arrive in Huntsville Jack sacrifices the remainder of his cash to stop Beth's home being repossessed. Then, when Beth sees the way the sheriff is harassing Jack, she offers him a home. Can the lonely, tired widow reform the cynical ex-con who claims not to have a heart?<br />And the best in the collection is Mary Balogh's Precious Rogue, which I'd read before. Patricia Mangan is a poor relation, treated as little better than a maid by her aunt. Joshua Buchanan is a guest at a house-party, and the favoured suitor of Patricia's cousin. However, Buchanan - as Patricia discovers when she sees him enjoying the attentions of a married lady guest - is a rake, and he's actually only leading her cousin and aunt on. He has no intention of proposing. However, the rake and the little shadow find themselves having sparky conversations... and the rake finds himself increasingly concerned for the fate of his little bird, as he calls Patricia. And soon he cannot even carry on his usual games with discreet women, because all he can think about is Patricia...<br />The best novellas in this anthology, as is always the case with anthologies, needed to be longer. The other two would have been best omitted. This gets three stars for Precious Rogue; on average, the rest of the anthology merits two.	2002-11-16

In Dead Until Dark, a couple of Sookie's work colleagues were murdered; in this book, Merlotte's suffers a similar haemorrhage of staff.<br />Added to that, there are other plots afoot: Bill continues his work as a sort of vampire 'union official', and Eric starts to rent out Sookie's help and mind-reading skills. He sends her to Dallas to investigate attacks on vampires there. Interestingly, Bill has to travel by sealed coffin on a conventional aeroplane; I thought it had been established in Dead Until Dark that he could fly. <br />This is a pretty violent book, and shows that Harris is more interested in mystery/suspense than she is in romance, although some parts of the book are given over to Sookie and Bill's relationship. Sookie is still having difficulty coming to terms with aspects of Bill's vampire nature, such as his need to hunt and feed and occasionally to feed off humans other than herself. <br />However, Sookie herself worries me. She's in love with Bill - and yet she finds Sam (the shape-shifter) extremely attractive and she even shares a kiss with him, a kiss they clearly both enjoy and would like to take further. There's also Eric the Viking vampire, who is very attracted to Sookie, and it's clearly mutual; the kiss they share also indicates that Sookie's commitment to Bill may not be all that serious. <br />I don't know whether Harris plans another book in this series, but if it also deals with murders which look as if they could have been committed by vampires, and Sookie using her mind-reading abilities to solve violent crime, the theme will get just a little old...	2002-11-15

This book is better than some others in this early series of Beverley's, though still not as good as Emily and the Dark Angel. Indeed, what I enjoyed most about this book were the opportunities to see Ver and Emily again, happily married and enjoying being together and with their friends. It was fascinating to see a much less cynical, but still non-conformist, Ver.<br />Amy is in some ways her own worst enemy. She's decided that she needs single-handedly to rescue her family from penury - so she controls their limited finances with an iron hand and when she decides to marry for money, she refuses to settle for Harry Crisp, despite the fact that he's comfortably off. Harry assumes that Amy is suffering under the unkind restrictions of her older sister Beryl - I don't think we ever see that misconception cleared up. <br />When Amy rejects Harry so cruelly, I was surprised that he was so willing to forgive her and continued to pursue her. But then, he obviously loved her.<br />Some interesting minor characters in this book: I was particularly taken by Clyta and the Duke, and would have liked to see a more definite resolution there.	2002-11-15

We discover early in the book that he's looking for a wife, and that he has some specific requirements. And then we also discover that he'd a vampire. <br />At a gambling den, he encounters Lord Farleigh and wins far more than Farleigh can afford to pay. Farleigh, in an attempt to get himself out of trouble, offers Nicholas his daughter Leonore. So Nicholas and Leonore become engaged. It's clear that Nicholas needs Leonore to help him in his quest to become human again, and that Leonore needs to marry him willingly. So he needs to court her. <br />Leonore, fed up with her father's gambling and the effect on her family, has become a governess. She isn't sure what to make of Nicholas, but agrees to marry him because he assures her that he will never force her, never be cruel to her. And, although she knows that this is a marriage of convenience, he pays her beautiful compliments, takes her to places her father never took her to, and his kisses make her swoon.<br />But, because he's so pale and because he tells her that he has an illness which makes him allergic to sunlight, she believes that he has a fatal illness and that he's dying. Can she allow herself to love a man she may only have for a short time? <br />This is a very intriguing take on Beauty and the Beast, which I did enjoy, although the introduction of the villainous female vampire was probably unnecessary. It's another unsual Regency from Karen Harbaugh, well-written as her books normally are, and while not the best Regency or vampire romance I've ever read, it's fascinating to see the two worlds combined so well.	2002-11-14

The premise of this book could have been interesting - younger son of duke falls in love with daughter of French emigres, with all the difficulties that create given the mutually exclusive cultures both come from. But instead it was simply tedious. Add to that the heroine's driving ambition to become a world-famous opera singer, which conveniently vanished once she decided that she was in love with the hero, and the characterisation wasn't very good either.<br />Richardson's knowledge of French revolutionary history is good, but she really needed to brush up on her names and titles. Apart from spelling the Duc de Berry as the Duc de Berri throughout (definitely not a French spelling!), she seems to think that Comte is the highest French title - above that of Duc. <br />This book went straight to the recycle pile!	2002-11-11
1352188:US	52631742	R2QBGF9IXI0M13	0373484585	297405260	At Twilight	Books	4	80	81	N	N	Great follow-up to Wings In The Night	At Twilight is a two-book collection, containing the short Beyond Twilight and the longer Born In Twilight - for some reason, the publisher has put them the wrong way around, which is irritating since it's clear that Born In Twilight follows the other story. These stories are sequels to the Wings In The Night collection, which introduces Maggie Shayne's cast of vampire characters.<br />We met Jameson Bryant, hero of Born In Twilight, first in Tamara's story, the first of the Wings In The Night books. Then, he was a twelve-year-old to whom Tamara was protector, and Roland rescued him from DPI, found his father and sent him safely away from DPI's reach. But even in San Diego and at the age of 30, Jameson isn't safe, though he enjoys the life he's made for himself. He supposes that one day he'll ask one of his friends to transform him, since he's Chosen and he won't live a long life anyway - but not yet. There's plenty of time. Reflecting on his life, he knows that he loves his vampire friends... but he wishes that they'd remember that he's not 12 any more. Although that's probably hard for vampires who never age - but at least they could stop calling him Jamey! Then he's captured by DPI again, made to suffer numerous tests, and Roland and Eric risk their lives to save him.<br />A young trainee nun, Angelica, on a forbidden trip outside the convent, is caught by a man who claims to know her. Before she can scream for help, he bites her neck... and within minutes she's a vampire too. Killing the one who made her, she runs off and hides, but days later is almost mad from hunger. A strange man comes to her, tells her kindly that he knows people who can help her. But as he tries to take her in his arms, all she can think of is feeding. It's a sensual experience, for both of them - but when it's over, Jameson Bryant lies dying on the ground.<br />When he wakes up, he's been transformed and is a vampire. But, as if that life-change isn't enough of a shock, he later learns that DPI has uses his semen to impregnate a fledgling female vampire. The child has been born - and DPI has it. So Jameson and Angelica - who is the mother - have to form an unwilling alliance to find their daughter before DPI can destroy her.<br />This is an excellent instalment in the series. Jameson and Angelica are drawn to each other despite their apparent mutual hatred, and their search for Amber Rose is very well drawn. It's good to see all the other vampire characters too. Well worth it!<br />Beyond Twilight is much shorter, and is the story of vampire Cuyler Jade and DPI agent Stephen (Ramsay) Bachman, who readers may remember from Damien and Shannon's story. Not for the first time, DPI has taken a member of the Chosen into its own ranks and used him as a vampire-magnet - now, Ramsay meets his own vampire protector, who is the very vampire he's been sent to capture. How can Cuyler protect herself from Ramsay when her very instinct is to protect *him*? <br />An entertaining story, too short, but with a very nice cameo appearance by Damien.	2002-11-04
1352516:US	52631742	R1T2JFFNZ8KSHL	0802711197	127307691	The Stolen Bride (A Regency Romance)	Books	3	9	9	N	N	Not Beverley's best, but readable	This book is ostensibly the story of Lady Sophie Kyle and her fiance Lord Randal Ashby. Sophie and Randal became engaged just after the drama which came at the end of Lord Wraybourne's Betrothed, and as I found Sophie and Randal more interesting than Jane and David, I wanted to read this book.<br />The first half of the book is far more about Beth Hawley, Jane's old governess, however. Beth is on her way to Steyne for the festivities leading to Sophie and Randal's wedding, when she meets up with Sir Marius Fletcher, another friend of David Wraybourne. He's a very big man, but unfailingly courteous, though with a good sense of humour. We sniff a secondary romance, and we'd be right.<br />On to Sophie and Randal, though, and for most of the book we only really see them through other characters' eyes. Something's wrong with what should be a blissful romance. Randal is avoiding Sophie, while she tries to flirt with him. She even tries to flirt with his friend Piers Verderan in order to make Randal jealous, but that only makes both men angry. Why is Randal so aloof? Why is Sophie so insecure? Why is Sophie wondering whether Randal was forced into proposing after he compromised her? Even though everyone around can see how much Randal loves Sophie, his behaviour is making her unhappy.<br />Into the mix here we then have anonymous threatening letters, and an attempt on the life of Randal's brother, where Randal himself seems to have been the intended victim. <br />The book was readable, but problematic. It was unclear whether it was meant to be about Sophie and Randal or Beth and Marius, and as such neither couple got adequate attention. The dramatic plot, although it tied into the events in Lord Wraybourne's Betrothed, was a distraction; it would have been much more interesting to see if Sophie and Randal could have sorted out their problems without this outside intervention. And, unusually for Beverley's work (or has she just got better?), the book was riddled with grammatical errors and typos, such as words missing or printed twice. <br />All in all, her longer novels are much better than these early regencies - although Piers Verderan's story, Emily and the Dark Angel, is really excellent. It's almost worth buying The Stolen Bride to find out more about his background and reputation, as we do here.	2002-11-04

Her dream is to make it as a scriptwriter, and she even has a fast-track route to success if she can produce a script, except she's no good at it. After six months, her screen is still blank... until she stumbles on a set of journals, written by a man called Dante, who lived 150 years ago and believed that he was a vampire. Reading the journals, Morgan finds herself transported into Dante's mind, and his life plays out for her in her head... and also on her computer screen. Five years later, she's written three vampire movies, all about Dante's life and based on the journals of what she assumes was a long-dead fantasist. <br />Meanwhile, in White Plains, Maxine Stuart, a conspiracy theorist, stumbled on the secrets of DPI the night their headquarters was destroyed (this book is a sequel to Shayne's earlier Born in Twilight). After a vampire strikes, killing a woman, Maxine makes the connection between a vampire called Dante whose details are on a CD-Rom she stole and the Dante of Morgan de Silva's films. She and her close friend Lou, a police officer, realise that they need to speak to Morgan, and set off to find her, not realising that they're already one step behind a rogue DPI agent, Frank Stiles.<br />Meanwhile, Dante is alive and well, and he's after Morgan to find out how she found out his secrets and why she betrayed him. Instead, though, he finds himself drawn to her - she is, after all, one of the Chosen, and she's dying...<br />Like other reviewers, I didn't enjoy this book as much as others in Shayne's series. Morgan was quite self-indulged and didn't have the same sparkiness as Shayne's other heroines - or even as Maxine, who I liked much better than Morgan. It feels to me as if Shayne liked Maxine more too. But it is Morgan, of course, to whom Dante is drawn. <br />The vampires in this book aren't as appealing as Shayne's previous characters - I really missed Eric et al. Dante is darker, more violent, hurting people in a way that Damien, Rhiannon, Roland, Jameson and the others would never have. And as for Sarafina, if we were supposed to feel any sympathy for her, it didn't work. The most interesting characters in Twilight Hunger were Maxine and Lou (and Lou is 18 years older than Maxine, not 20 as another reviewer said). The disappointing part of this sub-plot is that their story was left unfinished. <br />Shayne also seems to have changed some of her vampire `mythology' between earlier books and this; potential transformees' state of health was never an issue previously, for instance with Shannon or Ramsay. <br />And finally, the very convenient relationship between Morgan and Maxine - which was spoiled for me by several reviews here, especially since it isn't explained until close to the end of the book - was really too coincidental to believe. It wasn't even necessary to the book and would have been better left out.<br />All in all, far from the best of Shayne's series, and in some ways hardly feels like part of the series, but worth reading if you're a fan of the series as a whole. Three stars for Maxine and Lou; really only two for Dante and Morgan.	2002-11-03

It's an interesting concept, and one which should, in theory, make the stories appear less as unconnected vignettes and more as 'chapters' in one longer story. But in practice, The Grand Hotel didn't turn out that way. It's something which could have been achieved quite easily, had the authors been given a plot thread which would weave throughout the individual stories and be resolved in the final one. As it was, the stories were very much stand-alone, with only brief references to common characters.<br />Carla Kelly's The Background Man is probably the best of the bunch, which is hardly surprising. Charles Mortimer, the assistant manager, is rarely noticed, because of his ability to blend into the background. However, substituting for his superior, he comes to the notice of Miss Carrington, a somewhat unusual guest. He falls in love with her immediately, and barely dares to hope that she will return his feelings. She does... but she's hiding a secret from him. Will this destroy any chance for them? My problem with The Background Man was mainly that it was too short, a common problem with anthology stories. The relationship really didn't have enough time to develop, and I wanted to see more of Charles and Millie together.<br />In Elisabeth Fairchild's Love Will Find A Way, Lieutenant James Forrester is about to meet, for the first time, the widow of his late commanding officer. Yet he feels as if he's known Annabelle Grant all his life. (Incidentally, Annabelle is a widow. Why does Fairchild refer to her as 'Miss'?). James, we see, had to read all her letters to Archie, her late husbamd, and once Archie was too ill to respond on his own, James wrote to her. He fell in love with her from her letters. Now, he has a few days only to get to know her and persuade her to consider marrying him. This is an interesting idea, and a nice, gentle love story - but again rushed by the pressures of coming in at under 65 pages. <br />Anne Barbour's The Castaway is the most disappointing, given Barbour's undoubted talent. A woman called Martha Finch arrives at the hotel to keep an appointment with Lord Branford, acting on behalf of the Marquess of Canby, the man whose granddaughter she claims to be. The reader is shown very soon that Martha is lying about her claim, and Barbour does not give her particularly sympathetic motives. I was hoping throughout that she would be exposed and that Branford, the hero, would reject her. Her lie is, of course, found out, but a far too convenient solution then emerges. This is one heroine I did *not* want to see end up with the hero.<br />Next, we have Barbara Metzger's The Management Requests. Captain Arthur Hunter (who should, in fact, be Captain Viscount Huntingdon, if Metzger paid proper attention to protocol) needs a room on the ground floor because of an injury. None is available, so he persuades the manager to let him have the room behind the reception desk. Because of this, a guest - Hope Thurstfield - mistakes him for the manager, a misapprehension Arthur chooses not to correct. (Why?) The secondary characters in this vignette almost drove me crazy, and I didn't especially care for Hope. Another miss.<br />And finally, we have Allison Lane's Promises to Keep. Maggie Adams has arrived from America to try to make peace with her father's family, from whom he was estranged after eloping with her mother. She bumps into a Marcus Widner at the hotel, who just happens to be related to her mother's family and who offers to help her in her quest - but who warns her off making immediate contact with her father's family. Lane lives up to her usual standards here by inventing the usual crop of one-dimensional villains, completely unbelievable in their audacity and villainry. I liked Marcus, but that's about all I can say for this story.<br />All in all, not worth the new purchase price, unless you're desperate to complete a Carla Kelly collection. My copy is going to the next charity shop collection.	2002-10-21

Well, if you're Delilah Bening, now Viscountess Dragoner, you set about repairing your husband's fortunes by using your business acumen and your father's contacts to do so. You write to your husband and let him know what you're doing, and if he doesn't reply, well, you simply assume that he doesn't object.<br />And what if he turns up after six years, still handsome, still unattainable, and informs you that he wants a divorce and nothing further to do with you? Well, if you're in love with him, as Delilah always has been, you first of all show him the impossibility of a divorce under English law (and well done, Kerstan, for getting that right! I'm fed up with writers in this period who assume that it's easy!), and then you try to show him that despite the past he'd be welcome in your life.<br />Finding himself almost killed with kindness on his attempt to rid his wife of himself, Dragoner flees back to France, where his reputation has sunk so low that it cannot be retrieved, it seems. After all, he got captured during the war and, apparently, switched sides and has been working with the French. And this is one of several reasons why he thinks that Delilah would be better off without him. He's got the reputation of being a traitor, and once that news filters back to England no-one will want to be associated with anyone connected to him.<br />Of course, he isn't a traitor, as we find out very early in the book, but he's not in a position to tell anyone the truth. But Dragoner has other reasons for believing himself unworthy of Delilah, as he keeps telling her he is. His family background and his actions during the war (unfaithful to her many times) are also part of it. So he keeps her at a distance, especially when she follows him to France and tries to become the kind of woman she thinks he might want. He fends her off with sarcasm and Shakespearean quotations, and when that doesn't work, he tells her bluntly that he is a traitor. <br />How Delilah and Dragoner move from this state of estrangement to repair their marriage is told amidst a background of the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars, danger and espionage. It's very well done; Kerstan's careful research is evident. What stops this book getting five stars from me, though, is that I'd have liked a little more 'tell' as well as 'show'. While it became clear by his reactions to her that Dragoner was beginning to fall in love with his wife, I would have liked to see more of his thought processes, especially in the second half of the book.<br />But I certainly enjoyed Lord Dragoner's Wife enough to take a look at other titles by Kerstan.	2002-10-15

So when he is held up and kidnapped by a highwayman, he is diverted and amused rather than angry or afraid. He's even more amused when a closer look reveals his highwayman to be a *woman*!<br />Lady Chastity Ware is on the run - mainly from her cruel and malicious father, the Earl of Walgrave, but also from members of the censorious Ton who have condemned her as a whore after her father set her up so that she was found naked in bed with the man Walgrave wanted her to marry. Because of what happened, she is now the Notorious Chastity Ware, unfit for polite society. She is trying to help her sister Verity, on the run from a man who, in collusion with Walgrave, threatens the life of Verity's son. <br />Chastity intends to steal her prisoner's carriage in order to get Verity to her destination, but Cyn has other ideas. He insists on coming along and joining Chastity on her journey, but he fails to explain to her that he is well aware of her masquerade. This leads to a number of hilarious scenes in which Cyn takes advantage of Chastity's ignorance of what he knows - for instance, why should one man be shy of getting changed in front of another? <br />Along the way, the relationship between Cyn and Chastity changes, such that Chastity comes to trust Cyn and actually looks to him for guidance instead of assuming that she is in charge. In particular, she needs his help when her father finally catches up with them. But even though they fall in love, she's still the Notorious Chastity Ware, branded a whore... how can they ever be together?<br />As a stand-alone, this is an entertaining romp, albeit a little bawdy and tacky in places. As an introduction to the Malloren series, it's unmissable: the first glimpse of Rothgar as he strolls into an orgy and announces that \\"Your fate has arrived\\", for instance, is well worth the purchase price. We also meet Chastity's brother Fort, hero of Something Wicked - this book is essential to understand Fort's background.<br />Highly recommended, even if it's not the best of the Malloren series!	2002-09-24

But Balogh's done it, and more than once too. The Secret Pearl opens with Adam, Duke of Raybourne, emerging from the Drury Lane Theatre, parting from his friends, and seeing a sad-looking prostitute standing in the shadows. Something makes him approach her; despite the fact that she isn't throwing out any lures to him at all, he hires her. And, despite the fact that sleeping with prostitutes isn't something he makes a habit of, he takes her to a room in a run-down inn to use her.<br />This, we find, is Fleur's first night as a prostitute; having gone two days without food and unable to get a job, she has decided to sell the only remaining asset she has: herself. Her client, though, makes the experience almost as bad as it could possibly be: he is clinical and direct about what he wants, and - not knowing that Fleur is a virgin - he hurts her. <br />Afterwards, Adam does feel some guilt, and he feeds Fleur as well as giving her three times as much money as she asked for. And then he sends his secretary to ensure that she is offered a job - as governess to his daughter. His motives, he assumes, are simply philanthropic: he hates the thought of a gentlewoman down on her luck having to survive on the streets, and he feels guilty for not having realised before it was too late that she wasn't accustomed to her trade.<br />So Fleur takes up residence in the Duke of Raybourne's estate, delighted to have found a refuge both from her life in London and from the horrors from which she ran in the first place. Until the Duke of Raybourne comes home, and she discovers that he is the same man who fills her nightmares, the man who hurt her, the man who, in her dreams, rapes her nightly. Andyet, as the days go by, he is also the man who comforts her, who protects her and who offers her a safe refuge.<br />And there are many more complications in what is already a complex story: Adam, of course, is married, and he is an honourable man who will not betray his marriage vows, despite his lapse in London - the only time he has ever been unfaithful. And Fleur is running from a murder charge. And her tormentor is even closer than she imagines. <br />Balogh creates a wonderful, believable portrait of what seems to be an impossible relationship. Adam, appallingly scarred both internally and externally as a result of Waterloo plus private torments, and who was cruelly rough with Fleur when he hired her as a prostitute, does not seem to be the ideal romantic hero - and yet he is, in every way. Fleur, a possible murderer, a prostitute, does not seem to be the ideal heroine, either - and yet she isn't at all what she seems, although she did certainly sell herself on the streets. But how is it possible that she could fall in love with the man who haunts her nightmares? How could a decent, married man fall in love with another woman? But Balogh pulls it off so convincingly that I could barely put the book down.<br />The Secret Pearl is a classic which will have you reading breathlessly, eager to find out what happens next. It's poignant, heartwrenching and utterly romantic, and it's a classic. I can't for the life of me imagine why Balogh's current publisher hasn't tried to reissue this; it would be yet another best-seller for her. As it is, the best you can do is to buy it second-hand, if you can get hold of it - and that's not easy, because those of us who do have it will NOT let go of it!	2002-08-26

Wish the heroine had been less deceitful	Mary Balogh makes a habit of giving her readers 'different' heroines or heroes, and situations which are somewhat out of the ordinary: just read Heartless, A Secret Pearl, Indiscreet, More Than A Mistress and many more. In Secrets of the Heart, her hero and heroine are divorced from each other. Divorce, of course, was very rare in the Regency period; a man could only sue for divorce (and only via the House of Lords, no less) if his wife was mentally incompetent or unfaithful.<br />Sarah was not a virgin when she married George, the Duke of Cranwell. As we find out very soon, she was raped repeatedly as a teenager by her cousin, who also blackmailed her into keeping it a secret. Once he realised that she wasn't the virgin bride he'd been expecting, Cranwell had walked out on her. <br />We meet them four years later, when they run into each other in Bath - Sarah has finally been persuaded to return to society, in a limited way, under a different name. Cranwell is horrified to see that his sister and his (new) fiancee actually like this woman whom he perceives as little better than a whore, and he would love to shun her... but he finds that he can't.<br />While I very much sympathised with Sarah in relation to her past and the beginning of her marriage, what I really didn't like about this book was that when she was given an opportunity to mend fences with Cranwell by telling the truth, she not only failed to take it, but she deliberately made matters worse by pretending to be sluttish. And she does this several times. There comes a point when, even in the most painful of situations, people have to take some responsibility for their misfortune. In this book, Sarah failed to do so, and by around halfway through it, I found myself in full sympathy with Cranwell and deciding that she didn't deserve him. And despite the happy ending, which Balogh is so good at, I don't by any means consider this to be one of her best.	2002-08-26

Rebecca Shaw, schoolteacher daughter of the late vicar, is engaged to be married to the current vicar, Philip Everett. It's a passionless relationship of friends who respect and like each other; it will be a marriage in which each does their duty to each other and to the parish. However, what Philip doesn't know is that Rebecca was once engaged to Christopher Sinclair, who, now widowed, is returning to the village...<br />Seven years ago, Becky and Christopher had been crazily in love. Until he broke her heart when he came to tell her that he'd met a wealthy woman in London and he was engaged to marry her. He dumped Becky and married for money. And she'd never seen him since.<br />Now, though, he's back. And she's running into him at every turn - in the village, at the school, in her home. And it's very hard to ignore him, so she has to be civil to him even though she loathes him. And Christopher himself doesn't make it easy; he talks to her, engages her in conversation, and even suggests that he still cares about her.<br />And when he apologises for abandoning her, and even kisses her, one day after escorting her home, she doesn't know how to react. Quite apart from the fact that she's engaged to someone else, how could she ever forgive him for the way he behaved to her? How could she forget that he was a fortune-hunter, and that if he broke his promise to her once he could do it again?<br />She is also hearing stories about Christopher's behaviour towards his wife which are not to his credit at all, which makes her opinion of him tumble still lower. And yet his behaviour since returning, combined with her knowledge of him before he'd jilted her, is completely at odds with these rumours about him. What can she believe? And does any of it matter anyway, since she's going to marry Philip?<br />This is a book with a cast of secondary characters to match Jane Austen, and there are plenty of very delightful sub-plots, secondary romances and entertaining figures. The will-they-won't-they plot between Becky and Christopher takes us almost to the final page, and it's worth every second of the read. Balogh does separated lovers and angst very well indeed.	2002-08-11

The following morning, she wanders into the stables and finds what one would normally expect to find in the family stables: a vagrant asleep, close to unconsciousness. So she brings the man into the house and introduces him as her fiance.<br />Oliver Sherrard, the 'vagrant', is actually the younger brother of an earl. Feeling stifled by his position as scion of the aristocracy, he takes off on a walking tour of the country, dressed in rough clothes and only 30 golden guineas in his pocket. As we could have predicted, he is relieved of his wealth - and his boots as well - and left for dead within 24 hours of leaving home, and this is why he has taken shelter in the stables. He goes along with Moira's plan because... well, because it suited Ms Mansfield for him to do so, but whatever his rationale was for doing so was not something she chose to share with her readers.<br />So the man everyone assumes is a penniless common vagrant is invited into a viscount's home and treated as an honoured guest and the potential fiance of the daughter of the house. Ummm... why? But this is merely one of the many elements of the story which left me puzzled and frowning in disbelief.<br />First, just why does no-one (well, except for Horatio, who for some reason decides to say nothing to anyone) even suspect that Oliver is not what he pretends? People notice that his accent is cultured, quite like that of a gentleman. Moira and her sisters and brothers-in-law are around members of the working class all the time - house servants, grooms, gardeners, people in the village - so would it not occur to them that their accents and modes of speech are completely different? Oliver may have been wearing rough clothing, true, but his hair will have been elegantly styled and well cut. His nails will have been well looked after. His hands will not be roughand full of callouses, all signs that he couldn't possibly be a vagrant or common labourer. <br />And the biggest clue of the lot is when Oliver asks for something to read, and goes on to display his familiarity with contemporary novels. Now, what common labourer, or even any member of the working class, could even afford to buy or borrow books, always assuming that they could read in the first place? And if they did, would they read novels? At the time, novels were very definitely regarded as a luxury. <br />If, after all that, Moira still believed him to be a penniless vagrant, she's even stupider than she appeared to be at the start of the book. <br />There is also a scene involving some elements of violence on Oliver's part towards Moira, which I found off-putting. In all, not a book I would be interested in re-reading.	2002-08-07

Allegra Proctor, impoverished but very well-educated widow, applies for the job of tutor to the teenage son of the Earl of Wrexham. Max, the son, offers her the job without his father's knowledge, and by the time Allegra arrives at Stormaway, their Yorkshire estate, it's too late for Wrexham to return her to London immediately. So he grudgingly allows her to stay on temporarily until he can find a replacement, and in the meantime orders her to stay out of his way. <br />However, it's not long before Max discovers that his new tutor has another agenda in mind: she's out for revenge on a neighbour of theirs for a wrong he did her family. And soon Max is helping her break and enter the villain's home. And Wrexham, following them, is forced to help them escape.<br />Convinced that a wrong has been done to Allegra, Wrexham agrees to help her. But that means spending more time with her, and even getting to see a side of her he hadn't expected - and showing her that he's not such a toplofty, arrogant aristocrat as she thought, either. And suddenly two people who had assumed that they would never marry again find themselves reassessing their priorities...<br />This is a delightful romance, of a very high quality. The characters are appealing - especially the fifteen-year-old Max - and Allegra and Wrexham make a lovely couple. A few minor nitpicks: I find it hard to believe that a woman could have been taken seriously as a gentleman's tutor even for a second, but I let myself ignore that as I got sucked into the story. Second, when Allegra was pretending to be Wrexham's distant cousin and they started using first names, I felt that they were more likely to remain formal with each other. Certainly, she would have called him Wrexham, not Leo, if she was avoiding 'my lord'.<br />That aside, this is a keeper :)	2002-08-06

[...]Aidan is a 200-year-old vampire who hates what he is - well, similar theme to all of Amanda Ashley's books so far, but Forever And The Night had the saving grace of not being Gothic, it seemed. But I couldn't come to like Aidan, because he was incredibly selfish and self-obsessed. For example, his friend Valerian, whom I did like, risked his own life on several occasions to save Aidan from the consequences of his own stupidity, and how does Aidan repay him? He refuses even to acknowledge that Valerian is a friend. He's extremely ungrateful and rejects all overtures of friendship and good advice.<br />Aidan doesn't want to be a vampire any more. He tells Valerian and Maeve that he can't see a single good thing about his vampiric state. I wanted to scream at him and tell him to wake up and stop lying to himself! Because of his vampire powers, and only because of those powers, he saved Neely's life several times. If he hadn't been a vampire, Neely would have been killed in chapter 3 of the book - end of story. He can travel through time and space, exercise mind control, has incredible strength: because of these things, Neely stayed alive. And Aidan claims that there's nothing good about being a vampire??<br />And then there's Neely - the ultimate thick-as-a-brick heroine. Other reviews have already commented on her behaviour. One thing to add: in the course of the book, she meets three vampires - Aidan, Valerian and Maeve - all of whom are kind to her and take steps to help her. And yet she's still terrified of all vampires?? <br />And where's the romance? Aidan and Neely spend far more time apart than together, and much of the togetherness is in any case mental rather than physical. Aidan claims that he loves Neely and that he wants to protect her, both from the drug dealers and from rogue vampires - so what does he do? He leaves her alone and heads off on his crazy quest to become human again. He spends most of the book on that quest, which I found simply boring. <br />I can't say that I'm interested in reading any more of this series. As the other reviewer said, I too was looking for a vampire *romance* - not a horror novel. I don't read horror. But there was most definitely very little romance in Forever And The Night, and the vampire hero was tedious, to say the least. I just wish that Maggie Shayne would write more vampire romances!	2002-08-03

It's a good opening scene, and there's some sparky dialogue and even a tiny bit of sexual tension. And then... it gets boring.<br />Katherine is secretly engaged, but her fiance, Cyril Cullman, wants to escape from the entanglement. (He knows her father will never agree. Why not use that as his escape-route?). So he inveigles Lord Benjamin into a wager, the forfeit being that Benjamin must betrothe himself to Katherine. (Why doesn't Benjamin refuse to accept the wager and tell Katherine's father everything? Especially since he tells her father everything anyway!).<br />So Benjamin takes the wager and deliberately loses, giving up the last £500 he has in the world. (Why has he just bought a race-horse if he's that broke? How on earth is he paying stabling and feed fees, let alone wages for trainer and jockey?). And so he becomes engaged to Katherine - whose acceptance of the temporary betrothal makes no sense to me, nor does her very quick guess that Cyril is somewhere behind it. The 'clue' she's given doesn't seem to suggest that at all. <br />Desjardien's nicknames for her characters are also something of a turn-off - Cullman as the 'First Beau'? Katherine as 'The Repository'? And quite why the impoverished nobody son of a knight should have become such a desirable person in Society is never explained, and is quite unbelievable. Even Benjamin's own disgrace isn't that believable in the circumstances. He's the brother of a Marquess, and his family has not disowned him. Powerful people could usually rescue the reputations of their family members, at least publicly; would less exalted members of the Ton really dare to give the cut direct to a Marquess's brother?<br />I'm not inclined to seek out any more by Desjardien.	2002-08-01

If I wanted to read Georgette Heyer's wonderful These Old Shades, I'd go and read the original, not this pale imitation.

He subsequently discovers that Leon is in fact Leonie, a girl in disguise, and there is a mystery as to Leonie's identity. There is, of course - knowing Heyer - a very sweet romance as well as a well-plotted mystery story.<br />Sound familiar at all? Have other reviewers not read Heyer's book? My recommendation: forget about Love's Charade and go and read These Old Shades. You won't regret it!	2002-07-29

This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. From some writers I would expect to read something as bad as this; when it's from a writer of the (one-time) calibre of Patricia Oliver, it's immensely disappointing. What makes it even worse for me is that this book is linked to her Seven Corinthians series; Alex Hethercott, the hero, is one of the brothers of Robert, Marquess of Gresham, of Lord Gresham's Lady, and characters from at least two previous books appear in this.<br />Daphne is quite the most silly and childish heroine it's ever been my misfortune to encounter. She's twenty-five, and yet still lives in a childish fantasy world in which the real world doesn't exist. She believes that all men are monsters simply aiming to destroy her. Yet, if she believes that, why even get to know Lord Alex?<br />The plot did nothing for me, but it wasn't even redeemed by sympathetic characters. Most of the book is written from Daphne's point of view, and we get to see her entries in the eponymous diary. However, that only confirms in my mind how unsympathetic a character Daphne is; throughout the book, I wanted to tell her to grow up and stop being so self-indulgent. <br />And what happened to Oliver's lovely writing style? This book is full of what can only be described as purple prose. Furthermore, I was amazed to see several grammatical errors creeping in; could it be that Oliver has a new editor who simply isn't as diligent as his/her predecessor?<br />I simply can't recommend that anyone buy this book. If you really want to catch up with other members of the Hethercott family, borrow it, as I did. You won't want to re-read it - for me, it was all I could do to finish it.	2002-07-29

Rosalind Dacey, the latter of Raymore's wards, walks with a distinct limp as the result of a childhood accident; to Raymore's dismay, this makes her less marriageable as a result.<br />Raymore and Rosalind strike sparks off each other from the moment they meet. He wants to marry her off as soon as he can; she wants to be allowed to retire to the country and remain unmarried, thus escaping the humiliation of being found wanting by Society. He's an autocrat who dislikes women intensely, and so he expects her to obey his every order. She resents being ordered around and defies him openly on several occasions.<br />And yet on one occasion when she goes too far and he tells her off in his study, temper turns to irrestible attraction and he kisses her senseless. <br />However, someone does apparently find Rosalind attractive enough to want to marry her. But why does Raymore resent her engagement so much? Why does he seem to want to prove that her fiance isn't good enough for her? Can he simply put her out of his mind - and can she put him out of hers?<br />This is an enjoyable romance, but at times it does become obvious that it's one of Balogh's earlier works. There is rather too much informality between characters, which wouldn't have happened and which isn't Balogh's style in her later work. She also gets a title wrong; Raymore's unmarried cousin is several times addressed as Lady Marsh instead of Lady Sylvia, the latter being an earl's daughter and the former the wife of Lord Marsh. <br />Raymore's development from a misogynistic, autocratic boor to a sensitive and caring lover was not very well developed either. He went from doubting Rosalind's virtue as a result of the kiss she shared with him to (apparently) assuming that she had to be completely virtuous after all, with no real articulation of this change in his attitude.<br />All in all, while I enjoyed this book, I'd rather re-read another Balogh, such as A Certain Magic or Tempting Harriet.	2002-07-10

Swept from her hospital bed to a grand gentleman's house and given every luxury she could want, she wonders why the house's owner, Lord Allesandro de Avallone (Lord Allesandro or Lord Avallone? Ashley seems to think that these titles are the same, though they are not) has given her all this. And why Allesandro avoids her, seeing her only for a few minutes at night and is never around during the day.<br />And then one night when she's caught in the forest in a rainstorm, she stumbles on his secret lair, finding him close to death after an attack from another vampire. Without giving her any indication of what's going on, he feeds from her in order to live. And from then on, she knows that he is a vampire.<br />And from then on, this book is pretty much like A Darker Dream, though with the addition of an evil vampire villain and a housekeeper instead of a butler who knows Allesandro's secret. The housekeeper is in love with him - a rival for Analisa? Well, not really, though Ashley tries to make it appear so at one point. But other elements are indeed the same: the vast luxuries, Allesandro's frequent attempts to send Analisa away or to abandon her himself, his frequent attacks of conscience when he is driven by the need to feed on her, his demand that she at least once stay by his side when he sleeps during the day, and so on.<br />Well, Ashley writes Gothic vampire novels, so it shouldn't really be surprising that there are similarities - though even still, neither this nor A Darker Dream match up to Embrace The Night. I would like to see a novel from Ashley in which the heroine is *not* a naive, innocent and poverty-stricken seventeen-year-old, and in which the gulf between hero and heroine is not exacerbated by his wealth, his intelligence and education and familiarity with the ways of high society. Her heroes do begin to run the risk of appearing like paedophiles.<br />Finally, this book, we are told, is set in late Victorian times - probably around the 1880s, though this isn't specified. And yet the 'feel' is very much of the Regency period: around the 1800s. The balls, masquerades and Society rules are very much of the Regency (though, Ashley, it was no more than two dances, not three). The period in which this book is set was of the Industrial Revolution: where is the sense that this is a time of new, life-changing inventions? Where are the gas lights that all wealthy people had in their homes by this time, and which were installed in the streets in the posh parts of London? Rail travel was also in its heyday, and the rich rarely travelled by horse-drawn carriage any more. Ashley needs to do a little more research on her period, instead of assuming that 'one size fits all' when it comes to historical England.	2002-07-08

In MTAM, Ferdinand was portrayed as a loyal, somewhat timid and frequently hapless young man whose lack of ducal title wasn't the only thing he was missing in contrast to his brother.<br />Having won a country estate in a card game, Ferdinand sets out to view Pinewood. However, to his shock he finds it already occupied, and by a young-ish (ie mid-20s) single lady, Miss Viola Thornhill, who claims that it is her own, that she was left it as a bequest by the father of the current Earl of Bamber, from whom Ferdinand won it. Since neither is prepared to yield, we have stalemate. In order to try to force her to leave, though, Ferdinand insists on moving in. <br />Viola responds by massing the staff and the local inhabitants to make Ferdinand's life miserable: cold meals, smoking chimneys, inhospitable local pubs and so on. But Ferdinand is a charming man with not much in the way of aristocratic hauteur, and he quickly begins to win people over... everyone except Viola, although she can't forget the memory of their kiss.<br />And then Tresham arrives and recognises Viola from her infamous life in London, a life she's been trying to escape for the past two years. The revelations here change Viola and Ferdinand's relationship completely.<br />I've been looking forward to this book for a year, since I read More Than A Mistress, which is quite possibly the best long Regency Mary Balogh has ever written. Unfortunately, for me, No Man's Mistress doesn't live up to the promise. I suppose it was starting from a disadvantage in the first place, as Ferdinand is no Tresham, although I did like Ferdinand a lot.<br />Part of the problem is that I simply cannot believe in the rehabilitation of 'Lilian Talbot'. It's not that I can't believe that Viola could reform - since she'd never wanted that life in the first place, this isn't a problem at all. I justcannot suspend disbelief so far as to accept that the ton, as prudish as they were during Regency times, would accept into their midst a woman who had been a notorious courtesan. Even though Viola was accepted by the powerful and influential Duke of Tresham, I cannot see that as being enough. <br />What I liked most about this book, though, was renewing my acquaintance with Jocelyn and Jane from More Than A Mistress; and also getting to know Angeline, the female Dudley sibling. At some time in the not too distant future, Balogh intends to write the story of Angeline and Hayward, her husband, as a prequel to the Mistress books; I'll look forward to that one and hope that it's better than No Man's Mistress.	2002-07-07

This collection houses the first three of her Twilight series: Phantasies, Memories and Illusions. Brief reviews of each first.<br />Twilight Phantasies: This story introduces Eric Marquand, transformed into a vampire just before his date with Madame Guillotine during the French Revolution. He's something of a scientist, and loves working on things to make the life of a vampire easier. He also understands all about the Belladonna anitgen, which the Chosen carry. He has, for years, been linked mentally to Tamara, one of the Chosen, who has been brought up by a DPI operative (DPI being a branch of the FBI set up to hunt down and kill vampires). But Tamara and Eric are irrestibly drawn to each other, despite all the reasons why they shouldn't be together... Can Tamara accept what Eric is? Can she escape the clutches of the DPI to be with him? A gripping and at times heartwrenching story.<br />In Twilight Memories the story focuses on Roland, Eric's friend, and another vampire, Rhiannon - who is, in fact, the vampire who transformed Roland. Rhiannon has been in love with Roland for centuries, but he never seems to return her interest. He disapproves of her wild, uncontrollable behaviour, which frequently puts her in danger. Rhiannon believes that Roland disapproves of *her*, and her behaviour is mainly aimed at making him notice her. But Roland has sworn never to love again, because of a tragedy in his past. Can Rhiannon get through to him? Can he see the pain his attitude is causing her? Eric and Tamara reappear in this story, along with a familiar DPI agent.<br />Finally, there is Twilight Illusions, my favourite of the trilogy. Damien, the oldest known vampire, has not made a habit of associating with others of his kind, and as a result he knows nothing of the Chosen. He performs as an illusionist, using his powers to entertain and to select women from whom he can feed - he hypnotises them into believing that they were only dreaming. However, someone is killing off women he's been with... and Shannon is on his trail. What she doesn't realise is that she's one of the Chosen, and Damien is her mentor. Eric Marquand makes a welcome reappearance in this book, helping Damien to come to terms with himself and what he is. Shannon, however, is seriously ill, and before she's even come to terms with her discovery that Damien is a vampire, she has another attack and is close to death. Can Damien save her? And is the price he - and she - would have to pay if he did so worth it?<br />I enjoyed the trilogy very much, although I have to say that the DPI does get old very fast; it's a major part of the plot in all three stories, and I understand in Shayne's other Twilight books. I'm far more interested in the romances than in seeing the characters have to fend off quasi-FBI agents. That aside, Shayne's writing is good and her plots and characterisation very enjoyable. She's written characters which stayed in my mind for some time after I finished the book, and it's on my 'to read again' shelf.	2002-07-01

Seeing the local gentry eyeing Rhianna up and planning to have her in their beds, he intervenes and buys her. But we soon discover that he has no intention of sleeping with her - he only wants to creep into her bedroom at dead of night and drink from her, hypnotising her so that she thinks she's dreaming.<br />Rhianna and Rayven are drawn to each other, much as he tries to keep away from her and make her stay away from him. In the end, afraid that he will eventually hurt or kill her because his need for her seems to increase over time, he sends her away to Paris for three years. But when she comes back, she's determined to seek him out again and she gets his agreement to let her live with him for a year. <br />And then she discovers that he's really a vampire... and her love for him mingles with fear.<br />I ...agree ... that this book has problems. The angst on its own didn't bother me, although it was repetitive; every time we thought that Rayven had got over his 'I'm going to kill her if I don't let her go' fears, they resurged again, almost to a ludicrous level at one point in which Rayven almost kills himself. The period atmosphere wasn't right either; the characters did not behave like nineteenth-centuey English people, nor did they speak in a manner commensurate with the period. Dallon Montroy in particular (and what kind of a name is that for an English nobleman?!) did not fit at all with the period.<br />What bothered me, too, was the part of the book where Rayven takes Rhianna to London for several weeks. They stay in a hotel - but where does Rayven spend the days? He's supposed to need complete darkness and privacy, and yet he'd never get that in a hotel-room. Yet there's no mention of how that is handled.<br />... the absurd and very convenient plot device at the end was almost an insult to the readers' intelligence. Ashley could have done much better than that!<br />Having said that, parts of the book were very enjoyable and kept me reading, so on balance perhaps 2.5 stars really.	2002-07-01

As a result of re-reading them in this collection I have now ordered her Bar Cynster series; I can only hope that it's as good as these and that she hasn't fallen into the trap of sacrificing sex scenes for historical accuracy.<br />The collection concerns three members of the same family: the Lesters, who have fallen on hard times. Jack, the oldest and heir to the estates, Harry, and their sister Lenore. <br />My favourite of the three is The Reasons For Marriage, in which Lenore finds herself the choice of Jason, Duke of Eversleigh. She can't imagine why he's sought her out and wants to marry her, but to Jason it's simple: she isn't a silly debutante, and she understands the demands of running an estate and a large house. She's not interested in spending months on end in London either, so he thinks he can leave her in Eversleigh Abbey while he enjoys himself elsewhere. Lenore agrees eventually, and assumes that there is no chance of love in a marriage like this in which Jason has made his reasons for wanting her so clear. But during an idyllic honeymoon, she begins to hope that perhaps his feelings have changed... And so does Jason, but he lacks the courage to put his feelings into words. <br />There is some wonderful angst in this book, made even better by the very satisfying lead-up to the ending. I loved it!<br />Then there's A Lady of Expectations, Jack's story. Jack is no longer poor, but as yet the secret isn't out. He wants to find a bride before all the marriage-minded mamas find out about his new-found fortune and descend on him with predatory intent. One day, out riding in the country, he spies a beautiful young woman with golden hair, and determines to make her his. Sophie is attracted to him too, but her guardian makes it plain to Jack that he is not to rush her. She is to have her Season first, before he ties her down. Sophie, however, believes that the reason he is holding back is that he desperately needs to marry money, and she has none. Some misunderstandings, lots of romance and a degree of sensual tension, and lots of traditional Regency atmosphere - lovely!<br />Finally, there is Harry's story, An Unwilling Conquest. Harry, having watched Jack walk willingly into matrimony, is determined to stay well away from eligible young women and their matchmaking mamas. So he heads off to Newmarket, only to find himself rescuing a couple of damsels in distress. Lucinda, a beautiful young widow, arouses his protective instincts, and he finds himself, very reluctantly, offering his services to her in the conduct of her business. In fact, not only offering, but insisting! And he can't help finding himself irrestibly attracted to her. Perhaps a discreet affair will do? But then he discovers that he's actually taken her virginity. When he offers to marry her purely as recompense, however, Lucinda rejects him out of anger and hurt. She loves him, but will he ever come to love her in return?<br />A great Laurens anthology, which is well worth acquiring.	2002-06-30

Drunk and disbelieving, Grace performs the ritual... and Julian appears in front of her. As large as life, and very, very naked. And ready for action, in whatever way Grace wants him!<br />Grace, however, isn't a believer in casual sex; her only previous experience was with a man who hurt her very much and then made fun of her publicly afterwards. She's not, therefore, about to jump into bed with a perfect stranger, no matter how attractive he is or how sexily he talks to her. Julian, on the other hand, is compelled to want her as a result of the curse which put him inside the book, and he also recognises that she needs someone to teach her to enjoy sex. And he's determined to do just that!<br />I thought at this point that the book was going to be a pure romp. But in fact it ended up being very much deeper. Julian is a tortured soul; he had a loveless life before being cursed, and ever since he's been treated abusively by the women who summoned him, in some cases chained to their beds, never allowed anywhere except their bedrooms, and frequently having to plead for food as a reward for sex. To them, he was a body, not a man.<br />Grace is determined to treat him better than that; he is determined to help her overcome her distrust of men. But even if both manage to achieve their objectives, there is still the hard fact that at the next full moon Julian will disappear back into the book, to be trapped there until the next time someone summons him. Can they treat this as a short-lived relationship? Or is there a way to break the curse?<br />The book's poignant as well as funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed it - enough to keep an eye out for the second inthe series.	2002-06-30

Alice Penhallow has known Piers Westhaven almost all her life. They were children together: she, Webster Penhallow and Piers. At seventeen, she married Web, and not long after Piers himself married. But Piers' wife died in childbirth, and Allie herself is now widowed.<br />In London to visit her family, she meets Piers again and he confides in her that he has decided to remarry. He has his eye on several young debutantes, and Allie despairs because he's making the same mistake as he did the first time: thinking of marrying a young featherhead he has nothing in common with. Piers jokes at one point that he should marry Allie, but before she can give any kind of embarrassed reply he assures her that he didn't mean it; he tells himself that he wouldn't degrade her like that.<br />This is one of the earliest clues that Piers and Allie's feelings for each other are not as straightforward as we're led to believe. And soon it's confirmed: she's been in love with him since she was fourteen, and he fell in love with her a year later. But she thought that he would never look twice at her, and he thought that he was too wild and unconventional for her. And anyway, his best friend was also in love with her, so Piers let Web court her instead. And now they're both so used to hiding their real feelings that neither realises the truth.<br />Piers, having been amusing himself with a young and apparently shy debutante, suddenly discovers one night that he'd been suckered well and truly: baited and hooked and reeled in on a trap which could have been set by a professional. He has compromised Cassandra Borden, and will have to propose marriage to her. Shocked, horrified and very sad, he finds himself outside Allie's house late at night. She sees him and invites him in; he confesses what happened and, in a very poignant scene, they recognise that they have to say goodbye. Once he's married, their friendship cannot continue.<br />But a hug goodbye turns into something more, and suddenly Piers is in Allie's bed, and they are both discovering lovemaking as neither has ever known before...<br />In the morning, though, nothing has changed. Piers still has to marry Cassandra, and Allie leaves for Bath; they manage to persuade each other that it meant nothing more than the comfort of old friends for one another. But inwardly, it meant everything to both of them. Must they be separated again, permanently?<br />This is a very moving, as well as amusing in places, story of best friends who shoud have been lovers long ago, but missed out. It's also a story about how love can sometimes be even better when it comes somewhat later in life. And this book is most definitely a Balogh classic. If you can get your hands on it, don't let it go!	2002-06-30

He's already 379 years old, world-weary and achingly lonely. His undead existence dooms him to a half-life in the hours between dusk and dawn and the need to live off (warm and fresh) human blood. <br />Sara Jayne, an orphan, is crippled and seemingly destined to live out her life in the care of the nuns. But Gabriel, her 'guardian angel', saved her life when she was a small child, and he's watched over her ever since. He rescues her again when she's close to death, and takes her under his wing, providing for her and, once she can walk again, sending her to a new life in Paris. But she longs for Gabriel, and eventually he comes to her.<br />But she doesn't know what he is, and as much as he loves her, he can't bring himself to take the risk of telling her, in case she rejects him. Their relationship, for a time, is based on his demand that she ask him no questions about his unusual lifestyle, his refusal to eat with her, the fact that he's never around during daylight hours, the strange and very intent looks on his face sometimes, his almost superhuman strength... Until one day, when she finds him trapped in a run-down cottage behind a wall of holy water and garlic, starved for blood, she finally realises what he really is.<br />And then, can Sara really accept a vampire as her lover? What about her own mortality, as compared to his immortality? Can they possibly be happy together? Those questions are tough enough, without the added complications of Sara's would-be lover Maurice (whom I ended up liking very much) and Gabriel's ex-lover and the person who initiated him, Antonina. <br />And who couldn't love the brooding, sad and angst-ridden Gabriel? Or Sara, faced with such a discovery and learning to live with the reality of who her lover is?<br />This was my first vampire romance, and on the basis of Embrace The Night I'll be looking up more by Ashley. Four stars instead of five only because I wanted more at the end, and also in comparison tomy all-time favourite romance authors such as Beverley and Balogh.	2002-06-24

Unconvincing, badly researched and boring	Does Catherine Coulter know anything at all about the English Regency period? From reading this book and the other one of hers I've read, I doubt it very much. Her characters all talk and to a large extent act like contemporary Americans. That in itself is very offputting. The characters are too informal with each other, using first names where it would be completely inappropriate, which makes the book less credible to begin with.<br />That aside, what of the story? Well, Evangeline is under orders from someone nasty to spy for Napoleon by getting herself accepted into the household of a cousin-by-marriage, the Duke of Portsmouth - who, very conveniently, just happens to be engaged in counter-espionage himself. And this is the first incredible element of the book. Portsmouth, and his friend Pettigrew, are *secretly* working for the government against Napoleon. Note the *secretly*. So, of course, it makes perfect sense that Pettigrew tells Evangeline, a woman he's only just met, in front of other people, that he and Portsmouth are British spies, doesn't it? Not! That was ludicrous.<br />And just as incredible was Pettigrew telling Evangeline that he intended to marry Felicia, admitting that no-one else knew it yet. Why would he tell a perfect stranger personal details like that? <br />All these inaccuracies and unbelievable elements aside, though, I simply didn't like either Portsmouth or Evangeline. Portsmouth, in his crude way of talking to her, ogling her and making personal comments about her figure and what he'd like to do to her, was no more than an ill-bred lout. And, in the parlance of the time, Evangeline was no better than she should be. Portsmouth was so openly and loudly obsessed with her breasts that I almost expected Evangeline to suggest he draw his sword and cut them off so that he could have them in his possession permanently! He wasn't lover-like; he was a sleaze.<br />Someone else has already mentioned the appalling proof-reading: the grammatical and punctuation errors, the tense switches and so on. Perhaps Coulter could benefit from brushing up on her grammar too.<br />All in all, I think I'll stick with the better Regency-period authors from now on.	2002-06-22

Lord Wraybourne's Betrothed is part of the series which also contains The Stanforth Secrets, The Stolen Bride and Emily and the Dark Angel. Jane Sandiford, brought up in a very sheltered and restrictive household, becomes betrothed to a man her parents have chosen for her, and suddenly finds herself catapulted into the ton and the middle of a London season, and tries to get to know this sophisticated stranger she's about to marry.<br />This book really didn't do a lot for me. I did quite like both Jane and David in the beginning, but - and this is a short Regency! - the story really began to drag from around halfway through. Jane and David were already pretty much in love with each other, and it seemed as if the story could be over. But Beverley dragged it out with a mystery plot (and since I'd guessed the identity of the culprit very early in the book, that wasn't exactly suspenseful) and a largely absent fianc&eacute;.<br />And those are my main problems with the book. First, I ended up feeling that I really didn't get to know David at all, because he was missing for so much of the time. Second, the mystery plot was uninteresting and a distraction from the real story. And then third, I found Jane a little too perfect to be either interesting or convincing. She's had no real experience of Society or even mixing with other people of her own class - and yet she fits into the ton as if she's been attending parties and coping with repartee all her life?! She's an instant success - but why? She copes with every obstacle placed in her path just too easily. And her behaviour in respect of David is too inconsistent: she keeps believing that he's having affairs, and yet every time she sees him she ignores that suspicion and behaves as if he's the love of her life.<br />I ended up being far more interested in Randal and Sophie, two secondary characters; but their romance was dealt with very abruptly in the end, and then I realised that their story is finished in The Stolen Bride.<br />There are also a couple of clich&eacute;d villain-types in the book, which is something later Beverley books avoid like the plague. All in all, this is definitely not Beverley's best work - if you want to read a good short Regency by her, try Emily and the Dark Angel.<br />There are also a couple of clichéd villain-types in the book, which is something later Beverley books avoid like the plague.

It's very readable, and I enjoyed it while I was reading; I liked Kate Billings and the troupe of actors very much. Hal Hampton, aka the Marquess of Graydon (not Everdon) was in some respects amusing, and even solicitous. But I am in complete agreement with the other reviewer: his reason for not helping Kate and the troupe out of their mess was not at all convincing. It seemed like a very convenient plot device for dragging out the story, and no more than that. I'm not at all surprised that Kate gave Hal a black eye when she discovered that he'd lied about the threat to his life!<br />Other aspects of the plot, such as the marriage certificate, were extremely predictable; it was simply a matter of counting the pages until they happened.<br />All in all, if you want to read a *really* good Carla Kelly, find Reforming Lord Ragsdale or Mrs Drew Plays Her Hand!	2002-06-14

Race and Anne are just perfect :)	The long-awaited Hazard, direct sequel to Dragon's Bride and incidental connection to the Rogues books, is finally here! And it's well worth the wait.<br />Lady Anne Peckforth, daughter of the Duke of Arran, who will make her husband a rich man but who is considered less desirable by virtue of the fact that she has a club foot (walks with an unsightly limp, can't dance), has just suffered her second disappointment. Following on from Lord Middlethorpe's snub - he married another woman while in the process of negotiating for her hand - she then hears that Con, Viscount Amleigh, has married someone else after having indicated an interest in her. So she is doubly rejected.<br />Race de Vere, introduced in Dragon's Bride as Con's secretary, was asked by 'King Rogue', Nicholas Delaney, to check up on Anne. After all, she is unfinished business: twice a Rogue played dirty with her, and Nicholas therefore considers her his responsibility. He wants Race to establish whether she is genuinely hurt. So Race attaches himself to the Marquess of Uffham, Anne's brother, allowing Uffham to use him as semi-companion, semi-servant, all in the interests of helping the Rogues and seeing what he can do for Anne. Race, after all, is a congenital 'helper'.<br />Race, we discover, has very uncertain origins. He bears a surname which he has no right to - his father changed the family name in an attempt to 'gentrify' them, but didn't realise that the name he chose would be immediately suspect, as it was the family name of the Earls of Oxford, a line now extinct. So Race attracts attention everywhere as someone who can't possibly be what he appears. And anyway, as a 'hanger-on' to Society, he could never aspire to the hand of Lady Anne Peckforth.<br />Yet attraction sparkles between the two of them; when Anne asks Race to teach her about men and how they flirt, he only has to kiss her hand for her to realise that no man has ever aroused her senses with a simple kiss ever before. But Race isn'tfor Anne; how can she marry a man without a past, whose background makes him totally ineligible?<br />So she sets out to find a 'suitable' husband; yet none of the men she meets, and who fall over themselves to flatter her, appeal to her in any way. They all fall short next to Race. So should she obey her family by choosing a suitable titled gentleman, or follow her heart's desire... even if it means disgrace?<br />I adored this book. Anne is fleshed out extremely well here, and we learn that she is intelligent, shrewd, with a clever, dry sense of humour which is displayed to good effect in her verbal fencing matches with Race. There are scenes with her old friend Tris, the Duke of St Raven, which also sparkle with humour and wit - and the rats, mice and farthings discussions are hilarious! In fact, for a time there was an intriguing triangle going on with Race, Tris and Anne.<br />Hazard also introduces us to Tris, the Duke of St Raven, whom Beverley has assured us will be the hero of her next book. And already I can't wait!	2002-06-05

In this book, Hawk, the Earl of Rothbury, chooses the plain and - to him - repulsive daughter, Frances, so that he can dump her and won't have to spend any time with her. Unfortunately for him, she's actually beautiful - now there's yet another cliche, and his behaviour when he finds out is disgraceful.<br />The marriage gets off to a bad start when he insists that she let him have his conjugal rights - others have referred to his treatment of her as rape, and that's not a bad description. All their sexual encounters, up until the time that Hawk discovers she's beautiful and suddenly - surprise, surprise - starts to feel desire for her, are tantamount to rape.<br />Humour? What humour? I know that humour is very subjective but, while Coulter clearly thinks, judging by her sleeve comments, that the fights between Hawk and Frances are hilarious, to me they seemed infantile and embarrassing.<br />I was also turned off by Hawk's habit of discussing sex everywhere, no matter who was around. His explicit comments regarding the purpose of the cream were also distasteful. Like another reader, I could not see a single reason why the two of them should fall in love with one another; but in contrast, I think they deserved each other. Both were spoilt, silly and very immature.<br />Coulter remarks, in her sleeve notes to the reissue, that this book did not require any revisions since it was 'fine and dandy' as it was. Well, at the very least she could have done something about the grammatical errors and anachronisms in language! 'The both of us' is grammatically incorrect and would *never* be used in speech by an English aristocrat - or by any English person, then or now. Neither did eighteenth-century aristocrats say 'I guess', or any of the other Americanisms which peppered Coulter's dialogue. And her female characters,in dialogue and behaviour, were very out of place for the period.<br />Coulter also has a very bad habit of changing point of view frequently: in the early part of the book she not only did it in each successive paragraph, but *within* paragraphs. How on earth are her readers supposed to follow whose perspective is being given? It's a very sloppy writing style, one which an author of Coulter's experience should know to avoid.<br />Not now experiencing the slightest desire to read another word written by Catherine Coulter, I will await the new Jo Beverley and Mary Balogh novels instead.	2002-05-21

She is rescued by a pirate ship and, once she recovers, the pirate captain climbs into her bed and just casually has sex with her. Riiiight. Okay.

And even when she realises that he has to be part of a plot to work against her father's political agenda, she stays quiet and doesn't tell Cato what's going on. Even though she knows that Anthony is a pirate.<br />I'm sorry; I just didn't see any romance in here, and I didn't even like the 'hero'. And as for the ending, what kind of thing is that? I kept waiting for him to renounce his lawless life, but no; he continues to be a pirate, and Cato lets Phoebe go to him instead of having him handed over to the police and hanged.

Cato is also the father of her best friend Olivia, and is almost old enough to be her own father. He's distant, cold, very proper and only interested in politics and the war.<br />And yet one day she looks at him and falls in love.<br />So then she has to try to make him fall in love with her - which isn't easy, since she's overweight and awkward and informal and everything, it seems, which he disapproves of. She gets Olivia into trouble and creates chaos in his ordered manor home. And she has neither the talent nor the wish to take over housekeeping. None of her clothes suit her - which is hardly surprising, since they were all made for Diana, who was a completely different shape to her. She's not even, he thinks, all that good in bed, and she doesn't seem to be showing any signs of becoming pregnant.<br />Although I enjoyed this and found some parts of it humorous, I really had problems with the idea of Cato as a husband. In the first book he was very distant and cold and not at all hero-like. And, of course, a man in his mid-thirties, he is married here to a seventeen-year-old and a friend of his own daughter's. Doesn't he feel the slightest awkwardness at the thought of taking Phoebe to bed?<br />And as for Phoebe, I do find it hard to understand why she continued to love Cato, who for most of the book showed no interest in her beyond criticising her. I'm not even sure that he would have found her clumsiness endearing, as he eventually did.<br />So, although on a superficial level I found this book entertaining, I really didn't find it at all credible.	2002-05-19

This introductory scene appears in all three books, just in case anyone's missed it.<br />Portia is the bastard daughter of the Marquis of Granville's bastard brother. When her father dies, Granville offers her a home within his household, but he isn't that interested in her, and his wife, Diana, makes it clear that she is to be an extra servant, helping take care of the infant children. Olivia, Granville's daughter from an earlier marriage, befriends Portia, however.<br />An old enemy of the Granville household, Rufus Decatur, former Earl of Rothbury, has sworn revenge on the family of the man who was responsible for his father's death and disgrace. Olivia is to be kidnapped and used as a bargaining tool. However, a mistake is made and Portia is kidnapped instead. Rufus isn't sure what to do with her, so he keeps her prisoner.<br />However, Portia then decides that she wants to train and to join his militia as a soldier - even though she knows that Rufus intends to attack her uncle's household! That part was difficult to swallow; war is a serious business, and even if Portia isn't particularly loyal to either King or Parliament, the thought of striking against her uncle's home, and especially her cousin, should surely not have come so easily to her.<br />Like another reviewer, I wasn't convinced by the 'falling in love' part of the book, and the resolution in particular was unconvincing.<br />Finally, Rufus at one point used the term 'bourgeoisie'. Isn't early seventeenth-century England a little early for that term to be in common currency, since it's normally associated with the French revolution?	2002-05-19

So one night at his club when his friends are discussing his amazing success with women and his apparent record of never being turned down, he agrees to a wager that he can persuade any woman his friends name to sleep with him. She must be a lady of quality, but no debutante. A drunken friend mentions his widowed sister-in-law, Diana Ingram, as someone who would be a tough nut to crack in this regard: she's unfailingly virtuous. Jack - extremely drunk himself, and assuming that any widow must be missing lovemaking - accepts the bet.<br />Jack and Diana meet - and Jack almost wins the bet - under very unusual circumstances when they are both marooned at the same inn on the way to a house party. Confusion leads to Jack ending up in the wrong bedroom and, in a beautifully sensual scene, they almost make love. But when Diana comes to her senses she is mortified and wants to avoid Jack hereafter. The problem comes when they both arrive at the house party and discover that the hostess is determined to throw them together. Lady Rotherham is the incurable matchmaker of the title, and she is determined to marry them off.<br />Jack is vehemently opposed to marriage and doesn't believe in love. Diana believes that lovemaking goes along with commitment and love. So how do these two come together?<br />Well, this is my only problem with the book. The two protagonists provide readers with a lot of amusement - their conversations are certainly very entertaining. But I never actually felt that I *saw* Jack fall in love with Diana, and I certainly never saw the reasoning for him giving up his opposition to marriage. One minute he wanted an affair - although he certainly was beginning to sympathise with Diana's wish for commitment - and the next he was in love with her. There was a step missing, to my mind.<br />One quibble, besides. Jack's friend and Diana's brother-in-law, Ernie, is described as Lord Crensham. But he's a younger son - his oldestbrother is the Viscount. So how come Ernie has a title?	2002-04-29

Wulf is the member who Nathan believed had turned traitor, only to discover near the end of Entwined that he was still loyal. Physically scarred since his teenage years, Wulf also carries mental scars. <br />At a soiree hosted by a famous courtesan, Wulf sees Nell Nolan, who is rumoured to have been the late Duke of Clonegal's mistress (and no, Harriet Klausner, she was never actually his mistress). Nell wants a favour: she wants one of her aristocratic flirts to take her to the Golden Ball. Wulf offers on condition that she spend the night with him; she accepts, but has no intention of fulfilling her side of the bargain.<br />When he discovers that she intends to welsh on the deal, Wulf is angry, but he decides that he will win her for himself. He does... but in the end surprises both himself and her by asking her to marry him. However, he believes himself incapable of love, and while Nell loves him, she believes that he can never love her back because he believes that she was a courtesan. Once they return to Ireland, though, things change...<br />Again, I was disappointed with this book. I loved Entwined, didn't care for Fallen, and now with Moonlit have just about decided not to read any more by Jensen. Her earlier work, in particular His Grace Endures and The Irish Rogue, ranks very high among my favourites, but this trilogy has been for the most part a disappointment. Halfway through the book, I still didn't really care about the two lead characters, which is a disaster in terms of reader commitment to the book. When I read a Balogh, a Putney or a Beverley, by two chapters in I'm hooked and desperately keen to find out what happens to the lead characters.<br />There were too many plot threads: I agree with the reviewers who said that. It's as if Jensen doesn't believe that a longer book can be carried on the basis of a romance/relationship plot alone, and so she feels compelled to add an action/dramatic plot. It was superfluous, and in the end felt forced. <br />And I was very disappointed to see that Jensen is getting sloppy in her writing. She's very good at Scottish and Irish history, language and idioms, and in previous books her characters have also managed to speak upper-class nineteenth-century English very well. In this book, though, she used too many Americanisms - and contemporary Americanisms at that. They jolted me right out of the story.<br />Wishing Jensen could return to the talent she showed in The Irish Rogue...	2002-04-26

A day later, she is picked up by the British Naval ship commanded by Captain Sir Daniel Spark, who had so rudely boarded the US ship she'd been on only a couple of days before, impressing some of the crew. Then the villain of the piece, now he has saved her life.<br />But he's on the way to the Caribbean, so there's no possibility of being taken back to America... it will be at least six weeks before she can get on a ship bound for America again, and so she has to endure weeks upon weeks of being the only woman upon a British war-ship - and the company of Daniel Spark.<br />I found this book amazingly unconvincing in many respects. First, there's Daniel Spark. When we first meet him, he is shown as ruthless and uncaring: he has no qualms about impressing into his service anyone he wants, even a fifteen-year-old boy who isn't even British and despite the pleas of the boy's father. We see a sailor who has jumped ship from Spark's vessel and has found `a better master and a better country'. Yet the Spark we see on board the Dissuade suddenly becomes a caring captain who is respected by his crew. What happened?!<br />Spark's relationship with Hannah on board astounded me. This is a man in his thirties, an experienced captain who has been at sea since he was ten. A young woman on board would be nothing but a nuisance - and yet he takes time away from his other duties to escort her to her cabin, check on her welfare and so on. This is a warship, not a cruise ship! Far more ludicrous was the notion that Spark would become so distressed about the deaths of his crew members that he'd need Hannah to hold his hand, metaphorically speaking: with his experience and the dangers at sea, shipboard funerals would be a routine event. And just how a naïve seventeen-year-old could be of any help to a hardened, cynical man in his thirties,Kelly never explains.<br />And this is why, ultimately, the romance is unconvincing. I found it hard to see how Spark could see Hannah as anything other than an irritating child and a damned nuisance. In contrast to her other books, there was little or no romance here. A few kisses - and with a man who'd been on a ship for months, if not years, on end, that's not too surprising - and suddenly they're in love! <br />Oh, just a warning: don't get too attached to any of the secondary characters. This book takes place during a war, and Kelly doesn't hold back on description and consequence.<br />Finally, I have a real problem with this and Kelly's other naval novel, Mrs McVinnie's London Season. The heroes are Naval captains, and they will not give up the sea. So their wives will see them, at best, for a month or so every two, three or even four years. This may well have been standard practice for Naval wives at the time, but where's the romance in that?	2002-04-26

Other Kellys are far better	Mrs Jeannie McVinnie, widow, shares her name with her dead husband's late aunt, and as a result she opens a letter which commands her to come to London immediately to help out Captain Will Summers, who is in the unfortunate position of looking after his brother's family temporarily and bringing out his niece. Lost and without any real role in life, Jeannie goes to London and persuades Captain Summers to let her help, instead of the elderly lady (his former nurse) who he was expecting.<br />There follows an entertaining account of what could have been a disastrous Season, just saved from being so by the intervention of Beau Brummell, who takes to Jeannie and her young charge (just a bit cliched, that part). And, of course, Jeannie and Will grow close to each other, close enough to realise that each has a dark secret of which they are ashamed... and to confide in each other.<br />But Will loves the sea and will go back as soon as he can escape his escorting duties. So what future do they have?<br />This is a sweet romance, for the most part, though it is in some ways similar to Miss Whittier Makes A List: Will proposes to Jeannie and later withdraws his proposal, just as Daniel Sharp does to Hannah Whittier. I also have the same problem with this book as with the other: Will is a Naval captain and will go back to sea, and so we know that if he and Jeannie end up together they'll be apart for months, if not years, on end. I can't really see that as a happy ending.<br />However, this book is better than Miss Whittier, in particular in that I can actually see the characters falling in love. There are some delightful secondary characters, in addition - and the ending brought tears to my eyes.	2002-04-26

Seven years later, he is in China, working as a trader in the then Chinese system in which Western traders were kept in a compound in Canton, spied on by the translators provided to them by their hosts. The translator supplied to Kyle is a young man called Jin Kang, to whom Kyle feels strangely drawn. This is explained some days later when Kyle discovers that Jin Kang is really Troth Mei-Lian Montgomery, daughter of a Scottish trader and Chinese concubine, now both dead. Troth had been taken in by the Chinese overseer of the trading system, Chenqua, who took advantage of her fluency in both languages by making her work for him in disguise.<br />Kyle, frustrated by the restraints on Europeans, wants to explore more of China, and Troth offers to be his guide on condition that he help her get to Scotland. She agrees, and in disguise they make their way to the Temple of Hashon, becoming lovers en route. Kyle, though, makes it clear that he isn't capable of loving; Troth lies and says that she's not looking for love.<br />On the return journey, disaster strikes: Kyle's disguise is uncovered and he is arrested and sentenced to death. Troth creeps into his cell on the pretence of administering English deathbed rites, and Kyle offers to marry her, Scottish-style, to protect her and give her a means of getting back to England.<br />Believing that the death sentence was carried out - she heard the sound of the firing squad - Troth makes her way to England, arriving at Warfield to tell Dominic that his brother is dead. Mere weeks later, a frail but alive Kyle turns up; his captors had only played with him, pretending on several occasions to  execute him. So he and Troth are bound in a marriage of dubious legitimacy, and which neither believes the other wants.<br />Where do they go from here?<br />This is another Putney book I'd put off reading for some time; the Chinese element was offputting to me, since I don't care for Asian/Oriental settings and didn't like the latter two Silk books much for that reason. However, less than half of this book is actually set in China, and although Putney does her usual job of making the detail authentic (hence lots of stuff about feng shui and tai chi and chi energy and so on, most of which I skimmed rather than read), her usual skill at building a romance flows through the book. <br />The scenes leading up to Kyle and Troth's parting and Kyle's 'death', as well as the depiction of Kyle in captivity and the mock executions, were poignant and emotional - Putney at her best. And I don't agree with those who argue that the latter part of the book is less interesting: the emotional divide and miscommunication between Kyle and Troth is also Putney at her best. Enthralling!	2002-04-13

Dominic Renbourne, younger son - by ten minutes - of the Earl of Wrexham, is bored and restless. Not having the taste or talent for the army or the church, he lives a life of jaded pleasure from his lodgings in London. His twin Kyle, Viscount Maxwell, on the other hand, seems to have it all: land, money and an inheritance to look forward to. And yet, as we learn, Kyle is as envious of Dominic's freedom as Dominic is envious of Kyle's ownership of land - Dominic would love nothing more than to be a country farmer.<br />So when Kyle contacts Dominic and offers to sign over to him a manor estate if Dominic will take his place for a few weeks, Dominic is tempted. The masquerade involves visiting the home of Kyle's almost-fiancee, Lady Meriel Grahame (descendant of Adrian and Meriel of Warfield, from Uncommon Vows). Meriel is rumoured to be mad, as the result of severe childhood trauma; she doesn't speak and seems to pay no attention to anything around her. The idea of a child-woman like this becoming someone's wife disgusts Dominic, but he senses some raw pain in his brother's heart, so in the end agrees to go to Warfield.<br />Meriel is everything Dominic expected... and yet nothing like he expected. She is beautiful and untamed. She ignores everyone except Kamal, her Indian servant... and yet Dominic realises very quickly that she watches him and understands what he says to her. Gradually, she accepts his friendship and allows him to teach her to ride and to become involved in her daily activities.<br />But Dominic also realises that this apparently childlike woman is hiding her real nature. She understands far more than she pretends. She is highly intelligent, as well as intuitive. And when he discovers that she can read - and that her reading matter includes serious and demanding books - he suspects that she isn't being honest about her abilities. Can she speak, after all?<br />At the same time, Meriel and Dominic are falling in love with each other. And yet Dominicis bound by loyalty to his brother. How can he escape that? And in the background lurks the danger that Meriel's paternal uncle, Earl Grahame, will get his way and have her committed to an asylum.<br />Twins changing places is a common theme in romance novels, but many of these suggest that such changes are easy to execute. Never for one minute, though, are we allowed to believe that Dominic's masquerade is easy to maintain and unlikely to be discovered. Likewise, Meriel is portrayed in a very sympathetic and multi-dimensional way; at first she did indeed seem to be a very simple, possibly not sane, child; as we got to know her better, the glimpses we got of her thoughts and desires showed us that she was far more complex and intelligent than would be expected.<br />There are some lovely scenes in The Wild Child, as Dominic begins to get to know Meriel; the frightening events in the ruined Norman castle where Meriel pretended to throw herself off the battlements; the rescue of the fox; tending the garden together. As other reviers have noted, the compassionate treatment of the asylum was both fascinating and chilling. <br />This book gripped me from start to finish, and the only reason it didn't get read in one sitting was the inconvenience of having to get up to go to work! And then I couldn't wait to read Kyle's story, to find out how he fared after the loss of his beloved Constancia. A keeper!	2002-04-13

Probably what I most like about My Wicked Earl is the use of the Peterloo Massacre as a backdrop; it's often forgotten that eighteenth/nineteenth-century England, not long after the Industrial Revolution, was a very brutal period for working people. They had little or no rights, and even combining in trade unions to campaign for better pay and safer working conditions was a crime. Remember the Tolpuddle Martyrs, transported for joining a trade union?<br />However, the detailed use of this event and the sympathetic presentation of workers' protests isn't enough to make me love this book. Unfortunately, too much of it is simply incredible. First, as another reviewer mentioned, Hollie Finch *is* extremely unusual: she reads, writes and runs a print shop. Why? Needham needed to explain why this woman is so different from others of her generation. And, also, to explain why her reputation wasn't in doubt among those who knew her: an independent woman, living alone?<br />And as for her language - um, what's 'ballocks'? Do you mean 'bollocks'? - there is *no way* that a woman would have used such language. I kept waiting for Hollie to be dismissed as a trollop for the way she behaved.<br />Then, when she was taken to Everingham, the Earl's attitude is unbelievable. First, where were Everingham's servants? Only one manservant? There would have been footmen, below-stairs maids, above-stairs maids and many more. There would have been no need for Everingham to guard her himself. And why, when she told him that she was married, did he keep calling her Miss Finch? He would have called her by her 'married name' forthwith and continually. He would never have introduced her to his noble visitors, either - apart from anything else, they would immediately assume that the unmarried woman he introduced her as was his mistress. No maid? No chaperone? Couldn't be anything else. And, given the over-familiar way Everingham and Hollie behaved towards each other, wandering into each other's bedrooms and so forth, they acted as if she was his mistress.<br />And further on the subject of names, Everingham tells Hollie to call him Charles because calling him 'my lord' makes her sound like a servant. Rubbish! Apart from (male) social equals and superiors, and perhaps close friends, everyone would call him 'my lord'. That's simply the way it was. <br />Then there's 'Chip'. Everingham's son. What kind of name is 'Chip'? It may be an American diminutive of Charles, but it's not an English variation. Unless the boy was brought up in the US - and unless 'Chip' was used in the 1810s - that name is unbelievable. Even more unbelievable is Everingham making the child his heir. The boy was illegitimate: that's simply not legally or socially possible. What he might have done was acknowledge the boy - though he wouldn't have brought him up himself. And he would have paid for his education and perhaps helped him to get a start in a good profession. But that would have been all. <br />Nice backdrop, Needham, but *please* get the period manners and social customs right! I can't take a book seriously in which the author doesn't appear to care about the period she's writing in, and I won't be reading any more by this writer.	2002-04-08

Anthony Earhart, Marquess of Staunton, desperately wants to spite the father he hates. Summoned home after eight years' absence, he knows that he is expected to marry a chit straight from the schoolroom because she is his father's choice of bride for him; a suitable match for a future duke. Well, he has no intention of conforming. He decides to marry the most unsuitable woman he can find: a mousy nobody. So - as he is determined not to stoop lower than a gentlewoman fallen on hard times - he advertises for a governess, intending to marry the most submissive and plain of the applicants.<br />Charity Duncan seems to meet Anthony's requirements. Little does he know that her submissive manner is assumed, due to her having lost previous employment because she stood up for the rights of a chambermaid. Dressed in dull brown, she stares at the floor and seems so perfect for Anthony's purpose that he proposes to her.<br />Charity accepts, because her family is very poor and her brother is struggling to pay off debts so that he can marry his sweetheart. After all, the marquess promises that she will only have to play the part of his wife for a matter of weeks. Then he will give her a home and a pension - six thousand pounds a year! - and she can have her freedom, except for the wedding ring. Anthony himself, he declares, never wants to marry for real, never wants to have children of his own.<br />So they marry, and Charity accompanies Anthony to Enfield, the Duke of Withingsby's home. There, she finds an apparently cold, unloving family, and realises that her husband wasn't joking when he said he wanted to spite the father he loathed. However, Anthony has seriously underestimated Charity...<br />Gradually, she breaks down the ice which surrounds her husband's heart and, bit by bit, she becomes his confidant. She, on the other hand, learns that passion doesn't have to have anything to do with love.<br />While she seems to be making progress in helping Anthony to reconcile withhis family, isn't she only hastening the time when he'll inform her that he doesn't need her any more, and thus of her own departure? After all, he did marry a temporary wife...<br />In Balogh's inimitable style, she gives us a poignant story which examines relationships in all their manifestations, and shows us that love and hate are often closer than we think. And typically in a Balogh novel, the apparent villain is not so evil as he might have initially appeared. This is a wonderful romantic tearjerker, well worth the secondhand price you might have to pay!	2002-04-02

This book is a classic example of why I love Carla Kelly's work so much. With a very small number of exceptions, her books are touching, heartfelt romances which have me hooked from start to finish. <br />Although her books are set in the Regency period, don't look for balls and fancy dresses and simpering debutantes from Kelly. She writes about real people, and usually those whose lives have been touched by hardship in some way. In this book, Jane Milton is the archetypal poor relation, taken in by her relatives many years ago and whose only joy is in taking care of her nephew, the Marquess's heir and the son of the man we suspect that Jane may have loved. However, there is stigma attached to the boy, since he may not actually be his father's son.<br />Jane has a friend: Scipio, a mill-owner who owns the land bordering her grandfather's home. Because he's in trade, he's not acceptable; yet he's the only person who understands Jane's situation, and who is kind to Andrew. He offers to tutor Andrew when bullying at school makes the boy miserable, and this leads to a deepening of friendship between Jane and Scipio.<br />But Jane has some dark, painful secrets, which keep her awake at night. Scipio also seems to have a secret buried in his past, and although the two become closer over time, the weight of their respective shameful secrets seems to keep them apart...<br />This book made me cry in several places, notably Christmas Eve in the church, and the part about Jane's mother's headstone; those sections were so poignant, and so powerfully written, that I'd defy anyone to read them with a dry eye. They're typical of Kelly's skill. <br />There are also some lovely characters in the book: Kelly's wonderful at creating secondary characters. There's Andrew, for a start; then the butler - who, if it hadn't been for Scipio, I'd have been yelling at Jane to elope with! And there's Scipio's sister and brother-in-law; all very well drawn and sympathetic.<br />I agree with thereader from Bethesda that there were some sloppy editing errors and also an obvious error in relation to English inheritance law. That's a shame, and the latter point also somewhat spoils Kelly's outcome. Nevertheless, the power of the book itself, the way it's written, and the way in which I felt drawn in to the lives of Jane and Scipio and their families, meant that the errors didn't jolt me out of the story in the way a lesser writer's work might have done.<br />Thoroughly recommended, if you can get your hands on a copy!	2002-03-04

We discover, through lots of hints and introspection in the first couple of chapters, that it wasn't long before Chloe realised that she'd married the wrong cousin, and that Justin equally was in love with Chloe.<br />Now, however, Stephen is dead - has been dead over a year. His heir as Lord Stanforth has just died, and Justin has now inherited the title. Chloe isn't looking forward to seeing him again; she wants to leave the Stanforth estate and find a nice, conformable, boring man to marry. Delamere men are too rogueish and unreliable for her taste, and Justin's unlikely to have changed, she thinks. <br />Justin, who is longing to see Chloe again, gets sidetracked by the Prime Minister and the Prince of Wales, who want him to investigate a missing package of information about the French, and a possible murder, at his family home. Chloe, he is told, might well be a suspect. And so he returns home not only to take up the reins of the estate, but to investigate a mystery. Lord Randal Ashby, his friend and Chloe's cousin, accompanies him - this is before Randal's own story, and so he is still a rakish bachelor.<br />There's lots of suspicious minor characters, lots of talk about apples and potatoes (it was unclear whether pommes or pommes de terre were involved), more suspicious deaths and confrontations. Actually, I'd figured out the villains long before the end, as well as the hiding-place of the 'pomme' concerned.<br />There wasn't much romance; we knew that Chloe and Justin were in love, and the romantic plot simply involved Justin trying to persuade Chloe to forget her scruples and marry him. But they didn't have very many scenes alone together; not enough to stop the mystery plot from taking over the book. I also got *very* frustrated with Chloe for being so idiotic when it was obvious that she loved Justin and he loved her, and that he was clearly much more responsible now than he'd been when he was younger. Justin's jealousy didn't work for me either.<br />So, while I'll keep this book as part of my Jo Beverley collection, I doubt that I'll be re-reading it. Her other work is a lot better.	2002-02-16

Emily and the Dark Angel is one of Jo Beverley's earliest books, and is part of a series which began with Lord Wraybourne's Betrothal, and continued with The Stanforth Secret and The Stolen Bride. Not knowing that these books were linked, I read Emily... before Stanforth; I hope that by listing the order here other readers may be helped. (And I hope that some day I can find a copy of The Stolen Bride; I want to read Randal and Sophie's story!)<br />Emily is a spinster, in her late twenties, who has been looking after her invalid father for many years. Since her soldier brother was posted as missing, believed killed in combat, she has also been running the family estate. Her home is on the edge of Melton Mowbray, a very popular area with the hunting fraternity, situated as it is in the centre of several hunts. (This is the one thing I dislike about the book: I loathe foxhunting).<br />Piers Verderan, known as Ver to his friends, is there for the hunting, and because he's just inherited the estate next to Emily's. They meet first just as he's been ejected from his (ex-)mistress's establishment, colliding with Emily just as they're both showered in poudre des violettes. Ver offers to escort Emily to her destination, since the collision has damaged the heel of her boot.<br />She doesn't trust him; and why should she? He's called the Dark Angel for a reason; he is likened to Lucifer. Stories about his criminality and dastardliness abound. And yet he is kind, he comes to her rescue on several occasions, and he makes her feel good about herself for the first time in many years. He makes her feel desirable. He tells her that he loves her.<br />But can Emily believe a man who has a reputation for breaking hearts and never remaining faithful to a woman; a man who is reputed to have abandoned his own mother to a life of poverty? Can she be brave enough to listen to her heart above the warnings of her brain and members of her family?<br />Emily and Ver are hugely likeable characters, both with enough emotional depth to hold my interest. There are also some great secondary characters, including some I really want to read about: Lord Randal Ashby appears in this book, with his wife Sophie (and I want to read their story!), and Emily's brother Marcus looks as if he could benefit from a book of his own. Note to self: check if Beverley ever did write Marcus's story...<br />Highly recommended, if you can get hold of it!	2002-02-16

This is the story of Rainey and Kenzie, the apparently-perfect Hollywood couple, whose marriage was not as fairytale as everyone believed.<br />The story opens as Rainey and Kenzie's divorce is progressing, although along the way we get flashbacks which tell us the story of how they got together (playing the leads in a film adaptation of The Scarlet Pimpernel). We know that Rainey filed for divorce because of something Kenzie did and which made her believe that he no longer wanted to be married to her; we also know, though, that Kenzie loves her desperately and longs for them to be together still. However, for some reason - and this is the first hint of his tortured soul - he thinks she's better off without him.<br />Rainey wants to make a career as a director, and she has the perfect script: The Centurion, about a Victorian army officer who is tortured and abused in Africa and then returns home, ashamed and emotionally crippled, and has to try to rebuild his life. She wants Kenzie to play the lead; what she doesn't know is that the storyline hits very close to home for him, and unlocks the key to his hidden past, which he's always refused to discuss with her. When she ends up playing the female lead opposite him, she sees even more closely the torment the role is causing him.<br />Eventually, the whole painful story comes out... and Kenzie is left an emotional wreck. Can her love for him, and his for her, manage to put him back together again?<br />For some reason, although this premise should have been a real tearjerker and although MJP's writing has certainly made me cry before (The Rake; Thunder and Roses; One Perfect Rose), The Spiral Path didn't do it for me. While reading about Kenzie's situation and what had happened to him - even scenes in his POV - I felt detached from the emotions, ratherthan connected with them in any way. I don't think Putney actually got deep enough into Kenzie's mind - maybe because his revelations are so shocking, she felt it was too much detail, but without that detail, without Kenzie's journal (which he wrote but we weren't shown), and without more depth of introspection, I felt in the end that the emotions were rather superficial.<br />A personal gripe: while I'm very sure that Putney did her research thoroughly, the mystical healing properties of labyrinths just didn't do it for me. I couldn't suspend disbelief in those stages of the book. Oh, and like other readers, I felt that the Oscar ceremony was cliched and not up to the standard of the rest of the book. :/<br />It's still a very good book and one which I'll read again; I'll certainly buy other contemporaries by Putney, too. But I want more historicals, set in England in the same time-frame as Thunder and Roses!	2002-02-13

Gabriel, remember, is the other angel; the boy who grew up with Michael, whom Michael taught to read, and who in the end killed 'the first man' to save Michael's life.<br />Now, Gabriel is back, running the House of Gabriel - a whorehouse, to be blunt, where both male and female prostitutes operate - and waiting, knowing that the second man will come for him, to finish what was started earlier. He's protecting Michael and Anne in the best way he knows, with guards posted to be aware of any danger, and he's doing his best to draw the second man to himself - after which one of them will die.<br />Until one evening a woman, covered from head to toe in a shapeless cloak, comes into the House and offers her virginity for sale - for the same price that Gabriel himself was once sold for. He knows that the second man is involved here, and that this woman must be in on it; so he buys her and tries to get her to tell him the truth. However, after a while he realises that she's also an innocent pawn - which means that her life is in danger. He must hold her prisoner to save her life.<br />Gabriel, because of his past experiences, hates to be touched. Victoria, because of her background, her age (she's a 34-year-old spinster) and the fact that she's been living on the streets for the past six months, needs to feel wanted - he bid for her virginity, but makes it clear that he has no intention of taking it. She has also, over the last few months, been receiving anonymous letters which awakened her sexuality, making her want to experience passion between a man and a woman.<br />So, feeling rejected and not understanding Gabriel's rejection of her, she sets out to seduce him. <br />The love scenes in this book are erotic; they're also rough, raw and blunt. They're not for the timid; if you prefer your sex dressed up in pretty phrases in Harlequin books, you won't enjoy this. There's also some violence here and there, which is understandable given that a dangerous psychopath is out to kill Gabriel and will gladly kill anyone else who gets in the way. But very quickly Gabriel and Victoria come to depend on each other, and we see that Gabriel would protect her with his life. She's come to mean as much to him as Michael.<br />My one problem with Schone is that she leaves a lot to the reader's imagination. I'm not incapable of drawing my own conclusions about things, but I'm a big fan of introspection - especially in books about brooding, tortured heroes such as Gabriel. So I'd have liked more insight into the characters' psyches, motives, intentions, fears and so on.<br />As far as Gabriel's relationship with Michael is concerned, there is clearly a homosexual past of some kind - the reader who thought it was implied but not intended didn't read the two books closely enough! Gabriel clearly has conflicted feelings about Michael, however; he associates homosexual love with the shame he felt when he had to admit that he enjoyed what the second man did to him, and so he's not at ease with his feelings for Michael. That was the one big disappointment for me: the two clearly do love each other - though not to the exclusion of Anne and Victoria - but the fact that Gabriel found it so hard to kiss Michael, at a point when it could have saved their lives, seemed wrong to me. (Okay, I wanted them to kiss, anyway!)	2002-02-10

But as soon as I turned to page 2 of the book and saw the baronet Frederick Leighton addressed as 'Sir Leighton' instead of Sir Frederick I knew I was onto a loser with Johnson.<br />Despite the author's prolific use of footnotes to demonstrate her knowledge of English history and customs, she gets some very basic elements completely wrong. Apart from the example above, her heroine, the twice-widowed Alexandra, is referred to throughout as 'Miss Ionides'. Whatever Alexandra's preference in the matter, any woman who had been married would have been called by the surname (or title) of her last husband. That was her name legally; Alexandra should have been referred to as Mrs Coutts.<br />The main characters, especially the viscount and his male friend, sounded far too contemporary; in fact, much of their dialogue was both modern and American, so I couldn't possibly take them seriously as Victorian aristocrats. As for Sam's language and vocabulary when with Alex... not credible. No gentleman would speak to a lady, even his lover, in those terms. <br />As for the story... sorry, but apart from when I was being jerked out of it by the anachronisms and inaccuracies it bored me from start to finish. As another reviewer commented, there was no romance in here. The book could have easily been marketed as an erotic novel, certainly; the sex scenes are detailed and very crudely described, with plenty of four-letter words. I have no idea how the characters fell in love with each other; there was no love story here.<br />Not recommended.	2002-01-13
1695501:US	52631742	R1TG2IOGWTM6OH	0440221064	470111425	Forbidden Love (Dell Historical Romance)	Books	1	22	31	N	N	Starts very nicely, then nosedives	In the beginning, this was a fun book; Justin, Earl of Weston, is forced to confront his seventeen-year-old ward for the first time in many years, because her misbehaviour has gone too far. What he doesn't know is that everything she'd been doing was designed to get his attention, because she's lonely and needs someone to care about her.<br />Then they meet, and realise that they're wildly attracted to each other, and - though they try not to - they tumble into bed. That's when Justin realises that Megan didn't know that he's married. But before he can tell her, his estranged wife turns up...<br />This is where the book nosedives completely. Leaving aside minor errors (such as Robards clearly not understanding the difference between Lord Donald Winspear and Donald, Lord Winspear - one is the younger son of a duke or marquis, and the other is possibly a baron, or some other noble), there are two major reasons why I thoroughly disliked the book once I'd got beyond about 1/3 of the way through.<br />First, once the action moves back to England, Justin turns into a violent, brutal, controlling bastard. From liking him enormously at the beginning of the book, I ended up loathing him and couldn't figure out why Megan had any feelings for him. She ended up exhibiting all the classic signs of a codependent woman, and he was unbelievably violent, in deeds as well as words.<br />And then there was the discussion of divorce, which actually occurred first about a chapter or so into the book. Robards clearly hasn't done her research on the period, because Justin has no grounds whatsoever for a divorce. The mere refusal of his wife to sleep with him is not grounds; he'd have to prove infidelity or non-consummation. In addition, there would be a trial in the House of Lords - among his contemporaries - and he'd have to call witnesses. It was also extremely scandalous, so he'd have been ostracised as a result.<br />And women were not able to sue for divorce, so the prospect of Justin's wife divorcing him would simply be non-existent; yet there's a long passage in which Justin muses on why she hadn't tried to divorce him. Therefore the discussions on divorce in the book, and the consideration of this as a solution to Justin's problem, is simply ludicrous; I was jerked out of the story at this point when Robards didn't correct herself, and could not take any consideration of solutions seriously.<br />Since I prefer my authors to have done their research properly, I won't be reading Robards again.	2002-01-13

Anyway, I thought this was a terrible book. <br />To begin with, Dodd takes far too long to tell us what happened on that 'scandalous' evening; once she explains that, it's then clear that there is more to be told: what happened when Jane went to see Blackburn (Ransom?! What a ridiculous name!) several days later. By the time Dodd told us this, I'd completely lost interest.<br />Dodd needs to be more aware of period manners and behaviour; far too many things happen in this book which are completely wrong for the period. The silly girl who caused the scandal at the party in the first place would never have been able to do it; she'd have been quashed immediately and then disgraced. There is far too many first-name usage. And far, far too many scenes in which Jane is alone with Blackburn.<br />Some scenes which were obviously intended to be humorous - eg the aftermath of the attic scene - left me cold and cringing.<br />The spy plot was boring - and what on earth was Blackburn's friend up to? Was he a good guy or a bad guy? It was hard to tell; his motivation seemed to change by the page. In fact, I was very disappointed in the outcome of his romance; Blackburn's sister was the one character in the book I actually liked, and she deserved a lot better.<br />(And WHAT was with all the italics in her dialogue?)<br />The scene at the docks, which some other reviewers seemed to like, didn't appeal to me at all; I couldn't believe in it, and it didn't make me like the characters any better. <br />Dodd's books are clearly not for me.	2002-01-03
1709228:US	52631742	R3GHI9F9Y3F1H7	0312968930	536201806	Too Wicked To Love	Books	2	6	8	N	N	Barely passable	A baby is dumped on the doorstep of the most disapproving spinster in the disctrict; she immediately jumps to the - not impossible - conclusion that it is the bastard offspring of the local rakish earl, so Jane decides that it's her job to make Chasemore aware of his obligations. Poking her nose in, in other words. And she is shocked when she invades his bedchamber and finds him naked in bed with a woman - as if she had any right to be shocked, since it was her decision to insinuate herself.<br />You may guess that I don't like the heroine. Jane is incredibly self-righteous and judgemental, and Smith does not do enough to redeem her for my liking. Even when Jane has to acknowledge that she was wrong about something, she says so in such a way that it still sounds as if she's criticising Ethan, or whoever it is she's talking to. She isn't at all a nice person, or someone I could like and identify with.<br />What's worse is that, as other reviewers point out, Jane behaves exactly like Ethan's first wife: knowing that Ethan was manipulated into marriage by Lady Portia, Jane sets out to do exactly the same thing. She deliberately seduces Ethan, knowing that he will do the right thing. It would have served her right if he'd refused - in fact, I was hoping that he would. He deserves better.<br />As for the baby, I found it hard to believe that an earl would show such interest in a foundling which might or might not have been his. Most aristocratic males showed absolutely no interest in any bastard children they might have fathered; if they gave the mother a sum of money for the child's keep, or found it a foster-home, they considered that they'd been more than generous. They would not be remotely interested in actually getting to know the child.<br />Oh, and I too guessed the identity of the baby's mother at a fairly early stage. Again, it felt a very implausible development.<br />One irritant: there is no such place as Wessex in England. The mythical court of King Arthur(he of the Round Table) was in Wessex, but this doesn't exist other than in legend. <br />Again, Smith's writing is competent, but - as with Once Upon A Scandal - she fails to engage my emotions in any way. The very unlikeable heroine here probably means that I won't bother reading anything else by this author.	2002-01-03

Leaving the plot aside for a moment, I couldn't take the characters seriously, much less like them. Lauren and Alex did nothing for me, and their behaviour was silly from start to finish. <br />Why would the Duke of Sutherland introduce himself merely as Alex? He wouldn't; he'd have said, 'I'm Sutherland'. So I couldn't accept the misunderstanding about his identity, to begin with. <br />Lots of period and factual inaccuracies; London makes so many mistakes with titles that I don't know where to begin. Characters are far too familiar with each other. And what on earth is &quot;a'tall&quot;, something she has one character say? The 'word' does not exist. <br />Ultimately, the story drags on for too long - about twice as long as was necessary. In order to prolong the angst, characters behave stupidly - afer all, once Alex has told Lauren that he loves her and that he'll find a way to end his engagement, what more is required? Yet we're only about halfway through the book at this stage.<br />And speaking of his engagement, ended a bare couple of days before the wedding, doesn't London realise that gentlemen - if they wanted to retain their honour - never ended an engagement? Sutherland would have been called out by his fiancee's father or brother, and ostracised.<br />I was jerked out of this story by errors far too frequently to have any interest left in the characters, even had I not also found the plot itself tedious.<br />I think I'll be giving Dodd a miss in future.	2002-01-03

I don't need to write a lengthy review of this book, because the review below from bookjunkies has done an excellent job, with the exception of one detail: we, the readers, know from the beginning the true identity of James Gatewood, since this is revealed to us in the prologue.<br />Kelly's descriptions of Oxford - the town and the university - suggests that she knows both places well; I've visited Oxford many times and am familiar with most of the colleges, and I found no anomalies in her depiction of the town. <br />I did particularly like her portrayal of Ellen's frustration at not being able to study and participate in learning, and at her brother's wasting of the opportunity he had. Ellen is so well written as a woman who desperately wants to learn and read and argue and develop her mind, and yet is forbidden by the mores and practices of her day. (Great use of St Hilda's, too, Kelly!). Ellen's debates with James on Shakespeare are very well written, and these encounters were a joy to read.<br />For a very different romance, even from most of Kelly's other novels, this one is well worth a look.	2001-12-29

It's a shame, because a lot of the time she writes Christmas very well; witness A Christmas Promise. However, with this and The Last Waltz, I was disappointed. <br />I'm not really sure why; the story had plenty of potential to grip my emotions. Jack and Isabelle were lovers years earlier, but both misunderstood the nature of their relationship, each in love but believing that the other saw their relationship as only representing a transaction: sex in exchange for money. Isabelle, an actress with a passionate desire to succeed in her craft, knew that Jack hated what she did, and that he resented other men looking at her. In his response to that resentment, he emphasised that her role in his life was as his whore; she hated that description and the implication that he didn't care for her at all, and so she claimed to have other lovers, and then she walked out on him.<br />Now they meet again, eight years later; she's a widow with two children, and he's about to become betrothed at a house party to which they're both invited. Gradually, as they find they can't avoid one another's company, they work through the misunderstandings and realise that they were in love all along - and are still. But Jack's still committed to making an offer to Juliana, his chosen bride, and Isabelle still has a secret untold...<br />Some nice secondary characters, although the family gets very confusing if you haven't read the first book in this mini-series. Overall, though, Jack and Isabelle never made me love them sufficiently, and the book left me unsatisfied.	2001-12-26

I was going to write a lengthy review explaining all the ways in which this book, in its plot and execution, fell short of my expectations and desires, but I see that the reader from Bethesda who wrote the review of 16 March has done all that, very well indeed. Great review, and very accurate in its detailing of this book's shortcomings!<br />There are other grating inaccuracies and impossibilities which also irritated me: for instance, Marcus travelling with his twin nieces without a maid or governess in sight?! No way. Absolutely would that not have happened. These are daughters of a duke. They would be protected and chaperoned at every turn. Marcus may have been a relative, but he was still a man; he would not have been alone with them. <br />And then later in the book, Marcus sends someone to ride from Kent to London, to see his solicitor and a vicar and arrange for a special licence and dispensation to be married after dark, then visit Eliza's friends and get them to Kent for the wedding. All in the same 24-hour period! No chance; that's a complete impossibility. Sure, a rider on a speedy horse could get to London within a day, but do all this and get back again??? And, if I'm not mistaken, a special licence could only be obtained *in person* from the man about to be married, and only from a bishop.<br />I do find it irritating when writers clearly haven't bothered to do the most basic research. <br />Johnston doesn't take care with her language, either: her characters are supposed to be English, and English aristocracy at that, and yet a lot of the time they talk like Americans. Simply omitting contractions doesn't cut it, Ms Johnston. For instance, no young lady of the aristocracy - or even any English person - would talk about 'fixing' hair. One 'arranges', or - for that period and class - 'dresses' hair. That's just one example of several irritating Americanisms which leapt out at me. And Ms Johnston or her editor really needed to pay a little more attention to grammar, especially punctuation.<br />Some of this wouldn't have mattered so much - as with the inaccuracies in Edith Layton's early books - if at any time the characters had engaged my emotions. They did not, in any way. I found them flat and one-dimensional. And when I think of what someone like Mary Balogh or Mary Jo Putney could have done with a premise like this, I feel bitterly disappointed. This premise, in the hands of a Balogh or a Kelly, would have been a tear-jerker. Johnston's book has simply left me bored.	2001-12-21

I've recently had the good fortune to acquire a number of books from Kelly's backlist, and Summer Campaign is the first I read. And I loved it. It's heartwarming and tear-jerking, just like all the best Kellys.<br />Onyx, our heroine, is - in the tradition of much of Kelly's writing - not of the best ton. In fact, she's illegitimate, though brought up in a good family. All her life, though, she's felt that she has to hide, and almost apologise for existing. Now, she has a proposal of marriage: a vicar, Andew Littlewood, has sought her hand. Grateful for the chance to escape her stepmother's tyranny, Onyx accepts.<br />En route to her fiance's home, however, her carriage is held up by a rough band of robbers who also threaten her virtue. Onyx is rescued by a shabbily-dressed soldier, who is shot and almost killed as a result. The soldier is Major Jack Beresford, returning from the Napoleonic Wars - and, it turns out, he knew Onyx's twin brother.<br />Onyx feels a definite bond with Jack, but what can she do? She's already engaged to another man, and anyway, once she discovers that Jack is the brother of a marquess, she knows that he's well out of her reach. She has to put him out of her mind, no matter how much he teases and flirts with her. And yet she knows that he needs her too, in several different ways - to help heal the wounds of war, both physical and mental.<br />This is a wonderful book, ranging from humorous to wistful to angsty to downright tearjerking. I couldn't help but like and feel sorry for Onyx, and who could help falling in love with Jack? And then there's Emily and Adrian, Jack's brother and his wife - also characters I loved getting to know.<br />A classic Carla Kelly, and well worth the collectors' price!	2001-12-19

She's risking scandal, and worse, if she gets caught - but then, she's already the subject of scandal. For she is the estranged, cast-off wife of Lucas Coulter, Marquess of Wortham, the wife he discovered was already pregnant when he married her seven years earlier.<br />And now Lucas is back, and Emma wants a divorce, so she can marry someone else.<br />But Lucas has never forgiven Emma her betrayal of his love and trust, or the fact that she tried to deceive him and make him father another man's child. So he's not about to give her what she wants, especially not if it means that she will drag his family name through the mud yet again. So he refuses to give her a divorce. However, having seen her again, he is reminded of her beauty, and of the fact that he's never actually taken her to bed. So he offers her a bargain: live with him again and bear him an heir, and then he'll divorce her.<br />But what Lucas doesn't know is that Emma was actually raped. Her daughter Jenny is the child of her rapist, and Emma herself has never recovered from the trauma and pain of her one experience in men's passion. So, although she steels herself to accept Lucas, when it actually comes to letting him sleep with her, she panics.<br />To Lucas's credit, he believes her about the rape, and from then on he is kindness itself when it comes to giving Emma time to get accustomed to his touch and to being intimate with him. Dawson handles this aspect of the book very well; contrary to the other reviewer's comment, I didn't find the sensual element of the book at all frustrating. Emma is getting over being raped violently; of course she's not going to throw herself into lovemaking with Lucas in an abandoned manner the first time they're together!<br />I don't know what it wasabout the book which left me with a lukewarm response; I just know that, well-researched and -written though it is, this book didn't engage me in the way a story by Balogh or Beverley or Putney or a couple of other writers do. However, this book is certainly a good read, and I'll keep an eye out for others by this writer.	2001-12-18

At the same time, her ex-fiance, Oliver Rowley (Viscount Elmont) is broke and in danger of being sent to debtors' prison. Into the mix steps Michael Fairgrove, Oliver's friend, who persuades Oliver that he really needs to consider his father's offer: marry Miss Creighton after all, and his debts will be paid.<br />Michael decides to help things along by finding out what Rebecca is like now, so he goes in disguise to hear her speak. The lecture coincides with a riot in the Covent Garden area of London, and Michael ends up rescuing Rebecca from an unruly mob. Then he must find a way to get her safely home, while preventing her from finding out who he really is.<br />And on the way, as they spend almost all the night alone together, they fall in love...<br />But Rebecca is going to marry Oliver, and Michael can never let her discover who he really is. <br />This book does indeed give a fascinating account of London's 'underbelly'; Rebecca and Michael's journey is definitely the most interesting part of it. But later it becomes predictable, and in the end completely implausible - that final scene (okay, no spoilers!) just *could not* have happened.<br />And then there are a couple of errors. Oliver cannot have been Viscount Elmont if his father was the Earl of Elmont; viscountcies do not have the same name as the earldom. Likewise, Rebecca's sister was it Miss Creighton; she is Miss Sarah. Miss Creighton is reserved for the oldest unmarried daughter.<br />Nevertheless, an entertaining one-time read.	2001-12-13

In this book, set a few months after Lucien and Beth's marriage, Leander comes home and, thanks to the war having brought him to a realisation of his own mortality, decides that he really needs to marry and start his own family. However, a few weeks in London shows him only too clearly that he can't choose a bride from the available young women there. For one thing, none of them interest him. For another, they keep falling in love with him! While he can feel nothing more than lukewarm liking for any of them.<br />Not that he understands why this is the case; as he says to Beth Arden, he's not particularly handsome. And, in fact, standing next to the very handsome Lucien, he's nothing much to look at. Though Beth admits - and this is a very clever device, Jo, using the lens of Beth's thoughts to show us what's attractive about Leander - that there is something compelling about him. And Beth also tells us that what is most likely to appeal to women is the impression Leander seems to give of being alone and emotionally in pain. Which he is - except that he doesn't recognise it.<br />Leander's problem is that his upbringing has led him to see romantic love as destructive and not worth the emotional investment. Added to this, he doesn't see himself as capable of falling in love. So, he tells his friends, he wants to marry someone suitable, someone he can like, but who won't fall in love with him.<br />Who better, Beth thinks, than the Weeping Widow? Judith Rossiter, widowed a little over a year since and with two children, who is well known to have been so in love with her husband that she's still grief-stricken. She still wears unrelieved black. So Leander proposes to Judith, secure in the knowledge that she's not going to fall in love with him.<br />Judith, we learn, ceased to love her husband not long after they were married. The only reason she still wears black is that she can't afford anything else! She's very puzzled by this proposal from a nobleman five years younger than her, and at first thinks he's mad. But events lead her to accept his proposal - and now all she has to do is prevent him from finding out that she does actually have strong feelings for him after all...<br />What stops me giving this book five stars, as I gave some of the other Rogue books, is that while I enjoyed it very much I felt that something was missing. The romance was very, very understated; while there are some lovely scenes in this book, such as some of the kissing scenes, I didn't actually feel that I *saw* Judith and Leander fall in love with each other. I almost felt that Leander wasn't so much falling in love with Judith as he was with the idea of a family. So that wasn't quite as fulfilling as the first two books in the series, or The Devil's Heiress.<br />However, one thing I loved about this book was the chance to get a glimpse - well, more than a glimpse - of my favourite heroes and their partners. The book begins with Beth and Lucien at Hartwell, just six weeks after the end of AUB; we see that the promise of a very happy marriage which we were left with in AUB is definitely coming true. And Lucien and Beth play major roles in the first part of the book. Then, towards the end of the book, we get lots of Nicholas and Eleanor (and Arabel), proving that the happy ending of An Arranged Marriage was a lasting one. I do love encountering characters from earlier books later in the series!<br />Definitely one to add to your Jo Beverley collection!	2001-12-12

I picked this book up secondhand recently, and even with the transatlantic postage charges it was well worth the money. This is an example of the kind of story Balogh does best.<br />Truly is one of her 'Welsh novels', and it follows a similar pattern, at least in terms of setting and 'A-plot', as Longing. (Incidentally, I think the reviewer who mentioned Tangled is confusing that book - another Balogh classic, by the way - with Longing). A theme of both of these books is that of a wealthy aristocratic landowner who is made aware - usually by the heroine - of how rents and tithes and other unfair policies are resulting in his tenants starving and being ground into poverty. In these books, in addition, the heroine is not of the hero's class; she's one of the villagers, perhaps a schoolteacher or the minister's daughter.<br />The similarities of theme don't matter one bit to me; both stories are very different, and all unmissable, in my opinion.<br />One of the big differences in Truly is that the Earl of Wyvern, Geraint Penderyn, actually grew up among the village people; he was the son of a governess, whom everyone thought was an unmarried mother. She'd been driven out of her home and lived in a hovel up in the hills. Geraint, until the age of twelve, was a village child, to some degree an outcast, but he was befriended by Margred and by Aled. Then papers were found which confirmed that Geraint's mother was married to his father, and Geraint - now the heir to the earldom - was taken away to London to be brought up in a manner befitting his status. He never saw his mother again; she died when he was 18.<br />The book starts as he is returning to his Welsh estate after ten years away, now the owner of the area in which he grew up, and landlord of all his former friends and neighbours. On his last visit, things had been awkward between him and his childhood friends; he and Margred had begun to fall in love, but he'd handled it badly and she'd been hurt. Now, he's looking forward to seeing her again, although he is pretty sure that she'll be married.<br />What he isn't prepared for is the hostile reaction he gets from all around, and the anger and bitterness Margred throws at him. What he soon finds out is that his agent, in his absence, has behaved like any other landlord and has raised rents year after year, and evicted those who couldn't pay. And changing matters isn't that simple; other landowners in the area are resistant, and he is viewed with suspicion.<br />From Margred's perpective, Geraint is the man she used to love, but whom she now hates with all of her being. For her husband was arrested for trying to help their friends and neighbours, and sentenced to transportation. She wrote to Geraint to beg him to intercede, but he never responded. And since her husband died as a result of his treatment, she blames Geraint for his death.<br />So Geraint has an impossible task in front of him: how to win back the trust of his tenants, how to improve conditions for them - and how to prove to Margred that he still loves her and that he never deliberately betrayed her, even if his neglect caused her pain. His one remaining friend - Aled, now the village blacksmith - plus the continuing Rebecca Riots in the area might offer a way forward...<br />But even if he succeeds in breaking down the barriers between himself and the villagers, there's no guarantee that Margred will be interested. She realises that her feelings for Geraint are conflicted, but that soon becomes less important once she finds herself falling for 'Rebecca', the man in disguise who leads the Rebecca Riots against unjustified tollgates.<br />This is a wonderful story about the importance of loyalty, belonging, the effect of class differences on relationships and ultimately, how love and friendship can overcome differences. It's an unforgettable love story, but it's as much a story about a community and about friendship. Don't miss it!	2001-11-20
1770838:US	52631742	R23QMYZN2Y6ES3	0451408837	351593800	Captured Hearts: Five Favorite Love Stories	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Unexpectedly enjoyable	Anyone who's seen reviews I've written of other anthologies might be expecting a poor review here. But actually, not in this case. For once, I seem to have stumbled across an anthology in which the individual novellas are all very readable, enjoyable, and which suit the format of a shorter length. This is particularly surprising in the case of this anthology, in which all stories are about 70 pages long.<br />Three of my favourite writers are in this five-author anthology, which might have contributed to my enjoyment - but then Putney and Layton's novellas are not set in eighteenth- or nineteenth-century England, which is the setting I'm used to from them. <br />There is something of a theme to the collection, in that four out of five stories concern men who are or who appear to be rogues, and who reform right under the heroine's nose. MJP's contribution, set in Texas a hundred or so years ago, sees a condemned man being taken to hang for murder. Along the way, a young woman - who, it turns out, might have good reason to hate him - takes pity on him and they spend one unforgettable night together. But he's condemned to die, so how can they have a future?<br />Joan Wolf, an author I've never encountered before, sets her story, The Antagonists, in Regency England; the hero and heroine are cousins who grew up together. I would normally have wanted much more to this story, but Wolf uses an interesting technique. The story is told in first person, from the heroine's POV. And since Dinah starts off by telling us how spoilt and nasty her cousin Thorn (the Earl of Thornton) is, we're led off on quite a misleading track. (Although Dinah does reveal that she has a tendency to exaggerate!)<br />Layton's contribution, Buried Treasure, was the disappointment in this collection for me. A pirate narrowly survives a murder attempt and recovers in the house of a beautiful young woman whose seduction he plots. Unfortunately, for reasons related to both his behaviour towards her and to his fellow pirates, I couldn't come to like Dancer at all, and wouldn't want to re-read this novella.<br />Next was Patricia Rice, also new to me; her tale, Fathers and Daughters, covers the well-worn subject-matter of an impoverished suitor who was turned away by the heroine's father. Carolyn also believes that Jack accepted money from her father to walk away from her. Now that he's back, can he possibly convince her that he wasn't only interested in her money, and that he wasn't paid to reject her?<br />Finally, Mary Balogh's Precious Rogue. This is a lovely story, told with Balogh's great skill; Patricia, the poor relation who is effectively her aunt's slave, has no great opinion of her cousin's suitor, Mr Bancroft. After all, the man is an unprincipled rake, and - although no-one else seems to notice - during Patricia's aunt's house party Bancroft conducts clandestine affairs with at least three women. But what Patricia can't ignore is the fact that he is *nice* to her. And she enjoys their verbal fencing... too much for her own good. After all, he's going to marry her cousin...<br />This one is certainly worth a look.	2001-11-15

An English gentleman, Alfred Kensington, newly arrived in the colony of Virginia, rewards the bond-boy who saved his son's life by buying his indenture papers, freeing him, and offering him employment in his household. The boy is strong, good-looking, reliable and intelligent, and eager to please. The only fly in the ointment is that he insists that he's actually an earl - that he was kidnapped five years earlier and sold into slavery. The boy has to be mad!<br />But some years later, when Jared is now 27, he announces that he is going back to England to try to prove that his story is true. He has no expectations of regaining his title and lands, but he wants to confront his uncle, the one who arranged his kidnap. In the meantime, Alfred's daughter Della has fallen deeply in love with Jared, who only sees her as a sister.<br />The scene then shifts to England; Jared journeys to his old home, only to find that the present earl is his younger brother Justin, whom he'd believed dead all those years. He's quickly ensconced as the earl, lord of all he surveys and owner of all the lands and money which go with the title. But he can't help feeling a lingering, nagging sense of guilt about taking everything away from his brother. Even Justin's fiancee, Fiona, was actually betrothed from birth to the Earl... not the earl's younger brother. And it seems that Fiona would be only too happy to switch her affections to Jared.<br />It's into this tangled situation that Della arrives some weeks later, visiting as part of a last-ditch effort to persuade Jared to see her as a woman instead of his sister - and if he won't, to say goodbye. But she quickly realises that there's more going on here than she expected; Jared the Earl is a very different man from Jared the merchant in Virginia. Does she stand a chance with this new Jared?<br />This is a love story, but it's also a story about a man finding out who - and what - he really is. Jared was degraded as a young boy, and he carries the scars of that part of his life still: some visible, such as those on his back, and some invisible and carried inside himself. He can't accept that he is worthy to be an aristocrat, because he was brought so low. His friends and family must convince him - and he must convince himself - that true nobility comes from within, regardless of someone's birth or upbringing. Jared's soulsearching is very well told; sometimes painful, and always engrossing.<br />Very highly recommended - if you can get your hands on a copy, snap it up!

I knew there was a reason I tend to avoid anthologies; this one has reminded me of it with a vengeance. Basically, most anthologies aren't worth the paper they're printed on: you get a selection of authors, some of whom may not be very good, and shorter stories than usual, some of which - if they are at all good - don't benefit from being compressed into under 100 pages.<br />This book is very definitely a case in point. We have novellas from Jo Beverley (normally excellent), Tanya Anne Crosby, Samantha James and Kathleen Woodiwiss - three authors I'd never come across before and whose work therefore I know nothing about. After reading this anthology, I know to avoid their work in future.<br />The Beverley novella, The Determined Bride, was interesting, but I kept feeling that I'd come in halfway through the story. Told by her soldier husband that their marriage hadn't been genuine, Kate desperately wants her baby to be legitimate. Unfortunately, her 'husband' has just been killed in battle. His commanding officer offers to marry her to give the baby a name. Afterwards, Kate returns to England with her son - but what of Captain Charles Tennant, the man she's just married? Does she want him? Does he want her? How does he really feel about having a legal son who is not his biological child?<br />An intriguing premise, written with something close to Beverley's usual style; but too rushed. Perhaps three stars.<br />Next, there is Tanya Anne Crosby's A Kiss After Midnight. Two children brought up together are separated when Victoria's father, a duke, becomes concerned about her friendship with the gardener's son. Can their love survive? What happens when Victoria needs to marry to save her estates? To begin with, I thought her hero, Thomas, was American; his internal narrative in the first few pages is entirely American in dialect and vocabulary. Too many things didn't ring true in this story for me to take it seriously. For instance, apparently Thomas and Victoria drove to Gretna Green in under five hours. So where were they? North of the Lake District and in the middle of nowhere fifty miles south of the border? Unlikely. And did Victoria really not recognise Thomas??<br />Oh, and *what* is &quot;a'tall&quot; supposed to mean? That simply isn't a word. It's not an expression used anywhere in the UK (or in Ireland, in case Crosby thinks it is). If she means 'at all', then she should say so. Terrible. One star.<br />The next story is Samantha James' Scandal's Bride. It was readable, more or less, though Victoria seemed to me to behave like a spoilt brat. I can't understand what Miles saw in her; he should have refused to marry her and insisted that her father sent her back to the country until she grew up. Two stars, maybe.<br />And finally, Kathleen Woodiwiss's Beyond The Kiss. This, I gather, is the sequel to another book by Woodiwiss. She spends the first dozen pages summarising Raelynn and Jeff's story to date (tedious exposition of an overly melodramatic tale) before launching into this story. The language is extremely overblown -talk about purple prose! The dialogue is stilted: I couldn't believe some of Jeff's speeches. Take this:<br />&quot;In my lengthy quest for the woman of my dreams, I cannot deny that I've tested my heart with others, but they never assuaged that unsettled feeling gnawing at my vitals. I tell you no lie, madam, when I say that of those maidens I've courted, I favoured none with a plea to be my wife. Whatever enticements inspired me to seek their company were ephemeral, as fleeting as the morning dew.&quot; Ewwwww!!!!! I couldn't take this guy seriously at all.<br />In fact, I couldn't even finish this story. After 30 pages of it I'd had enough, and it's definitely put me off reading any more by Woodiwiss. I can't believe she's considered to be a top historical fiction writer! Zero stars. <br />Don't waste your money on this one.	2001-11-09

Described as the final book in Edith Layton's C series (and I hope it isn't!), this is at last Drum's story; the Earl of Drummond, friend of Ewen from The Cad, and the man on whom Gilly had such a crush in The Choice. Finally, we get to know Drum better, and to see him make his choice of bride.<br />One thing I learned very quickly about Drum in this book is that he is the son and heir of a duke; so why is he an earl and not a marquess? Minor point; Layton please note, all the same. As the book starts, Drum is very conscious of his duty to his family; he needs to marry and carry on the line. His father has also impressed on him the need to marry *well*: he has a duty to the dukedom to consider a wife worthy of his own rank. But he doesn't know anyone he really cares about enough to marry; and he's seen all his friends marry for love.<br />Drum believes that he just must not be capable of love; if he was, he surely would have fallen in love long ago, just as all his friends did. And he feels very reluctant to marry without love. He did, of course, propose to Gilly in The Choice, but he admits to himself (and Gilly acknowledges to Damon) that he only did it because she was there and in love with him and it was convenient. Now, though, he wonders whether he should just choose a suitable woman and be done with it. Someone like the Lady Annabelle, who has already been let down by his friends Damon and Rafe. <br />Riding through the forest, mulling over all this, he is shot at. Almost killed, he is brought to a cottage belonging to Alexandria Gascoyne and her three adoptive brothers, and there nursed. But because he feels grateful, he starts trying to do things for Alexandria: he builds her a barn and tries to give her money, which she resents because it underlines their difference in status, she being merely a schoolmaster's daughter and by no means good enough for an heir to a dukedom. Alexandria is fighting against her feelings for Drum, knowing that he believes she might try to compromise him or make demands on him in return for her help.<br />But ultimately he wants to help; back in London he misses her and he asks Gilly to invite her to London. He tells himself that he can give Alexandria a nice holiday and perhaps introduce her to a suitable husband. He hadn't counted on his own feelings suddenly being involved...<br />Almost all our old friends appear in The Conquest: Ewen and Bridget, Gilly and Damon, Rafe and Brenna. Drum's father makes a couple of appearances too, and we meet again Brenna's brother Eric, and Lady Annabelle. I was disappointed, though, not to see Wycoff and Lucy. Given that Eric is left single and unhappy, though, I am very much hoping that this will *not* be the last C novel after all!	2001-11-09

This book is the third and final in Beverley's 'Three Guys Named George' series; but it's also in many ways a direct sequel to An Unwilling Bride in the 'Company of Rogues' series. So if you've ever wanted to know what happened to shy Clarissa, the very unwilling fiancee of the evil Lord Deveril, after Deveril was killed by Blanche (and the murder was covered up by the Rogues) in An Unwilling Bride, here's all those loose ends brilliantly tied up.<br />Clarissa, now a year or so older and quite a bit wiser, is the ward of the Duke of Belcraven, a considerable heiress, and about to make her second attempt to enter society. She wants to strike out on her own; fond though she is of Beth Arden, Lucien, the Marquess, scares her. This, for critics of one element of An Unwilling Bride, is the legacy of Luce's one moment of lapse of control. It wasn't all over and forgotten with after all!<br />Hawk, returned at last from the war, finds unwelcome news. His father is deep in debt and has mortgaged the manor to an appalling developer - all the quest for the family title. The title? That of Viscount Deveril. So his father is about to become Lord Deveril, and he wants Deveril's fortune. Hawk's duty is to obtain it, either by proving the will a forgery, or by marrying the Devil's Heiress.<br />But Clarissa is obviously no murderer, nor a fraudster. Instead, she's a fairly plain and shy young woman, but as Hawk gets to know her, he sees that she's beautiful, and intelligent, and fiercely determined to combat the prejudice she encounters as Deveril's heir. Despite himself, he is intrigued.<br />Clarissa knows that Hawk is after her money; but she also knows that someone as plain as her is only going to attract suitors who want her money. And, since she's resigned herself to that eventuality, why not marry someone she *likes*? For she likes Hawk, very much. Too much...<br />And so the game begins, with guilt and lies on both sides, but with a stirring, sensual attraction between Clarissa and Hawk which simmers off the pages. Familiar characters from other books return: Francis Middlethorpe's Aunt Arabella, who is sent by Nicholas to chaperon Clarissa; Nicholas himself, along with Eleanor and Amabel; Therese Bellaire, Con and Susan; Van and Maria; Hal and Blanche (now, there has to be at least one more Rogues book, simply to complete their story!), and, of course, Lucien and Beth. And the Duke and Duchess of Belcraven!<br />And there is also a welcome appearance from one very unexpected character indeed!<br />This is an unmissable, unputdownable book. Don't miss it!	2001-10-28

And it's just as well that this is the only story which interested me, because it was the only one worth reading in this anthology. On its own, Beverley's story would have received four or five stars, but since the others are barely deserving of any, that brings the book as a whole down to two.<br />The first story, A Man Who Can Dance (Maxwell), suffered first and foremost from being far too short; approximately 60 pages is not long enough to develop characters to the point where I could care what happens to them. Besides that, the story was unconvincing and badly written. Since the hero was Scottish, Maxwell seemed to feel the need to ape Scottish inflexions in her dialogue - this chiefly manifested itself by use of 'Tis here and there, which felt extremely false. She compounded this irritant by using 'Tis and 'Twas in *narrative*, which made me want to stop reading the story. One star.<br />Moving on rapidly. The second story, Forevermore (Royal), is actually the second in a series by this author, thus putting at a disadvantage anyone who has not read the first book. Besides that, it also suffered from 'anthology-itis', in that it was too short and the characters and plot insufficiently well developed. Again, I didn't really care whether the characters got together or not. That apart, I found the ending very unsatisfying. One star.<br />The third story, Written in the Stars (Reding), was better written than either of the first two, and actually a little more interesting. The plot - young woman has been in love with her brother's best friend almost all his life, and now that he's home from the war he realises that he loves her too - was good and interesting. However, the 'magical' elements which surrounded it: dreams, 'signs', stormsand portents, were very off-putting. Two stars, perhaps.<br />And then we have Beverley's The Demon's Mistress. I wanted this story because it's actually the first in her Three Georges series, and I'd read The Dragon's Bride a few months ago without realising that there was another story preceding it. This one is about George Vandeimen, known as Van, who returns from Waterloo to find his father having committed suicide and his estates in ruins. In an attempt to recoup his fortune, he loses a fortune at the gaming tables, and attempts suicide. However, the widow of the man who was chiefly responsible for Van's father's misfortunes wants to help, and in order to do so in a manner which she knows Van will accept, she offers him a bargain. Act as her fiance for six weeks in order to deter fortune-hunters, and she will pay him twenty thousand pounds...<br />This, in typical Beverley fashion, is a beautifully-written story, with compelling plot and excellent characterisation. My only complaint is that I think it would have been better as a full-length novel instead of a 100-page novella; I would have liked to see much more exploration of both Van's and Maria's feelings as they fell in love, and more history of the three George's friendship would have been good. Four/five stars.	2001-10-25

She manages to get a job at the Magnum Corporation, a company she's admired all her life, but finds that she's paid less than male entrants and given insufficient responsibility. Doing some research, she comes up with an idea to apply the new science of computers to the company's European division, and persuades Jack Magnus, son of the Machiavellian owner, to support her scheme.<br />Along the way, she and Jack fall in love and plan to marry... until, just before her computerisation project is about to go online, Francie is sacked and Jack marries the woman his father selected as his bride long before. Jilted and betrayed, she starts her own company and sets out to get revenge on the Magnum Corporation, and Jack and Anton Magnum in particular.<br />I did find the business and computer plots interesting, much more so than I'd anticipated; this aspect of the book is well-written and there are some likeable secondary characters here too. The sub-plot of Anton Magnus's relationship with his family is also well-told, including the sad story of his daughter Juliet, whom Anton has been raping since she was six years old and whose one chance at happiness Anton destroyed.<br />But I had problems with the characterisation of Jack and Francie. Jack, we were told at the start of the book (from the point of view of both Anton and Jack), did not want to take over the Magnus Corporation. He intended to quit and start his own business. Anton desperately wanted to bring him to heel and hand over the business to him. And yet, when Jack betrays Francie and marries Belinda, we're told that he did this because it was the only way his father would make him his heir. Huh? - he didn't *want* to take over the corporation! I could accept Jack being the villainof the piece; but Gage set that aspect of the plot up wrongly.<br />We were given too little insight into Francie's motives and feelings once we got past her jilting by Jack. I suppose Gage wanted us to believe that she was trusting Jack again - though I certainly didn't. However, I did want to know how she felt about Sam - kind, considerate, brilliant Sam Carpenter, who - the way Gage wrote the story - was completely shut out of Francie's plans and thought processes. I could understand Sam forgiving Francie if I thought that she'd at least told him something of what was going on.<br />I think the cover was a big mistake. Looking at the picture - a woman's legs, encased in stockings and suspenders, and with a cane in the woman's hand - readers are led to expect something overtly sexy, if not kinky, rather than the dramatic plot we actually get. Sure, there are sex scenes in the book, but not those implied by the cover - which actually cheapens the book. I found the title inappropriate too, and can't see why Gage didn't continue the chess metaphor. 'Master' certainly works in that context, but 'stroke' does not.	2001-09-21

And that's why, when the handsome, charming and genuinely *nice* Joe Roth asks her out, she's needlessly cruel to him. Last chance saloon? She couldn't care less.<br />Until suddenly it's *Fintan* - Fintan, the golden boy, blissfully happy with his boyfriend Sandro - who's really in the Last Chance Saloon. Fintan is very seriously ill - not with AIDS, thankfully, but with Hodgkin's Disease. And it's very possible that he might die... Suddenly, life begins to look very different to both Katherine and Tara, and they start to re-evaluate their priorities and what they want out of life.<br />There are some wonderful secondary characters in this book, too: Sandro, Fintan's boyfriend; Joe Roth; Fintan's family, the O'Gradys - especially Milo; Liv, Katherine and Tara's former flatmate; and the egotistical Lorcan, whom we all want to see come a cropper before the end of the book. In this, as in so many ways, Last Chance Saloon is reminiscent of Maeve Binchy at her best. (Oh, and to the reviewer who thought the character names were odd: these are all quite normal Irish names).<br />Ever since Watermelon, I've been waiting for Marian Keyes to write another book genuinely worth reading. I loved Watermelon: it was funny and poignant and romantic. Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married was a mistake: it was juvenile and tedious. Rachel's Holiday was better, but it felt as if a serious subject was being trivialised - though that may have been the first-person narrative. Last Chance Saloon, however, at last shows what Keyes is really capable of. <br />I preferred the third-person narrative in this book, and the fact that, as a result, Keyes gave us a rounded picture of both Katherine and Tara - a less rounded picture of Fintan, but then it was interesting to view him through others' eyes. In many ways, he is a pivotal character in the plot development.<br />Next up: Sushi For Beginners, which I really hope is as good as this book! I think, in Marian Keyes, we may have found Maeve Binchy's successor for modern Ireland.	2001-09-10

I've finally found another author to sit alongside Putney, Balogh and Beverley on my all-time best historical writers shelf. Loretta Chase, with Lord of Scoundrels, has produced a compelling and very readable, unputdownable masterpiece.<br />Sebastian Ballister, son of a late marriage between the late Marquess of Dain and the daughter of an Italian count, has never known love. Abandoned by his mother, all-but disowned by his father and bullied at school on account of his oversized body, protuberant nose and foreign looks, at an early age he learned how to get the better of people. And when he almost found himself trapped into marriage for his money, he vowed to steer clear of the ton and to focus his attentions on gambling (but only if he won) and vice.<br />The Marquess of Dain, therefore, is known as the biggest rogue in Christendom; Lord of Scoundrels or Beelezebub, as his friends call him. <br />Jessica Trent, sensible sister of one of Dain's satellites, Bertie, wants to free her brother from Dain's influence. Believing that Dain is no doubt the devil incarnate, she is shocked to discover that, on seeing him for the first time, she actually wants to rip his clothes off. The attraction is dangerously mutual, as they discover when Dain manages to send Bertie off and he and Jessica have coffee together in a Parisian cafe. They get involved in a dangerous flirting game which ends with Dain unbuttoning her glove. Attraction sparks between them.<br />Dain, angry with Jessica for having bested him in acquiring something he wants, threatens to ruin her reputation if she doesn't give it to him. She points out that it is *his* reputation which is more likely to be ruined: after all, he *never* bothers with respectable women and has foresworn anything as mundane as marriage. If he is seen too frequently with Jessica, his reputation as the lord of vice will be destroyed.<br />And yet, when they both have so much to lose, they can't stay away from each other... and then disaster strikes. As the cover description points out, they're seen in a compromising situation. Dain could have made things better, but his darker nature makes him say the cruellest thing possible; and then he abandons Jessica. <br />However, Jessica is no ordinary heroine; she goes after Dain with a gun!<br />I couldn't bear to put this book down. The characters are cleverly and richly drawn, and the plot is both engaging and gripping. Dain is a wonderfully complex hero: commanding and powerful on the one hand, but deeply vulnerable and in need of love on the other. He thinks himself ugly and can't see why any woman - especially a beautiful woman like Jessica - would want him, if not for his money. He can't admit to himself that Jessica actually means something to him beyond mere lust, because that would mean that he'd be admitting that he needs another person in his life, that he's not self-sufficient. <br />Jessica is a marvellous heroine. She's sensible, intelligent, but not prudish or stiff-rumped. She admits to herself early on that she's attracted to Dain, and that she can't keep away. Not (at first) knowing that he considers himself ugly, all she knows is that he's completely gorgeous! And when he almost destroys her, she determines that he's not going to get away with it. But then she starts to see through his bluster and his threats; her experience with helping to bring up her relatives' young sons have taught her a lot about the male psyche and in particular masculine pride. As such, Jessica doesn't take offence and storm off, as many such heroines in other books might do. Instead, she plots and uses her intuition to figure out what might be going through Dain's head - and most of the time, she's right.<br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable love story, a definite keeper. If only it didn't have such a horrible cover!!	2001-08-20

I don't read many books where I'm tempted to skim by about the second chapter, but this was one. <br />The plot was straightfroward fare: new Earl inherits title, a pile of debt and three unmarried daughters from his profligate brother. How can he make ends meet and find husbands for his nieces, who are not exactly the most marriageable young women around? Then, in the first plot development requiring suspension of disblief, a woman - Riley Fontaine - who runs her own theatre company (in the 1790s?!?) visits the Earl and actually lets him know that her company owes him money - now, once she'd realised that he knew nothing about it, why on earth didn't she make her escape immediately?<br />Anyway, be that as it may, through a convoluted process Riley is then employed to teach the Earl's nieces how to behave on the Marriage Mart. As if! A ridiculous idea in the circumstances. And the Earl and Riley are attracted to each other, but he needs to marry for money. Oh, and at the same time, through some dastardly plot by a cousin who wants the money Riley never knew she had, someone's trying to kill her. Because, as the prologue tells us - now, wouldn't it have been more interesting to keep this information hidden, Ms Boyle? - Riley is actually the granddaughter of a countess and the heir to the title and lands herself.<br />I don't know where the comedy was. All I saw was ludicrous farce, in scene after scene which made me cringe. Cousin Felicity - how irritating was she?! And her nosey friend. And Mason, the Earl's, friends too! As for the nieces, I can't really comment, because they were so poorly drawn I didn't find out anything at all about them. They could have been interesting characters, but instead they were shadowy, caricatured sketches.<br />And then Ms Boyle is another writer who doesn't appear to consider that it's important to make her characters *sound* authentic. I don't mean that she should pepper dialogue with eighteenth-century slang; but at the very least her characters should *not* use contemporary American phrasing! I lost count of the number of times I winced when a character said something which was completely wrong either for the country or the period. <br />I definitely made a mistake buying this book.	2001-08-13

Mary Balogh did this so much better in Unforgiven. <br />Lucien left Arabella ten years ago, when he inherited his father's title, and married a rich heiress in order to save his family from ruin. Arabella, feeling that she was already ruined, stayed at home and never married; now her father's dead too, she's desperately trying to keep her family and home together and safe from various debt collectors. And then Lucien, now widowed and rich, stumbles across her path.<br />Um. So why did Arabella never marry? Sulking at home? She was a beautiful young woman, and her father did have some money when she was younger. And why did Lucien stay on at Rosemount? Good manners dictated that he should have left once he was fit; his hostess made it clear he wasn't welcome, and the sole male occupant was an invalid - hardly adequate chaperonage, and not at all credible for the period.<br />But then, much of this book is incredible for the period. Lucien wandering around shirtless? (and while we're on the subject, what a horrible cover for the book!) Arabella wearing breeches around her property? Robert - wheelchair-bound or not - letting her run the estate? And then the scheming and manipulating was beyond belief. I didn't find Arabella's aunts anything other than annoying.<br />Then there is the fact that Hawkins hasn't even done the most basic research. If you're going to write about the British nobility, then make sure you know what you're talking about! Who on earth is 'Sir Laughton', a baron? If his title is 'Sir', he's a baronet, not a baron. And he is 'Sir David' - baronets' titles attach to the first name, not the surname. And how could Lucien have been a viscount when he'd known Arabella years earlier? He inherited the dukedom when his father died. The heir to a dukedom is a marquis. All these inaccuracies were very irritating, and suggest an author who hasn't done her homework.<br />There were loose ends here, too - so who was the duke who was previously at Rosemount, as Sir David Laughton mentions to Lucien? We're never told. And just what happened to Lord Holdford, who was after Arabella and appeared to be up to no good, since he was seen many times with the bad guys? And surely Lucien has properties and a main residence of his own - why look on Rosemount as his home? It actually belongs to *Robert*, remember!<br />Oh, and if anyone is thinking of reading the book, don't read the plot summary on the back first. There is a major plot spoiler there, referring to something which doesn't happen until 50 pages from the end of an almost-400 page book.	2001-08-05

Her mother is carefully grooming her for a life as a high-class mistress, as it's the only life Rosalind has known and she believes that it's the best way for Gabrielle to find security. Gabrielle, on the other hand, wants to be married. She wants respectability, the security of being legally bound to a man, and to have children who know both their parents.<br />So she runs away, only to end up in Haymarket rejecting propositions. She is then rescued by a campaigning reformer, and when she gets away from him, she's abducted by Pierce St James, the Earl of Sandbourne. Sandbourne is trying to find evidence that the reformer - Prime Minister William Gladstone himself - actually consorts with prostitutes.<br />So Gabrielle and Sandbourne strike an agreement. She will help him find evidence against Gladstone, if he will pretend to be her lover and provide a cover for her to find a man to marry. Sandbourne agrees, thinking that it sounds vaguely entertaining and assuming that he'll make it into her bed pretty soon anyway.<br />Only things don't quite work out that way; they conduct what appears to be a scandalous liaison under Gabrielle's mother's roof, but Sandbourne has never had any women read him morality tales before, or play bawdy coffee-house songs with him! So very soon he's completely intrigued by Gabrielle. And determined to make her his mistress in reality.<br />But he becomes her friend first... and then he tries to take their relationship further, and things change completely.<br />There is some very good use of historical detail in this book, including senior political figures of the day, Machiavellian intrigue and so on. I was aware of Gladstone's interest in prostitutes, and it was interesting to see this feature in a novel. However, here and there the dialogue wasn't really appropriate for the period; while there weren't many examples of contemporary Americanisms, there were certainly expressions which weren't in common usage in Victorian times. And British Rail certainly didn't exist then; this was well before nationalisation!<br />Those minor criticisms apart, an enjoyable book.	2001-07-30

Wealthy woman's relative tries to kill her by drowning her. She's rescued by some sort of pirate/robber, with whom she - naturally! - falls in love. She decides that she needs to marry in order to protect her fortune, so she marries her criminal. And then tries to pass him off as an aristocrat! <br />I'm sorry, but please! <br />A one-time read which went straight into the charity bag afterwards.	2001-07-24

It was encouraging to see that 'Sweet' Willy Hampton, from Oliver's Seven Corinthians series is a major secondary character in this book (and she actually goes to great lengths to tell us that this is a linked book in the same series, with references not only to the Earl of Mansfield, from the first book in the series, but also to the 'Seven Corinthians' as a group). One of these days, I hope Oliver will give Willy his own story. He certainly deserves it, as does David Laughton from earlier books.<br />Ten years ago, Mathilda was betrothed to Miles Stephen, heir to the Earl of Southwood. But his chilly, unloverlike nature made her unhappy, and the night before the wedding she ran off with his best friend. Now, widowed and with two sons, she returns to London. And one of the first people she runs into is Miles.<br />Miles is older and wiser, but still scarred by the shock of being jilted; his ego certainly suffered a severe blow, but we also realise that he did actually love Mathilda then. He just didn't know how to show it. Mathilda, too, is older and has matured from the silly eighteen-year-old we see in that coach at the beginning of the book. Is it possible that they can somehow unravel the tangle of the past and forgive each other?<br />Mathilda certainly feels a strong sense of guilt at her past behaviour and only wants to avoid any further hurt to Miles. Miles, though, discovers that the more he sees of Mathilda, the more he loves her. Can his love become stronger than his burning desire to avenge himself on her? Can Mathilda's forgiving nature allow her to look past Miles' darker soul?<br />I did enjoy this book. It's still not back to the standard of Oliver's best, such as An Unsuitable Wife or Lord Gresham's Lady, but it's getting there. Now, please, more in this series!	2001-07-22

Now 26, she is going to London for the first time to have some fun. For Rosalind has been feeling ill lately and, because her mother died from an illness the nature of which was always kept from the family, she thinks she's now suffering from the same thing. A local doctor has agreed with her self-diagnosis of a few months to live.<br />So she wants to visit her notorious Aunt Fanny and experience everything she can possibly manage to fit in. Trips to the theatre, balls, masquerades, drives in the part, flirting with handsome gentlemen, maybe even a kiss or two. And once she meets her aunt's good friend, Max Devenant, she wants even more than that.<br />Max, once he realises that Rosalind isn't going to swoon if he says something improper, is only too happy to assist her in scandalising Society: waltzing with her in Almack's before she has permission - and holding her far too close! Attending masquerades with her and kissing her in public. Helping her to attend gambling dens dressed as a man. And, ultimately, showing her how rakes treat women they admire.<br />But then Rosalind discovers that her diagnosis was wrong and that she's perfectly healthy and, ashamed of her actions, she runs off back to Devon and abandons Max, to whom she is now more than an agreeable flirt. Can he win her back?<br />I enjoyed this book, the second I've read by Hern. However, a few niggles left me unable to rate it more highly. The diagnosis of Rosalind's 'illness' was badly handled; why would any doctor confirm something the nature of which he wasn't aware of? Rosalind's status as an instant hit at balls and so on was surprising, considering her age; she would more likely have been sniggered at as an ape-leader or something. And I couldn't take seriously her sudden flight and rejection of Max once she knew that she wasn't sick after all. <br />Other than those, this is an entertaining book.	2001-07-22
1918026:US	52631742	RBA4SWFZMA8N9	0804119554	900455028	Fallen	Books	3	4	5	N	N	A somewhat disappointing sequel to Entwined	Gabriel, Earl of Rivaulx, has narrowly escaped from the Peninsular war with his life; indeed, his family and close friends all thought he was dead until he suddenly resurfaced. However, he carries the shame of knowing that he allowed himself to be duped and seduced so that the secret papers he carried could be stolen; as such, many brave men died. He blames himself, and since his return has led a life of dissolution, alienating all but one of his former friends.<br />But Nathan, Marquess of Oriel (from Entwined) has a mission for Gabriel: one deadly enemy is still on the loose, and they think he's based on the isle of Skye. Gabriel sees this as his one chance of redemption, so he journeys to Skye in search of l'Ecossais, the Scotsman. And on Skye, he's told, Nathan's in-laws live, and they will provide an excuse for his presence on the island.<br />The McLeods, with help from Nathan, have moved back to Syke: Jamie the drunken father, Tessa the young and insatiably curious girl... and Maggie, Isobel's older sister. Gabriel and Maggie are attracted to each other at first sight, but Gabriel's mission will ultimately result in his arresting, or possibly killing, one of Maggie's friends. Can their relationship have any future?<br />I didn't like this book anything like as much as Entwined. To me, the A-plot detracted too much from the romance; Gabriel seemed to spend more time thinking about his mission than about Maggie. I wouldn't have minded if he'd spent time brooding about what had happened on the Continent - and it would have been nice to have seen him eventually forgive himself - but the plot revolving around the Scottish traitor didn't really interest me that much. I also felt that there were far too many secondary characters, and that these led to further unimportant scenes which pulled attention away from Gabriel and Maggie. <br />The ghost story around which much of the book revolved was marginally interesting, but personally I thought the romance would have worked better without it. And the old rhyme theme was somewhat distracting, since I've never heard it as '*savoury*, sage, rosemary and thyme'; I have only ever seen or heard 'parsley'. <br />It was certainly nice to see Isobel's sister turning out to be the love interest for Nathan's best friend; true. But Jensen can do so much better than this!<br />Nevertheless, I'll still look out for the third book in the series - about St Wulfstan, perhaps? And possibly Tessa?	2001-07-15

Gentleman rescues waif of indeterminate age and background and raises her as his ward; discovers that she's older than he thought she was; falls in love with her, but has too much of a sense of propriety to tell her of his feelings.<br />That's the main story here, but there's a lot more to it besides. This is the second Veryan I've read (so far I haven't really seen reason to find more), and I had not read the Sanguinet series referred to by the first reviewer here. Thus so many of the characters who will be familiar to readers of the series were not so to me, and their presence in the book seemed distracting and often confusing. Yet again, may I issue a plea to publishers to *tell* readers when a book is part of a series???<br />Apart from the characters from other books, I found Veryan's attempts at humour embarrassing. In particular, Josie's party was toe-curling, especially when King George IV arrived out of the blue. Puh-lease!<br />Other than that, the romance element was substantially missing here. We knew that Alain loved Josie, but only because his close friends accused him of wanting her for himself and he didn't deny it. We certainly didn't know how Josie felt! Although there were scenes written from Josie's POV, her feelings were never made clear in any sense. Sure, we could tell that she cared for Alain, but as a ward or a would-be lover? Who knows?<br />The best part of the book is the point where Alain goes to the surgeon (no further spoilers here); this is a very poignant part, and perhaps merits the book 2.5 stars. Other than that, I would call this a one-time, don't-much-care-how-it-ends read.	2001-07-15

He's cool, collected and not at all troubled by his opponent, the husband of his supposed lover. Until the order to fire is about to be given, and a scream echoes across Hyde Park; a young woman's voice yelling, &quot;STOP!&quot;. Tresham lowers his pistol, but his opponent does not, shooting him in the upper calf. Furious, Tresham delopes - as is his habit in duels - then, in agony, orders the young woman to his side, lashing her with his tongue and demanding that she remains to support him while the surgeon examines him, thus deliberately making her late for work.<br />Having been sacked unless she can produce evidence that her excuse was true, Jane Ingleby turns up at Tresham's home to induce the Duke to write a note for her. She's mistaken for the doctor's assistant and is conducted to his bedchamber, where she ends up helping the doctor to remove the bullet. Furious at her presumption, Tresham employs her as his nurse for the three weeks he will be immobile, telling her that he will soon make her believe that killing her would have been preferable.<br />But Jane turns out to be a surprising companion. No-one has ever spoken to Tresham as she does; she refuses to be cowed, only calls him 'your grace' with reluctance and only as long as he calls her 'Miss Ingleby', she argues with him and entertains him... and, he discovers, has an understanding and compassionate nature. She can also sing like an angel. And he is more attracted to her - his servant - than to any woman he's ever known before.<br />Jane, too, finds herself becoming more and more attached to the rakish, arrogant Duke, to the point that she is tempted to confide in him the truth about who she is and the fact that she's on the run having been accused of murder. And she doesn't want to leave him... so when he offers her a position as his mistress, she accepts. Because it would offer her further protection and enable her to stay hidden, and also because she loves him.<br />Thinking of it as a business arrangement, as all other such arrangements have been, Tresham sets her up in a house and she becomes his mistress. But very soon, in that blissful first week in which they spend almost every hour of every day in each other's company and Jocelyn rediscovers his love of art and music, she becomes so much more than a mistress. Jocelyn, Duke of Tresham, has found his first real friend.<br />And then... well, other reviews have dealt with Jocelyn's discovery of Jane's true identity as Lady Sara Illingsworth and his reaction to it, the breakdown of their relationship.<br />In my opinion, this is Balogh's best book yet, better even than Precious Jewel, Tempting Harriet, Longing and other favourites. The developing relationship between Jocelyn and Jane is beautiful to read; I re-read some of those early chapters immediately upon finishing the book. It's all in the subtleties of dialogue; one word can say so much, as another reviewer commented. Then there are the scenes which make your heart stop: that very first kiss in the music-room, when both are vulnerable and barriers are lowered. The fond, almost loving kiss after the party when he tells her that she can't stay. The moment when, once she agrees to be his mistress, she calls him Jocelyn for the first time. Their first lovemaking - even though he retreats afterwards and calls it 'sex' and 'bedwork'. And those poignant days when they sit together and talk in Jane's den; when he tells her about his chldhood and reveals his utter vulnerability. And, yes, that later kiss others have mentioned, the night before his next duel, where they say not a word to each other.<br />I too am glad that I didn't read the reviews here before I read the book; I utterly disagree with those who said that the resolution took too long, or who blamed Jane for not forgiving Jocelyn. What about his manner whenever they talked? When one word of kindness or lovefrom him would have made her run to him - and he knew it - he remained arrogant and haughty, even after the duel when he knew she'd come because she cared.<br />This is now one of my absolute favourite historical romances, along with Putney's Thunder and Roses and Beverley's Devilish. It's that good.	2001-07-12

Which, she claims, does not bother her, though we, the readers, suspect that this isn't the case. Then the bombshell strikes: Bruce has just got a column with a popular national women's magazine, and his first column is entitled 'Loving a Larger Woman'. And guess what? It's about him and Cannie, to whom he refers as his ex.<br />Cannie has never thought of herself as a larger woman until this point. And the article is crueller still: it begins 'I will never forget the day I discovered that my girlfriend weighs more than me.' And finishes: 'Loving a larger woman is an act of courage in the modern world'.<br />Naturally, she is humiliated, and the relationship is now completely over. Too late, she reads the full article, only to discover that it wasn't cruel after all, that Bruce understood her insecurities and hang-ups only too well all along, and that he loved her regardless of them. Her weight was an issue with her, not with him, and his reference to loving her being an act of courage meant that she, not him, made it difficult for them to be together because she could never quite convince herself that he loved her.<br />This is an extraordinary article, written with sensitivity and feeling. So here's my first problem with the book: we're supposed to believe that Bruce is an insensitive, uncaring loser. Huh? The guy who wrote that article? I also find it hard to believe that the guy who wrote that article is the same one who responded as he did to Cannie's letter telling him that she's pregnant.<br />Other reviewers have outlined other aspects of the plot. Count me in with those who found the Hollywood twist too fantastic, and actually a detraction from what was a good, sincere and intelligent story. I couldn't take the screenplay and the sudden best-friends with a movie star development at all seriously, and certainly not Cannie's flirtation with a film heart-throb who appeared to find her incredibly attractive, despite her large figure and her obvious pregnancy. That part of the book was wasted space to me.<br />However, there were other elements in the book I really enjoyed, such as Cannie's speech to the nurse in the diet center, Dr K, and the insights into what it's like to be more than just a little plump. I know I'll understand my larger friends better having read this book.	2001-07-11

In the previous Company of Rogues book, Forbidden, there are a couple of brief mentions of Miles Cavanagh and his 'wild ward', Felicity - including one reference to Felicity being tied to a chair to prevent her escaping. Quite naturally, that intrigued me and made me very curious indeed. So here, at last, is Miles and Felicity's story, and I got to find out why she and Miles were clearly striking sparks off each other.<br />Miles has just returned home to his Irish estate - where he is heir to the Earl of Kilgoran, one of the oldest and most respected Irish titles - when he discovers that his step-father's uncle has just died and left Miles, *not* his step-father, guardian to Felicity for the six weeks until she turns 21. <br />So Miles has to go to meet the young woman he is responsible for... but runs into difficulty when he is kidnapped and tied up. When he's released, it's by a local woman who offers him her body in exchange for his silence about what happened. He almost accepts... then discovers that *this* is Felicity. And now he knows what a hurdle he has to overcome - and he soon discovers that it's an even bigger one, once she informs him of her intention to marry a local *very* unpleasant character, whose son she seems very attached to.<br />Somewhat unusually for a romance novel, Miles and Felicity acknowledge their feelings for each other - first lust, and soon afterwards love - very early in the book; the plot, from there on, is concerned with ensuring that they are free to marry. As to why - as we know from Forbidden - Miles actually takes her prisoner; well, this all has to do with the villain of the piece, and you'll have to read the book itself to find out exactly what Felicity's relationship is to Rupert Dunsmore, a man she clearly despises yet insists she wants to marry.<br />In among all the drama, this is a hilarious book, full of witty dialogue humorous situations, and cats. Lots of cats! And also plenty of the other Rogues; no Nicholas, unfortunately, but Lucien and Beth, and Hal and Blanche, play quite significant roles. So if you're a Lucien fan, as I am, you'll love seeing him again.<br />The only slight niggle, for me, was Beverley's insistence on - again - picturing Ireland as a country in which magical things happen; as an Irish person, that vision of my country irritates me somewhat. However, I ignored that and thoroughly enjoyed the next in the Company of Rogues series. On to The Dragon's Bride!	2001-07-07

Now, Con is the Rogue about whom I knew least before reading The Dragon's Bride; we'd been told that he was a soldier, and that he'd survived the Napoleonic wars. He was also 'around' - but just as a name; he never actually took part in any of the plot - in Dangerous Joy. Here, for the first time, we get to know him.<br />Con has just inherited the Earldom of Wyvern, and so is returning to Crag Wyvern in Devon, a place he has not visited for eleven years. We're also told that he has a lot of buried pain - from the death of Dare (Lord Darius, another Rogue) during the war - and that this is preventing him seeking out his friends for any more than the kind of superficial contact he'd had with Lucien and several others when hunting. He's also avoiding friends from his home in Sussex - friends we've never enountered before, since they're not Rogues. And he's contemplating marriage to Lady Anne Peckworth, Francis' jilted fiancee from Forbidden. Poor Lady Anne - as is obvious since we know that this is Con and Susan's story - gets abandoned again.<br />(It's only later, in Beverley's author's note, that we discover that The Dragon's Bride is actually a bridge between two series, the Company of Rogues and a series she refers to jokingly as Three Guys Named George - Con's real name being George Connaught Somerford. The first story in this second series is in the anthology entitled In Praise of Younger Men, and is about Van, a character referred to in his absence in this book. Hawk, Con's other non-Rogue friend, appears in this book and his story is told in the forthcoming The Devil's Heiress).<br />To resume. Back in Devon, Susan Kerslake - the sister and illegitimate daughter of a smuggler - dreads the arrival of the new Earl of Wyvern, because eleven years ago, when they were both fifteen, they had briefly been lovers. Then she'd sent him away believing her to be a fortune-hunter, because she'd made it clear thatshe wished he and not his (now dead) older brother was the heir to the Earldom. And now, she is Con's housekeeper, and has the responsibility of keeping secret her brother's leadership of the local smuggling gang.<br />So, when the two former lovers meet, there is a certain amount of friction. There are also mysteries: missing gold, the question of how the old Earl died, Con's secrets, the lovers Susan admits to having in the meantime and so on. And we're introduced to other characters - Susan's brother and cousin, Con's intriguing secretary Race (about whom Beverley half-promises a separate book at some future date), and Hawk.<br />I give this book a lower rating than the other books in his series for a few reasons. First, I was very disappointed that, apart from two brief scenes with Nicholas, the other Rogues don't figure in this book. It's clear now, of course, that Beverley wanted to introduce Hawk and Race; but Con was such an unknown quantity at the start of this book that having a couple of other Rogues around would have helped. It's one of the features of this series that I really enjoy: being able to meet loved characters again in subsequent books.<br />Second, because I didn't know about the second series Beverley was beginning, I felt all at sea with Con's thoughts of people I had no knowledge of; the fact that his friend Van's story had already taken place didn't help. It was very clear that there was something important going on with Con and Van, since Van was frequently in Con's thoughts, and this distracted from the main story.<br />Third, and most important, I never really took to Susan. In all Beverley's other books, with the exception of Forbidden Magic, I have come to love both hero and heroine, to say nothing of minor characters; here, I found myself struggling to like Susan. It wasn't just because of what she'd done to Con when they were first lovers: she was fifteen then, and could be excused. It was because of the way she behaved here; for example, she kept thinking that if only she could wipe the slate clean and tell Con she was sorry, she'd do it. And that she intended to be completely honest with him in future; she didn't want there to be any more lies between them. And yet there were plenty of opportunities where Susan had to choose between truth and more lies - and she lied. And on more than one of those occasions I simply couldn't see any good reason or justification for the lie. So Susan is not my favourite Rogue wife by any means, and I cannot see myself re-reading this book with anything like the same degree of frequency as I'll re-read the other Rogue books.	2001-07-07

But I decided that it was time to give it another try, to see whether my tastes had changed with maturity. Not in this case, it seems.<br />I realise that this book is in the Gothic style, and of course even Jane Austen tried one Gothic novel - which I don't like anything like as much as the other Austens. My problem with Cousin Kate, however, wasn't its Gothic content, but the fact that much of it is extremely boring. Heyer's other works are full of witty dialogue and entertaining characters; here, the dialogue is dull, the characters uninteresting (even the hero, Philip Broome, failed to excite me), and the narration and introspection tedious. I realise that Heyer is trying, for some part of the book, to indicate Kate's boredom with her situation, but there's no need to bore the readers at the same time!<br />I couldn't really come to like Kate much, at the same time. She's a young woman of quality - lower-ranking aristocracy - fallen on hard times, like a number of Heyer's other heroines, but without the character or determination or resilience of those other heroines. She hasn't got an ounce of Ancilla Trent's independence and resourcefulness, for example. I found myself gritting my teeth at the way Kate takes her old nurse, Sarah Nidd, for granted: the woman left her family's employ many years earlier and is married with her own family, and yet Kate assumes that she can simply descend on Sarah any time she wants, and be waited on hand and foot - for nothing - in Sarah's own home. No wonder Sarah wrote to Kate's aunt Minerva!<br />However, this is clearly an aberration among Heyer's usual excellent work. And I don't agree with a previous reviewer that it marked a decline in her talent; Lady of Quality, to which that reviewer refers, is another highly enjoyable Heyer.	2001-06-30

Instead of her more usual London or Bath settings, in this delightful novel - which is a comedy of manners every bit as much as a romance - Heyer takes her characters to the village of Oversett, in Yorkshire, close to Harrogate and Leeds. Sir Waldo Hawkridge has just inherited the run-down and ramshackle estate of Joseph Calver, purely on the basis that Sir Waldo was the only relative 'who paid as little notice of me as I did of him'. Naturally, there are relatives who are unhappy about this bequest, and these add a further element of humour to the tale, especially when one - Laurence Calver - follows Waldo to Oversett.<br />Society in Oversett may not be what Sir Waldo is accustomed to, but the local residents are very quick to include him in their activities: balls, routs, simple country dinners, the ridotto that no-one came to, and quiet evening entertainments. It helps that Sir Waldo is known in London circles as 'The Nonesuch', a great Corinthian admired by many. And his nephew, Lord Lindeth, a charming and handsome young man, is of course the delight of the young unmarried girls.<br />However, Sir Waldo appears to be most intrigued by Ancilla Trent, who is, she informs him, a most superior governess/companion. Her charge is the Beautiful Miss Tiffany Wield, quite the most lovely girl Sir Waldo has ever seen... but whose personality by no means matches her looks. <br />This is where Heyer's talent for humour comes to the fore. Tiffany is an incredibly selfish and self-centred young woman, and Waldo and Ancilla frequently join forces in a hilarious manner in order to make her see the error of her ways - not to criticise her, for she would refuse to listen, but to persuade her that such behaviour would cause her to lose her looks, or to make the mythical Marquis she wishes to marry to have a disgust of her.<br />Ancilla certainly finds Waldo's company congenial - and more than that, he makes her laugh. But it never occurs to her that his interest in her is any greater than the fact that she is intelligent and can actually make conversation - after all, one of these days he will return to London and forget all about the governess he knew briefly. However, she doesn't know Waldo...<br />This is a lovely, entertaining read, full of deliciously entertaining character studies (Tiffany, Mrs Underhill, the Squire, Mrs Chartley, Laurie Calver and many more), witty dialogue, a gentle secondary romance and, of course, the main love story, between Ancilla and Waldo. This is another of Heyer's 'older heroine' novels, subtle, romantic and very enjoyable. Highly recommended!	2001-06-25

What is a lively, intelligent woman in her twenties to do, if she is bored by the various suitors who have shown an interest in her and she doesn't want to dwindle into a spinster aunt living with her brother and his family? Well, she sets up her own establishment, in Bath, much to the dismay of her family - her prosy brother immediately procures a distant cousin to act as companion and chaperone - or, more accurately, to bore Annis to tears!<br />So when, one day, our heroine, Annis Wychwood, encounters a young couple who have suffered a carriage accident, she is only too delighted to help. The young woman involved, Lucilla Carleton, is running away from the threat of an enforced marriage; her accomplice in this endeavour is none other than the young man her guardian wishes her to marry! Having got to the bottom of this story, Annis invites Lucilla to stay with her, and writes to Lucilla's aunt and guardian to obtain permission.<br />And these events result in Lucilla's *other* guardian, Oliver Carleton, commonly known as the rudest man in England and who, apparently, cares nothing for other people, descending on Annis to check her out and ascertain just what is happening. And at their first meeting sparks fly.<br />Though Annis knows she should be appalled by Oliver Carleton, she can't help but find him amusing. After all, he's the first man who seems capable of rousing her to temper, but then teasing her out of her annoyance; he makes her laugh, and she can talk to him for more than ten minutes at a time without being bored rigid. His disregard for convention - as it concerns everyone else but Lucilla, of course! - should shock her, but Annis finds that she's continually biting back laughter. The appalled reaction of her ever-tedious companion, and of her brother, only serve as even more of a contrast to the enjoyment she finds in Oliver's company.<br />As ever, Heyer has an array of entertaining secondary characters. You will roll your eyes at Maria, the companion; you'll smile at the earnest Ninian, Lucilla's childhood friend - and perhaps even agree with Annis's sister-in-law's prediction for their future; and you'll enjoy the Bath setting of this charming, amusing book.

I hadn't read Black Sheep for several years, and it made a delightful read. As I'm getting a little older myself, I'm coming to appreciate, and much prefer, Heyer's older heroines, such as Abby here and Serena in Bath Tangle.<br />Abby, supposedly on the shelf at 28, is certainly no stereotypical maiden aunt, despite the fact that she has a niece and is unmarried. Having been brought up in a strict family, she finds that propriety irks her; and yet, ironically, she is faced with having to instil a sense of propriety in her impulsive 17-year-old niece.<br />For Fanny, the niece, has fallen in love with a man everyone - except Fanny and Abby's older sister Selina - can see is no more than a fortune-hunter. But Fanny simply won't listen to reason, and Abby begins to fear that she'll elope with Mr Stacey Calverleigh. But then, a stranger appears on the scene: Mr *Miles* Calverleigh, Stacey's uncle.<br />Miles Calverleigh is, apparently, the black sheep of the title; having been guilty of too many indiscretions when young - including that of an abortive elopement with the woman who became Fanny's mother! - was sent to the Indies. There, he worked hard and made his fortune, but on his arrival in Bath he does not appear to have lost any of his disregard for convention. He is utterly careless of propriety, and insists that he feels no sense of obligation to family - therefore he refuses to help Abby in any way by warning off his nephew.<br />Despite his unhelpfulness, and his habit of teasing her outrageously, Abby finds herself drawn to Miles...<br />Heyer's inimitable witty style is in evidence, as ever, in this book. There is some hilarious dialogue, as well as very acute observations on human nature. Her secondary characters are, as always, very well drawn, and her cameo characters wonderful caricatures of the type of people we all meet: gossips, pinch-purses, the upright type who disapprove of anything andeverything. And who could avoid falling in love with Miles?<br />A side note - I am appalled that the editorial review above managed to spell the main characters' names incorrectly.	2001-06-20

I am fed up with this misappropriation of a perfectly good word, 'liberalism'. <br />From the Cambridge Dictionary:<br />liberal (POLITICS) adjective (of a political party or a country) believing in or allowing more personal freedom and a development towards a fairer sharing of wealth and power within society.<br />liberal (SOCIETY) adjective respecting and allowing many different types of beliefs or behaviour a liberal society/church/ideological position/person.<br />Okay, how does that equate to the type of thing Boortz rants endlessly on about? Answer: it doesn't.<br />Liberals believe in freedom and choice tempered by social responsibility. What Boortz thinks he's talking about is communism, of a type which barely exists in the world any more. And the idea that - in the US context - the Democratic party aspires to control every aspect of individual lives is ludicrous. <br />But then, what's more ludicrous still is that, instead of laughing at this book, people take it seriously!	2001-06-14

I simply couldn't bear to finish it; by the time I was a quarter of the way through I started skimming, and then I simply skipped the last 40 pages and read the final chapter. Certainly didn't feel as though I missed much!<br />Plot: Woman who landed a Duke for a husband wants to catch Dukes for her daughters too. Three successfully married, and Georgiana's the last. So can the Duchess of Gordon find a Duke for her youngest daughter?<br />The Duchess is an embarrassment. Apart from the dreadful Scottish dialect - didn't anyone tell Stamford that the aristocracy don't use such dialect? At most, they'd have an accent! - she's also pushy, opinionated and an out-and-out liar. I cannot see her being welcomed in Society at all, let alone an intimate of Prime Minister Pitt. Loathed the character. And, actually, the daughter didn't do a lot for me either.<br />And I'd imagine the genuine historical characters Stamford uses in this book, especially the Duke of Bedford, Lord John Russell and Eugene, stepson of Emperor Napoleon (all of whom at one time or another end up engaged to Georgiana) would be spinning in their graves if they could see the liberties Stamford takes with their characters. <br />Simply appalling!	2001-06-09

Caitlin Campbell, daughter of an impoverished mere Mr, is enjoying a Season in London as the guest of her aunt, the widow of a baronet. However, although she's made friends with an earl's daughter, there are others who consider her a mere nobody. It is the consequence of hearing the Lady Elizabeth refer to her as such at a ball that Caitlin is walking home alone late one night. A strange man crashes into her, running away from some footpads, and as a ruse to evade his pursuers he grabs Caitlin and kisses her senseless.<br />At a subsequent entertainment, Caitlin recognises her assailant as Richard, Lord Kilverton; and to her mortification he recognises her too. He begins to tease her, and she realises just how attracted she is to him - and he to her. But Kilverton is betrothed, and to the same Lady Elizabeth who looked down her nose at Caitlin.<br />How can Richard and Caitlin find love, when betrothals are - for a gentleman, at any rate - as sacrosanct as marriage? Can Richard's sister Serena help at all? His irrepressible friend Ned? Or Caitlin's demure and shy sister Emily? (Plenty of secondary romances in this delightful novel!)<br />There is also a further issue to resolve: just why was Richard being chased in the first place, and why does he keep falling victim to accidents? Could it be that his life is in danger? And why?<br />Diane Farr is another Regency writer whose books I would order without question, without waiting for reviews. Her books are, without fail, witty, sparkling, romantic and very much in character for the period. She's been likened to Georgette Heyer, and with good reason.

Wondered what happened to the urchin Gilly who masqueraded as a boy to protect herself? Well, The Choice is her story.<br />It's set four years after The Cad; Ewen and Bridget have made Gilly and her little sister their wards, and are bringing them up as educated young ladies. (No-one claims that they are in fact 'eligible' by birth, and rumours circulate that they aren't of good family). <br />At a ball one night, Gilly is attacked by a young aristocrat who, having heard the rumours, assumes that she's fair game. As he's standing nearby, Damon Ryder prepares to come to the rescue; but instead he finds himself having to pull Gilly off the young man! Just who is this young woman who can fight as well as any man?<br />In revenge, Gilly's attacker tries to ruin her reputation, but Damon again comes to her rescue by claiming that they are long-standing acquaintances and are actually engaged. Thus begins what to Gilly is a pretend betrothal; Damon very quickly realises that he'd like nothing more than for it to be real, and sets about persuading Gilly of his intentions.<br />But there are several things he doesn't know about Gilly. Readers of The Cad will be aware of her origins in the slums of London; to Gilly's surprise, Damon isn't at all bothered by that discovery. So she reveals her deepest secret to him: as we know from The Cad again, it is that she was raped as a very young child. Again, Damon is only sympathetic, not disgusted as she expected.<br />So she agrees to marry him. But at the same time there are other complications. Drum, Ewen's cousin (minor character from The Cad), with whom Gilly has been in love ever since she met him, returns and, as the book jacket informs us, seems to see Gilly in a new light. Could he be in love with her after all?<br />And what about the disreputable Hathaway Wycoff? A married man legendary for his affairs, he treats Gilly as a friend - and she returns the compliment - but he makes no secret ofthe fact that he would like her to be his lover. And that he is aware that being somebody's mistress might be the only option open to someone of her background.<br />Three delicious men - all of whom will, I hope, eventually get their own stories: which one will Gilly choose?	2001-05-25

At the end of The Challenge, we saw that Lord Rafe Dalton was again struck by the beauty of Lady Annabelle Wythe, just as he had been in The Choice. He also feels very sorry for Annabelle, since she'd been in love with her childhood friend Damon Ryder (The Choice) for years, only to see him marry Gilly.<br />So Rafe decides that he will try to court Annabelle, though he doesn't have much hope that she will return his interest - after all, he tells himself, he's a very plain-looking man, with ugly red hair and a complete inability to make pretty speeches. However, Annabelle seems to show some interest, although largely playing Rafe off against several other suitors.<br />Then Rafe's old friend Eric returns wounded from India, needing somewhere to stay for a few days; his beautiful sister Brenna is with him. And circumstances contrive to compromise Rafe and Brenna, so that Rafe is obliged to offer Brenna marriage in order to retrieve her reputation. He likes Brenna, and is attracted to her, so it isn't such a hardship; his only problem (and hers) is that he is in love with Annabelle.<br />This is where the book becomes really interesting. Rafe is a very insecure, under-confident man when it comes to personal relationships; he can never quite understand why his close friends, such as Drum and Ewen Sinclair, seem to like him. And we discover that his insecurity comes from always having been second-best in his family relationships, being made to feel the outsider - which is, of course, what makes him sympathise with Annabelle.<br />In this respect, Rafe has more in common with Brenna than he realises, since she has also suffered more than her fair share of disappointments: one fiance was killed in the war, and another rejected her for another woman. So the really beautiful part of this book is how these two damaged individuals manage to heal each other and repair each other's self-esteem.<br/>The reason I give this book four stars instead of the five I've given every other book in Layton's series is that I found Annabelle's behaviour profoundly annoying, and I couldn't understand why Rafe took so long to see through it. He kept finding excuses for her, long after all his friends were seeing her as the selfish dog-in-the-manger she was. <br />Now, I want Drum's story!	2001-05-21

Now, she tries to forget that scandal, which ruined her for ever in the eyes of her village home.<br />Nicholas Daventry, Baron Stafford (*not* Lord Nicholas, as Layton refers to him; that title is incorrect), is the uncle of Julia's erstwhile fiance. But what Julia doesn't know is that Robin, her ex-fiance, has been spinning Nicholas a web of lies about her and is using her supposed rejection of him as his excuse not to fulfill his family responsibilities. Therefore Nicholas attempts to bribe Julia to come with him to see Robin, and when she refuses, he later kidnaps her.<br />Therefore these two begin their acquaintanceship on the worst possible terms - and as if things can't get any worse, Nicholas then loses his temper with Julia when she insists on protesting her innocence and lets it be known that she believes him to be demented. He slaps her, an act he later suffers enormous guilt over.<br />However, Nicholas's basic decency begins to filter through the harsh appearance he has shown Julia, and she finds herself coming to like him despite herself. And likewise, Nicholas finds himself less and less able to believe his nephew's claims about Julia's character.<br />I have to thank the previous reviewer here. He/she commented that this book is the third in The Duke's Wager/The Disdainful Marquess series, and this is why I bought it at auction. Having read it, I don't think it is part of that series at all, although, like many of Layton's books, characters from other books appear. But if I hadn't seen that review, I'd have missed out on an extremely enjoyable, angsty and romantic read. <br />I do think that this book has to be a sequel to something; Nicholas has a stepfather who appears briefly and very enigmatically, and the man is never named; it's as if the readers are expected to know who he is.

Having been recommended Veryan, I acquired this book in an auction. But I was very disappointed, and may not bother to read anything by Veryan again.<br />I believe this is supposed to be a comedy and a romance; in my view, it was neither. I didn't find the story funny, and I looked in vain for romance. We began with neither character liking each other very much, and with Savage wondering whether Primrose might be good for a brief affair (though he never so much as tried to pursue her); we end with them somehow madly in love with each other, with nothing in between.<br />Primrose's daughter was exceedingly irritating. Five-year-olds don't refer to themselves and their auditors in the third person! And why 'Consuela'? Even born in Spain, with English parents it's not at all a likely name. <br />Primrose, for someone who had been through such a difficult and sad past, seemed relatively untroubled. Why did Veryan not show us more of her thoughts? But then, she - like Savage - was not drawn consistently throughout the book.<br />As for Savage, I ended up despising him. He was narrow-minded and judgemental, and - regardless of his subsequent acts - the way he purposefully and publicly humiliated Primrose was despicable. Even worse, it was part of some scheme or other, of which Primrose knew nothing either before or after. His behaviour was appalling, and I was horrified when Primrose simply ran into his arms at the end of the book - which was actually the first time she saw him after his betrayal of her.<br />Oh, and the denouement is straight out of Heyer's These Old Shades - very derivative, and with none of the style of the original.	2001-05-19

He stays to help her and Consuela, her young daughter (almost five and speaks in what is almost a patois, which was completely incredible and very distracting), and Primrose's (male) cousin, also ill. Savage later discovers that Primrose isn't what she claims, and that she seems to have a scandalous past. <br />I assume the book was intended to be largely funny. I didn't find it amusing, however, but then farce doesn't especially appeal to me. Leaving that aside, there was very little romance; for example, I have no idea whatsoever how it was that Primrose, from thinking that Savage was an irritating nuisance, suddenly was both attracted to him and in love with him! Savage's own behaviour was equally incomprehensible. <br />The characterisations were not at all consistent throughout the book, and as such characters behaved in unbelievable ways. The Primrose we met at the start of the book wouldn't have sighed over Savage, and nor would she have fallen into his arms at the end - especially after what he did to her.<br />Savage's treatment of Primrose was, in fact, unforgivable. Regardless of his motives, the action he took was appalling - it was humiliating, patronising and completely unfair. Primrose should never have spoken to him again - how Moore/Veryan could expect her readers to accept that Primrose would run headlong into Savage's arms after her public humiliation at his hands is unbelievable. Savage had in any case previously shown himself to be narrow-minded and judgemental. Not a hero I could admire in any fashion.<br />The denouement of the book was highly derivative: straight out of Heyer's These Old Shades, where the Duke of Avon tells his friends a story, which turns out to be the truth of Leonie's birth. Did Veryan not expect that her readers would have read Heyer?	2001-05-19

A hero you'll adore, and a strong, determined heroine	This is the third book in Edith Layton's series which begins with The Cad. The second book was Gilly's story, and we first encountered Hathaway Wycoff in that book; he was one of Gilly's admirers, a married man and a serial adulterer who could only offer her an affair. At first he seemed to pursue her with that in mind, but later he told her that he respected her too much to take her that way - although he did try to persuade her to go to America with him. He showed himself a true friend to Gilly, though, by giving her some very sound advice on a couple of occasions. We also discovered that he wasn't as wicked as he was portrayed by Society: his affairs had been prompted by his wife's open and unashamed adultery.<br />The Challenge takes up about a year after The Choice finishes. Wycoff is now in Virginia, contemplating buying land and starting a new life. He'd originally moved to America because he was fed up with unsatisfying affairs and he hoped to find a woman he could love and settle down with - even if that made him a bigamist. However, the death of his wife (before this book commences) leaves him free. <br />Lucy Stone, an impoverished widow with a nine-year-old son, is immediately taken with Wycoff, and he with her. She works at the hotel where he is staying, and soon they're spending as much time together as possible. But before their relationship can advance, Lucy finds out the devastating truth about him: his adulterous past, which makes him completely untrustworthy in her eyes. While he offers her marriage, she can't believe that he will be faithful; the legacy of her first marriage, to a man who failed to provide for her, leaves her unable to take Wycoff on trust.<br />So she decides to return to England, helped by her brother-in-law who expresses a very belated wish to meet his nephew. However, purely by coincidence, Wycoff is on the same ship... While they become closer on the voyage, she still refuses him - there is a beautiful, and very poignant, scene in which traditional positions are reverses: Lucy wants to make love, just once, with Wycoff, but he refuses because she won't marry him.<br />So in order to win her, he has to prove to her that he can be trusted; in order to do so, he sets about retrieving his reputation. Has a man ever tried so diligently to prove himself to the woman he loves?<br />Definitely a keeper!	2001-05-14

Well, don't miss this wonderful book. The story commences four years after the end of The Cad; Ewen and Bridget are still very happily married, with two children. In the interim, Ewen made Gilly and her young sister Betsy his wards, and Gilly cast off her boy's clothes and learned to live as an educated and ladylike young woman, taught by - among others - Ewen's friends Rafe and Drum (the Earl of Drummond). <br />As the story starts, Damon Ryder - newly returned from America - is strolling in the garden at a ball, and sees a beautiful young woman apparently in danger of being embraced against her will by her companion. He rushes to her rescue, only to find that she doesn't need help; he ends up having to pull her off her attacker. Thus he discovers that there is a lot more to Gilly Giles than meets the eye. However, since her attacker then tries to destroy her reputation, Damon claims that they are secretly engaged.<br />Gilly, although grateful, is anxious to free Damon from this obligation, but he is only too happy to make the engagement real; he fell in love with her the moment he saw her, and the more he learns about her only makes him love her more. Even when Gilly tells him the truth about her background - that she comes from the slums of London and that her father was a docker, *and* that she was raped as a small child - his feelings don't change.<br />But Gilly still feels that she isn't good enough for him, or for his family. And what she hasn't told anyone is that she's been secretly in love with Drum, her old friend, for years. But he never saw her as more than a child... until he returns, and it seems as if he's beginning to see her in a completely different light.<br />And as if having to choose between Damon and Drum isn't enough of a problem for Gilly, Lord Wycoff - married, but who lives apart from his wife - also makes it clear that he would take herany way he could have her.<br />Can Gilly choose between three men, all of whom want her? Or will she leave it too late to work out who she really loves, and risk losing them all?<br />Having read this, I now can't wait to read The Challenge, to find out how Hathaway gets on in America; and I sincerely hope that The Conquest is going to be about the last member of this little group of men!	2001-05-12

This is the first longer one I've read, and I enjoyed it so much. I'm really looking forward to the rest of this series!<br />Bridget is the archtypal 'poor relation', passed around from family to family among her many relations. At present she is acting as companion to her beautiful cousin Cecily; she was considered suitable, her aunt tells her, because of the contrast between her and her cousin. Because Bridget, though beautiful in profile, has a very visible flaw once she turns to look at someone properly: she has a deep, jagged two-inch scar on her face, just beside her mouth. She's very conscious of the scar, and is deliberately self-effecing as a result, hating to be stared at.<br />But one evening, at a ball, someone does stare at her, and she makes the mistake of staring back. He is Ewen, Viscount Sinclair, a known rake. And, living up to his reputation, he follows her, gets her alone and offers her carte blanche. She refuses, but he engineers another time alone with her and offers again. When she refuses this time, he offers marriage.<br />Her relatives assure her that he couldn't possibly have meant it, that he might pretend to want to marry her but will simply seduce her instead. And since she refuses to believe them, they throw her out. With nowhere to go, she flees to Ewen, putting her trust in him.<br />We're told bits and pieces about Ewen along the way: that he has been married before but hates to talk about it, that he spent many years spying for the British government on the Continent, and that he used the cover of rakish activities in order to fulfill his missions. And he certainly has been a rake; the expectation of his friends on meeting Bridget is that she is his latest mistress. But he marries her.<br />Then, not long after the wedding, he abandons her in the country house he'd taken her to - and where he also used to take his mistresses - and goes back to London. It is at this point that the question of whether he is a cad or not comes about. Has he, as Bridget wants to believe, been honest with her about everything - including the fact of their marriage? Or has he been playing a game with her and has now abandoned her, as the servants, Ewan's cousin Drummond and the knowing street-urchin Gilly would have her believe?<br />Find out for yourself in this very touching, poignant love story!	2001-05-08

Rushing to find his fiancee and let her know that he's safe, he discovers that she's already married to a friend of his. Feeling betrayed and lost, he intends to resign from the army and return home - especially after he discovers that he is now Baron Falkirk - but first he has a promise to keep. He needs to find Lara Alexandrovna, the niece of Pyotr Andreyovich, the Russian officer who was his fellow prisoner and who died instead of Ian.<br />Lara, now calling herself Laura, has just watched her stepfather die when Ian finds her. She is alone in the world, and also, he notices, wary of physical contact with men. One legacy of the Black Well, however, is that it has made Ian impotent; so he offers her what he believes will be a safe, affectionate, but passionless marriage. Laura, who likes Ian and feels safe with him, accepts.<br />Of course, Ian's disability isn't permanent, so at a later stage they have to deal with the consequences, and Laura has to confront her memories and fears. Ian also has his demons, which haunt his nightmares and sometimes make him difficult to live with. Gradually, over a period of a few months and in the course of their journey across India, these two tortured souls heal each other.<br />But the romantic/emotional plot isn't all there is to this book, which is why I've rated it less than the five stars I normally give Putney. Again, she has a strong dramatic plot - and I generally prefer her books without them - but she's also chosen to locate the book in colonial India. That, for a start, would have put me off buying the book had it been written by anyone other than Putney; as it was, it was difficult for me to empathise with Ian's feelings as far as that part of the plot was concerned, since my sympathies werewith those who would prefer to overthrow British rule!<br />At one stage I did find myself getting somewhat frustrated with the emotional plot, since it seemed as if any time Laura made a step forward Ian would regress a stage, and vice versa! However, in the end that aspect of the book was satisfying.<br />I did wonder about Ian's mother: after all, she's the woman who was pestering the British Consul in Constantinople for months on end in Silk and Secrets, trying to get someone to find out whether her son was alive or not; and it was she who sent Ross to find Ian. In neither Silk and Secrets nor this book did we see or hear about Ian's reunion with his mother! And what about the British government, which effectively left him to die?<br />In relation to the series, I was disappointed not to see more of the characters from earlier books in each successive one; all we get is a brief epilogue at the end of each, which isn't enough for characters we've grown fond of. Putney did better in her Fallen Angels series, allowing other characters to reappear in more substantial roles.	2001-05-06

Why was he still single in his thirties? Who was the perfect woman for him? Well, very early in this book, we discover that he is actually married and has been since he was 21. But his wife left him after six months of marriage and hasn't been seen since.<br />Juliet, Ross's estranged wife, lives in the desert in the middle of Persia, having cut off all contact with her friends and family. But she accidentally encounters Ross when her brother's life is in danger and Ross agrees to try to save him. Long-dormant feelings for Ross emerge, and she cannot allow him to go into danger alone, so she insists on accompanying him into the most dangerous part of Asia to try to rescue Ian, her brother.<br />On the journey, both Ross and Juliet discover that, however they may feel about each other, strong attraction still lurks between them. Can they somehow overcome the problems which caused Juliet to leave Ross, and the anger Ross still feels at her abandonment of him?<br />As usual, Putney reveals painstaking research, but presented in such a way that we don't feel lectured at or anything of the kind. Without feeling in any way as if I've been taught, I now know an awful lot about Arab customs and how to survive in the desert! Besides that, she is as good as ever at portraying star-crossed lovers; some of the scenes with Ross and Juliet are fiercely poignant, while others are richly passionate.<br />What loses this book one star for me is that the setting - the desert, and the thriller aspect of the plot - is not my favourite. It's very Anglo-centric of me, I know (as Ross says at one point in the book), but I prefer those books of Putney's which are set in England, and which are more romance than mystery/drama. Others will certainly disagree, and they'll appreciate Putney's skill in this book better than I will!<br />Now to read Ian's story...	2001-05-03

Putney's introduction of the character is masterly. We know that he comes from Kafiristan; but he never claims that he was born there. We're told his name is Mikhal Khanauri; but he never claims that this was his birth name. And Ross describes him as a prince, but Peregine never claims to be one. He is dark-skinned, but with unusual green eyes; eyes the villain of the piece recognises and finds troubling. <br />The only thing Putney does tell us about Peregrine right from the start is that he is looking for revenge, and that his desire for vengeance is all-consuming.<br />Peregrine's friend Ross has a cousin, Lady Sara, who is engaged to the man Peregrine is out to kill, Sir Charles Weldon. For Ross's sake, he will detach Sara from her fiance before he destroys Weldon; but he didn't expect to find himself overwhelmingly attracted to Sara, and she to him. An innocent in the experience of passion, Sara finds herself drawn to Peregrine more and more, and one kiss is simply not enough...<br />But as the events roll on inexorably, Sara has to ask herself whether Peregrine wants her for herself, or because she was one of the possessions which he is busy taking away from Weldon. Furthermore, she has to persuade Peregrine, a man who has never known love, to choose between vengeance and love.<br />Although I didn't find this book as compelling as other Putney works such as Thunder and Roses and The Rake, it was a fascinating and addictive read. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Mikhal and Sara in the two other books in the Silk series - the next book is about Ross, who played a minor but important role in Silk and Shadows but around whom there seem to be some interesting questions. <br />Oh, and just who is Peregrine? You're going to have to read the book to find out!	2001-04-30

This book is one of my favourites so far. <br />Morgan Courtney, Earl of Arden, is in his thirties, walks with a limp thanks to a war wound, and is a widower with no desire to marry again. His first wife was a sex addict, and she was routinely unfaithful to the point that he eventually sent her back to her father and went off to war to get away from her; she later died giving birth to a baby which wasn't his.<br />However, he needs to name an heir because someone he doesn't even know is apparently claiming to be his heir and is running up bills which are being sent to Morgan's man of business to settle. Since he has three male distant cousins, all of whom are equally entitled to the position of heir, he sends for them all in order to nominate one. Therefore, three Courtneys descend on his country estate: Richard, a dour, quiet man with little interest in the position; Owen, an overweight child whose mother is extremely ambitious and would like any deal to include her as well as her son; and Anthony, a seventeen-year-old radical who comes accompanied by his cousin, Elizabeth De Lisle.<br />For Elizabeth, the stay at the Earl's property is close to the fulfilment of a Cinderella fantasy. She is twenty-three, and has lived for most of her life in poverty, although she's of good family. She works as a milliner, in a shop, in order to keep food on the table. But since, if Anthony was lucky enough to become the Earl's heir, it would result in a change of the family's fortunes, she is persuaded to accompany Anthony in an effort to keep the boy in line.<br />She and Morgan are attracted to each other from the first, but Elizabeth is tongue-tied by a combination of attraction and intimidation. Later, when she finally begins to feel comfortable with Morgan, he suspects her motives; just about every woman he has ever known has wanted his money and has concealed the truth about herself from him. And it's obvious that Elizabeth is hiding something, but he thinks that it's far worse than it is.<br />However, alone on the edge of his property on a beautiful day, he kissed her, and suddenly secrets are shared and it seems to be the beginning of a wonderful relationship - but what kind of relationship can he offer her? <br />This is a lovely, heart-warming book which I'd recommend to anyone.	2001-04-22

Catherine is hired by the Duchess of Crewe, but wonders fairly soon why her employer doesn't seem to want her to do anything for her. Until the Duchess announces that she is taking Catherine to Paris, and buys her several very risque dresses...<br />What Catherine doesn't know is that the Duchess likes to achieve notice and notoriety, and that she makes a habit of doing that by hiring courtesans as her companions. The more men her companions sleep with, the more of a talking-point the Duchess is. However, Catherine only finds out what is going on when she's already on the way to Paris; since she has no money and no-one to appeal to for help, she's stuck.<br />St John (pronounced Sinjun, and this is the way Layton writes the name), Marquess of Bessacarr, noticed Catherine when she first entered the Duchess's employ, but he assumes her to be no better than her predecessors. He and Catherine keep running into one another, but he refuses to allow himself to give in to her attractiveness; after all, he thinks, she's a lightskirt and thus not worth his time. So, instead, he teases and taunts her, thus making her distrust him instead of asking him for help.<br />Until several things happen: St John finally gives in and makes Catherine an offer of carte blanche, which she refuses and at the same time tells him that she's an innocent; Catherine becomes the target of a Revolutionary officer's desires, and again refuses; the officer conspires to buy her from the Duchess, ensuring that she has no safe haven in Paris. At that point, she has no other choice than to accept help from the cynical Marquess.<br />I didn't particularly like Bessacarr in The Duke's Wager; he seemed a very selfish individual, only concerned with his own interests and heedless of anyone else's desires. It was clever of Layton to set this book several years later, since her 'reform' of Bessacarr was very credible. He'd matured a lot in the interim; he no longer cared about his image to the exclusion of all else, and he'd learned the value of helping other people. As a result, he became a likeable romantic hero.<br />Another very readable book from Layton!	2001-04-22

He had come to help her when she was lost and alone and devastated; she assumed that he was tarred with the same brush as her villainous, murdering father.<br />Five years later, Francis is an MP and in a position of some influence, and Charlotte desperately needs his help. Since he had been in love with her for years anyway, his pride led him to state - as a challenge - that the price of his assistance was marriage to her. He never expected that she'd agree, but she did, so they marry, a marriage of convenience in which Charlotte doesn't trust Francis one bit and his pride won't allow him to tell her the truth about himself.<br />Into this relationship add the return of Charlotte's father, who now wants to plot to ruin Storbridge for his failure to support his plan for a new railway. This leads us into the political sub-plot of the book. Unlike the last reviewer, I enjoyed this very much and it was, in fact, the best-researched and most entertaining part of the book. One minor criticism at this point is that there were rather too many characters to keep track of; admittedly, some of them were from previous books in the series, but I had not read those previous books (both now out of print), and had to keep reminding myself of who these people were and what their relationship was to the protagonists.<br />I have very mixed feelings about this book. While I enjoyed the political sub-plot, I found it very difficult to concentrate on the romance and the personal interaction between the characters, because quite simply very few of these characters belonged anywhere but in the present day. The dialogue was far too modern for the period. Now, while I don't expect writers to stuff their dialogue with obselete words, neither do I expect to see contractions all over the place and modern expressions used. At onepoint, Charlotte even says 'bloody hell'; now, while it's just possible that a gentleman of that period would use such an expression, a lady would never have done so.<br />Period behaviour is also very much lacking - I was incredulous to see Francis' young sisters-in-law (aged 17 and 11) talking openly about mistresses, and to him as well. If young unmarried girls even knew of the existence of such a thing as mistresses - and they usually didn't - they would never dream of mentioning this in front of adults. Serena, who is 11, was treated as if she was at least 17, both in her conversation and in the way she was allowed to stay up late, join the adults at dinner (even formal dinners, which would be unheard of) and at the theatre. <br />Grant's male characters also treated the women in a way which, although common nowadays, was completely unheard of two hundred years ago. No man ever discussed anything of any importance with his wife or daughters if he could avoid it; the idea that Francis, Paul, Silverton and Robert would involve their wives in their planning is ridiculous for the period.<br />And finally, a two-year-old being able to pronounce 'explosion' perfectly and know what the word means?! Please!<br />While there were parts of this book I enjoyed, I was jolted out of the story by historical impossibilities far too often for me to read anything else by Tracy Grant.	2001-04-18

To be quite frank, I found it boring, tedious, not remotely funny, lacking in any depth of characterisation and a chore to read. And the ending, supposedly a 'big surprise', according to the jacket blurb, was so predictable; I in fact did predict it from about the second page.<br />Blake's characters inspired no interest in me, although I desperately tried to feel such an interest. Clare is a wimp who doesn't know what she wants out of life, so she stays with a boyfriend who clearly bores her; she invests all her emotional energy in a correspondence with a man she's never met and who, right from his first letter, comes across as something of a psycho. This impression is confirmed when we meet Carl: he's lazy, and he's so weird he picks names at random out of international telephone directories and writes to them. This would send most people running long distances in the opposite direction, but not Clare. <br />Not Bernice either, Clare's surprisingly sensible friend - she actually falls for Carl! The guy has nothing to recommend him; even his creator can't seem to write him with any redeeming features. It was clear to me, long before Carl's friend Art pointed it out, that to Carl the letters he exchanged with Clare were his way of escaping from the world. He never wanted to meet her; he wanted to keep his illusions of her and believe himself in love with her - but a state of platonic love, in which he never had to take any risks or actually get to know her.<br />The only really likeable character in this book is Art, Carl's friend; yet Blake has a pretty good go at making us dislike him as well, given the way she introduces him at the start of the book - long tirades against the British, apparently crazy behaviour, an attitude which suggest that he treats women badly, although this turns out not to be the case.<br />The staged meeting between Carl and Clare was, I assume, supposed to be funny. It fell very flat with me; in fact, I found it, and the succeeding scenes, embarrassing. I found Carl's indecisiveness a complete turn-off, and Clare's quick forgiveness and change of heart as soon as she knew the truth incredible. Not an hour or so earlier she'd thought she was in love with Art; suddenly she's in bed with Carl and thinking she loves him.<br />Blake, while allowing one of her characters to complain about English authors writing Americans and getting the dialogue wrong, does exactly the same with her UK characters, who do *not* sound British a lot of the time. For example, no British person refers to a 'parking lot', or talks about being in 'the hospital'. Additionally, the book is very badly edited. Blake's grammatical skills are poor, and no-one has seen fit to correct her usage of punctuation, especially around dialogue. There are many mis-spellings, which jolt an already bored reader further out of the text - 'zenophobia', for instance.<br />I recommend other readers give this book a miss; there are many better romantic comedies on the market, some of which are actually funny.	2001-04-17

So now she lives in a slum, hoping against hope that she will find a new position. Charmingly, she is 'adopted' by Alfie, the eleven-year-old oldest child of the family next door, who hires her to teach himself and his siblings how to speak 'proper', in return for food and her rent.<br />In the meantime, Colin Haverford, the new Earl of Clune, hears a confession from his young cousin Theo, Lord Malverne: an action of crass stupidity on his part lost a poor old governess her job. It was some weeks after the event that Theo bothered to tell Clune anything about it, but they at once go to find the governess; Colin is amazed and dumbstruck to find that Victoria is anything but old, and that she is beautiful. Still, Theo promises to call on her to recompense her in some way, so Colon thinks no more of it. Until he discovers a couple of weeks later that Theo did nothing at all. Struck with an attack of conscience - Clune is a far more noble man than the book's cover description implies - he goes to see Victoria, to try to undo the wrong done to her by his family.<br />But he is overcome with feelings of attraction to her, and since - because of the way Theo explained what had happened to him - Colin believes that Victoria is not as innocent as she appears, he offers her a carte blanche. She rejects it outright, but wonders afterwards if she did the right thing. Learning from his mistake, but still feeling responsible for her, Colin then tries to arrange a respectable position for Victoria. But her poor living conditions and lack of sufficient food means that when she comes to see him to discuss his offer, she collapses and has to be confined to bed in his house.<br />Which means that Colin then finds himself also responsible for the most charming and amusing family I've encountered in romantic fiction: no-one could help loving Alfie, or admiring the way he takes care of his younger siblings. <br />However, Victoria is still just a governess, an apothecary's daughter, and as such the only relationship possible between Colin and Victoria is that of master and mistress. And Colin's already made the mistake of offering her that once, and he respects her too much to disgrace her. So, as he tells her, she cannot live under his roof. <br />As usual with Layton's heroes, Colin is a decent, fair man at heart; despite the jackets of her books portraying her heroes as wicked seducers, almost none of them ever do seriously attempt her heroine's seduction - and never against their will. She does a very good job of portraying Colin's fight with his libido and his struggle to remember his manners and position around Victoria. And likewise, Victoria constantly struggles with her conscience and her attraction to Colin.<br />And as ever, there is an entertaining cast of secondary characters, including Alfie and his siblings. Highly recommended, if you can get your hands on it!<br />One thing which puzzled me: just why Colin is called 'Cole' by his family, when the first syllable of 'Colin' is obviously 'Col'.	2001-04-15

Maeve Binchy has been my favourite Irish writer for a long time; she writes Ireland as I know it, both in her 1950s stories and those set in contemporary Ireland. Her characters are normally richly drawn and three-dimensional.<br />Scarlet Feather started well; I quickly became interested in Cathy and Tom's catering business and I found the main characters likeable. There was Cathy and her barrister husband Neil - who had married her against the wishes of his parents, Cathy being the daughter of their former cleaner. There was Tom and his girlfriend Marcella, who wanted to be a model and believed that she could make it. And there were Muttie and Lizzie, Cathy's parents, and Hannah and Jock, Cathy's parents; and Maura and TJ, Tom's parents; we were not told about Marcella's family. Yes, a lot of characters, and some I haven't mentioned here, but it wasn't difficult to keep track of them all.<br />However, I put the book down when I'd finished reading and quite simply felt unsatisfied, as if someone had ripped out the final chapter. I felt the same way after reading Tara Road, but hoped that this time Binchy would do better; and she didn't.<br />Cathy and Tom are partners in a catering business, Scarlet Feather, and at the start of the book have just found their premises and are ready to launch in a big way. There is history between Tom and Cathy; they almost became lovers once, but it's obvious that now they're the best of friends and are fond of each other's partners. Neil, Cathy's husband, is supportive of the business, but he's a very busy campaigning barrister and not always ready to listen when she wants to talk about *her* day. Tom is jealous of Marcella's beauty and hates other men looking at her - here we are shown, early on, the seeds of trouble in the relationships.<br />Along the way, we meet Neil's nine-year-old cousins, Maud and Simon, abandoned by their parents and a trial to everyone because of their lack of manners. They are just frightened kids, however, and one of the nicer elements of this book is how Muttie, the compulsive gambler father of Cathy, becomes the most stable and the most determined influence in these children's lives, the one person prepared to fight for their welfare.<br />However, otherwise this book shows that Binchy hasn't stopped rushing her plots. Some reviews have said that the pace is slow and boring; well, there's a lot of extraneous detail, but the central plot, that relating to Cathy, Neil, Tom and Marcella, and their families, moves very quickly. Too quickly, and lots of details are simply skipped over. Neil, when we first meet him, is certainly busy and more focused on his work than on Cathy's relationships, but he's dedicated to *Cathy*. And yet somewhere around the middle of the book he turns into a self-obsessed, self-important and neglectful git. That isn't the same person we were reading about 100 pages earlier. And the route that Cathy and Neil's relationship took was glossed over far too quickly, with too little information about the surrounding details before or after.<br />Likewise, Tom - an otherwise nice bloke, unassuming, considerate, turns into a pathologically jealous idiot when his partner so much as speaks to another man. We're left to believe that she was the one at fault, where for some parts of the book it looked as if Tom was seriously in need of therapy. And yet he recovers from the eventual disaster, without us, the readers, being privy to any ways in which he might have been changed by it.<br />And, as she's done a couple of times before, Binchy took us to the last few pages with many plot details still unresolved. In particular, she introduced us to many secondary characters and even some main characters, and their stories are left hanging. There was a resolution of sorts for one central thread - at least,I'm assuming that this is what we're meant to imply - but that wasn't satisfying for me. Binchy needed to take at least one more of her very long chapters to tidy things up properly.	2001-04-10

When she does, he is shocked, because although his wife is walking towards him, she is not the woman he'd intended to marry that day. Instead, she's the woman he married on a battlefield eighteen months before and thought was dead.<br />Lily, the illiterate daughter of a sergeant, had survived the attack which severely wounded Neville, but she'd then been captured and had been held prisoner for many months. Her captors had refused to accept that she was an officer's wife and she had become the sexual slave of one. Finally, she was released and she walked through Portugal before she managed to get transport back to England and Neville.<br />But, once reunited with the man who had married her as a death-bed promise to her father that he would protect her, Lily realises just how far apart they are. Neville is a member of the nobility, surrounded by family and friends who are just like him. She doesn't know how to dress, to make polite conversation, to behave among the upper-classes; she can't even read, write or play the piano-forte. Much as she loves Neville, she just doesn't fit in. She's not even sure, at first, whether Neville wouldn't have preferred her to be dead, although before long he shows her in the most perfect way that he still loves her.<br />But she still doesn't fit in... and then Neville finds out that their marriage was never registered, which means that they aren't legally married. He instantly tells her that he will take her to London to marry her again, legally this time, but she refuses. She will not stay with him in a world where she doesn't belong. He has a second chance, without her.<br />Enter Elizabeth, Neville's aunt, and a wonderful character. She's an independent woman in her thirties, wealthy, who never married because she couldn't bear being submissive to a man she didn't love. (She has a beau, and he's rather lovely too, but that's beside the point for now). Elizabeth offers Lily a position as her companion, but what she actually has in mind is a Pygmalion-like task.<br />And will Neville let her go? How will he convince her that he really loves her and win her back?<br />As ever, Mary Balogh refuses to write a tame, ordinary Regency novel. I shudder to think what would be made of a plot like this in another author's hands; Neville would have paid Lily off and married Lauren, I imagine.<br />There was only element of the plot which I found a little unnecessary, and that was the aspect concerning Lily's parentage. Much as I like Elizabeth's beau, I would have found it more fascinating had Balogh left Lily as she was when we first met her.<br />Oh, and in response to another reader, how could anyone think that Neville listened to his mother too much where Lily was concerned, and treated her with disrespect as a result? *He* insisted that his mother should receive her. He insisted that she should be treated with all due respect as his wife. His mother had no choice but to go along with it, and Neville made sure that Lily was treated well. <br />This is another keeper from a very talented writer.	2001-04-04

It's Cassandra's twenty-first birthday, and she's blissfully happy. Having inherited the Earldom of Worthing in her own right (she's the countess), she's looking forward to the freedom of managing her own property without interference from her relatives - all of whom she loves, but who persist in treating her as a child.<br />But an unexpected guest arrives: Nigel, Viscount Wroxley, who claims to have been a friend of Cassandra's late father. Nigel charms Cassandra, much to the disgust of her relatives, and she finds herself very much drawn to this handsome, charming and very attentive man. So when he asks her to marry him, she has little hesitation in saying yes.<br />Balogh lets her readers know early on that Nigel has at least one ulterior motive for coming to Kedleston and for wanting to marry Cassadra. I guessed relatively early what these motives might have been, but I was very unsure, certainly with regard to the second, of whether I was correct. Balogh plays her cards very close to her chest in this book, leaving the readers, as well as Cassandra, guessing as to whether Nigel is really a villain in need of reforming, or a very badly-misunderstood good guy.<br />Balogh very cleverly doesn't allow her characters to sink into uncommunicative misunderstanding in this book; although Cassandra is furious when she finds out part of the truth about Nigel, she doesn't lock herself into her room and stay there. Instead, she decides that she will not be afraid of him, and as a result we get some wonderful scenes in which her love for him - and his for her - battles with her dislike of what he did.<br />There are also a couple of delightful secondary romances in this book, something I always like. <br />Oh, and as for the reader from San Diego who didn't like Nigel as a romantic hero, isn't it a bit shallow to expect all heroes to be tall, dashing, well-built and devastatingly handsome? As it happens, Balogh, does write about heroes and heroines who do not fit the usualmould - but on the other hand, read the book carefully. Nigel *is* tall. He has dark hair. He is handsome. And, although he is slender, his valet comments at one point that he needs to fill out still, after his experiences. <br />As for the 'Zounds' and 'Egad', this book is set in Georgian (just pre-Regency) times, and such vocabulary, along with long, bagged hair and powder, was common.	2001-04-01

Thus says his grandfather's will - and even more specifically, he must marry the daughter of the late Earl of Covington. Therese, the daughter of the Earl of Covington, has responded to his advances and agreed to run away with him... but what he doesn't know is that she's in league with the wicked Nick. Thus he ends up abducting Julia.<br />Julia Frant (Miss Frant, according to Hawkins, but she should be Lady Julia) is Therese's cousin and also a daughter of a late Earl of Covington. Under the influence of rum punch, she agrees to marry Alec, but since she has him over a barrel she makes some conditions. One, she gets half of his fortune to give to her charity. Two, it's to be a marriage in name only. Three, he must not take a mistress. <br />In desperate straits, Alec agrees... and reminds Julia that one condition in the will is that they must remain scandal-free for a year. Julia thinks that will be no problem for her. But will it? <br />There are some entertaining, and intriguing, secondary characters in this book. Lucien, Duke of Wexford, in particular is a man I want to know more about, and I'm delighted to see that Hawkins has now published 'The Belated Bride', which revisits Lucien. Nick, the so-called wicked cousin, is actually quite a well-rounded character and not as black as he's painted; it would be nice to know more about him one of these days. He'd make a great dissolute-in-need-of-reforming hero.<br />Some of the misunderstandings and failures to communicate did irritate a little, but in all this was a light and amusing read.	2001-03-31

What can you do if you're a well-brought up young lady, but your mother is a byword for scandal? This is Lady Amanda Amberley's problem: her mother, the Countess of Clovelly, has not lived with her husband for many years, and indeed now lives 'in sin' with an elderly duke. While Amanda is truly the daughter of the Earl, the majority of her siblings are fathered by other men: hence the commonly-used description of her family as the Amberly Assortment.<br />Amanda herself has suffered by association with all of this scandal: at twenty-three she is unmarried, and although she has a (rather pompous and dull) suitor, he is in no hurry to propose - she suspects that her background deters him. Amanda's mother, on the other hand, is keen to ensure that her daughter marries, and marries well.<br />Christian Jarrow, Lord North - a handsome gentleman, but with the unusual feature of having one blue and one grey eye - seeks shelter and rest at Kettering, the home of the Duke of Laxley (the Countess's lover). Showing him to a bedroom, the Countess becomes 'confused' between the Blue Room and the Grey Room, and shows him to the Blue Room... in which Amanda is already ensconced. The obvious happens: they are disturbed minutes later, as North and Amanda are busy working out what must have happened and how they can resolve it.<br />Neither Amanda nor North wish to be forced into a marriage neither of them wants. However, since this happened at a house party, there is no way of escaping the scandal. North therefore comes up with a suggestion...<br />Layton takes time to allow us to get to know both North and Amanda, and they are both very likeable characters. North, who has a reputation - which is largely deserved - as a cynical rake, at first doesn't believe that Amanda is not cut from the same cloth as her mother, and it takes some persuading on Amanda's part to convince him that not only will she not fall into bed with him, but that she is an innocent. There are some lovely, poignant scenes in which Amanda hesitantly tells North about her upbringing and her realisation that she was part of a scandalous family.<br />North himself is not without a painful past; without giving away spoilers, it's enough to say that his reputation is deliberately earned because of his own parentage. So ultimately Amanda comes to understand that North has good reason to be able to empathise with her.<br />This is a lovely love story, of the type which will keep the reader sighing for some time after finishing the book. And I'm delighted that the publisher decided to reissue these two books in a single volume; otherwise I might not have been introduced to Edith Layton's work.<br />One minor grumble: even though this is a later book than The Duke's Wager, she still doesn't understand titles. The title of 'Sir' - for a baronet or a knight - attaches to the first name, not the surname. So it's *Sir Giles*, NOT 'Sir Boothe'. I winced every time I read that.	2001-03-28

Edith Layton is a writer I missed, somehow, when discovering the best of American regency writers. And yet, in terms of being true to the period, both in relation to customs and manners *and* in relation to the atmosphere of the book, she is better than many.<br />What most intrigues me about this book is the deception Layton practices on her readers. We are introduced to two men, the Marquess of Bessacar and the Duke of Torbay, one dark as the other is light in appearance, but we are led to believe that one is evil incarnate while the other is honourable and decent. However, Layton challenges this intial perception throughout the book, as well as challenging our own notions of good and evil. Which is the better, more honourable man? The one who pursues Regina openly with his declared intention to make her his mistress, or the one who offers her a safe haven and comfort while all the time plotting to offer her _carte blanche_?<br />Another refreshingly different aspect of this book is that we are left uncertain for quite some time as to which man Regina would choose. Most romance novels, even where there is an attempt to set up a love triangle, fail miserably at creating this uncertainty: the author simply doesn't develop the character of the eventual loser well enough, or makes him appear too unworthy of the lady's hand. Not so in this case. And even though I'd worked out half-way through which man I wanted Regina to end up with, I was still unsure almost to the end of the book whether that was the outcome I would get.<br />I ended up not entirely liking the loser in this wager, but from something another reviewer said I wonder whether he is revisited in another book? (Knowing my luck, it'll be out of print!) Far more, though, I liked and admired Amelia, St John's cousin. Now, I could wish to see a happy ending for her!<br />I give this four stars rather than five for some irritating minor errors - such as calling the Marquis 'Your Grace', when that's a form of address reserved for dukes and bishops, and referring to Regina and Amelia as 'Lady Berry' and 'Lady Burden': neither was married, and so could not have a title attaching to their surnames. 'Lady Amelia' might have been accurate, however.. Yes, minor; but mistakes like that, when there are a lot of them, jerk me out of the story.	2001-03-24

Pandora and Max were encountered briefly as minor characters in THL.<br />Pandora, the unconventional daughter of even more unconventional parents, had been dubbed The Hellion of Grosvenor Square by a rejected suitor some years earlier. Six seasons later she is still unmarried. Max, the Earl of Trent, wants her, however, but she refuses to have him. Attracted though she is to him, she tells him that she really wants a hero. What she doesn't tell him is that she wants her marriage to be an enduring love match, as her parents' marriage is.<br />Max challenges her to set him a test; if he passes, she marries him, and if he doesn't, she can name his bride. Pandora responds by setting him the Twelve Labours of Hercules. Max, clearly an ingenious man, interprets the labours in very much contempory terms, aided and abetted by various of Pandora's family and her best friend, all of whom want her to marry Max. She in turn enlists the aid of Max's best friend (the twit!) to help her defeat Max.<br />Oh, and Cynthia - Pandora's friend - and Laurie, Max's friend, are a great pair of secondary characters.<br />Much of the book, including the various lengths to which Max goes to succeed in his tasks, is very amsuing. There are also some wonderful sensual scenes. But where the book falls down for me is towards the end, when the miscommunications seem to get more and more forced. We know that Max and Pandora love each other. They've known they were in love for quite some time. Max knows that she needs to hear him tell her he loves her. Pandora knows that it's not fair expecting Max to confess his love for her when she's never told him that she requires love from a husband... what more do they need??! I was shaking my head at what actually happened before we got a resolution.<br />Alexander falls down on the manners and customs of the period,too; I don't mind suspending disbelief a little in this regard now and again, but she has her main characters, and their friends, closeted together far too frequently. Cynthia and Pandora visiting Max (separately) in his London house would simply not have been permitted; even if the ladies had been bold enough, the servants would have been outraged and Max would - if he was a gentleman, which he appears to be - have refused to see either of them without a chaperone. Neither even brought a maid with them; young ladies didn't go anywhere without at least a maid.<br />So... fun, frothy, a little frustrating, and not to be taken too seriously!	2001-03-23

I can't help but notice that this book seems to be rated very highly by McNaught fans, both in its own right and in comparison with her other books. For me, though, it's a non-starter. I can't rate Judith McNaught as a writer of Regencies and other English historicals: her work, in terms of plotting, characterisation and attention to accuracy, pales in comparison to Mary Balogh, Mary Jo Putney, Jo Beverley and others.<br />In this book, I could never even begin to like Clayton, and I can't see why McNaught imagines him as a romantic hero. In other books, he would be the villain of the piece, from whom the hero would come and rescue the heroine. Having said that, there's nothing wrong with a book in which the aim is to rehabilitate the sometime-villainous anti-hero: Mary Jo Putney did this to very good effect in The Diabolical Baron/The Rake. However, the Duke of Claymore is by no means redeemed in my eyes by the end of the book. I simply cannot understand why anyone would have stayed with him willingly; but then, I didn't end up having much admiration for Whitney either.<br />The most disturbing part of this book, as other reviewers have noted, was the rape scene. Frankly, I was shocked and appalled. I am not arguing that writers should not write about rape; but the context in which the rape happens, and the aftermath of the rape, make it all appear completely unforgiveable to me. This is a man who is continually violent to his wife, the rape aside. Are we expected to believe that he will change his ways? I can't accept that.<br />Nor can I accept that a man who rapes his wife in that manner - regardless of the customs of the time, which dictated that a woman is the property of the man in her life (father or husband, or, when widowed, son) - can be viewed as a romantic hero.<br />I can't recommend this book, and - considering my poor opinion of McNaught's Something Wonderful in addition - I will not be reading anything else by this writer.	2001-03-20

But it does help when the formula is varied from time to time. In Betty Neels' stories the pattern is invariably the same: nicely-brought-up but plain young woman falls on hard times, has no training or qualifications so has to take menial job or train to be a nurse. Meets older and very much aloof man, who secretly falls in love with her, but fails to give her any evidence of his regard for her, except perhaps one kiss when she least expects it and which she assumes was intended just to tease, especially since there's always a far more glamorous woman hanging around. And just when nice girl realises that she's in love with aloof older man, he sends her away and she thinks she'll never see him again. Then he comes to find her, out of the blue, and tells her that she's going to marry him. End of story.<br />(There is a slight variation, in which nice girl marries aloof older man early in the book, as a marriage of convenience, but he was secretly in love with her all along and just never told her).<br />This book follows the same old formula: Beatrice meets Dr Oliver Latimer, who treats her in exactly the same casual, almost dismissive manner which all Neels' heroes use on their heroines. Somehow, we're supposed to understand that this means he loves her. I have to admit that I found the book patronising in this respect: women *do* have the right to make their own choices in live, and yet Latimer, like most of Neels' heroes, has a tendency to ride roughshod over Beatrice's wishes.<br />Neels' books seem increasingly anachronistic these days, for several reasons. First, she writes men and women as they were perhaps in the 1950s or 1960s, right down to dress, manner, way of speaking and so on. Second, when her books are set in a hospital, as this is, it becomes clear that she has not set foot in a hospital for at least twenty years. Hospitals are run very differently nowadays. Nurse training (in the UK, whereher books are set) bears no resemblance to the depiction in Neels' books. Frankly, her publishers would do better to market her books as historical fiction, which is what they actually are.	2001-03-20

I didn't find it as breathtaking or compelling as either Nicholas's or Lucien's stories in the first two books. <br />Francis Middlethorpe is a sweet, gentle and caring man, who is half-way in love with Nicholas's wife Eleanor but knows he must marry to ensure the continuation of his title and line. He is on the point of becoming engaged to Anne Peckworth, a duke's daughter; then he meets Serena Riverton, widow of a man dubbed Randy Riverton by the ton and whose marriage - entered into when she was 15 - had been an appalling, abusive sexual servitude. Running away from her brothers' attempts to sell her into another distasteful marriage, she wonders whether life as Lord Middlethorpe's mistress might be more congenial - so she seduces him.<br />As a result, Francis - being an honourable man - feels that he has no choice but to marry her. But the lack of trust between them, added to Serena's own preconceptions about marriage and sex, mean that their relationship is uneasy. A man who was a virgin until his wife seduced him, and a woman who views 'bed-work' as something to be endured and in which she must not display any reluctance, have a lot of difficulties to overcome. <br />Fans of Lucien and Beth, and of Nicholas and Eleanor, will find their heroes making several appearances in these pages. Francis's wonderful aunt, Arabella, also takes a secondary role. And just who is Felicity, Miles's wild ward? And will she reappear in a later Company of Rogues novel? <br />The only aspect of this book I really didn't like was the way Beverley handled the secondary romance. In particular, the scenes in which this was being resolved seemed to me to be farcical in the extreme (relying on confusions such as those following from there being two Lady Middlethorpes, for example), though I also found Francis's mother's blackmail tale, in the second chapter,unconvincing. I'm sure this aspect of the book could have been handled better.<br />However, that aside, Beverley handles Serena's traumatic past with delicacy and care, and she and Francis make a lovely couple.	2001-03-12

The plot is fairly simple: Vianne Rocher, a wanderer with a young daughter, arrives in Lansquenet on Shrove Tuesday. Something about the village appeals to her, despite the looming presence of the Black Man, the local priest, and she decides to stay. Taking the lease on an old bakery directly across the road from the church, she opens a chocolaterie.<br />A chocolate shop. In *Lent*! Thus Vianne arouses the fury of Reynard, the priest, while at the same time gradually seducing many of the townspeople one by one with the delicious smell and taste of chocolate, and her uncanny ability to divine everyone's 'favourite'. Does Vianne have some sort of supernatural powers? Can she read minds? Harris never completely answers that question, but then the first-person narrative allows Vianne to reveal only as much as she wishes, and she herself rejects any suspicion of such abilities. And yet the Tarot cards are still ever-present, as are the strange dreams and visions.<br />Reynaud, the priest, whose own first-person narrative takes up about a quarter of the book, is another fascinating character. Overly self-righteous and determined to be in control of everything in the village, he takes immediate exception to *Mademoiselle* Rocher and her chocolaterie, and sees it as his mission to wean his flock away from her. But he has secrets as well, some of which are suspected by the old woman Armande (another fascinating character).<br />As Harris takes us inexorably towards Easter, it's clear that some sort of confrontation is coming between the old habits and the new, the dull darkness of conformity and the glad brightness of joy, and the priest and the chocolate-woman. But exactly what form does it take? You'll have to read for yourself.<br />Oh, and don't forget to savour the secondary characters: Vianne's daughter Anouk, Armande, Guillaume and his beloved dog, Josephine the kleptomaniac who is married to a drunked wife-beater, Roux the proud gypsy and many more.	2001-03-07

By process of elimination, he chooses Claire Summerbourne, the dead man's daughter, as his wife.<br />Claire - still in  mourning for her father - is deeply distrustful of de Lisle: she is wary of him because he is a warrior by profession, and she resents his acquisition of her father's property. She doesn't want to marry him, but has little choice. However, by the day of their betrothal the two have come to understand each other, and by the following day - their wedding day - they are ready to admit that they love each other.<br />However - as the editorial review above makes clear - it's at this point that Claire discovers Renald is the man who killed her father, and she realises that she cannot commit to him. <br />The remainder of the book deals with Renald and Claire coming to terms with the harsh knowledge which lies between them, made all the more difficult by Renald's feeling that he did nothing wrong; he was acting lawfully and in accordance with the king's instructions. How Claire comes to understand and forgive, and to reconcile her love for Renald with her love for her father, is told very well and very convingly by Beverley.<br />The historical detail is also very interesting, as well as being accurate; I certainly learned a lot from this book.<br />My only complaint is that - typically - there was no indication on the book's cover, or even inside before the start of the book, that this was a sequel to another mediaeval romance by Beverley, Dark Champion. While reading Lord of Midnight, I kept coming across references to Imogen and Fitzroger, and when eventually these characters were encountered, it did seem as if readers were supposed to be familiar with them. Beverley's postscript then revealed that Lord of Midnight is a sequel to Dark Champion. I wouldn't say that it's essential to read Dark Champion first, but I did feel that it might have been useful to have read it. I do wish publishers would be honest when one book is a sequel to another!	2001-03-01

The editorial review on this site describes the book as 'passionate'; that's certainly not an adjective I would use. Even the sex scene was completely lifeless and clinical.<br />There were too many coincidences, too many far-fetched plot developments and too many one-dimensional characters for my liking. And I felt that Erin's behaviour reeked of meddling. First, although her mother didn't want her to, she rushed off to England to find her mother's family. Then she tells an eighty-year-old man she'd only just met that the daughter he'd thought died fifty-five years ago is alive and that she's the man's granddaughter - did she want Giles to have a heart attack there and then?! Long-lost relatives are introduced to each other with no preparation - Kate's mother is given no choice about whether she wants to meet the daughter she'd thought was dead. And as for the decision to keep quiet about one major character still being alive, that was simply incredible. <br />It was clear that Bowden knew the UK reasonably well, but her knowledge was quite out of date. The EEC ceased to exist in the early 1980s; it became the EC and then the EU. No politician, especially of Simon's standing, would get that wrong. Other inaccuracies also jolted me out of the story: for instance, as the direct heir to an earldom, why wasn't Simon a Viscount? Had his father still been alive, he would have been The Honourable Simon Houghton. (As Leader of the Opposition, he becomes Right Honourable by virtue of being a Privy Councillor, but this is different). And finally, why on earth would a producer for UTV live and work in London? UTV, as its name implies (Ulster Television) is based in Northern Ireland; its production staff would at the very least *work* in Belfast.	2001-02-28

What's a woman to do? So she asks her two best (male) friends to compile a list of suitable men for her to consider as possible husbands. They don't take the task at all seriously, and present her with a list of completely unsuitable men... and one Richard, Earl of Shelbrooke, a reformed and impoverished rake. <br />So Gillian proposes a marriage of convenience to Shelbrooke; he is tempted to accept, since he desperately needs money to restore his estate and provide his sisters with dowries. However, he refuses to contemplate a platonic marriage: after all, what's the point of owning an estate unless he has a son to pass it on to? So he tells Gillian that he will only marry her if she is willing to agree to a full marriage in every sense.<br />Unfortunately, he then has the idea of seeing whether she could be tempted to passion, and in a moment of madness he approaches her as his nominal _alter ego_, Etienne-Louis Toussaint. This is Richard's pseudonym: in the guise of Toussaint he has been earning a living as an artist for the past several years. And so Gillian finds herself attracted to both Shelbrooke and Toussaint, and becomes hopelessly confused.<br />Alexander has a light touch with this novel; plenty of humour, especially with the secondary characters - Gillian's friends, Shelbrooke's sisters and aunt. The misunderstandings aren't dragged out interminably, either, and there are some very unexpected twists at times. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable read!	2001-02-06

Unlike other Beverley books - the Malloren series, and the first two Company of Rogues books - the characters did not capture my imagination, and I ended the book not really caring about what happened to any of them.<br />Meg, in many respects, seemed a sensible woman at first, but by the time she ran to Saxonhurst's grandmother, from whom she knew very well he was estranged and didn't want anything to do with, I wondered what had got into her. She knew exactly how Saxonhurst (I did not like the nickname 'Sax') felt about the Dowager, and it made no sense whatsoever that she would ask the woman for help.<br />Unlike some other reviewers, I never grew to like Saxonhurst, which made it difficult to enjoy the book. I found his habit of smashing things irritating rather than amusing.<br />Not being a great fan of the supernatural, I found the 'sheelagh-ma-gig' element of the plot a complete turn-off. Beverley could easily have written this book without resorting to the device of a 'magic stone'. I know I would have enjoyed the book far more without it.<br />However, equally I was not convinced by the Dowager; such an irredeemably evil person seems simply too one-dimensional to be true. I found that part of the book where we learn the full extent of the Dowager's actions to be beyond credulity.<br />Ms Beverley, you're allowed one aberration; now can we have more Company of Rogues books, and more heroes like Bey Malloren, please?	2001-02-05

Having now struggled against boredom to finish it, I can now say for certain that I'm definitely not among McNaught's fans.<br />I never, at any point in the story, found myself actually liking either Alexandra or Jordan - and liking the main characters is, of course, an essential requirement for enjoyment of a book. Both behaved stupidly - now, of course, stupid behaviour on the part of the principals is a standard component of romance novels, but this seemed to be excessive. What probably caused me to disengage a little from the story to begin with was the unbelievable plot development whereby Jordan actually married Alexandra in the first place. He was a *duke* - and a very arrogant, puffed-up one at that. She was a nobody, in his eyes. No-one would have believed that he could have married so far beneath him; that alone would have caused a scandal greater than any Alexandra's mother could have created. (Incidentally, just what happened to Alexandra's mother after the wedding? She's never heard of again!). In the circumstances which McNaught created, in which Alexandra's mother and uncle came and accused him of ruining her, Jordan would more likely have done one of three things. He might have ordered her family out of his house forthwith. He might have paid them off. Or he might, if he really felt responsible, have bribed some poor relation to marry her. Absolutely *no way* would he have married her himself. <br />But even later, McNaught did little to persuade me to like the book. The scenes in London after Alexandra was launched into Society were farcical. And the events surrounding Jordan's return were poorly written - as another reviewer has said, it's beyond credulity that there would have been so little discussion of what had happened to him. I can't believe that Alexandra would never have asked him to tell her about it, given her supposed feelings for him.<br />The murder plot and its resolution were totally ridiculous. The dénouement left me reeling in disbelief that McNaught expected me to swallow such a thin explanation. So, by that time, the resolution of the romance left me cold - and gaping in disbelief at Alexandra's near-resurrection, which was never explained.<br />Then there were the errors and inconsistencies. We're introduced to both Jordan and Alexandra in their youth at the start of the book: he is eighteen and she is thirteen, a five-year gap. Then we meet them again at the start of the story proper, and he's twenty-seven to her seventeen! (There was no clue whatsoever in the early scenes that they supposedly took place five years apart). <br />Then Alexandra saved Jordan's life, and he `winces' at a small cut on her face. The man's just looked at a footpad with half his face blown off, and didn't bat an eyelid! Yet he `winces' at a small cut on what he believes to be a teenage village boy - when boys are always involved in some rough-and-tumble and acquiring cuts and bruises by the dozen. <br />McNaught made a major error after Jordan's reported death: she made Anthony the Duke immediately. The legal position at the time where a married man died without leaving a son was that the man's wife was assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise, and if she was pregnant, then everything was in limbo until the child was born and it was known whether it was a boy or a girl. There was no mention at all of any possibility that Alexandra might be pregnant, much less a notion of waiting before the title and lands passed to Anthony. <br />Oh, and even though Jordan was away for fifteen months, and he'd known Alexandra for, at most, a fortnight before his disappearance, she persisted in referring to her knowledge of him `two years ago' - at which point she'd never met him! And why didn't she have any money of her own? McNaught talks about the Dowager andAnthony giving her a dowry, but the marriage settlements would have provided for her in the event of her husband's death in any case. <br />To me, this was no `sweeping love story', and McNaught's talent as a writer pales in comparison to writers like Putney, Beverley and Balogh.	2001-01-18

Eleanor, our heroine, is raped at the start of the book by the Earl of Stainbridge - a rape organised by her own brother, who wishes to blackmail the Earl. Eleanor does not shrug it off - did that reviewer read the book, as opposed to just skimming it? - she was actually contemplating throwing herself into the lake to drown when she met Stainbridge again. Consumed by guilt, Stainbridge - who was already on his way to Eleanor's brother's house at the time - takes Eleanor under his wing, but lies and claims it was his brother who'd raped her.<br />Nicholas Delaney (who, as the son of an Earl, should actually be Lord Nicholas) is engaged on crucial espionage work, and under orders to conduct an affair with Therese Bellaire, suspected to be involved in a Napoleonic plot. However, he agrees to bail his brother out, hoping that he can tie up his investigation quickly and end his affair. Nicholas is like no other man Eleanor has met: he is kind, considerate, values her opinions and treats her in many ways as his equal, unlike most men of the time and unlike her own experience with men. On their wedding night, she learns the truth about her rape, and he makes love to her gently and considerately - yet another hangover from the rape is that she's, naturally, afraid of sex. <br />Of course, the affair in the background means that Nicholas's behaviour is erratic; some of the time he is loving to Eleanor and willingly seeks her company, but as Therese becomes more and more unco-operative and Nicholas comes to care more for Eleanor, he has to distance himself from her and act as if their marriage had never seemed likely to become more than one of convenience. Eleanor, who had guessed that Nicholas has a mistress, accepts it because it was the norm for men at the time, and because their marriage *was* arranged, and the understanding was that she and Nicholas would lead separate lives. Neither of them, after all, she thinks, had anticipated that she'd fall in love with Nicholas.<br />And who wouldn't fall in love with Nicholas?! He is a wonderful creation: charming, amusing, considerate, very capable, intelligent, a great lover, and - best of all - he has a vulnerable side. <br />He also has some fascinating friends. I wish I'd read this book before reading An Unwilling Bride (publishers, *please* make it more clear when books are part of a series, and what their place in the series is!); I would have understood Lucien a lot better if I'd read this first, much as I loved Luce's own story. Francis also appealed enormously, and I hope he gets his own story at some point.<br />Nicholas and Eleanor make a wonderful couple, and I hope to have many glimpses of them in future Company of Rogues books.	2001-01-16

However, if Dangerous is a fair sample of her work, as the reviews here seem to suggest, I won't be reading anything by her again.<br />The first thing which irritates me is that Ms Quick is clearly not a writer to allow historical accuracy, in relation to societal manners and mores, get in the way of her desired plot-line. I don't see the point in writing novels set in a particular period in history if the novelist is going to write about situations which simply would not have happened because the normal behaviour of the time wouldn't have permitted it. So, for example, no matter how much Prudence might have wanted it, she would not have been permitted to spend so much time alone with Sebastian at the various entertainments she attended; as an unmarried woman, even on the shelf as she'd be presumed to be at 25, she would have been chaperoned very closely. And as for calling him Sebastian before they were even engaged, let alone married... <br />But besides that, this was a book which would have been far better as a 200-page short Regency. After Prue and Sebastian were married, it lost all interest and simply became boring. The 'investigations' sub-plot was tedious and uninteresting, and the lack of any real tension between the two principals meant that I was turning pages merely to finish the book.<br />I doubt I'll be reading anything else by this writer; perhaps her fans look for different things from their historical romances than I do.	2001-01-16

I really enjoyed this story about an arranged marriage between the Marquess of Arden and an ordinary schoolteacher; the reason for the marriage was fascinating, and certainly made for an interesting story.<br />The character dynamics in the book were excellent. I really liked the Duke and Duchess, and their interest in Lucien and Beth - though I was somewhat disappointed that the Duke never told Lucien what he told his wife: that he was proud of Lucien and happy to have him as his heir. Given the distressing news he gave Lucien at the start of the book, and Lucien's obvious hurt at that news, it would have been a worthy reconciliation.<br />I liked Nicholas and Eleanor, and am looking forward to reading their story next; it certainly sounds intriguing. <br />But, most of all, I loved Lucien and Beth. These two struck sparks off each other right from the start, and gradually accepted that they had to come to some sort of accommodation. Finally, by the day of their wedding, they became friends, and that period in which their friendship grew was a beautiful section of the book. There was some sexual tension, but mostly what we saw was two people who had a lot in common and who gradually realised that they were, in fact, soulmates.<br />Beverley's knowledge of the period again stands her in excellent stead; I really hate finding elementary historical inaccuracies in Regencies, but so far Beverley hasn't failed me. Another excellent book!	2001-01-11

I read it straight through in a couple of hours, in total contrast to the many wonderful books by the above writers, which keep me wallowing for more than twice that length of time and leave me feeling very satisfied in the end.<br />Quinn certainly has a deft hand for comedy, and many scenes in this book were very amsuing - such as the 'James, stand up straight!' scene referred to by another reviewer. But overall I found the book disappointing.<br />The story became extremely farcical towards the end, especially in the scene in Elizabeth's cottage where everyone was talking at once and the scene's figure-of-fun was out of the loop. I found myself rolling my eyes in exasperation at that point.<br />Historical accuracy has to take a back seat as well: the characters' behaviour - and Lady Danbury's encouragement of it - does not jell with the mores of the time, and no young lady of good character would have behaved as Lizzie did - nor would any gentleman, a marquis or not, have expected her to.<br />Oh, factual note, Ms Quinn: if a married woman bears a child to another man, not her husband, that child is *not* illegitimate. The law recognises the woman's husband as that child's father, whether he is so biologically or not. <br />And I really wish that Ms Quinn or her editor would take some lessons in grammar. 'Off of' is grammatically incorrect, as is 'the both of us', and since they are inaccuracies unheard of outside America, there is no way that any English aristocrat would make those errors. Likewise, Ms Quinn needs to learn the difference between 'lie' and 'lay'; it's distracting when so many elementary grammatical mistakes appear in a novel. Without those errors jerking me out of the book every few pages, I might have awarded this book four stars.	2001-01-08

First, many stories in these anthologies suffer from being over-short; the usual 70 - 100 pages is simply not sufficient to develop the storyline in a sufficiently satisfying manner. Second, there is always at least one story in each collection which is disappointing and lets the others down.<br />However, I saw this book in, of all places, a bookshop in Manchester (yes, in the UK). An import, at a very reasonable price, so I decided to give it a try. And I'm delighted I did, having had several days of very satisfying reading from five authors, none of whose work I had read before.<br />These stories all have a strong Christmas theme, which is done properly, in sharp contract to many Christmas-themed books these days in which the festive season gets perhaps a couple of lines at the end with no other mentions anywhere in the book. Each story in this anthology *feels* Christmassy, in different ways. And yet each story is very different. There are two contemporary romances in US settings, two British historical romances (in the Victorian period, though again each very different), and one time-travel, again set in the US. <br />We have a modern career woman reunited with the childhood hero who devastated her years ago by a careless act; a still-grieving widow who discovers that the boss of whom she thoroughly disapproves has an incredibly romantic heart; a poverty-stricken young woman finds out how it feels to play the role of angel to a lonely widower and his son; a young Victorian choolmistress enters into an arranged marriage with a reclusive Earl so that his orphaned niece will have a governess, and quickly finds a way to melt his frozen heart; and a 1990s woman is transported back to Pioneer country, finding herself married to the man of her dreams.<br />I loved each and every one of these short stories. None - well, except perhaps the last, which ended a little abruptly - seemed over-short or insufficiently well developed. And each had its share of humour, angst, romance and heartwarming seasonal cheer.<br />Highly recommended!	2001-01-02

Well, usually considerably better than this. I knew I'd wasted my money when, in the very first chapter, the writing was so stilted and amateurish. Short sentences, frequent use of the second person in narrative when it distracted from the flow and was completely unnecessary - eg (from memory) 'on your birthday you were the most important person in the house'; this being in *narrative*, not dialogue. <br />The plot was hackneyed, but then they frequently are. What made this book almost unreadable, and only fit for throwing out now, was the complete lack of *any* sense of romance or sexual tension. Many scenes seem to have been included merely to pad out the book, since they didn't contribute to the plot or relationship development. This - with a very critical editor - would have been better as an 80-page short story in an anthology.<br />And I was tempted to challenge this book's marketing under Trade Descriptions. A Christmas book? Mistletoe? The only mention of mistletoe was on the cover. The only mention of Christmas was a very brief, in-passing mention of a pre-Christmas party on the penultimate page. This was not a Christmas book.<br />Oh, and I just could not believe the characters' decision not to tell the child that Keith was his real father. Huh??? What if he somehow found out later in life? (There are so many ways that could happen). How would he then feel about the way his parents had deceived him?<br />Bad, bad, bad.	2000-12-27

She creates a series of likeable characters - even her 'villains', to the extent that any have malicious or unkind motives, are well drawn and aren't without redeeming features.<br />Celia is the impoverished great-grand-daughter of a duke; her grandfather was disowned by his family many years before, and she has never met any of her titled relatives. All of her immediate family has recently died tragically, and she faces life as a governess. Until the Duchess, her cousin-once-removed by marriage, arrvies to sweep her off to Delacourt Palace. Unknown to Celia, the Duchess has ulterior motives...<br />Jack Delacourt, the Marquess of Lynden, is well aware of his mother's matchmaking activities, and has no intention of being caught in this particular trap. This leads him to behave coarsely and lewdly, hoping to give Celia a disgust of him. But he finds himself falling in love with her instead... while she's convinced that he's insane!<br />The Duchess's plotting is frequently hilarious, but equally frequently poignant, as we are let in on the secret she shares only with her abigail: she is terminally ill, and desperate to see her only son married to someone who will continue to run Delacourt just as she has always done. It's very clear that Celia won't; it's equally clear that Jack would simply not be happy with someone who would!<br />There is a delightful, and low-key, secondary romance to look forward to, as well. Definitely a heart-warming book to read at Christmas-time!	2000-12-26

And I'm very glad I did. Putney has certainly not lost her talent for taking a seeming impossible relationship and bringing the couple back together. Here, along with forgiveness and understanding, goes redemption.<br />I liked Putney's way of introducing us to her two main characters. We meet Kate and Donovan when they've been divorced for ten years, but are not told what caused the break-up of their marriage. Instead, we get to meet them both and get to know them a little first. And Donovan seems to be a nice guy, considerate, understanding, regretful over the way he treated Kate. By letting her readers get to know Donovan in this way, Putney not only lets us get to know him without preconceptions and, as a result, come to like him; it means that when we do find out what happened in Kate and Donovan's marriage, the shock is all the greater.<br />Domestic violence is unacceptable. I have no intention of getting into the debate which has raged in these reviews about whether it is or is not a forgiveable offence. Putney herself acknowledges that it is a highly controversial theme to include in a romance. However, I did accept by the end of the book that she had shown Donovan as not only genuinely sorry for what he'd done, but also as someone who had overcome his violent impulses. He'd worked out why he was violent (violent, controlling father, the influence of alcohol), and had undergone counselling and treatment. He had unlearned the habit of violence. I was totally convinced of that. And so I was totally convinced that Kate was right to come to love him again. <br />What spoilt the book somewhat for me, though, was the dramatic/action/mystery plot. It took over too much for my liking: I prefer my romances to focus on the individuals. I understand that Putney was using the demolition industry as a metaphor for the characters' relationships, but that's not really what I want from a novel, and for me it overshadowed the *real* story. There were also a few too many secondary characters; I might wonder whether Putney is considering writing about some of Kate's friends, except that I hoped for similar follow-ups to Uncommon Vows and it didn't happen. I suspect Putney likes to try out different genres as experimentation, whether or not she intends to continue writing in those genres, but still finds it hard to resist introducing a whole cast of secondary characters just in case she might want to make use of them some day. (That said, I did like the secondary romance in this book).<br />So, while I enjoyed this book and will definitely keep it, it won't be re-read with the same enjoyment or frequency as M-J P's historical novels.	2000-12-19

I was looking forward to Rothgar's story too, and Beverley definitely did not disappoint: in fact, she saved the best until last. Neither Something Wicked nor Secrets of the Night, the other Malloren books I've read, came anywhere close to this. Bey's story still haunts me; it's incredibly memorable, and far exceeded my expectations.<br />First, the story does *not* `start on page 166', as one reviewer claims; does she believe a romance novel only begins at the first love scene? Second, the early part isn't merely `synopses of the previous novels' - we get about three separate short paragraphs summarising Elf and Brand's romances. This is in no way distracting, and it's a useful reminder of important elements of previous plot. If the complaint refers to Rothgar's memories of his mother strangling his baby sister, I would point out that this is Rothgar's story. His refusal to contemplate marriage and reproduction lies entirely in his conviction that his mother was insane; he will not perpetuate insanity in his family. Of *course* we need his own thoughts on that! And Bey's friend and occasional lover, Sappho, introduced in previous books, plays a very minor role, so I have no idea what this complaint relates to. And Diana whiney? Now I *know* I read a different book from the reviewer who said that!<br />I knew, from Secrets of the Night, that Diana would be Bey's love; that book set up some intriguing sexual tension between them, and this was magnified in the early stages of Devilish. Both Bey and Diana dread their meeting, knowing how they react to one another. But the king's desire that Bey bring Diana to court means they will be thrown into one another's company far more frequently, and he warns her (bringing the subject of their mutual attraction into the open) that they must avoid each other. Even his offer of a marriage in name only, should she need help, is clearly only to be considered as a last resort.<br />And this leads me to the complaints that therewere insufficient love scenes. Are these reviewers forgetting that this is Georgian England? Unmarried ladies *did not* conduct sexual relationships outside marriage, and a reputation could be ruined by gossip, so when exactly were Diana and Bey to conduct this mad, passionate affair? Secondly, Bey refused to risk procreation because of his family history, so it would be totally out of character for him to jump into bed at every opportunity. He slept with Sappho in the past, true; but she was infertile.<br />The plot is excellently summarised by L.N.Tramposch's review of 19 May.  I was delighted with the development of Bey's character in this book. It's not possible for him to have remained the distant, although caring, Dark Marquess for ever; he fell in love, and we see him softened by that. One reviewer comments that Bey seemed out of character, but I find that absurd. It's one of Bey's strengths that he can be strong and in control while yielding control to others: genuine love means allowing people freedom to make mistakes, while being around to pick up the pieces. It also means not wanting to control the loved ones; as Diana says during one of Bey's very protective phases, she doesn't want to be weakened by his protectiveness (in fact, she goes out of her way to ensure that he *won't* have to rescue her, which is why she decided that, if she did become pregnant, she wouldn't burden him with the knowledge, knowing his history). And this is why he gives her some leeway where he is concerned: he loves her. He still sets the limitations, which the reviewer who complained that Diana made all the decisions failed to understand. Bey allowed Diana to kiss him at the Queen's House; Diana even notes that if he hadn't wanted to be kissed, he wouldn't have permitted it. She initiated the kiss, but he controlled it. Likewise, in the scene at the cottage, Bey *wanted* to exact revenge himself, but he knew that Diana needed to do it for her own self-respect. In the same way,in Something Wicked, Bey allowed Elf to insist that Fort *not* be killed for taking her virtue and boasting about it.<br />The first love scene in this story is one of the very best I have read in romantic fiction. It haunted me so much that I couldn't stop thinking about it the following day, and had to go and re-read it before finishing the book. For very convincing reasons, Bey let down his guard and showed Diana just what lovemaking between them could be like, in response to her plea, and it was all the more poignant given they both knew it couldn't be repeated. (When they did make love for a second time, it was beautiful and poignant in a different way, and showed that Bey's trust in Diana was winning against his own battle with his conscience).<br />The love between Diana and Bey was obvious right from the start. It was there even when they barely spoke, and it was clear in the scenes where they were together in public but had to watch every word they said, for fear of damage to her reputation. Sexual tension crackled between them in every scene; and it was very much mutual. Diana is absolutely a worthy match for Bey; she's strong, independent and intelligent, and he would never be satisfied with less. He would be bored rigid by an undemanding or naïve heroine: a woman like that could never have persuaded him to marry. The historical setting and the political plot added to the story; given Rothgar's intriguing, the absence of a dramatic plot would have been a mistake.<br />This is a keeper, and I can see myself re-reading it very soon. *Now* I understand where Beverley's high reputation comes from!	2000-12-13

She's a 25-year-old virgin with a sensual nature, strong-willed and determined, and longing for excitement. She also longs to understand what all the fuss is about where sex is concerned, but can't bring herself to marry one of her 'convenient' suitors. She wants to be in love.<br />Fort, Lord Walsgrave, has just become her twin's brother-in-law. Elf finds herself strangely drawn to Fort, but he hates all Mallorens with a vengeance. By coincidence, however, Elf falls into Fort's hands at a masquerade which she attended disguised as a demi-rep, Lisette, wearing a mask and speaking only French. Fort takes her home with him (this is all part of the political intrigue sub-plot, in which he is involved), but, although his kisses tempt her to make love with him, she can't go through with it, and escapes.<br />The next time she meets Fort, she acknowledges to herself that she is attracted to him; she makes an attempt to end the feud, but all he will promise is not to provoke a fight with her brothers. He calls her Vespa, a wasp, and makes it clear she holds no attraction for him.<br />Desperate situations call for desperate measures; the Lisette disguise returns, and Elf propositions Fort. They share a wonderful night of love... until they're kidnapped by the plotters, and the morning after, once they're rescued, Fort sees Elf without her mask and recognises her. In that moment, she's lost him.<br />This is the second Malloren book I've read, and again, while I prefer Mary Jo Putney's work, I did enjoy this very much. I am surprised at reviews below describing the book as 'disappointing' or 'boring'; I found it fast-paced and with an interesting plot. The only point at which I found myself getting a little bit bored was when Elf started taking an interest in the silk trade; I don't thinkwe needed as much information as Beverley gave us here.<br />Something Wicked gets four stars rather than five because I don't think Beverley explained Fort's change of heart adequately. She wrote several passages of the book from Fort's point of view, so she could certainly have allowed us more insight. We go from Fort being furious at Elf's deception and never wanting to see her again, to a point a week or so later when he gives her his hand and says, &quot;Friends?&quot;. What brought about that change of heart? We are not told. <br />Likewise, he then leaves her for about four months before making contact again; the only excuse he gives her was that he was 'abroad'. Why were we, the readers, not told what he was up to during that time? Why weren't we privy to his changing feelings for Elf? Without these insights, I found it hard to accept how Fort's hatred of all things Malloren - and especially Elf - could disappear virtually overnight.	2000-12-11

This is the first Jo Beverley book I have read, and it's also more than half-way through a series. It's a credit to Beverley as a writer, though, that I didn't realise it was towards the end of the Malloren series until I read her author's notes at the end. <br />Rosamunde Overton is married to a man much older than she is, and who is not expected to live long; they have no children, and the heir is a member of a Puritanical sect whom no-one wants to inherit the land. So hints aplenty have been dropped: Rosa should get herself pregnant by whatever means possible, so that the baby can be passed off as her husband's. By pure chance, Lord Brand Malloren has been drugged and dumped in the middle of a bog; Rosa finds him, rescues him and, as payment, demands his sexual services. And what begins as pure sex turns into something more.<br />But Brand has no idea who his temporary mistress is, and Rosa is determined that they will never meet again. But she reckons without Malloren determination, and the resourcefulness of Brand's elder brother, Bey. <br />This is certainly an enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it memorable; it has none of the haunting qualities of a Mary Jo Putney, or of Balogh at her best. I also felt that some descriptive passages were rushed: I had to read some of the action sequences several times to understand what had happened. Beverley also skips over elements of the story very quickly, losing the sense of suspense and failing to take advantage of opportunities for angst or romantic scenes. And I still don't know, for example, just how Brand managed to be at Wenscote in time to save Rosa from attack, since the last time we saw Brand he was headed somewhere else entirely. His presence was neither explained at the time nor in retrospect.<br />Having said that, I do intend to read the other Malloren books, and in particular - since I guessed from this book who Bey, Lord Rothgar's, own particular Nemesis would be - Bey's own story.	2000-12-09

In this book, Gil and Chloe have known each other for years. They're the best of friends, but have never seen each other in any other light. Until one night they're stranded together in a cottage. Although both protest that nothing happened, suddenly a notice of their engagement appears in the newspapers.<br />Gil can't jilt Chloe. Chloe doesn't want to humiliate Gil. So they agree to carry on for a while, and when they realise that Gil's (married) sister is being pursued by a rake, Chloe decides to pretend that the engagement is real in order to encourage the rake to flirt with her too.<br />Farr makes excellent use of jealousy in this book; there are some wonderful scenes in which Gil sees Chloe with Lord Rival and realises just what his feelings for his childhood friend are. But he still has the major problem that Chloe, for very good reasons, has no wish to marry...<br />There is a very well-written secondary plot - which is one reason why I found this book reminiscent of a Heyer (another is the extremely well-drawn cast of cameo and secondary characters). Gil's sister and her husband are well-drawn and Farr makes us sympathise with them in their difficulties. Gil's mother, who appears near the end, is also a wonderful character!<br />And, just to make the Heyer comparison even clearer, Farr has actually set this story in one of Heyer's books! Who else recognised Alverstoke and his sister, from 'Frederica', and recognised the ball Chloe attended as being the one Alverstoke threw for his cousin Chloe and Frederica's younger sister?	2000-12-04

This is the third and final volume in the trilogy Balogh started with 'Indiscreet'; an excellent series about four friends who fought in the Peninsular war together, came home, planned to have a riotous time together as bachelors... and, one by one, succumbed to the lure of love and marriage - though not necessarily in that order!<br />After Rex and Kenneth's stories, in Irresistible we finally get Nat's, with Eden's thrown in as an extra (I wasn't surprised to discover that Ede didn't get his own book: throughout the series, he was the least well-drawn character. However, his and Lavinia's fiery relationship made a pleasant diversion in this book). <br />Two years after going home to deal with family responsibilities, Nat returns to London, partly to see his friends again, but mainly because he has one remaining sister and a cousin to marry off. He is also feeling quite sexually frustrated, and looks forward to some carousing... until he realises that sex with prostitutes no longer has any appeal. So he decides to look for a willing widow of his own class with whom to have an affair.<br />In the meantime, Sophie Armitage, widow of an old friend of the four, is still in London; the four run into her and remember how much they all liked her in years gone by, so she joins their social circle. An unexpected sexual attraction strikes between Sophie and Nat, and they take advantage of it; Nat then is amazed when Sophie suggests that they have a discreet affair. Not that he's at all averse to the idea, of course... <br />But there is more to Sophie's current circumstances than meets the eye. She's being blackmailed, and gradually she is forced to deny all her friendships, including her relationship with Nat, as her blackmailer becomes angry at the actions of the four in trying to protect her. So can Nat find out what is going on in time, and can he and Sophie realise what their feelings really are for each other before they say goodbye for ever?<br />This is a heart-warming love story about two friends who begin an affair and fall in love. Both were always fond of each other, even though Nat never saw Sophie as a possible romantic or sexual partner before this; each has a high degree of respect for each other. And this fondness and respect is always there, even during the points in this book when they're at odds or when Sophie has to withdraw from her friendships with Nat and his friends. It's a delightful read, and one you'll want to keep.	2000-11-21

This is the sequel to Balogh's Indiscreet, and worth reading for that reason alone, since Indiscreet introduced the 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse', as Rex, Kenneth, Nat and Eden were known during the Peninsular war. For those who wanted to know more about all four characters, this book gives you what you were looking for.<br />At the end of Indiscreet, we're left with quite a cliffhanger concerning Kenneth: he has to return home to marry a woman who is having his baby and whom he says he dislikes more than he has ever disliked anyone in his life (and this can't be a spoiler, since it's part of the plot summary on the cover of Unforgiven and on this site!). I, for one, was desperate to find out exactly how this had come about.<br />Kenneth and Moira, we learn right at the start of the book, have known each other for years, but their families have been estranged for generations. We learn that Moira, Kenneth and their respective siblings were friends in secret as children, but it's apparent that something happened which not only tore apart those friendships and the burgeoning love Kenneth and Moira felt for each other, but also renewed the family quarrel with a vengeance.<br />Moira has just agreed to marry her distant cousin, a prosy, pompous, self-important bore who also happens to be the heir to her family home, at the point when she meets Kenneth again. It's very clear to the reader that their mutual dislike hides a very mutual attraction. However, both suppress it very heavily indeed, and more might never have come of it had Moira not attended the Christmas ball at Dunbarton and overheard some comments about herself spoken by Kenneth's mother and sister. She foolishly goes out to walk home alone in heavy snow...<br />I have to admit that the circumstances in which the child was conceived made me raise an eyebrow; I still find it a little difficult to accept that Kenneth would propose, and Moira would accept, that particular course of action in those particularcircumstances. Nevertheless, that's the premise Balogh went with, and I was able to ignore my reservations and concentrate on the story.<br />The way in which two stubborn people who did not want to be married to each other, and who can't seem to be able to speak to each other without causing yet more misunderstandings, come to realise that they do actually love each other - and that they can actually *tell* each other that fact - is very well told by Balogh. She does do misunderstood lovers very well indeed. <br />Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find Moira's behaviour childish, although Kenneth accuses her of that more than once. She's certainly stubborn. And she believes, as we find out later, that she has very good reason to hate him, and therefore she resents the need to ask him for anything at all - and his own imperious, occasionally domineering Earl of Haverford manner doesn't help. As for her refusal to accept at first that she was pregnant, how many of us can exist in a state of denial over something we would rather wasn't happening? And she did face up to the truth eventually.<br />I did like this book a lot, and will be reading it again. Now for Nat's story in Irresistable!	2000-11-19

Instead, he is her landlord's twin brother, Viscount Rawleigh, who assumes that she's throwing out lures. So he pursues her, and eventually makes an improper proposal, which she rejects angrily. Not that he gives up; he continues to pursue her. Although she is attracted to him, she has no wish to become anyone's mistress and keeps refusing him... until the night when he's careless and she's compromised utterly...<br />One of the things Balogh does really well in this book is to give us an excellent picture of the nature of English society in the Regency era. First we have the claustrophobic village atmosphere, and the incredibly judgemental inhabitants; it's hard to imagine how people could have coped with that. Later, we have London society: the ton, for whom an eternity would be a short time, and who were not likely to have forgotten Catherine's indiscretion in a mere six years.<br />Rex was at his best in the scenes after his and Catherine's marriage; up until that point he appeared shallow and uncaring, but it was after they arrived at his estate that I started to like him. And in the end this was a lovely love story.<br />Can't wait to read the sequel next, to find out why Ken had to hurry off so suddenly!	2000-11-18

Here, Balogh gives Emily her own romance, and also allows us to see how Luke and Anna have grown as a couple - their relationship, while in the background, is shown to be mature and solid.<br />Emily has been deaf and mute since a small child, and only Anna, Luke, and particularly Ashley, Luke's younger brother, really understand her when she tries to communicate and make the effort to communicate properly with her. Ashley, however, went away when she was fifteen, and although he subsequently married, she still loves him. Luke, her brother-in-law, understands that, but also wants her to have a home of her own rather than feeling that she has to be dependent on relatives for the rest of her life. Believing that he has her best interests at heart, he tries to find her a husband. But, just as she is about to accept Lord Powell, Ashley comes home...<br />Ashley has been widowed in tragic circumstances, and is now a bitter, guilt-ridden man of thirty. None of his family can get through to him to find out what's going on inside his head... except Emmy, who always understood him years before. Except that he cannot vocalise his feelings any longer, so instead he takes comfort from her in another way.<br />She refuses to marry him, because although she loves him she knows that he doesn't love her and only asked out of a sense of honour. The real problem here is that Ashley's image of Emily is still fixed on the fourteen-year-old child she once was; he is unable for a very long time to acknowledge that she is now a woman, and so he can't allow himself to think of her as a desirable partner instead of his little fawn. He remembers her as a child, and hates himself for adding to his own guilt over what he did to her.<br />There are many themes in this story: inner healing, redemption, the meaning of maturity, and even more important the nature of disability. Emily is the only person who does not consider her deafness a handicap; no matter how well-meaning they are, the rest of her family all consider it an affliction they must help her overcome. Anna by teaching Emily how to behave in society, Luke by teaching her to read and write, Ashley by insisting that she learn to form words and speak. As Emily herself thinks any number of times, perhaps they should learn from her about the qualities of silence. However, Ashley does grow in this respect: he ceases assuming that he knows what's best for her and learns to appreciate her world as well.<br />(So, to the reviewer who made that crass comment about Emily's deafness, I ask: did you read the book? Emily *never* sought special treatment or considered herself pitiful because of her deafness.)<br />The one thing which seemed completely superfluous in this book was the villain plot. It seemed unnecessary; there was more than enough material for Balogh to write about in simply resolving Ashley and Emily's relationship. The villain brought a different dynamic into the story, and I actually would have preferred Ash and Emily to turn to each other because they realised themselves that they loved each other, not because someone else's actions gave them a shove in the right direction.<br />That aside, this is a deeply emotional book which deserves its high rating.	2000-11-15

Jane seemed to be both intelligent and sensible - so what on earth was she doing working for that kind of magazine and letting herself be talked into ghost-writing some lackwit socialite's column for her?

He certainly has no wish to marry. And yet, within the space of a week he has done all this: returned to London, reacquainted himself with his mother and remaining siblings, and married Anna, god-daughter of his uncle's long-term lover. He makes no claim to be in love with her, nor does she with him; however, they have engaged in several highly enjoyable flirting sessions in public. He finds himself attracted to her, and if he must marry, why not Anna? And he knows he must marry, since his older brother's widow is dropping hints that she would not be averse to resuming their childhood romance.<br />Anna had also sworn never to marry; all we know is that there is a mysterious man in her past who seems to terrify her. She knows, for the man told her, that he will come back for her one day. He also told her that no man would want her as a wife, since she isn't untouched. And yet she agrees to marry Luke, while dreading her wedding night and the consequences should the terror from her past reappear.<br />On their wedding night, Anna discovers that lovemaking can be beautiful and very pleasurable; Luke discovers that she was not a virgin. His reaction to that discovery means that no secrets can be confided to each other; their marriage becomes, for a time, a shallow affair in which neither talks of their real feelings: duty during the day, pleasure at night.<br />And yet, even as they hide their secrets from each other, the man who believes himself incapable of love discovers, day by day, that his heart wasn't buried after all the day he was estranged from his family. Luke is far from being heartless. But, as well as resolving his relationship with Anna, he has a long way to go to regain the trust of his younger brother and sister, and to discover the truth about his older brother's betrayal, the act which had caused Luke to become estranged in the first place.<br />For a change - Balogh usually tends not to write in simple black and white and her villains are rarely one-dimensional - in Heartless we have two pure evil villains: one Anna's tormentor, and a female accomplice. This is unusual for Balogh, and even more so in that she never really gives her villain a clear motive - except, perhaps, insanity. This aspect of the story is less important than Anna and Luke's relationship: as another reviewer noted, Balogh has done an excellent job of showing how Luke was falling in love with Anna without even realising it. When Luke finally tells Anna of his feelings, it was no surprise to me, and in a way I was surprised that Anna hadn't already realised.<br />This is a wonderful book, and I'm looking forward to re-reading it. I'm also very much looking forward to reading the sequel, Silent Melody; Heartless has some very likeable secondary characters, and I'm keen to meet Emily and Ashley again.	2000-11-13

This is not, however, the way to impress Deborah Grantham, who is in fact an entirely honourable young lady despite her presence in her aunt's gaming-house.<br />So Deborah decides to spite Ravenscar; first she rejects out of hand his offers to buy her off, then appears in public with his nephew, Adrian, dressed and behaving as precisely the vulgar harpy her believes her to be. This, of course, only serves to infuriate him even more, and he ups the stakes further.<br />There are some hilarious scenes in this book - the one where Deborah has Ravenscar kidnapped and imprisoned in her cellar (and then... oh, but no spoilers! &lt;g&gt;) is worth the price of this book all on its own.<br />For a sparkling and determined heroine, and a hero who, despite his stiff-necked pride, has a very well-developed sense of both honour and humour, you can't go far wrong with Heyer's Faro's Daughter.	2000-11-01

As for the crazy rescues, the narrative was too improbable for words.<br />The only really interesting characters in this book were David and Violet, and we saw far too little of their romance.

Patricia Oliver has a reputation for writing heartwrenching Regency romances with attractive, rogueish heroes who have damaged pasts, and strong-minded, independent heroines. Her men are often rakes, and even try to carry on being rakes after meeting their destined wives - even try to be rakes *with* their destined wives - but end up making devoted husbands.<br />Her last three books have marked a shift away from this established and loved pattern; and, frankly, it hasn't worked. The Lady in Grey was tedious. Scandalous Secrets seemed to lack the Oliver spark. And, with Lady Jane's Nemesis, I have finally encountered an Oliver book I don't want to finish. Had it been by any other writer, I'd have junked it after the first three or four chapters; as it is, I'm persevering. I have only three chapters to go, but it's getting harder and harder to continue reading.<br />It's not the premise: a writer of Oliver's calibre should have been able to write an excellent novel predicated on the story of a woman betrothed from birth to a neighbour's son, secretly in love with him, but who discovers that he's having an affair with the wife of another neighbour. But instead she's produced this book.<br />I would have had far more respect for Jane had she stuck to her initial resolve not to marry Roger. But she agreed - well, perhaps she had little choice. But two days before the wedding she catches him in _flagrante_ again, yet marries him and goes to bed with him without any attempt to tell him that he must promise never to see her again. She had the upper hand before they were married - he needed her money.<br />And then when, a month or so into the marriage, she receives evidence that he's seeing his mistress again, does she tax him with it? No; she hides the letter and carries on as before. And then - this I *cannot* believe - knowing the mistress is pregnant with Roger's baby, she nurses the woman through her final illness, and allows her husband to bring his illegitimate child by another woman into her household, seemingly not caring what family, servants and neighbours think of her husband's lack of loyalty. The last straw for me was when Jane actually thinks that the world is a worse place without Maud, the mistress, and contradicts her aunt when that woman refers to Maud as a brazen hussy. Yet that was precisely how Jane thought of her a bare month earlier!<br />As for Roger, he is a weak, vacillating idiot who can't seem to make up his mind between Jane and Maud, and I can't see why any woman of sense would actually want to be married to him. Maybe, in the mores of the time, Jane had no choice. But as a reader, I have a choice of whether I care about him or not. As it is, I have only contempt for him.<br />Patricia Oliver used to be the only Regency writer whose books I would pre-order as soon as they were advertised here, before reading any reviews. That has now stopped; until I see evidence that she has returned to her previously excellent standards, as evidenced in Lord Gresham's Lady and An Unsuitable Match, I won't be buying any more of her books. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this one.	2000-10-23

There have been a number of books in a similar genre now: consisting entirely of emails and in which the reader eavesdrops on what should be private correspondence. This, however, is the first to have held my interest. I thought at first that a 'cast list', or Shakespearean _dramatis personae_, would have been a useful addition to the book, since I was having difficulty keeping track of who was who. But, after a chapter or so, it became much easier.<br />The cast is full of larger-than-life characters; secretaries who judge their status by that of their bosses; copywriters who spend as much of the day as they can in the nearest bar talking about how crap their last campaign was; a creative director who is a big-headed idiot, and a managing director who can't figure out how to send email correctly, and so ends up copying everything to a Finnish CEO he detests.<br />The Coke ad campaign acts as a backdrop for some crazy shenanigans; lots of backstabbing, plotting, intrigue, two-faced behaviour and even a bit of sexual impropriety (which gets filmed and exposed in a very public manner... ;)). Not forgetting Scandinavia's finest current pop export, Aqua, who play a minor supporting role. <br />This is a quick read, but certainly enjoyable.	2000-10-14

The main plot, as shown in the synopsis above, has Diana travelling to London with her son to become a courtesan; she is immediately attracted to Gervase Brandelin, Viscount St Aubyn, and becomes his mistress. What he doesn't know - and nor do we at the time - is that Diana is actually the woman Gervase was forced to marry more than eight years earlier, when she was fifteen, and whom he raped in his fury immediately after the ceremony. Ever since, he's been haunted by guilt.<br />I wish the cover synopsis had been phrased differently, because Diana's surname was given as 'Brandelin'; this gave away the plot. Had it not been for that, while I might have had my suspicions I would have only found out at the same time as Gervase that Diana was actually his wife. However, this element of the plot was revealed by the use of her married surname - as it is by the synopsis on this site.<br />One aspect which I found unconvincing was Diana's attitude to Gervase when they met in London, however. As we discover later, she still harboured a lot of anger and resentment against him for what he'd done to her; yet her reaction on meeting him seemed to be mostly attraction. I would have found it more convincing had she also been wary, afraid, cautious, reluctant to risk getting involved with him. This would have been more in keeping with her previous knowledge of him.<br />That aside, I enjoyed this book very much, and especially liked Putney's relating of Diana and Gervase's first few months as lovers - particularly her time with him at Aubynwood. Putney knows how to portray lovers, both in terms of physical lovemaking and the development of an emotional bond.	2000-10-09

Since I noticed that The Rake is a sequel to The Diabolical Baron, I read the latter first; found it enjoyable but nothing wildly out of the ordinary. I was thus not expecting too much when I realised that the villain of 'Baron' was the hero of The Rake. But I realised very quickly that I underestimated Putney.<br />She doesn't try to force anyone to like Reggie; it's clear from the outset that he is a drunk and a gambler, and that he doesn't see anything wrong in sponging off his cousin, the Earl. But we also learn fairly early on that his behaviour has been shaped by circumstances. Put into the *right* circumstances, he begins to mend his ways.<br />Alys is a wonderful heroine, and her first meeting with Reggie is a terrific read. She knows he wants her - and, of course, her very unorthodox position as his farm manager, dressing in trousers most of the time, won't give him any illusions about her virtue. But she insists that she's not that kind of woman... and gradually, they become friends.<br />Reggie is an alcoholic, as becomes clear, and Putney pulls no punches as to its effect on his behaviour. Like some of her other books, this one contains harrowing scenes. And yet these are enlivened by flashes of humour; Reggie, when he's sober, is a delightful and witty person.<br />I just loved this book from start to finish. And now that I've written about it, I want to go and read it again!	2000-10-05

Leaving that aside, however, the story is certainly entertaining.<br />Katherine, widowed and recovering from a brutal forced marriage, is determined not to be fooled by a man again. However, the circumstances of her marriage are not widely known, which causes Nicholas Seton to approach her very carefully. When he first meets Katherine he's in disguise as a smuggler, but she sees him without his mask. They instantly fall in love, but he is still cautious...<br />Then Harry Tate arrives on the scene, and despite his unpleasant treatment of her, Katherine finds herself drawn to him also. She therefore believes herself torn between two men, both of whom she loves.<br />There were aspects of the book which I found difficult to accept: that a virtuous widow would sleep with a man she believed to be a smuggler, and so early in their acquaintance, as well. She is equally free with Harry Tate, making herself appear quite promiscuous. I was also surprised that Katherine did not appear to feel more guilt about being attracted to two men - we may know, after all (from the cover notes and from being privy to Nicholas's thoughts) that Nicholas and Harry are one and the same, but Katherine does not.<br />Still, an entertaining read, even if it does not possess the haunting qualities of Balogh's better works.	2000-10-04

The set-up may seem a little unusual, but I didn't find it beyond the bounds of credibility at all, and once past the initial scenes at La Gianetta's home I began to enjoy the tale very much.<br />Clarissa is a splendid heroine, determined to keep her virtue regardless of the alternatives, and Trevor - determined though he is to seduce her - displays an impressively keen sense of conscience once he is convinced that she is really a virgin. <br />Farr develops the growing friendship between Clarissa and Trevor in a sensitive and humorous fashion, at the same time showing the sexual attraction between them which refuses to go away no matter how much Clarissa wishes it would. I did find Trevor's own attitude towards marriage and love a little contradictory, true - he was determined to view his marriage as a stepping-stone to Society, but on the other hand he wanted to marry for love. However, I saw that as displaying a lack of understanding of what Society was like; after all, Trevor is very much on the fringes of the ton.<br />I did think the climax of the book was a little rushed; I would have liked a lot more of the character introspection which Far gives us earlier on in the book. However, that doesn't spoil the story for me.	2000-10-02

Charlie is a witty and daring heroine, and seems to make a convincing boy; however, her sister Beth seems far too feminine and missish to be at all convincing in the role of a boy - and so, when Charlie and Beth change places, I couldn't believe that Radcliffe didn't work out that something was wrong - quite apart from his hormonal reactions altering according to which twin was playing which role.<br />I enjoyed the scenes with Radcliffe and Charlie-as-a-boy very much. The brothel scene, and the earlier ones in the tavern, were very well written and amusing. But later elements of the plot became farcical - the trip to Gretna, Radcliffe's disguising himself as a woman, and so on. Like the other reviewer, I was also disappointed in the aftermath of the revelation of Charlie's real identity.<br />Of course, this book also requires a huge amount of suspension of disbelief. I overlooked the typos and grammatical errors, as well as the Americanisms in dialogue which were completely wrong for the location and the period. But Sands actually suggests that it became widely known that Charlie was really a woman - well, Charlie, Beth and Radcliffe would have faced social disgrace and ostracism. Charlie would have been branded a strumpet. Many more details were incorrect - for instance, it was a blacksmith and not a fisherman who married couples at Gretna.<br />This is a one-time read, for me.	2000-10-02

I only managed to read Book 2 (Cupid's Darts) and not the first in the series, Cupid's Mistake. I was disappointed with the second book, feeling that the only characters worth being interested in were Psyche and Harry.<br />Finally, here, we get Psyche's own story, in which, as her mother puts some pressure on her to find a husband, she realises with a shock that she's in love with her childhood friend, Harry... who she can't have because he is actually Eros, the God of Love, in disguise. Harry has been looking for his wife for the last thousand years, and Psyche is helping him in his quest.<br />But now she loves him... and circumstances reveal to Harry that he loves her too. Both manage to hide their feelings quite successfully until, in a gesture of friendship, Harry kisses her.<br />The book becomes very poignant at times, especially when Psyche pleads with Harry to make her fall in love with someone else; but thankfully, as the cover notes tell us, Harry realises who Psyche really is.<br />The subsidiary romance involving Artemis is also delightful. This book really is a keeper!	2000-09-28

Lydia hates accompanying her younger and more beautiful sister to social occasions, and Sam, despite being an Earl, insists on staying in a makeshift army hospital with the badly injured and dying men he commands. He meets Lydia when she and her sister join those Society men and women who visit the hospital; much to Lydia's disgust, her companions only want to stare. She, on the other hand, helps. And ultimately her insistence on helping out causes a major rift with her family...<br />I liked this less than other Kelly books, such as Mrs Drew Plays Her Hand and Reforming Lord Ragsdale; there is something in those two books which is simply haunting and unforgettable. In this book, I found Lydia's family members to be little more than one-dimensional caricatures, something which is certainly not the case in her other books. <br />I also couldn't understand why, after the mail coach was robbed, Sam didn't send for his friend, who *he* knew lived nearby. Instead, as he grew more ill, Lydia was forced to take desperate measures... all because, for some unknown reason, he didn't want his friend to know he was in the area. Silly, that.<br />So, overall, a rating of good, but...	2000-09-26

It's especially amusing, in the early stages, to see the different attitudes to love and sex taken by the male and female protagonists.<br />Jack is a late-twenty-something struggling artist, mostly sponging off his best friend and flatmate, Matt. Amy is a younger twenty-something temp, finds most of her work boring and hasn't had sex for six months. They meet in a bar - where else? - and get talking.<br />I did occasionally get frustrated by the fact that the narratives don't overlap; for instance, we see Jack and Amy's first meeting from Amy's perspective, but since she falls asleep we miss a lot of it. When the narrative switches to Jack, time has moved on; we don't find out what his first impressions of Amy were, or whether he wants to see her again. (He does. But we don't learn this immediately).<br />Entertaining nonetheless, and the sequel, Come Again, is also worth a look.<br />Incidentally, I notice that the US edition of this book has a completely different cover design and colour... weird!	2000-09-26

This put me off buying this book for some time, and  yet when I started to read it I was unable to put it down.<br />Emma Jensen is  a very talented writer, and her knowledge not just of the Regency period in  England, but of Scottish and Irish culture, history, language and mores, is  very impressive. I loved Isobel, and Nathan was a delight as a hero. I love  brooding, tortured men! <br />Isobel, despite being caught very much at a  disadvantage the first time she encounters the Marquess of Oriel (she's  returning the purse her father stole, with coins missing), doesn't allow  him to intimidate her. She gives him as good as she gets, and is equally  strong-willed when she meets him again the following day... and guesses the  secret he's tried so hard to hide from everyone. And because of that, he  insists that she come to work for him, and later persuades her to marry  him. He claims that it's a business arrangement, but he's wanted her since  he first grabbed hold of her in his study. She, on the other hand, quickly  comes to be very fond of him - later falls in love with him - but has no  idea of his feelings for her. (As I am Irish, and Scots Gaelic isn't too  dissimilar to Irish, I was highly amused by Isobel telling Nathan 'ta grath  agam ort' and his musings as to what particular curse this represented,  since I knew what it meant all along!)<br />The backdrop to this story - apart  from the comic secondary characters, Nathan's and Isobel's respective  families - is a plot against the lives of Nathan and his former spy  colleagues. This was a well-worked plot, only spoiled for me by the fact  that I'd recently read a Regency by another author with a similar plot and  the same ultimate 'bad guy', so I wasn't at all surprised when I discovered  who was behind the murder attempts. But that wasn't Jensen's fault: had I  read this first, she would have fooled me! (Oh, and there's a *very* nice  twist at the end.)<br />The motif Jensen uses in the book, symbolism involving  the entwined white and the red roses at Nathan's country home, works  extremely well; I had a lump in my throat when Nathan left red and white  roses awkwardly entwined on his pillow the night after they'd made  love.<br />This is another wonderful Emma Jensen book. I still prefer His  Grace Endures - an even greater angst-wallow - but love this one.	2000-09-13

With Cupid's Darts, though, I  have to say that I agree with some of the other reviewers here. Kenneth and  Aimee - and the anti-hero, Francis - held little interest for me. It was  Psyche and Harry who provided all the humour and interest, and I really  felt as if I was just skimming this book in order to allow me to get on to  Psyche's story.<br />This is disappointing, because I usually rate Harbaugh's  books much more highly. I do feel that I'll be rating the final book in the  trilogy higher, though!	2000-09-13

What really turned me off was the sheer impossibility of so much of what  Ferguson writes about. It's perfectly clear that she doesn't know very much  about the habits and customs of the Regency period.<br />Young ladies did not  go about unescorted or unchaperoned. So Emily's visits to the bookshop  could not have gone unnoticed. She would have had to have, at the very  least, a maid with her everywhere she went. More likely, there would have  been some female relative or paid chaperone living with the family; two  unmarried women would simply not live with their father without a female  companion of some type.<br />The forms of address are wrong: only Emily is  Miss Tallcot. Her sister is Miss Miriam Tallcot, or Miss Miriam. <br />Women  were not supposed to know any slang terms. So, even if Emily did know some  of the terms in popular usage, she would never have revealed that fact, far  less use such language in conversation.<br />If Emily's father had owned his  own shipping line, then he was in trade and would have been shunned by the  ton. Likewise, it's fanciful to imagine that Wentworth would have managed  the publishing company himself. It just wasn't done.<br />There is no way that  Emily could have been her sister's chaperone. Both are unmarried young  ladies; both would have been required to be chaperoned by an older matron,  some relative who was a married woman or a widow.<br />People simply did not  use each other's first names in public; even in private, it would have been  unheard of for a lady to use the first name of a gentleman who wasn't very  closely related to her. So Emily and Damon would not have called each other  by their first names, nor would any other characters.<br />Damon is unmarried,  and apparently has no female relative acting as chatelaine in his country  house. Therefore he simplycould not have held the house party as described  in the book. He could certainly invite male companions to his home, but no  women; not without a respectable hostess. <br />And, most of all, Emily and  Damon could never have been alone together in the way Ferguson writes them  as being throughout the book. Even on the very first occasion, when they'd  gone out into the garden at someone's party and were alone, once they were  discovered - as they were - it wouldn't have been treated as nothing out of  the ordinary. Emily would have been completely compromised and Wentworth  would have had to marry her or be considered beyond the pale. Yet Ferguson  has them seeking places to be alone and to kiss the whole time, as if  no-one else would notice or bat an eyelid. Emily would have been ruined,  and would either have been sent away by her father in no short order, or  Tallcot would have called Wentworth out.<br />I just couldn't get beyond these  inaccuracies, and more, to accept the story on face value.	2000-09-08

I  was a little reluctant to read Uncommon Vows because, although I have read  some books set in the middle ages (Edith Pargeter's compelling novels, for  example), it's not my favourite period.<br />Putney, again, impresses me  immensely with the quality of her research. It's impressive enough when a  British author's attention to detail and accuracy is good; it's amazing to  see an American writer, writing for a mainly US audience, who takes such  care with her research. I learned a lot about the Stephen/Matilda period I  never knew!<br />A couple of reviewers comment that Adrian ia harsh and refer  to him as a 'psycho'. Clearly they know nothing about the historical period  in question, and are judging him by contemporary males. Up until this  century, women were only valuable as the property of men. Men could do what  they liked with their wives and daughters, and women of the lower classes  were fair game. Actually, Meriel was treated amazingly well as a captive,  and even though Adrian's behaviour was sometimes harsh, he never - as  Meriel herself recognised much later - actually hurt her. His emotions were  running riot where she was concerned; he was completely unable to express  his feelings or convince her that he loved her; but he never completely  lost control.<br />I found both Adrian's mental torment and Meriel's  determination to resist seduction utterly convincing. Both had almost taken  religious orders; naturally, their faith played a very strong role in their  lives, even more than other people in a world where religion was very  important. Adrian's attempts to show Meriel how kind and considerate he  could be and how well they got on together were wonderful to read; and his  confusion and bitterness each time he discovered that she was only looking  for a chance to escape was heart-wrenching.<br />Thelead-up to Meriel's  plunge from the window was so well written. My heart ached for both of  them, and it almost stopped beating as she grabbed Adrian's dagger, he  grabbed it back and she ran for the window. And then, afterwards, as he  held her thinking she was dying, I had tears in my eyes.<br />The amnesia  element was completely credible, and - as another reviewer pointed out -  Meriel's character was essentially the same. She didn't know anything about  Adrian to make her afraid of him, so she allowed herself to recognise what  her heart had known all along: she could love him. This is just a simply  wonderful book, and I can't think why Putney hasn't written more in this  time-period. She does it so well.<br />Oh, and like another reviewer, I  wondered about Richard; I was going to check this site for a sequel, until  I noticed the book's publication date. I did suspect that Putney was going  to give us a secondary romance, given what Adrian asked Richard to do in  the end, together with what we'd been told about the widow he was to help  [see - no spoilers!]. And I also wondered about Alan, Meriel's brother, who  was portrayed as a likeable man. <br />Mary Jo Putney, if you ever read these  reviews, do think about revisiting Alan and Richard, please!	2000-09-06

A spy, disowned by his family, he  finds himself framed for a murder he did not commit and with his own life  in danger. Not knowing who he can trust, he sets out to hide himself while  he tries to investigate. Then he saves Catherine Meade's life, and is badly  injured himself...<br />He can't tell Catherine who he is, so he pretends that  his initial amnesia has continued. Although she is drawn to him, she  doesn't trust him; she knows he's lying, and she also sees him sneaking out  of the house at nights. And her own past makes her see his attempts at  flirtation as the mark of a seducer.<br />However, propinquity does have  certain effects, if either of them were able to see what is happening to  them....<br />The love story here is low-key, but warm and loving; a man and a  woman, neither of whom think they deserve to be loved, slowly begin to  realise that their perceptions are not reality. In the end, Justin gains  more than Catherine; the shadows of his past turn out to be less  distressing than he had imagined. Catherine, too, has the courage - thanks  to Justin's encouragement - to face her demons.<br />As for the threat to  Justin's life and the many assassination attempts made in the course of the  book, Barbour handled that well, keeping me guessing right up until a  couple of lines before she revealed the culprit. Very cleverly  plotted!<br />Definitely a keeper.	2000-09-05

Karen Harbaugh is quickly becoming an author who'll feature on my 'must  buy' list. This is an entertaining Regency, better than the average, in  which the nice, unassuming guy definitely doesn't come last. Annabella  actually chooses the shy, retiring and not very fashionable younger son of  an earl over a duke, even before she discovers that the duke in question is  not all he seems.<br />Parcifal is a wonderfully attractive hero, precisely  because he is *not* dashing, or fashionable, or ruggedly attractive or  popular with the ladies. He is, instead, sensible, caring and deeply in  love with Annabella - but despairs of her ever noticing him. Until one  night he goes to a masquerade ball wearing a Cavalier outfit belonging to  one of his ancestors... He ends up saving Annabella from an attack, and  surprises himself by refusing to tell her who he is, and kissing her before  running off. <br />From then on, she's consumed with a desire to find out who  her dashing Cavalier is....<br />I love stories about secret identities, and  this one is no exception. Parcifal's Cavalier is a delicious disguise, and  Annabella is suitably intrigued and enraptured, but at the same time she  finds herself oddly drawn to the quiet younger son of her neighbour.  <br />Whether or not the supernatural is at work in this book, as it is in  many of Harbaugh's other Regencies, it's a heartwarming romance which I  will certainly keep to read again.	2000-08-31

Having read another Regency romance by Karen Harbaugh, I was  half-expecting this to have a supernatural twist. It doesn't; it's a  straightforward, and very enjoyable, romance.<br />Diana's uncle and guardian  dies in what appears to be a tragic accident; suddenly, an heir no-one knew  about appears, and her uncle has left her a large inheritance provided she  marries Gavin, the new Lord Brisbane. But she doesn't know him... and the  fact that he tells her he fell in love with her the instant he saw her only  makes her doubt his sincerity.<br />The growing friendship between Gavin and  Diana is beautifully portrayed. Although she's hardly a young debutante,  she's had reasons to be nervous around men and to distrust their  intentions; Gavin is not aware of that, but does realise that she is shy,  and he adapts his behaviour accordingly. Before she knows it, she's fallen  in love with him too...<br />But then he tells her that he thinks her uncle's  death, from a crash in the curricle of the title, was no accident; and the  story becomes intriguing, with danger lurking for both Gavin and Diana.<br />A  well-written and enjoyable book!	2000-08-29

Her  characters are all well-drawn, with none of them appearing as caricatures  or one-dimensional figures.<br />Eden is a delight, and it was obvious that  Seth would fall for her; just as obvious that she would find him attractive  but barely be able to believe that he was interested in her. After all,  she'd had London seasons without success, and she was used to being  regarded as a plain spinster. <br />I also admire the way Barbour has created  a spoilt brat of a younger sister *without* making her a complete monster,  as too many other authors do. Zoe, for all her wilfulness, has a good  heart, and it's easy to see that Eden looks out for Zoe's interests because  she loves her, not to spare the family embarrassment.<br />Did any other  readers notice the very brief mention of characters from a Mary Jo Putney  book here? Seth refers in passing to Rebecca Seaton and Kenneth Wilding  when discussing painting with Eden; these were the principal characters in  Putney's River of Fire, so I was very surprised to see them mentioned  here.<br />Now to look for more Barbour books!	2000-08-29

I really enjoyed all the separate stories in this anthology, not  surprisingly since they're written by great authors including Mary Jo  Putney.

When both characters had been so determined to  maintain their business relationship regardless of their marriage, what  made her decide to go to him? The motivation simply was not established. We  had the beginnings of motivation, but given the characterisation Wilson had  established, that wasn't enough. She needed to flesh out the story more,  which would have taken more than the 100 pages in total which she  had.<br />Putney's story, as always, was well crafted and very enjoyable; it  was interesting to see a story set in the late 1800s as opposed to some  years earlier. Again, though, I felt that she ended it too abruptly;  despite her story being the longest of the three, she seemed to run out of  time.<br />Anthology editors, please make these stories longer in future!!	2000-08-29

Shattered Rainbows was perhaps Putney's most eagerly-awaited book, since it is the story of Lord Michael Kenyon, the tortured soldier and former friend of Nicholas in Thunder and Roses. Subsequent books in the series had  mentioned Michael in passing, indicating that he was either at home in  Wales, in the army fighting Bonaparte, or staying with Nicholas and Clare  recovering from injuries. <br />In this book's prologue we discover how he  survived the Peninsular war, recovering in a Spanish field hospital when he  hadn't been expected to live. We know, from Thunder and Roses, that this  was the stage in his life when he wanted to die rather than fulfil his  promise to his former mistress, Nicholas's dead first wife. Then we are in  Brussels a year later: he is back in the army since Bonaparte is again on  the march. He takes lodgings with Catherine, married to a cavalry officer;  although he is very attracted to her and it's clear that her marriage is  unhappy, he has no intention of straying beyond propriety. He acted  dishonourably once, and it led him on a path in which he betrayed his best  friend and almost killed him (Thunder and Roses), so Michael is determined  never to love unwisely again.<br />Then Catherine saves his life after  Waterloo, leaving him with a debt he knows he can never repay, and so when  the following year she comes to him asking that he masquerade as her  missing husband so that she can claim an inheritance he agrees.<br />While I  don't find the portion of the book dealing with their stay on Skoal as  gripping as the first half, overall this is a very well-written tale of  romance, betrayal, honour and the importance of life. Michael is a  compelling hero, and Catherine a courageous, determined heroine. <br />Cameo  appearances to look out for include Lucien and Michael's brother Stephen -  in a scene which will make you want to read One Perfect Rose, Stephen's own  book - and Nicholas. I was disappointed with the small role played byNicholas, however, since I had hoped this book would pick up Michael's  story where Thunder and Roses left off. The Fallen Angels series is, after  all, as much about a group of very close friends as it is a collection of  individual love stories.	2000-07-15

Stephen Kenyon, Duke of Ashburton, who was introduced to readers in Shattered Rainbows as the stiff but essentially good-hearted older  brother of Michael Kenyon, discovers that he is suffering from a fatal  illness, the symptoms of which appear - to the reader - to be consistent  with stomach cancer or severe liver damage. He has, he is told, between  three and six months to live. Unable to bear the thought of carrying on  with his normal life under those circumstances, he packs a small bag, takes  his favourite horse and rides off to be by himself until he can at least  come to terms with his fate sufficiently well to enable him to set his  affairs in order and say goodbye to his family. And by the way, contrary to  what one reviewer says, he always intended to arrange his affairs and talk  to Michael; he just needed time to accustom himself to his fate.<br />Counting  his remaining time in days, with a countdown from three months - any time  he lives beyond that he considers will be a bonus - after about a week he  falls in with a company of strolling players. He is immediately attracted  to the adopted oldest daughter of the family, Rosalind, already a widow,  and it's clear the attraction is mutual. But she doesn't know who `Mr Ashe'  really is, and nor does she know that he is dying, and Stephen not only  doesn't want her pity but since he is also escaping from himself and his  life, he wants for a short time at least to pretend that all is  normal.<br />Until one day she sees him having a bad attack, and the truth  comes out, and he makes her an offer of convenience....<br />Stephen is a  magnificent hero, proving that heroes of romantic novels don't always have  to be strong and powerful and slaying all dragons in their path. In many  ways, in fact, he becomes strongest in spirit when he is weakest in body.  Rosalind, the foundling who has no idea of her background, is a strong and  caring heroine who loves Stephen and is devastated at the thought of losing  him.<br />The story is lovingly and carefully depicted, with clearly a large  amount of research having gone into it. The characters are all  three-dimensional, entertaining as well as poignant, and it is good to see  some old friends: Rafe and Ian Kinlock, as well as Michael and Catherine.  Given the subject-matter, it would have been very easy for this book to  slip past pathos into melodrama, but Putney treads that line carefully,  providing touches of humour and of the mundane to balance the emotional  moments. As such, although there is poignancy throughout, it wasn't until  the last fifty pages that I found tears flowing. Incidentally, when reading  the book I had completely forgotten the editorial and customer reviews here  which made reference to a happy ending: I had got to the point where I  really believed Stephen would die. A real tear-jerker!<br />A fantastic,  powerful, memorable book; my only regret is that it is the last of the  Fallen Angels series, and so I will not meet any of these characters in  subsequent books.	2000-07-15

Thanks a lot, Jane Green! Okay, I'm not fat myself, but I can see that books such as this  do not help women and girls who are overweight. Crash-dieting is a health  hazard, and the kind of weight loss described by Green is highly dangerous.  But does Jemima get ill as a result? No; she gets beautiful, and suddenly  *everyone* notices her and she gets the job she craves as well as the  boyfriend she wants.<br />Sure. And pigs might fly.<br />What a message - that a  woman can only be happy and successful when she has the figure of a Jodie  Kidd!<br />Oh, and as for the 'Internet romance,' what on earth was Green  thinking? Okay, this is a novel and not reality, but even in fiction people  should be aware of the dangers in going to meet someone you've only chatted  to over the Net. And since Jemima sent a false photo, didn't she think Brad  might have as well? I confidently expected him to be some sort of weirdo,  and was amazed to find Green expected us to assume that he was a normal  guy.<br />Oh, and didn't anyone else find the narrative style profoundly  annoying? Why couldn't she make up her mind whether she wanted to write a  normal third-person narrative or a first-person narration from Jemima's  point of view? And what did she think she was doing with those irritating  second-person sections?<br />That's enough for me; I'll know to avoid Jane  Green's books in future.	2000-07-15

This book is, on first appearances, far less a part of the Fallen Angels series than any of the others, except perhaps Angel Rogue. Kenneth's claim to being a part of this series lies in his minor role in Shattered Rainbows  (a much less significant role than Robin's in Petals in the Storm).  Kenneth, in Rainbows, was an officer promoted from the ranks and a friend  of Michael's - though not a close friend. We also learned that, although he  hid it, he was the son of a viscount.<br />In River of Fire, Kenneth has  inherited the viscountcy, but with it a mountain of debts and a mortgaged  estate. His principal creditor offers him the bargain which other reviews  have explained, and out of desperation he accepts.<br />The relationship  between Kenneth and Rebecca is fiery and difficult, but it quickly turns to  passion, a passion reflected in their paintings. I have to admit that I  found their rationale for not wanting marriage to each other, first raised  fairly early in the book, a little far-fetched: while Kenneth was certainly  deceiving Rebecca, he was already confident that Sir Anthony was not what  his brother suspected, and so it wouldn't have been too difficult to tell  at least part of the truth and make it clear that a betrothal wasn't  anathema to him.<br />There are cameo appearances aplenty by other characters  in the Fallen Angels series, which was good to see; Rafe in particular  plays a highly typical and very funny role, and Michael and Lucien use  their talents to good effect.<br />Incidentally, the book summary displayed  above is incorrect. Kenneth was never a spy; he was a reconnaisance  officer, which is not the same thing. The 'master spies' in this series  were Lucien, Robin and Margot.	2000-07-14

He's survived the Peninsula war by the skin of his teeth, and now he's back in the thick of things at Waterloo - though unlike his previous wartime experience, he's not reckless as to his own survival.<br />Catherine is a beautiful woman and  dedicated nurse, married to a man who is obviously unfaithful to her; and  yet she stays with him and doesn't herself have affairs. She and Michael  are drawn to each other, but nothing is ever spoken by either. Michael, who  made a grave error some years before in falling for the wife of his best  friend, is determined to avoid all temptation. <br />A year after Waterloo,  Catherine needs a favour, and who can she ask but the man whose life she  saved immediately after Waterloo... Lord Michael Kenyon. Thus the two of  them travel to Skoal, with Michael pretending to be Catherine's  husband.<br />The sexual tension between Michael and Catherine is very, very  well done, and Michael's memory of loving unwisely in the past (and his  betrayal of Nicholas in the process) certainly justifies his behaviour in  the book. I also enjoyed the minor role played by his older brother,  Stephen, and am looking forward to One Perfect Rose as a result.	2000-07-14
2381913:US	52631742	R3P0EFF1DYBSS0	0451405986	354284501	Angel Rogue: Revised Edition (Fallen Angels Novels)	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Passion and excitement in the classic Putney style	This was the one book in the Fallen Angels series I hadn't expected to  like, but I got a very pleasant surprise: I loved this book! My hesitance  about it was partly because Robin, the hero, is not one of the four  original Fallen Angels, and also because I was a little resentful at  Robin's occupying so much space in Petals in the Storm, Rafe's story.<br />At  the start of the book, Robin is still the complete enigma he was in Petals,  and it's no surprise that his brother can't seem to find a way to break  through his reserve. It's clear that Robin hasn't yet come to terms with  the loss of Maggie (who married Rafe in Petals), and that he has too many  bleak memories from his years spent spying.<br />Then Maxie stumbles on him -  literally - and he sees an opportunity to be someone else for a time, and  to have an adventure in which he is answerable to nobody except himself and  Maxie. <br />Maxie is a wonderfully different heroine: part easygoing  American, a very small part British young lady, and with the instincts of  her Mohawk ancestors - and to the reviewer who couldn't understand how  Maxie knew so much of her Indian heritage and culture, *read the book*! It  was very clearly explained that she, and her father, had spent much time  with her mother's tribe, even after her mother died.<br />Maxie's empathy with  the ghosts of Robin's past was beautifully portrayed: as ever, Putney does  angst and hurt-comfort extremely well, and this book comes close to Thunder  and Roses in this respect. Both books have as a major theme the way in  which love can heal the wounds and torment of the past. The symmetry in  this respect was also highly enjoyable: as Maxie helps to heal Robin's  spirit, so he does the same for her.<br />Oh, and the secondary romance in  this book was also a delight! I loved Desdemona, Maxie's aunt - the instant  she appeared I thought she was a wonderful character, and I was so glad  that Putney made use of her. Giles, Robin's brother, was alsoa very  sympathetic character.<br />To the reviewer who complained about grammar and  syntax... how petty. I have read far worse than the few examples of which  she complains, and in fact at least one of her examples contains no error  or confusion at all. <br />This is yet another excellent book from Mary Jo  Putney, a worthy addition to the Fallen Angels series and a book I know  I'll be re-reading.	2000-07-08

Putney has created  another wonderfully complex character in the apparently indolent rakish  aristocrat who is really a man of superb intelligence and courage.<br />Kit,  too, is an intriguing and daring heroine, a worthy mate for 'Lucifer.' Her  early encounters with Lucien are fascinating and leave the reader wanting  to know more about her, never mind what Lucien wants! Attraction flares  between them from a very early stage, despite the fact that each is  suspicious of the other; one touch I love is the early scene where Kit,  while distrusting Lucien, actually saves his life. <br />As usual with  Putney's Fallen Angels series, other Angels play minor roles: Rafe appears  briefly at the start - and incidentally, though this book follows Petals in  the Storm, it is set chronologically before it - and Michael is briefly  involved near the end, thus making readers all the more impatient for  Michael's own story. New characters are also likeable and intriguing: Kit's  cousin Jason Travers, for instance.<br />And as usual, Putney's research is  impeccable. The Hellfire Club was a well-known gentlemen's organisation in  the late eighteenth century, infamous for its fondness for alcohol, women  and devil-worship. The Hellions in this story are certainly a credible  'spin-off' from the original Hellfire Club. <br />Now for Angel Rogue....	2000-07-06

This is Rafe's story, and it is a book I've been waiting to read ever since I read  The Bargain (the end of The Bargain is reprised from Rafe's point of view  at the beginning of this book). In The Bargain, Rafe was presented as a  cynical rake with shadows in his past, and I was really looking forward to  learning more about him, particularly after meeting him again in Thunder  and Roses.<br />I was a little disappointed in this book, however. Rafe shares  the limelight here with Robin, the hero of Angel Rogue, and as such we  don't learn as much about him as we would like. Minor characters also  occupy far more of a centre-stage role in this book than in other Putney  novels, to the point of having entire scenes written from their point of  view, for example. <br />Maggie, or Margot, is a fascinating heroine, and I  enjoyed her relationship with both Robin and Rafe - and yes, she did choose  the right man! <br />But I had wanted so much to get to know Rafe properly,  and - particularly after reading Thunder and Roses, which is just *so* good  - I found this book ultimately a bit unsatisfying. I will no doubt read it  again, but by no means as often as I'd re-read Thunder and Roses and The  Rake.	2000-07-06

I'm still trying to catch my breath	I didn't think Mary Jo Putney could top The Rake for a compelling, erotic, angsty and breathtaking story of betrayal, love and trust. But she's done it with this book. <br />So far, this is the fourth Putney book I've read and  she's yet to get less than five stars. This one, however, would get ten if  they were available. The book is full of tension, anguish, emotional  moments to bring a lump to the reader's throat, moments when there is no  option but to gasp in admiration at Putney's skill. I actually felt a sense  of loss when I reached the final page: I wanted this book never to end. And  I couldn't resist going back and re-reading some of my favourite passages  there and then.<br />Nicholas is a deeply cynical, embittered man in his  thirties, who has no intention of taking an interest in anything beyond  casual affairs and other such pleasures. But Clare has other ideas for him:  she demands that he do something to prevent the inhabitants of the local  village from either starving or getting killed because of the appalling  working conditions in the local coalmine. Nicholas just wants her to leave  him alone, so he suggests a bargain he's sure she'll refuse: her reputation  in return for his assistance. But she accepts him, along with his condition  that he is allowed one kiss per day and that he will make every attempt to  seduce her.<br />He keeps his word, in every respect, and soon Clare learns  that while the Gypsy Earl takes his responsibilities very seriously, he  also takes seduction extremely seriously. She's soon wondering just how  long she can resist his advances and her own attraction to him....<br />In  this book we also meet the other three Fallen Angels: Rafe (who has already  appeared in the - chronologically - earlier The Bargain), Lucian and  Michael. Michael in particular plays a significant cameo role in this  story, which has left me eager to read his own story. Putney has created  some delightfully complex and intriguing heroes here, and I'm looking  forward to exploring them in greater detail.<br />Putney, in addition, has  clearly put a lot of time and effort into research: she is head and  shoulders above most US Regency writers in this respect. If it wasn't for  the use of US spelling conventions, I would never know I was reading an  American writer. The detail in respect of Methodism, the coalmining  industry, the Napoleonic wars, societal conventions in the early nineteenth  centuty and so on is both accurate and interesting.	2000-07-01

Although I've enjoyed other books by Jensen, this - to me -is her best so far. She's created an intriguing, complex and very entertaining heroine in Ailis, and a very attractive,  desirable hero in Lord Clane. I was so sorry when this book came to an end:  I could have read something twice as long!<br />Ailis, the daughter of a  respectable Irish family (respectable for Ireland, that is, not England!),  despises Christopher Francis Rhys, the Earl of Clane, because of everything  she thinks he stands for. His title may be Irish, but he sits in the  British House of Lords; he is a decorated British war hero and a notable  member of the English Ton. But he very quickly informs her that he is as  Irish as she is - &quot;Naomh in Erin me!&quot; - and Christor, the Irish  version of his name which he uses in preference to Christopher, turns out  to be as proud of his Irish heritage as she is of hers.<br />Ailis soon begins  to develop a sneaking liking for Clane, but her dreams are focused on the  Robin Hood-like figure of 'An Cu,' The Hound, the masked man who robs the  gentry to give money to the poverty-stricken Irish peasants. But what she  doesn't know is that Christor *is* An Cu.<br />This is an engaging, witty and  heartwarming romance which I know I'll love to read over and over. What's  more, Jensen has really done her research well. Having an Irish husband  must help, I'm sure, but the thread of Irish history, society and politics  running through is book is very accurate and convincing. Being Irish  myself, I was prepared to be critical, but all the details are exactly as  I'd hope for; even Jensen's use of the Irish language is accurate and also  very well done. She doesn't break the flow of the narrative by translating  immediately, but the meaning of the Irish phrase used is always supplied  within the next line or two.<br />I really loved this book, and I hope Jensen  carries on with her practice of referring to one book's lead characters as  minor characters in later books. In this book, for example, Lucas Gower  (star of His Grace Endures) has a cameo role because of his letters to  Christor. <br />Waiting for Jensen's next book....	2000-06-28

And I'm rarely disappointed.<br />While I'm still  hoping that some day she'll return to her 'Seven Corinthians' series and  finish it, this book was a great read in the meantime. She has created two  very interesting characters in Fanny and Derek: both damaged by their  pasts, and both afraid, or too proud, to tell each other the truth about  themselves. Thus Fanny allows Derek to think her too proud and snobbish,  when in reality that isn't the case.<br />The secondary characters and  villains in this book are all very well portrayed, with not a caricature  among them; there's a sweet and humorous subsidiary romance, and a nasty,  but not over-drawn, main villain who is very threatening. <br />Good, very  good... now waiting for Lady Jane's Nemesis!	2000-06-22

We meet Joanna Sherwood almost a year after the death of Gary, the Earl of Crewe,  the childhood friend who married her after Adrian, the Duke of Roxbury,  divorced her for alleged adultery. We are told that Joanna's eldest son  looks very like Adrian, so much so that Gary used to refer to him as  'Duke's Double.' It is seeing Justin which first makes Adrian wonder  whether it's possible that he misjudged Joanna.<br />It's obvious early on  that both Adrian and Joanna still love each other, though both feel they  have much to blame the other for. The author carries off this sense of  betrayal extremely well, allowing us glimpses into both protagonists'  feelings and thought processes along the way.<br />One thing I found a little  odd was Adrian's persistence, when talking to Joanna, in believing that she  was unfaithful, when we know that from early on in the book he was  reassessing his earlier belief in that regard; but on the other hand, it's  possible that he actually wanted her to tell him herself that she wasn't  unfaithful.<br />That aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.	2000-05-29

Like these, it is another 'rites of passage' novel involving friends from different social backgrounds who grow up together in  a small Irish town in the 1950s, going on to university together in Dublin  in the sixties. There are several friends, mainly Benny, Eve and later Nan  Malone... and there is Jack; charming, handsome Jack, who runs after all  three girls, including chubby and not-so-beautiful Benny.<br />The film  version tried to turn this into a Hollywood hearts-and-flowers soppy  ending, but actually Binchy's ending here is more credible in the  circumstances. Binchy does not always feel the need to go for the happy  endings, the tidy resolutions which authors of other romance novels or  rites-of-passage stories like to give us, as was shown in Echoes and Tara  Road, for example. Here, the ending Binchy gives us is about the only one  possible if the integrity of the characters is to be  preserved.<br />Beautiful, slow-paced, characters you feel you are relly  getting to know and can identify with, this book is a delight.	2000-05-27

I adored 'Mrs Drew Plays Her Hand' and 'Reforming Lord Ragsdale.' This book is quite  different even from those.<br />Susan is the daughter of a gentleman, but her  father is a gambler and has fallen on hard times. After he lost her family  home, Susan was forced to go to live with an aunt, who turned her into an  unpaid servant. So, she decides, she might as well get paid for such work,  and applies for a job as a lady's companion.<br />At the home of her employer,  Susan meets, not a handsome son who instantly falls in love with her (as  more traditional Regencies would have), but her employer's bailiff. A  completely unsuitable match for a lady - but why should it be considered  unsuitable?<br />This is why I say this book is more reminiscent of Catherine  Cookson's nineteenth-century novels, where these kind of cross-class  romances are more commonly found. Kelly provides her usual natural style  and occasionally earthy touch to the romance (and I don't just mean in  terms of sex scenes; her characters are always well-rounded and she spares  no maidenly modesty).<br />I still prefer her earlier books, but if you're a  Carla Kelly fan this one is worth a try.	2000-05-27

The characters are not even consistent with the original - why, for instance, when Scarlett loves  Tara so much, would she leave it? I cringed most of the way through this,  especially for Rhett during some of the 'love' scenes - the Rhett Butler of  GWTW would never have humiliated himself like that.<br />But the most  cringeworthy part for me was the section set in Ireland. How much Irish  history does Ripley know? Has she ever visited Ireland, or is her  impression simply based on the awful Hollywood films of the forties and  thereabouts, themselves based on appallingly inaccurate stereotypes? This  section was unbelievably bad; and as for the resolution at the end, it was  so incredible - and out of character again for Rhett - that I wanted to be  sick.<br />Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.

She is used to doing what she wants, and getting away with it. Now, though, her father has had enough, and he has sent her to stay at the  home of a family friend, a man she detests because he has always regarded  her with disdain, dismissed her as lacking any sense of propriety.<br />Yet  she must spend the summer being chaperoned by his mother, and he must learn  to tolerate her. Although at first Marissa almost delights in allowing  Tristan to carry on thinking the worst, and her pride won't allow her to  disabuse him, they gradually become friends despite his disapproval and her  dislike. Some of the scenes in Tristan's study are simply  wonderful.<br />Misunderstandings continue, mainly because Tristan is  reluctant to believe the evidence of his own eyes despite getting to know  Marissa better, and because Marissa's pride won't allow her to admit the  truth. It doesn't help, of course, that Marissa also believes Tristan to be  short of money and suspects that he may be prepared to put aside his  contempt and marry her for her money - she reaches that conclusion early in  the book and, like Tristan, holds onto it.<br />This was the first Emma Lange  book I read, and it made me want to find more by this writer. As with the  other I've read more recently, it started slowly, but then engrossed me as  I got further into it. An entertaining book with some beautiful moments and  a very satisfactory finish.	2000-05-27

If, on the other hand, you admire Maeve Binchy's ability to tell you all about a character's life, personality, interests and dreams in a few pages,  then this is the book for you. The Lilac Bus is a series of 'postcards' or  brief character sketches of a number of different people, all of whom  travel home from Dublin each Friday evening on the same bus. Each has their  own preoccupations and concerns, and Binchy manages to give us some  fascinating insights into not only the individuals here, but into the tight  little society to where they're travelling, with its own mores and habits.	2000-05-27

She makes a very good job of the  transition: there is a real contemporary feel to this book. I grew up in  Dublin in the period in question: I know!<br />The characters, like other  Binchy novels, are very well developed. Binchy has a real sense of  'friendship' as well as love and life after the supposedly happy-ever-after  of the wedding. Ria's marriage to Danny, their purchase of the dream house  and their life together is brilliantly portrayed.<br />Then Danny announces  he's leaving Ria, and her life falls apart....<br />This introduces the  house-swap part of the plot, and this is the real novelty for Binchy. Ria  changes places with Marilyn for the summer, which leads to both women  coming to a greater understanding of herself, and of the factors which led  the other's life to fall apart. Some of these passages are excellent.<br />I  notice some reviewers here complain when Binchy fails to get US dialogue  correct; fair enough. I wonder why some of these same reviewers think it's  not important when US writers make similar mistakes - and sometimes much  worse ones - with British or Irish vocabulary? But this is an aside.<br />I  did feel that there was an unfinished feel to the book. Although Binchy by  no means always goes for the happy ending typical of so many lightweight  romances, she does at least tend to tie up her loose ends. This, for me, is  why the book gets four stars instead of five: I needed another fifty pages  or so to finish off the story properly.<br />I'm now looking forward to  Binchy's next book, which, sadly, she's already announced will be her last.	2000-05-27

Anne de Monteforte, widowed with two children and cast off by her husband's father, knows the world thinks her a lightskirt - if not now, then certainly before she married Peter. Her oldest child, Nell, is  certainly not the product of that marriage. And that is precisely what  Trevelyan de Monteforte, her husband's cousin, believes, and tells her so  when he first meets her. He also tells her that since her son is now his  paternal grandfather's heir, he must be taken from her to live with the  same cold man who disowned Peter for marrying Anne.<br />But Buckingham takes  the family to live on his own estates for a while first - so that Anne can  see what Alex would be missing out on if she refused to hand him over to  his grandfather. What Buckingham doesn't tell her, but she realises soon  enough, is that he also intends to seduce her, knowing that this will  disgrace her further.<br />But as with many of the best-laid plans, things do  not run as smoothly as either of them expect, and both find themselves  realising that the other is not at all as they expected.<br />This book seemed  to get started slowly: for the first three or four chapters I really wasn't  sure whether I liked it or not. But once all the main characters were at  Sisley and we began to learn more about both Buckingham (I hate the  abbreviation 'Trev' which Lange gives him!) and Anne, I was engrossed.  There is humour, pathos, sensuality and, at one point, sheer anguish. But  the ending is richly satisfying in a low-key but very pleasing way, so I'm  really not sure what the first reviewer felt was wrong with it and why she  gave the book only one star as a result.<br />There's lots of character  introspection, which I love - and as such, yes, the style is similar to  Mary Balogh. The only irritation about Lange's style here is her occasional  habit of switching point of view mid-passage for just a couple of  sentences; it's often easy to miss, and not to realise that the reactions  or emotions she is describing are not that of Anne or Buckingham, the main  subject of the passage, but of some minor character allowed to take centre  stage for a brief moment.<br />This book's one to keep and re-read.	2000-05-27

Mary is twenty-nine, conditioned by her late father to believe herself plain and unmarriageable; Jack is nine years  older, a Marquess and rake who has been hurt in the past by a faithless  woman, and who is now looking for a rich wife to save his estates from  ruin.<br />They meet at a ball and quickly become friends: Mary offers to help  him find a wife who will not bore him or lose her looks as she grows older.  But friends grow closer... and then Jack discovers that Mary herself is  very rich.<br />Candice Hern tells this story beautifully, little by little  revealing the details of both characters' past and demonstrating why each  finds it so hard to trust - and why, once trust appears to have been  broken, it can be so hard to forgive. <br />There are some excellent  supporting characters in this book, including Mary's companion Olivia,  Jack's uncle Edward and Jack's mother. It's definitely a book to savour and  read again and again.	2000-05-27

It's about a group of friends growing up together in a small seaside town in 1950s Ireland. As they get older  they discover there are differences of status between their families, and  Claire and David, who are beginning to fall in love as teenagers, discover  his family is not receptive to their relationship.<br />The story moves on,  through their college years and beyond, and along the way Binchy shows the  passage of time by subtly blending social and political changes in with the  characters' lives. Binchy has fantastic story-telling skills, and these are  best exhibited in her earlier books, such as this and Light a Penny Candle;  I did find some of her later books a little disappointing.	2000-05-27

One day the young Kit's unhappy mother disappears, leaving a note which Kit destroys, not  wanting to upset her father. Everyone assumes that she drowned in the lake,  and life for Kit and the others goes on, but not without heartache as she  grows up.<br />I was really engrossed in this book as it developed, looking  forward to finding out the solutions to the various mysteries Binchy had  set up. But as I got closer and closer to the end, with seemingly no real  resolution to some of the issues, I found myself wondering how Binchy was  going to tie up the book.<br />Then, in the last thirty pages, she rushed  through several very major plot developments, reintroduced some characters  and dealt with some serious emotional issues... in a very rushed and  unsatisfactory manner. The pace had been leisurely throughout the rest of  the book, and as such this really looked to me as if Binchy had suddenly  realised that she was over her word limit and needed to tie up all the  loose ends as briefly as possible. It didn't work, and really spoilt for me  what could have been a wonderful book.	2000-05-27

I'm not a fan of the supernatural in romance novels, and might not have bought this book had I been aware of that element of the plot. But I have to admit that Harbaugh did an excellent job in using Teufel, the devil, as  the catalyst for her plot.<br />Richard Clairmond is at the end of his tether.  Having just returned from war, he is near-penniless; then he pratically  mortgages his estates when he loses at table to Lord Wyvern. He is  desperate, thinking about what financial ruin would mean to his sister;  then Teufel appears, offering him a bargain he cannot refuse. His gambling  debts will be forgiven if he seduces and abandons Eveline Seton, a  merchant's daughter. What could be simpler?<br />Except that Richard finds he  has a conscience after all, and cannot abandon Eveline - despite the fact  that this then gets him in even deeper with Teufel. He becomes increasingly  desperate, and in such circumstances what hope is there for Eveline?<br />And  yet Eveline cannot abandon him any more than he could her, and she is  stronger than he thinks. <br />This is a captivating book, with some  unexpected twists and turns along the way. There is also a secondary  romance - completely unexpected to Richard but blindingly obvious to anyone  else, and which apart from anything else provides one reason why Richard  need never have dealt with Teufel in the first place.<br />Very readable, and  a keeper.	2000-05-27

I certainly enjoyed it very much and will keep it to read again. However, it does suffer from a lot of credibility issues,  and had the book not been so well written I would have been seriously  jolted out of the story and would have stopped reading.<br />The review below  makes all the points I wanted to make about this book, and more. It is just  not credible, in the circumstances, that Jared and Charles could possibly  have thought Hannah was a common prostitute from the stews of London; there  was far too much evidence to the contrary, and in any case no woman from  that background could have learned to behave as an aristocrat in a couple  of days.<br />There were later issues which were just glossed over, such as  the aftermath of Hannah's real background being discovered; and the  elopement seemed a little too incredible for words.<br />Having said all that,  this book does have the advantage of being well written, in an entertaining  style, and it contains some wonderfully romantic and erotic scenes which I  enjoy re-reading.	2000-05-25

Neither of them - they are by now both widowed -  is at all keen on renewing contact with the other, but find they have to  join forces to prevent their offspring making a disastrous match.<br />Thus,  two former lovers and now bitter enemies are forced to spend several days  in close confinement with each other. Although they at first try hard to  maintain a facade of cool civility, as time goes on and frustrations  increase they find it harder to stay away from the events of the past.  <br />What I liked about this book was the way we slowly got to know the main  characters; the way in which Morland, who at first seemed a cold, bitter  autocrat, is revealed to be a genuinely caring man who still loves Harriet.  The resolution, by the time we catch up with the young runaway couple, is  no surprise; but then, that's not the point of this book. It is a gentle  study in relationships, misunderstandings and a mature couple who are given  a second chance to make their relationship work.	2000-05-25

Unfortunately, this book seems to mark the downward  slope of Nadine Miller's work - I've rated her subsequent books at one  star.<br />The problem is not so much the lead characters: these were  interesting enough to keep me reading. But some of her secondary characters  are too incredible for words, and - as in later books - there are plot  twists which left me shaking my head in disbelief. There is the hero's  other suitor, who seems at the beginning to be a decent enough person, if  over-persistent; near the end of the book he turns out to be a  near-villain! And the scene in the Viscount's grandfather's house at the  end is too farcical for words. Absolutely incredible.	2000-05-25

Lane writes villains with no  redeeming features whatsoever - which is somewhat unrealistic - and with,  in some cases, no credible motivation at all for their villainy.<br />In this  case, Catherine is left alone when her brother is killed; her brother's  best friend, who she'd expected would at least check that she was all  right, completely ignored her. Her brother's heir (the eponymous uncle)  arrives at the family estate and, telling Catherine that there is no money  left for her dowry, turns her into an unpaid servant for the family. Of  course, as we quickly discover, her unredeemably wicked uncle and his wife  have been destroying letters, have told the brother's friend (Damon, Lord  Devlin) that Catherine was engaged to be married, and have usurped all her  money.<br />Not too incredible so far, I suppose, and this is after all a  fairly common - even cliched - plot-line in some historical romances. But  Lane builds upon this with embezzlement, murder attempts, misunderstanding  upon misunderstanding and just about every cliched plot twist imaginable.  By the time the book ended I was almost confidently expecting yet another  kidnap or something.<br />Having now read three Regency romances by Lane, and  having made the same criticisms of her secondary characters and cliched  plot devices in each, I have now come to the conclusion that she should  really be writing Gothic novels. At least in this genre caricatured  villains are expected, and the more cliched the better.	2000-05-20

Enoch gives us some intriguing insights into both Lucien and Alexandra's thought  processes as this romance plays out. There are some very amusing scenes,  and much of the dialogue between Lucien and Alexandra is highly witty. Lots  of good sexual tension early on, too!<br />But - and I know I'm going to get  lots of 'not helpful' votes for this - Enoch hasn't done her period  research properly, and that partly spoils the book for me. I prefer my  Regencies not to have inaccuracies which jump out at me, wrenching me from  the story. For instance, once Lucien gives Alexandra the job (at some time  after 12 noon), he lends her his carriage to collect her belongings, and  says he will see her at dinner that evening. She then goes to Derbyshire  and back... in an afternoon!  Even now, with a fast car and if relatively  little traffic could be guaranteed, it would take three to four hours to  get from central London to Derbyshire, one way only. The later journeys to  Hertforshire and back sounded similarly fantastical. <br />Some of the 'feel'  of the period was wrong to me; although I enjoyed the explanation of  delaying tactics for young ladies stuck for dinner table conversation,  otherwise the Society scenes just didn't seem to have the accuracy of a  Balogh or an Oliver.<br />I found Fiona, Rose's mother, to be completely  beyond all credulity, and her marital ambitions for Rose, revealed later in  the book, made no sense whatsoever given her characterisation and behaviour  earlier. The character was a caricature, and spoilt the book for me. <br />I  also thought Alexandra was far too ready to give Lucien what he wanted -  more than once - and without either regretting her behaviour or worrying  about the consequences. For a well-born young woman of that period, this is  unbelievable. He was the one who brought up the possible consequences, and  it was an element of the story Enoch left hanging. In fact, the story was  unfinished in more ways than one: she built up some big mystery about  Lucien's cousin James, about whom he felt some sort of guilt, and about  whom Alexandra tried to get him to talk on several occasions. Yet we were  never told what that was all about. (If she's planning on explaining it in  a sequel, she could have said so! There is no explanation anywhere about  the 'With This Ring' series).<br />Finally, though with some suspension of  disbelief I was able to enjoy Lucien's method of stopping Alexandra  leaving, but there was always a voice in the back of my mind saying 'this  is *ridiculous*!'	2000-05-19

Clever plotting, great characters	I read this book in one sitting on a train journey, and couldn't put it down. It was utterly captivating, and I love the characters of Alex and Darcy.<br />The way in which Alex and Darcy meet - the teenage Darcy has to  correspond with an American academic because her school has asked her to  take part in the US university's reseach project - is ingenious, and the  letters between the dry and dusty researcher and the teenager are  hilarious. Prone makes much fun out of Darcy piercing the pomposity of this  guy she knows only by initials.<br />As Darcy grows up, she sees Alex much  more as a friend, but because of the rules of the research they must never  meet or exchange any identifying information. This is both fascinating and  intriguing as an examination of what makes friendships, and whether it is  possible to have as a close friend someone you have never met.<br />The other  characters and events in Darcy's life are also very well portrayed, as a  study in growing up; Prone makes excellent use of her knowledge both of the  US and of Ireland.<br />The denouement is sheer brilliance. My only regret is  that I felt the book finished too soon.	2000-05-19

But this is actually the first book of hers I read, and on the strength of that I went  out and bought several others.<br />THIS is a great book - and I still want to  know what's happened to Miller since she wrote it! <br />Jared, the Duke, has  decided that it's time to marry, and so he's asked his elderly female  relations to gather together several possible brides for him (shades of  Emma Jensen's Best Laid Plans here). One of the possibles has brought with  her a cousin/companion, Emily - a slightly overweight, plain little mouse  of a woman, and certainly not someone who would be thought to attract a  Duke; only she doesn't meet the Duke. She meets someone who calls himself  Jared, and who seems to be an ordinary local farmer - but who, judging by  his strong resemblance to the Duke, must be a half-brother. Emily has  absolutely no doubt that he is not the Duke, however - he couldn't be. He's  charming and rogueish and fun to be with, while the Duke is top-lofty and  disapproving.<br />An entertaining and occasionally heart-wrenching story  follows, in which the Duke gets himself more and more deeply entangled in a  mess entirely of his own making.<br />There are also some great secondary  characters here, including Jared's heir and his secretary, Edgar Rankin - I  would have liked a book with Edgar as the hero, since there was clearly a  story here, strongly hinted at in conversations between Jared and Edgar.  Those two had a 'past,' and I wanted to know more. <br />Highly recommended,  even if I can't recommend any of Miller's subsequent books!	2000-05-14

What stops it getting 5 stars is that there were some elements which  I found a little beyond credulity, and since I'm no great fan of the  supernatural, the crying child in Lucy's dreams - which is what brings her  to the Isle of Man - didn't really appeal to me.<br />This story features, for  the first time in my experience of Regency romances, an older woman as  heroine: Lucy is 31 to Roddy's 25. This, of course, makes her even less  inclined to see him as a potential suitor. I thought Butler didn't make  enough of this and Lucy's own circumstances in this respect, though: she  seemed very quick to discount the possibility that Roddy might just intend  to make her his mistress. Despite his continual flirting with her - and he  really did seem to be an inveterate flirt - from quite early on in the book  she's convinced his intentions are honourable.<br />As other reviewers have  noted, the supporting characters are an entertaining bunch, and Butler  makes the most of them. I would have liked to learn more about Roddy's  friends sooner; while Butler did tell us more about them, it wasn't until  some way into the book. Intriguingly, one character mentions his 'Uncle  Arkady;' I'm curious to know whether this is the Arkady from Lord  Monteith's Gift, and if so, whether Butler has or intends to write Arkady's  story.<br />An entertaining read, even if not up to the standards of Oliver or  Putney.	2000-05-14

I think this is the best of Nancy Butler's books so far, although I've enjoyed some of the others. She seems to focus on heroines who are considerably below her heroes in social standing - though not impossibly so  - and who have fallen on hard times; this is certainly the case with  Eveline here.<br />Robbie - or the Earl of Monteith - is a wonderful hero.  Outwardly dour and conscious of his image, he has a loving heart just  wanting to escape. Eveline, struggling to support her younger siblings, is  a courageous young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to get a  job. They are thrown together in unusual circumstances... and fall in  love.<br />Many of the scenes between Eveline and Robbie, especially after  she's saved his life, are marvellously entertaining while at the same time  touching the heart; you won't easily forget these. However, I did - like  another reviewer - find Robbie's complete volte-face later hard to take.  Despite the circumstances, it was just difficult to accept that he would  change so completely.<br />Despite that, I still love this book and have  already re-read it.	2000-05-14

Heyer writes a hero and heroine who are both strong-willed and impatient, and who have been indulged for most of their lives. As such, it's only natural that they should behave like an  irresistable force meeting an immovable object.<br />Serena and Rotherham had  once been engaged to be married, but she called off the engagement within a  month of the wedding. Since then, they'd barely been able to meet without  arguing. But then her father died and left Rotherham trustee of all her  income, and with the power to veto any potential husband. Thus the scene is  set for yet more sparks....<br />Rotherham and Serena are a wonderful couple:  even from the time we first meet them it's obvious they were meant for each  other. It's there in the way they can't keep their eyes off each other, the  way she's bored when he's not around, the way they can't stop interfering  in each other's affairs. Yes, they are both rude - to each other, and  occasionally to others - but that's true to the period, at least in  Rotherham's case. I can't see how the other reviewer could have missed the  attraction between them.<br />The dialogue is fast-paced and sparkling, with  great fights and some wonderful making-up scenes. In all, it's another  immensely readable Heyer, although I would have liked to know more about  the circumstances surrounding the original engagement. Still - can't have  it all!	2000-05-06

But Harriet is not quite  what Guy was expecting....<br />Harriet is a delightful heroine who is  determined to make the best of her new home and new husband, even though  Guy doesn't want to be made the best of! Oliver also makes good use of an  entertaining cast of supporting characters, including Guy's brother (who  really deserved his own book) and his mistress, who turns out to have an  interesting connection to Harriet!<br />Mentioned in passing are characters  from some of Oliver's other books, although this is less obviously part of  the Seven Corinthians series than the others in that series.	2000-05-06

Georgiana wants to marry her chosen man - of whom her parents disapprove, so naturally she decides to pretend to have fallen in love with the disreputable Earl of Dunraven. Not too incredible so far, when we bear in mind that Georgiana is barely out of the  schoolroom and therefore pretty silly and naive. But Summerville expects us  to believe that someone of Dunraven's age and standing would go along with  it?<br />The remainder of the book contains cliched plot device after cliched  plot device, and the most unbelievable element of the entire book is the  romance between Georgiana and Dunraven. What someone like him could see in  a spoilt, silly child I have absolutely no idea. <br />Basically, read  something else.	2000-05-02

However, I just can't concur with the otherreviewers' opinions of it. The 'setup' elements of it just seemed utterly ridiculous. The contemporary heroine feeling compelled to bid for the Lordship of the Manor (which is *not* the same as an aristocratic title, and would have nothing to do with the queen or Buckingham Palace, so that element of the story is just incredible).<br />When Candace/Emily ends up back in the eighteenth century, the story gets even less credible. The hero spending hours alone in her bedchamber, despite being engaged to someone else and Emily being an unmarried woman? No way. And when she tells him her secret, that she's from the twentieth century, I find it unbelievable that he doesn't have her sent to Bedlam. But no; he believes her, and spends hours late at night talking to her about politics, world affairs, literature and all sorts of things which, let's remember, women were supposed to have very few opinions on then. <br />So yes; I find many aspects of the plot aside from the time-travel bit unconvincing. But besides this, the 'other woman' is too unremittingly evil to be true, as well. Lane needs to take some lessons from writers such as Balogh and Putney in writing villains; very few of them are evil through and through, and Lane's characterisation here was just unbelievable.<br />Not recommended.	2000-05-01

The title (Lois and Clark); the picture of Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher on the cover; the cover description of the book as a  'sparkling romantic adventure'; all these persuaded me that it was worth  buying. <br />Instead, basically it acted as a cure for insomnia while I was  staying in a not-very-comfortable hotel.<br />It is *not* about Lois and  Clark. It's about Superman, and to a degree about Lois; Clark is barely  mentioned. It is certainly not a 'romantic adventure' - where's the romance  when the two lead characters are separated for the entire book and don't  even speak to each other? Superman disappears to assist with a natural  disaster in Russia, without letting Lois know where he is. Somehow, no news  or wire service manages to pick up his presence in that region, which is  somewhat incredible anyway, so Lois can't find out through that means. Yet  she has other things on her mind - including visiting Lex Luthor in prison.  Why! <br />I will concede that there were parts of the book which were  mildly interesting, but I haven't re-read it since and can't see myself  wanting to do so while there's so much better available on the Internet.  For anyone looking for romantic Lois *and* Clark adventure fiction, just  check out the fanfiction archive instead! You'll save yourself a lot of  money and get far better stories to read at the same time.	2000-05-01

I read this book a few months after it was published, and found it very hard to put down. Never mind working out who all the characters were supposed to be (although with some there wasn't much difficulty!), it was a  fascinating insight into the murky world of political campaigning, of the  reality that there are no perfect people out there - and if there were,  they probably wouldn't want to be president.<br />It was a novel approach to  take the perspective of an idealistic campaigning lawyer drafted in to help  with the Stanton bid; someone steeped in the political process and 'how  to,' but who had rarely been exposed to the murkier sets of compromises and  deals which candidates and their teams engage in. <br />I loved it, and now  I'm waiting for Klein's sequel, The Running Mate, to arrive in paperback.	2000-05-01

However, like another Lane book I've read, it suffers from poor characterisation. While the heroine, Elizabeth, and Symington himself are  well drawn, the rest of the cast seem like mere caricatures, especially  Elizabeth's father, Fosdyke. I cannot understand why Symington maintained  his masquerade when faced with such an appallingly il-mannered host.  Cecilia is similarly unbelievable with her repulsive and incredible  attempts to force Symington's friend (pretending to be Symington, remember)  into marriage.<br />The mistaken identities do get resolved in the end...  somehow... and yet I can't even remember how, now! (not that I'd give it  away for anyone who hasn't read the book). <br />I can't recommend this; it  pales in comparison with anything from Mary Balogh, Mary Jo Putney,  Patricia Oliver or Carla Kelly.	2000-05-01

When I recognised the names of some of the characters, I was initially delighted because of the connections to other books in Oliver's Seven Corinthians series. For  instance, Regina Heathercott is the sister of Robert Heathercott, the Earl  of Gresham (Lord Gresham's Lady), and is a good friend of Guy Hawkhurst (An  Unsuitable Match) - not that either of these men play much of a part in  this book, unfortunately.<br />Regina begins the book - and remains for at  least half of it - as a spoilt, selfish and demanding brat, which was very  disappointing, since Oliver's heroines are normally more likeable. She did  improve later and became a genuinely nice, considerate person, but by then  I'd lost sympathy with her and all my sympathies rested with poor Richard,  who'd been forced to marry her. (Incidentally, 'arrogant'? Hardly! ).  <br />The last couple of chapters were amusing, largely for the opportunity to  meet Regina's brothers, but overall, while I've read almost every other  Oliver I possess at least twice, this one still hasn't cried out for a  second read.	2000-05-01

The plot has a lot of strengths: heroine (Cassandra) was secretly betrothed, but her fiance died before they could marry. On his  death-bed, he begged his brother to look after Cassandra, because they'd  anticipated the wedding ceremony. Thus the book starts with the brother,  the Earl of Mansfield (known to his friends as Raven) arriving to break the  sad news to Cassandra and - reluctantly - to offer to marry her if she is  pregnant.<br />Thus begins a very inauspicious marriage; what Raven was not  expecting is that Cassandra becomes very popular with his sister, his  mother and his friends! His closest friend, the Earl of Gresham (look for  Lord Gresham's Lady) even sets up a flirtation with her. And, to his  amazement, Raven finds that he cares.<br />The problem is, he's completely  hopeless at doing anything about it! And Cassandra doesn't really have much  idea how to deal with him either. <br />But being Patricia Oliver, the plot is  resolved with some fun, quite a bit of angst, and a smile at the end. And  there are more books to look for, about many of the supporting characters  here, so what are you waiting for?	2000-05-01

It's not actually Regency; it's set a little earlier, pre French Revolution. It's actually a sequel to Black Moth, although Heyer changed the names of some of her characters and a few identifying details; however, enough similarities remain to identify Avon  as the villain of the earlier book. Heyer herself confirmed this, as is  noted in one of her biographies.<br />The discovery by the Duke of Avon of a  young boy who reminds him strongly of an old enemy, the Comte de  Saint-Vire, is intriguing; what is even more intriguing is the fact that  Leon is actually Leonie. Surprisingly enough, this child-woman inspires  Julian's protective instincts rather than his predatory ones, as might have  been expected, and instead of seducing her - which might have been his  original intention - he decides to keep well away from her. But absence, of  course, makes the heart grow fonder, and not only does Leonie miss  'milord,' but he misses his brat. <br />The denouement of this book is one of  Heyer's most ingenious and is astonishingly well played out. <br />A  heartwarming romance with many twists and turns; it's definitely a keeper  and shouldn't be missed. And look out for the sequel, Devil's Cub, starring  Avon's son and heir, the Marquess of Vidal. It's a delight too!	2000-04-30

I love just about everything Georgette Heyer's written in the Regency genre, but this book is the best of an excellent crop. Venetia is a delightful heroine, mature and intelligent while at the same time extremely  naive about men and the ways of the world - so much so that she has  absolutely no notion just how much danger her new next-door neighbour, the  wicked Lord Damerel, could be to her. And yet it is her innocence which is  her greatest protection where he is concerned.<br />Their growing friendship,  assisted by Venetia's young brother, and the interference of Venetia's  other suitors, is portrayed with humour and a light touch by Heyer. But  once he decides that he cannot in all conscience seduce her, Damerel  believes himself to be unworthy of her. Even when she needs him most, he  appears to turn his back on her.<br />Of course, being a Heyer book, all works  out in the end, but the journey to that denoument is alternately witty,  sparkling and heart-wrenching. <br />Like most Heyers, this book is now out of  print; however you manage to get a copy, keep it! This is a book you'll  want to read over and over.	2000-04-30

ButJulian was killed at war - and there's a dreadful secret there which David dares not reveal...The reader is shown the truth about the characters of the two men, but Rebecca remains ignorant... <br />Balogh does eventually resolve this seemingly impossible situation, but not before all three main characters arrive at a better understanding of themselves and each other.<br />As usual, Balogh's characterisations are excellent. One thing I really like about this writer is that she almost never writes a completely irredeemable character; even her villains tend to have some trace of good in them (and indeed, in some of her stories villains of previous books end up as heroes). She also does an excellent job of portraying emotions here, particularly the emotions of two characters who just have no idea how to communicate with each other.<br />A beautiful and memorable love story.	2000-04-30

Brilliant	Patricia Oliver has another winner with Lord Gresham's Lady - and I'm amazed more people haven't reviewed this excellent book. Sarah Stanton is an impecunious widow whose only means of support for herself and her daughter is to marry a man she dislikes intensely. Until Lord Gresham comes  on the scene.<br />Gresham, for those who've read other books by Patricia  Oliver, made his first appearance in Miss Drayton's Downfall; in that book,  he was portrayed as a cynical rake who would even contemplate running off  with another man's wife. Here, he is immediately attracted to Sarah, and is  very willing to assist her in her predicament, too... but only if she  becomes his mistress. Despite her refusal, he is willing to use whatever  unscrupulous means he can in order to get what he wants.<br />However, as is  frequently the case, when someone gets what they want it turns out not to  have been everything they expected, and that's certainly so here.<br />As  usual with Patricia Oliver, this book has plenty of excellent character  introspection, angst, and a brilliantly-written resolution at the end. I've  already read my copy several times, and - as with the rest of her Seven  Corinthians series - this is definitely a keeper.	2000-04-30

Her siblings are a delight, especially Felix and Charis, and the various  adventures and scrapes from which Alverstoke has to rescue them are  hilarious.

When Robert Monroyal, depressed at seeing so many of his close friends - all once rakehells like himself - now married, bets ten thousand pounds that he will never marry, he never imagines that scarcely a couple of weeks  later he will find himself forced to marry a woman he barely knows, the  daughter of a man he despises, who hates his guts and whom he believes to  have trapped him. And yet from these inauspicious beginnings....<br />Robert  Monroyal first appeared as the cynical, sneering friend of Guy Hawkhurst in  An Unsuitable Match, and very much merited a book of his own. And Oliver  did him proud! He's not, of course, quite the arrogant, cruel man he  appears to be, but he is seriously troubled and in need of a good woman.  However, he certainly doesn't intend that Pamela should have any role in  his life. Instead, he sends her away to his country estates, planning never  to visit her.<br />However, he reckons without his siblings, his step-mother  and even Pamela herself.<br />A great read!	2000-04-29

Here, she's surpassed herself with a wonderful, funny and out of the ordinary heroine,  and a hero I fell in love with on the first page I encountered  him.<br />Serena is no blushing debutante, and never wanted to go to London  and join in the Marriage Mart in the first place. And when she meets Guy  Hawkhurst, the Duke of Wolverton, all her prejudices about drunken, idle  wastrels are confirmed. And she certainly leaves an impression on him when  she gives him a bloody nose!<br />And yet, from this inauspicious start they  become friends. At first their relationship is based on challenges, neither  one wanting to back down; Hawk, egged on by his even more cynical friend  Monroyal, can't resist baiting Serena. But then Serena's life falls apart  around her, and he finds he can't leave her to cope alone....<br />From there  on, the book becomes less of an amusing romp and very much a heartwrenching  love story. There are some unforgettable scenes in this book, which I won't  spoil for anyone who hasn't read it - buy it and wallow in them  yourself!<br />Patricia Oliver is a master at writing books about men with  'pasts' - they usually have some sort of bad experience in their childhood,  or have suffered trauma, and that influences their outlook on life in  general, on women and on marriage. This is the case for most of the heroes  of her novels, and is certainly true in respect of Hawk. But she is also  brilliant at giving her heroes a heroine who can help them to heal and  teach them how to love.<br />I read this book three times within a fortnight  of buying it, and still re-read it regularly. It's a classic!	2000-04-29

Since my previous review of this book didn't show up, I'm trying again.... This is the first book by Mary Jo Putney I'd read, and it didn't disappoint in the least. In fact, I loved it and just didn't want to put it down.  <br />Although the cover suggests it's about Jason Kincaid and Caroline  Hanscombe, in fact there are four main characters: Richard Dalton and  Caroline's Aunt Jessica come into it as well. Jason chooses Caroline as his  bride at random - he literally draws her name out of a bowl - and she  accepts him under duress. But she won't accept his invitation to his  country estate unless her aunt accompanies her. But Jessica and Jason have  met before....<br />At the same time, Richard Dalton, who has received some  astonishing news, journeys to his old family home... which just happens to  border Kincaid land. And he meets Caroline. What happens next? Well, you'll  just have to read and find out!<br />Personally, I think Putney does a great  job of characterisation, and all four main characters are portrayed  sympathetically and likeably. I can certainly see - contrary to the other  reviewer - what Jason could have seen in Caroline once he got to know her:  their conversation at the ball made that very clear, and I agree with what  he said to her then. (If you've read this book, you'll know what I  mean!).<br />And look out for Richard's wicked cousin, Reggie. He seems  totally without redemption, but then again, who knows... and of course,  there is The Rake, the sequel to this book!	2000-04-26

I was a little dubious about ordering this book in the first place  given the mixed reviews here, but decided to give it a chance; and I'm very  glad I did.<br />I never read the original, shorter version of this book, but  I cannot imagine wanting The Bargain to be any shorter than it is. The  story flowed really well, and the characters - *all*  the characters - were  entertaining, well drawn, and a joy to meet. David and Jocelyn in  particular were very sympathetic and their relationship was portrayed by  Putney in a loving, humorous and sometimes heartwrenching manner. And we  also got two other love stories on the side!<br />I can't see how anyone can  say that there was no love developing between David and Jocelyn here. It  literally flowed off the pages! It was there all along, from Jocelyn's  unexpected sadness at what she'd thought was David's death, to her joy at  his recovery, and then the time they spent in the country. It was  blindingly obvious there that they were in love.<br />Another thing I enjoy  about Putney's books is the use of recurring characters: in this book we  meet Richard Dalton, for instance, who gets his own story in The Diabolical  Baron, and also Rafe (Jocelyn's other less well-intentioned suitor) whose  own story I can't wait to read. <br />I thoroughly recommend this book, as  I've done for every other Putney I've read - and as I already did in  respect of this one last week, but the review I submitted then never  appeared.	2000-04-26

Carla Kelly is an incredible writing talent!<br />Roxanna Drew is a relatively recent widow left in straitened circumstances, but who would  rather be homeless with her two daughters than dependent on her  brother-in-law's not entirely selfless charity. So she manages to rent a  run-down cottage on Lord Winn's estate. Then Lord Winn himself gets caught  in the snow and begs for shelter....<br />The growing friendship between  Roxanna and Winn is alternately hilarious, touching and heartwrenching.  Both have sorrows in their past - his more public than hers - and both need  each other's friendship; her daughters also begin to rely on him as a  father-figure, making things even more poignant. There is a beautiful scene  not too far in the book where Winn is about to leave for his sister's home,  but he simply turns around and comes back, unable to leave Roxanna and the  children.<br />From there on... suffice to say that I doubt anyone could read  the rest of the book without crying at least twice. The threat to Roxanna's  daughters, the horseback ride to Scotland and back when Winn gets  frostbite, and what happens from then on is so well written I couldn't put  the book down. <br />This is genuinely a love story for adults. And by that I  don't mean that it's X-rated; simply that Kelly treats her readers *as*  adults and gives us a story full of the whole range of human emotions. Her  characters are real and down to earth, and concern themselves with the  mundane and essential things of life, rather than superficial things like  balls and dresses (if you want blushing debutantes and visits to Almacks,  don't buy this book). <br />I could only wish that this, and Lord Ragsdale's  Reform - another excellent Kelly novel - were twice the length they are. If  I can't have that, I'll still say that this book is absolutely perfect. No  matter what you have to pay for it, BUY IT!	2000-04-26

Well, perhaps Carla Kelly, but few others. <br />Yes, Prissy is really a prostitute, and has been for several months  before Gerard becomes her client. He is a shy, not-very-bright young man  who quite simply does not know how to relate to women and finds comfort in  the routine. He doesn't know how to show love or affection either, and when  he finally decides to set her up as his mistress he has to pretend it's all  a business transaction; Prissy likewise compartmentalises her life because  it's what Gerard wants.<br />Their love story is beautifully portrayed by an  author who has a gift for such angsty relationship tales. The characters'  motivations all become clear over time, and Balogh uses introspection to  great effect in developing the relationship and the characters'  personalities. If you love books which make you want to cry before you  smile at the ending, you'll love this one.	2000-04-26

I loved this book, and rate it among Balogh's best in the Signet regency genre. Tenby and Harriet are wonderful characters, whom I liked from the  moment I encountered them in these pages; I gather they previously appeared  in `Dancing with Clara,' but since I can't get that book I haven't read it.  The story of how Harriet ends up as Tenby's mistress even though he had  actually intended to propose to her is beautifully done, and then their  first encounter as lovers is so bitter-sweet I nearly cried. They both love  each other, but are determined that love cannot come into such a  relationship, therefore they make love without emotion, not daring to allow  their feelings to show at all.<br />We also have Tenby's grandmother,  determined that he needs to make a suitable match (and the daughter of a  country parson and widow of a baronet, which is what Harriet is, is by no  means suitable for a duke); we have Tenby's own sense of duty which leads  him to court another woman despite loving Harriet and having her as his  mistress; and thank heavens for the interfering great-aunt!<br />This book  came close to being a tear-jerker on many occasions: Balogh is wonderful at  angst, star-crossed lovers and seemingly impossible situations. And just  when a resolution seems impossible, Balogh pulls a happy ending almost out  of the blue.<br />Another thing I like about Balogh's writing is that her  characters are all real, human in every way. She never writes people as  pure black or pure white: even the suitable wife for Tenby is a woman I  felt I could like as a character, rather than being the grasping seeker  after a title that this kind of character might have been in a book by  another writer.<br />I entirely recommend this book; it's a keeper and will be  joining my other well-read Baloghs on my bookshelf.	2000-04-09

It certainly looks like it; even the last couple of books in that series looked as if she was running out of steam and couldn't be bothered putting  together an interesting or convincing plot.<br />This book was, frankly,  boring. The characters inspired no interest in me whatsover, even though  the plot as described on the cover and on this site should have interested  me. Kihlstrom's attention to detail and to factual accuracy is also very  poor. I enjoyed some of her Westcott books - although she's not on a par  with Balogh, Oliver or Kelly, those books were entertaining. After 'The  Reckless Barrister' I can safely say that I never intend to read anything  by Kihlstrom again.	2000-04-07

It is certainly not a typical Regency; in fact, the only feature in common with the Regency genre is that the hero is an aristocrat. Having  said that, he has no sympathy with the ton and no desire to live among  them. Instead he wants to bring up his daughter in Wales - but to his  shock, he finds that country life, and the management of his estates and  coal mines, is not what he'd expected. He's an aristocrat with a social  conscience, but finds that his fellow land-owners don't share it.<br />She is  a teacher, a widow, and the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy landowner  who chooses to live among the mining community; about to become engaged to  a miner. Then she meets the Marquess, and becomes governess to his  daughter, and attraction flares between them....<br />But there is far more to  this book than romance. It is also a sweeping social history, and Balogh  has done her research extremely well here. We see poverty, brutal  employers, the early trade unions and the Chartist movement, and the  'Scotch Cattle,' as well as an evocative portrayal of a miners' march. As  usual with Balogh's books, though, there are no simple distinctions between  good and evil; characters are portrayed as human, with flaws as well as  good points.<br />Definitely a keeper; I gave a copy to a friend shortly after  reading mine, and she loved it too.	2000-03-28

Cora is a wonderfully amusing and enjoyable heroine, and  Francis a rather unexpected but thoroughly likeable hero. Cora's  misconception about Francis is actually very plausible, and the scene in  which this gets straightened out between them is one of the most amusing in  any Regency I've read. It's also good to see a heroine who isn't a  simpering miss in the bedroom.<br />Don't expect the usual Balogh angst in  this book; but for a comedy with a light touch this is wonderful.	2000-03-27

Full of angst and humour in equal measure	A friend of mine recommended this book to me, and I managed to find it through an Amazon auction. It was well worth the trouble, and the postage costs of having it sent across to the UK. <br />There's a matchmaking mama;  but she's the hero's mother. There's a debutante, but no ordinary simpering  miss. And there's a hero, but no stiff aristocrat. Instead, when the hero  first meets the heroine, he insists that he has no intention of standing on  ceremony with her; they treat each other very informally and he encourages  her to behave in a very unladylike manner on occasion. Which is fine...  until the house party starts. Suddenly they have to behave very properly  with each other, there is no further opportunity for private conversation,  and its all downhill for their relationship from there. Here's where the  angst sets in.<br />And it's very well written; we feel for both characters  through the trauma of misunderstanding - and even more so when the private  dinner which was supposed to resolve it all goes horribly wrong! <br />A great  book; shame Joy Freemen hasn't written many since.	2000-03-27

She's established a scenario in which her characters have met before and have reasons to dislike or distrust each other, but finding out where  they met before, under what circumstances and what actually happened is  like getting blood from a stone. Balogh does give us quite a bit of  introspection, but instead of the usual technique of using the  introspection as a means of filling her readers in on what happened in the  past, she tries to combine this with a 'closed mystery' style, in which we  only find out the full story at the same time as the hero and heroine. This  makes the book very frustrating.<br />Even when all is finally resolved, the  ending is unsatisfying because I feel she finishes the book too soon. I  wanted more discussion about the past and what went wrong, and about the  future. I wanted to *see* the characters reconciled - and I didn't get  that.<br />So, while I'll keep this book as part of my Balogh collection, I  won't be re-reading it much.	2000-03-27

It was Keyes' first novel, and is about Claire, who is dumped by her husband just as she's about to give birth... yes, Keyes can and does turn that into a comedy! The book is set mostly in  Dublin, and deals in a humorous way with themes such as coping with a new  baby and no partner and returning home to live with parents after having  lived away from home for several years. Oh, and men do come into it as  well... <br />I laughed, I cried, and I was smiling when I reached the end of  it. One of the best of the genre.	2000-03-22

The characters don't appeal to me at all, and the premise - that the heroine is so embarrassed by her eccentric  family that she doesn't want to know the hero - is just ridiculous.

Totally unconvincing plot, unlikeable and incredible characters and to add insult to injury, the most stupid, insulting plot devices I have  ever come across. This book had no redeeming features whatsoever.<br />A duke  falling in love with, and marrying, the illegitimate granddaughter of a  witch? The illegitimate son of an earl inheriting his title? 'Mystic'  bloody ponies?  I wanted to be sick.<br />The saddest thing of all is that  Nadine Miller's first book, 'The Duke's Dilemma', was just so good that I  was really interested in reading more of her work. But having read this and  'The Unlikely Angel,' I'm almost inclined to doubt that they were written  by the same person. <br />Appalling. Truly abysmal. And as for research -  well, it looks to me as if Miller has never heard of the concept.	2000-03-20

This is another well-written, entertaining novel from the pen of Patricia Oliver, one of the best writers in this genre. Although I was initially disappointed to discover that this book is not part of her Seven  Corinthians series (and what happened to that series? I don't think she  finished it), I still never regretted buying it.<br />Oliver uses one of the  classic plot-lines in this book, that of indigent widow latching onto a  young and naive man, who persuades himself that he's in love and wants to  marry her. The twist, however, is that in this version of the plot the lady  is no villain or harpy, as would usually be the case. Athena knows that  she's not being entirely fair by Peregrine and feels guilty, but Peregine  insists that he does love her, and he's very kind indeed to her  daughter.<br />Peregrine's father, the Earl of St Aubyn, is (not surprisingly)  none too happy about the engagement, and sets himself the task of  separating the couple. However, he finds himself attracted to Athena, much  against his will. <br />Again, Oliver doesn't resort to stereotypes: St Aubyn  is by no means the heartless father. In fact, he is a sincere, caring and  very moral man who hates what he has to do to detach Athena from his son,  but does it because he loves his son. He does actually recognise Athena's  merits, and the portrayal of his own dilemma makes this story all the more  interesting.<br />In addition, Peregrine is also drawn very sympathetically.  Even when - as could be expected - he falls in love with someone else, he  doesn't forget his obligations, and he still keeps undertakings he's made  to Athena's daughter.<br />All in all, a very enjoyable book, with a great  cast of characters, including some minor ones who sound as if they deserve  their own story!	2000-03-20

For some reason, this book didn't grip me at all, and I found parts of it  boring. The characters were not as interesting, and the plot not as  entertaining, as her other books.<br />The sub-plot with the painting, and the  mystery about the Earl's past and his dead first wife, just didn't appeal  to me, and when, close to the end, the heroine's life was at risk I wasn't  remotely gripped by any sense of danger. The hero and heroine's antagonism  didn't seem to ring true for me either.<br />Not sure why... but this wasn't  up to Oliver's usual standards as far as I was concerned. Still way ahead  of many other authors in this genre, though!	2000-03-20

Neither the hero nor the heroine inspired any interest at all in me, and had I not paid good money for this book I'd have binned it there and then. Having persevered, I  now wonder how it got published. True, this book is not as appallingly bad  as some I've read, but since the principal characters come across as plain  stupid apart from anything else I can't see what it has to recommend it.  And what's the description here all about? It bears no resemblance to the  book at all - at no time was there any question in the heroine's mind that  the Burlingham had any dishonourable motives in his pursuit of her.<br />The  main sub-plot is farcical in the extreme - third cousin of hero tries to  ruin his reputation with the ton. Why? And what does Purtwee stand to gain  from it? Why would he bother? Burlingham is already poverty-stricken, and  if Purtwee really wanted to destroy him all he'd need to do was see that  fact become common knowledge. No need to invent barely-credible scenarios  whereby Burlingham insults one of the Patronesses after being drugged.  Purtwee himself is a poorly-caricatured, unbelievable character.<br />As for  the hero and heroine, it is unbelievable that it took them so long to  realise the truth of each other's financial situations. What ladies of  Quality would fail to employ a butler or any manservants? That would have  given the game away to Burlingham immediately, as would the re-used  teabags, the worn garments, the neglect around the house. Likewise,  Burlingham's lack of the usual gentleman's accessories would have shown  Bets the truth.<br />In any case, there is no way at all that the ton would  have been ignorant of the true circumstances of each. Bets and her mother  wore gowns which were already two or three years old, made over and  redecorated. Any member of the ton, lady or gentleman, would have noticed  this immediately and realised its significance. Likewise, there is no wayBurlingham's situation would have gone unnoticed - tradesmen talk, as do  servants, and gossip would have got around that he was unable to pay his  debts, didn't maintain his own stables and only had one threadbare  curricle. Completely incredible scenario, therefore.<br />And then there is  Douglas's lack of research on the period: for instance, she allows  Burlingham and Bets to eat together in an *inn,*  for heaven's sake! She  would have been ruined immediately had anyone heard about it - as they  would. Then there is vocabulary: she has Purtwee use the word `tosspot' to  Bets when describing Burlingham. No gentleman would ever have used any  coarse term in front of a lady, and especially a young unmarried lady. In  any case, I sincerely doubt that Douglas understands the meaning of the  word herself - I can't imagine she'd have a character use it if she did  know what it means. Does she seriously imagine that one aristocrat would  use a very coarse expression referring to masturbation when referring to  another aristocrat? <br />And then, at the end, when she's tying up loose ends  in a barely credible manner, she refers to house prices. One large town  house in London was apparently worth over sixty thousand pounds. Is she  joking?  This is over two hundred years ago, when sixty thousand pounds was  an absolute fortune. House prices in that part of London may be high, but  even *one* hundred years ago that kind of house could have been obtained  for perhaps six thousand pounds.<br />What a waste of time and money!	2000-03-18

Some other characters from that earlier book also appear here (eg  Lady Leverham), and others are referred to.<br />This is a very funny book,  somewhat in contrast to 'His Grace Endures' which, while it had its amusing  moments, was more heartwrenching. Jensen in this book reveals a light touch  and a gift for putting her characters in ridiculous situations; her  narrative also has some very amusing touches to it, particularly some of  Tarquin's introspection.<br />I think the second reviewer from Hong Kong  missed the point of this book: it is *supposed* to be funny. Additionally,  I'm puzzled as to how s/he can say that Tarquin wasn't attracted to Sibyl.  It was obvious all along that he was more interested in her than he wanted  to be, and there were plenty of subtle hints: the way he sought out her  company in preference to the company of others at times; the way he started  to notice the colour of her eyes; how well she looked in her blue dress;  the scene when he sought refuge in her bedroom - there, his attraction to  her was blindingly obvious, and I'm not sure how this reviewer missed it.  And, of course, when she escorted him to his room when he was drunk - he  may have been drunk, but he wasn't incapable! Not to mention the  conversation through the locked door. After all that, I have no idea how  anyone could say there was no attraction or chemistry.<br />This book is quite  a contrast to my other favourites, books by Oliver, Balogh and Kelly for  example, but as a comedy-romance it is excellent.	2000-03-15

This book is so bad, its plot so farcical, its characterisation so thin and unrealistic that I can't help wondering  whether someone's passing off a spoof here.<br />*No-one* in Regency times  behaved as Chesney's characters do. Lucinda's actions are completely out of  place for a young lady of quality of that time. The idea that she would ask  a Marquess to marry her, let alone that she would speak to his mother as  she did, is completely unbelievable. And as for the Marquess himself, he  seems totally irredeemable - so how could she possibly fall in love with  him? There is no motivation, either, for his sudden chage of  character.<br />And the other elements to the plot - the servant, the  jewellery theft, the attempted murder... I was rolling my eyes in  disbelief.<br />Chesney also needs to take some lessons in technical writing  skills: her sentence structure and grammar need a lot of  attention.<br />Finally, I'd suggest that if she's going to write any more,  she needs to take a sabbatical first and go and read some English social  and political history, brush up on her grammar and period language, and  read some books by much better writers such as Balogh, Kelly, Oliver and so  on.<br />Publishers: please be more choosy in what you publish!	2000-03-15

This is a wonderful book; Ms Jensen demonstrates some great skills of storytelling, characterisation and emotion in this tale of  a widow who has to confront and deal with the man she jilted seven years  earlier and who she believes to have been ultimately responsible for her  husband's death. And yet she discovers that the Duke of Conovar is nothing  like she imagined. And very soon, because of the cruel gossip which starts  to spread about him, she becomes his staunchest defender rather than his  enemy. <br />There are some heartwrenching scenes in this book, as well as  some dialogue which had me glued to the page. It's impossible not to be  touched by Conovar's sincerity or Deirdre's anguish as each finds out that  they were mistaken about each other and about other characters whose  actions impinged on their lives and destroyed their relationship seven  years earlier.<br />I thoroughly recommend this book, and I'm completely  bemused by Susan Johnson's review, below.

This is a very entertaining story, with believable and likeable main characters, and also some  supporting characters who are very well developed and could even deserve a  story in their own right (Robert and Barbara in particular, though possibly  also Chloe and John).<br />Hester and Thorne at first appear to be poles  apart, but he is less shallow than she believes him to be and she is less  of a harridan than he expects her to be. Even still, when they meet and get  to know each other, the sparks fly in all directions! The sexual tension is  palpable in some scenes, and Barbour handles the relationship development  extremely well. She shows the unwilling but deep friendship which grows  between them in parallel to their mutual attraction, and the way in which  they come to trust each other, much to their surprise.<br />And when jealousy  rears its ugly head... watch out!	2000-03-08

But the plot itself is just a little incredible; despite Gates' birth (about which Griffin knew nothing until the end of the book) there is  no way she would have been invited into his home and treated as a member of  the family. He'd have made her his mistress at the very most, if he hadn't  just seduced her and left her behind in the country. So although I quite  enjoyed it, I had to suspend my disbelief more than I would have wanted.	2000-02-29

While the romance between Griffin and Gates is certainly well-written, the circumstances of their meeting are pretty unlikely in the first place, as  is Griffin's failure to make her his mistress once he realises his  attraction to her. If he genuinely believes she's an uneducated farm girl,  there is no way he would treat her as a valued guest in his home, or that  his aunt would welcome her as if she was a social equal. The sexual tension  is certainly well drawn, but I found it very hard to believe that - even  with Lady Min's ultimatum in his mind - Griffin would have waited so long  before consummating the relationship.<br />So... has its moments, but  certainly by no means Butler's best. I'd recommend The Rake's Retreat or  Lord Monteith's Gift in preference.	2000-02-20

I'm not a mystery fan; I am, however, a fan of good romances with well-drawn, sympathetic characters,  which this is. Beecham Bryce is a rake, but has become one by virtue of  incidents in his past. Jemima Vale is a twenty-nine year old spinster,  considered to be on the shelf. However, there is a strong attraction  between them, and once her initial reaction against Bryce (because of his  reputation) wears off, Jemima can't help but want to know what it would be  like to be loved by him.<br />He is very tempted by her, too, but his scruples  prevent him from taking their relationship further. How they resolve the  impasse between them forms the basis of this beautifully-told, angst-ridden  love story. The murder plot has some bearing on their relationship, though  not much, and in a way it's a shame that this dominates the story  description since I almost didn't buy this book as a result.	2000-02-20

But she's done it with this one.  I know this book was written before 'Mrs Drew,' and in some respects it  shows: Kelly's narrative style and vocabulary aren't quite as much in  keeping with the period and some Americanisms creep in. But the book is so  good that these errors failed to jolt me out of the story.<br />Ragsdale is a  wonderfully complex but sympathetic character, initally seeming to be a  dissipated rogue, but we quickly discover that underneath he has a very  kind heart despite the episode in his past which makes him predisposed to  hate Emma because she is Irish.<br />Emma is no ordinary servant, despite  being in fact a slave (an indentured servant, forced into servitude for no  pay for a fixed period). She too has reason to hate the British, and that  hate initally becomes focused on Ragsdale as the epitome of that uncaring  nation.<br />But both discover very quickly that first impressions are rarely  accurate, and we are given insights into the reactions of both characters  as they find themselves reluctantly drawn to each other. And despite the  fact that Emma has set herself the task of reforming Lord Ragsdale - which  involves healing his pain along the way - she also ends up being the  subject of his attempts at reformation.<br />As someone originally from  Ireland, I was very impressed with Kelly's use of Irish history as a  backdrop; so many American writers have a tendency to write Irish people  and Irish history in a very 'twee,' romanticised manner far divorced from  reality. Kelly captures the atmosphere perfectly.<br />This book is now very  difficult to obtain, and I got my copy through an Amazon auction. Now,  having read it, I'd have paid twice as much as I did for it, including  postage. It's really that good.	1999-12-16

Balogh shows Rebecca's unwilling attraction to David extremely well.  In the beginning she dislikes him (for reasons which seemed to be valid at  the time, but all is not what it seems), but her feelings change gradually,  in a way she does not even herself notice. Rebecca and David's inability to  talk to each other, while it compounds their awkward situation, is very  credible in the circumstances.<br />And, since all Balogh's characters,  including minor characters, are always very well drawn, Julian is portrayed  extremely sympathetically. Given his 'back-story' it would have been very  easy to paint him as the villain, but Balogh avoids that temptation and  shows him as the flawed but well-meaning person he seems to be.<br />I  thoroughly recommend this book.	1999-11-29

It is much more low-key than her other books, and as such there isn't much to get excited  or sad about. It's not a tear-jerker, although there is no doubt that the  heroine has had a tough life. <br />I would have liked to find out more of  Christina's and Gerard's background sooner; the information came in dribs  and drabs and it was a little frustrating waiting to find out *why* she had  married his cousin instead, and what the issue was with her father. The  book also ended very abruptly; Balogh could have brought the characters  together a little sooner and thus spent more time on the  resolution.<br />Still, it's worth buying and reading, even if I won't be  re-reading it as often as some of my other Baloghs.	1999-11-21

At least it might help me recognise which books to avoid in future! &lt;g&gt;. Since Miller is the author of 'The Duke's Dilemma,' an excellent book and one which I notice Ms  Emory hasn't reviewed, I thought this one was worth a try. It  wasn't.<br />Yes, Miller tries to bring some social concern into a Regency,  which when done well does tend to appeal to me. But for some reason the  characters just did not appear either particularly credible or sympathetic.  The heroine's friend almost undergoes a personality transplant close to the  end, and as for the final scene in the hero's grandfather's house,  'farcical' springs to mind.<br />Since the later book of Miller's I've read  is even worse, I really wonder what happened to that talent she showed in  her first book. I could even begin to doubt that it was written by the same  person!	1999-11-17

Strains credibility to its limits and beyond	I really cannot believe that this book is written by the author of 'The Duke's Dilemma.' I bought it because that book was just so good I had to believe that the author's other work was equally good. But I was so  wrong.<br />I could just say 'Do not buy this book.' But I see the author is  about to publish a sequel to it, which makes me despair utterly about  publishers' decision-making.<br />The plot of this book is truly nauseating.  The 'mystic white pony,' the so-called witchcraft and so on are just  appalling stuff. Okay in a fantasy universe, but not in regency romances,  please!  But even dismissing the supernatural, there is so much here which  is completely incredible. *No way* would a duke (which is what the hero  becomes by the end of the book) have married a woman from the lowest  classes, especially one who is illegitimate. <br />And then we have the  heroine's brother, Liam. The illegitimate son of an earl, close to the end  of the book he gets named the earl's heir and inherits the title on his  death. I wouldn't bother about this complete fantasy plot-twist were it not  for the fact that Liam seems to be the hero of Miller's sequel. The  illegitimate offspring of an earl - or any aristocrat - can inherit  whatever money or property his/her parents decide to pass on to them, but  CANNOT inherit any title (or any entailed property). These can only pass to  legitimate heirs. Thus the entire premise of Miller's sequel is sunk before  she starts.<br />Please do some research first next time!	1999-11-16

Since they had anticipated the wedding ceremony,  her fiance had begged his brother, on his death-bed, to look after  Cassandra. So they find themselves tied to each other in a marriage neither  of them wanted.<br />However, some of Mansfield's friends find Cassandra  rather more attractive than he had expected, and both of them find  themselves experiencing very unexpected feelings of jealousy.

Patricia Oliver is one of only two writers in this genre whose  books I would buy without any prior recommendation.<br />This book is not part  of her 'Seven Corinthians' series, which was initally disappointing since I  like those characters, but as a stand-alone book it is immensely readable.  Oliver introduces another determined, strong and intelligent woman as a  heroine, and a hero who has to be tough but underneath is a caring, shy and  ethical man. St Aubyn's son is also painted very sympathetically as the  young man who initally falls in love with Serena; even when his feelings  are revealed as infatuation, he remains a likeable character who still has  time and patience for Serena's young daughter.<br />Two minor characters are  also interesting: the Earl and Countess of Ridgeway, friends of St Aubyn's  who appear near the end of the book. Enough is said about their romance to  suggest that Oliver might have already written, or be intending to write,  their story, and I shall look out for that book eagerly.	1999-11-09

The heroine, Regina, seemed to be a spoilt and selfish  little madam, which is unusual for Oliver: her heroines are usually  sensible, intelligent women with a well-developed sense of humour. However,  Regina did improve later in the book, and I ended up enjoying it.<br />It was  interesting to encounter both Gresham and Wolverton in a book set before  both of their own stories; I would also love to see Oliver write a book  with David Laughton as the hero. He has cropped up in a few of her books  now, and he sounds intriguing as well as having a mysterious and sad past.	1999-11-05

Her series of linked books, using recurring characters, is entertaining and very enjoyable and I had initially hoped that this book  would be another in the series. It isn't, unfortunately.<br />It was well  written, certainly, but the plot unfortunately did not grip me in the way  her other books did.

The hero is indeed likeable, but the supporting characters are barely credible at times. How could two sisters be so  different? Yes, fathers could get away with all sorts of behaviour  towards  their offspring, but really, Fosdale is simply an unbelievable character.

An independent woman determined to resist her  two insistent suitors and take good care of her younger borther; she meets  her new neighbour, Damerel, the most notorious rake in England. At first he  is tempted to seduce her, but later becomes protective towards her. Then,  when her older brother marries and she is forced to leave her home for  London, she thinks she will never see Damerel again. Desperate measures are  called for...<br />This is not a typical Regency; Venetia is not a blushing  debutante, and Damerel is not a dandified town gentleman. But the  characters are delightfully appealing and Damerel is such a wonderful,  down-to-earth hero! Read it, re-read it, treasure it for ever. I do.	1999-11-01

So why did I find this book  completely boring?<br />April Kihlstrom seems to lack the skills to tell a  story in such a way that the reader's interest is captured. Neither of her  two main characters came across as particularly appealing, and the  supporting characters were little more than caricatures. I never became  engaged with either the characters or the plot, and it was with great  difficulty that I managed to finish the book. If I'd just borrowed it  rather than paid good money for it, I wouldn't have finished it.<br />I should  have known; Kilhstrom's earlier Westcott series was very hit-and-miss, the  later books being very much poorer than the earlier ones. If she wants to  know how to write a novel with likeable characters, involving plots and  sub-plots and a little bit of social realism, she should take a career  break and spend her time reading Mary Balogh's books. <br />This gets two  stars rather than one, incidentally, because believe it or not I have read  worse books - from authors like Loyd Black and Chesney who barely have  adequate technical skills with writing and don't even attempt, in the  Regency genre, to ensure that they get the period details accurate.	1999-10-07

The plot, too, was plausible  and enjoyable.<br />I didn't even find Kate being taken in by Sir Harry Tate  difficult to believe, though maybe once she'd made love to him it strained  the credibility a little more.

Mary Balogh writes Regencies and other British historical novels better than many British writers. This book is not a Regency as such, though a member of the aristocracy is the hero.  <br />The heroine is a strong-minded, intelligent woman desperate to 'fit in'  among her mother's community in Cwmbran. She is the illegitimate daughter  of a baronet, but does not belong in his world. She meets the Marquess, but  feels she would only be destined to be his mistress, a fate she will not  resign herself to.<br />That's a bare plot summary, but there is so much more  to this book than that. There is also the very real poverty in a mining  community, the Chartist movement, and the Scotch Cattle who are the  'guardians' of group norms of behaviour. <br />Balogh has a geniune skill at  drawing readers into her characters' lives and concerns; once I'd started  this book I couldn't bear to put it down and ended up reading it in two  sittings. Thoroughly recommended, and I'm already giving a copy to a  friend.	1999-09-06

The part which  appealed most to me was Darcy's 'school project,' which develops into the  correspondence with Alex the American academic.

To take the plot first, Chesney has created a set of completely unbelievable characters: caricatures, especially the secondary characters who are portrayed in a  one-dimensional manner with not one redeeming feature between them. The  hero and heroine aren't particularly credible either, and as a reader I had  little sympathy for them. As for the events depicted, I find it hard to  believe that they are remotely credible within the Regency setting. The  heroine, in particular, speaks and behaves in a way no lady of the period  would have done whatever the provocation; and the Marquess's mother is  similarly incredible.<br />Leaving aside the thin and barely believable plot,  the author seems to me to have little skill at her craft. Her writing  style: sentence structure, command of vocabulary and so on, is immature and  distracts from the content of the book. While she tries to provide some  history for the hero to explain his motivations, her attempts at doing this  are very poorly done; in this respect, she has not one-hundredth of the  skill of Patricia Oliver, for example.<br />Finally, there are numerous  inaccuracies, both to the period and to the language and vocabulary; a  British-born writer such as Chesney should certainly be able to do better  at avoiding Americanisms in the dialogue of English Regency characters. And  young unmarried ladies in that period would know little or nothing about  mistresses or sex.<br />I have already disposed of my copy, and I cannot  recommend this book to any other reader.	1999-08-08

Her writing style is a welcome relief from that of a couple  of other authors I read recently, whose style and vocabulary are, at best,  immature. Putman has an impressive command of language, sentence structure  and overall novel structure, and that alone made the book immensely  readable.<br />She also has a skill in drawing readers into her characters,  earning our sympathy for them; and unlike some other writers she does not  neglect her secondary characters. They too have their stories, which in  many ways become as important as those of the hero and heroine. She also,  bit by bit, allows us to find out about the past of her characters, which  then reveals some of the reasons for their present state. This is  especially well done in the case of Claridge's Aunt Eleanor.<br />Putman gives  us a heroine who has been deaf since the age of seventeen, and shows how  despite that disability Hannah copes with life and manages to win the  respect and love of those around her. The intriguing twist which makes this  story out of the ordinary for a Regency is that Hannah at first appears to  be no lady - the Duke finds her in a hospital for sick  prostitutes.<br />Questions Putman fails to answer satisfactorily include just  how Claridge and his friend Sir Charles fail to realise that Hannah cannot  possible be low-born. They simply assume that her speech and intonation are  assumed; but in that case, how come she never drops the facade and speaks  roughly? She also 'learns' to be a lady too quickly: it must be apparent to  Claridge that she knows the rules and habits of polite society. No common  woman from the streets, unless she was a very high-class whore indeed,  would know how to behave.<br />And when the truth about Hannah's background  emerges, that she is not the orphaned daughter of Sir Charles' uncle, how  onearth was that kept from the ton? There was no explanation of any  attempt to convince Charles' uncle to keep quiet, and certainly Hannah's  real relatives would have boasted of their connection with her and denied  any suggestion that she was related to anyone else.<br />It is unfortunate  that these gaps exist in the plot, since otherwise this is a very  entertaining and extremely well-written book. However, if readers can  suspend disbelief over those aspects of the plot, it is well worth  reading.<br />Incidentally, why 'Dastardly' Duke? He is hardly that; the title  seems to have been chosen for effect rather than for its  suitability.<br />Just one further nit-pick: not only is the construction 'the  both of us/you' grammatically incorrect, but it is also completely wrong  for the location and would never have been used by Regency aristocracy. It  would not even be used in contemporary Britain.	1999-08-08

He helps her out of a number of difficult situations, telling  himself that his actions are merely a means of making her dependent on him  and eventually giving her no option but to accept his carte blanche. She  eventually does, but... things don't turn out as Gresham expects.<br />We  learn just why Gresham has lost all faith in love and in women; and we see  him undergo the difficult journey towards rediscovering his faith in  humanity. <br />This is a book which I highly recommend on its own, but is  even more worth acquiring as part of Oliver's Seven Corinthians linked  series. One of my favourites in this series of novels, along with An  Unsuitable Match.	1999-08-03

The Marquess of Monroyal first appeared as  an intriguing and in some ways likeable figure in 'An Unsuitable Match,'  and it is good to see him getting his own story. Monroyal, Hawkhurst and  the other two men in 'An Unsuitable Match' were new characters in the  series; none of these had appeared in Oliver's previous books, though  earlier characters reappear in both 'Unsuitable Match' and 'Inconvenient  Wife.'<br />What puzzles me about Monroyal, however, is that at the start of  this book there is reference to his feelings for the Countess of Mansfield,  and his attempt to run off to Paris with her. However, as readers of 'Miss  Drayton's Downfall' and 'Lord Gresham's Lady' will be aware, the person who  offered to run off with Cassandra Mansfield was the Marquess of Gresham.  It's unclear, therefore, whether Oliver got her characters mixed up and  hadn't realised that she had given Monroyal the same 'back-story', or  whether she liked Lord Gresham so much that she decided to duplicate him in  Monroyal.<br />Still, regardless of that, this is a book you'll want to read  again, particularly in conjunction with the others in the series.<br />I can't  tell whether Oliver has continued this series since; this appears to be the  most recent I can find, but there are other characters who have not yet had  their own stories, most noticeably 'Sweet Willy' Hampton. Anyone know?	1999-08-03

Serena is a perfect heroine: no simpering miss, but a  strong-willed woman who is not on the catch for a husband. Nor is she  particularly beautiful, and as her father is deeply in debt she's destined  to be an ape-leader.<br />Guy Hawkhurst, the Duke of Wolverton, is a drunken,  dissolute aristocrat; the first time he meets Serena she punches his nose!  But they become friends of a kind; then a tragic twist in the story brings  them closer together.<br />A must-read for Oliver fans. <br />Only one question -  why has she not revisited this group of friends since she wrote Monroyal's  story? There is certainly scope!	1999-07-28
2891651:US	52631742	R1DO4B57WFMN5J	0451195949	234232157	AN Outrageous Proposal (Signet Regency Romance)	Books	2	12	12	N	N	A very disappointing, thinly-plotted book	This is the weakest of the six-book series about the Westcott sisters and their governess; it reeks so strongly of Kihlstrom running out of steam that I actually suspect this may have been written after 'Miss Tibbles'  Folly.' Penelope and Talbot are very thinly drawn, and as a result I found  both to be unsympathetic characters. Talbot, who is at the start of the  book set up as a man with a genuine understanding of women and of Lady  Penelope's situation in particular, part-way through turns into a complete  idiot who wants to act like a domestic dictator. And Penelope, the  supposedly highly intelligent and independent young lady, is suddenly  missish and quite silly.<br />The book begins with a half-way decent plot in  which Geoffrey tries to get to know Penelope without making her think he  presents a threat to her desire not to marry. However, Kihlstrom rushes on  to the mock/real betrothal very quickly, and the remainder of the book is  taken up with a series of extremely thin roadblocks which suggested to me  that the author was desperately reaching for any device, however poor, to  pad out the book for the requisitve 200+ pages. The scene close to the end,  with the multiple Mrs Talbots, was by far the worst example of this: it was  simply ludicrous and at that stage Kihlstrom's plotting skills lost all  credibility. This was a pity, since the other books in this series have  generally been entertaining reads.<br />Ms Kihlstrom also makes errors in  relation to titles here: Penelope is an earl's daughter and therefore  entitled to the title of 'Lady'. This title remains with her when she  marries, unless her husband's title carries greater significance. Thus it  is Lady Penelope Talbot and Lady Rebecca Rowland (from the fourth book),  not Mrs Talbot and Mrs Rowland. In contrast, Diana (from the first book)  becomes the Duchess of Berenford since her husband's title is superior. The  occasional Americanism in disalogue also grates - while I expect  Americanisms in narrative, the dialogue should be accurate for the country  and the period. Thus I would not expect to see Regency ladies and gentlemen  use 'gotten' or 'the both of us' (which is in any case grammatically  inaccurate).<br />Not a book I shall be keeping to re-read; I think this book,  more than any of her others, demonstrates that Kihlstrom is not a Mary  Balogh, an Emma Lange or a Carla Lane.	1999-04-04

However, after reading 'Exeter's Daughter', I have now added Emma Lange to  that list.<br />I enjoyed this book enormously; the author has drawn the  complex characters very well. Marissa is, on the surface, a spoilt and  over-indulged duke's daughter, and Tristan - to whose home she has been  exiled as a temporary punishment - believes that this is precisely what she  is. But her disgraceful behaviour hides an independent spirit and  justifiable motives.<br />At first, the two appear to loathe each other;  Tristan certainly disapproves of Marissa, and she resents his disapproval  to such a degree that she refuses to explain herself to him. But gradually,  each discovers that the other is not what they appear to be. Tristan  discovers that Marissa is caring, loyal, intelligent and virtuous; Marissa  discovers and admires Tristan's strong sense of duty and loyalty,  demonstrated in his struggle to stay afloat financially and to take care of  his mother and sister.<br />How these two eventually overcome their distrust  and suspicion of each other, and fall in love, is well told in a cleverly  crafted novel by Emma Lange. I am keeping this book, and it has made me  want to seek out other titles by this intelligent, talented writer.	1999-03-28

What you will find is an earthy and very realistic story of an unlikely  friendship between a courageous but despairing vicar's widow with two young  daughters and a cynical, rough-and-ready marquess. Winn is no ballroom  dandy; he is a disgraced divorced man with no intention of ever marrying  again. Then he meets Roxanna Drew and, without even realising it at first,  is drawn to her.<br />The story contains a number of unexpected twists, but  the underlying theme is of two people betrayed by love, who find it  difficult to trust, and yet learn that they need to trust each other. Kelly  pulls no punches, and at times the book is earthy, shocking and  tear-inducing. <br />I loved it, and will be re-reading it very soon.	1999-03-01

It features two refreshingly different characters from those in usual Regencies: a heroine who is most definitely not a simpering, shallow schoolroom miss, and a hero behind whose jaded  sophistication lies an intelligent but lonely spirit.<br />Emily is from an  impoverished and decidely un-tonnish background, and seems to face a future  either as a perpetual companion to selfish and demanding distant relations,  or living quietly in the country, perhaps as the wife of a vicar. She is at  present companion to her beautiful cousin Lucinda, who may be about to  receive a proposal from the very rich Duke of Montford. On a visit to the  Duke's country estate, during which the Duke will make his choice of bride,  Emily meets a well-spoken but rough countryman named Jared, who bears an  uncanny resemblance to the arrogant Duke - and therefore must be an  illegitimate half-brother - and who ignites in her stirrings of passion she  never realised she possessed.<br />The Duke finds Emily intriguing, but is  aware that she is completely unsuited to be his bride. Despite the  disapproval of his secretary - who threatens to woo Emily for himself -  Jared continues his masquerade until the worst happens: he unintentionally  ruins Emily's reputation. Only when he cannot find her does he realise how  much he cares for her.<br />This is a lovely and well-crafted story, which I  will definitely keep and re-read. All of the characters in the book are  extremely well-drawn, and of the minor characters the most interesting is  Edgar Rankin, the Duke's secretary and friend. It is surprising that Ms  Miller has not returned to the character of Rankin in another book: he  definitely deserves to have his story told. There are hints in this book of  an intriguing past shared by the Duke and Rankin; and it would make a  wonderful finish to this story were Rankin to find an intelligent and  loving bride of his own, particularly someone who would provide a friend  for Emily.	1999-02-07

This book features a credible hero and a heroine who is certainly no  simpering, empty-headed Regency miss. Hugh and Rebecca's romance by no  means runs smoothly, and the tale certainly holds the reader's  interest.<br />However, what is disappointing about this and the other book in  the series I have read is the occasional errors Kihlstrom makes. She has  certainly researched the Regency era, and English manners and dialogue,  well - better than a number of other American Regency authors. This is what  makes the inaccuracies quite so disappointing. <br />For instance, in this  book there is a character called Sir Geoffrey Parker, whom Ms Kihlstrom  refers to as Sir Parker throughout. Baronets' titles attach to the  Christian name and not surname, and therefore the character would be Sir  Geoffrey. This is not something which would have been very difficult for Ms  Kihlstrom to ascertain.<br />The other mistake which jars is Ms Kihlstrom's  use of some Americanisms in dialogue. I don't object to Americanisms in  narrative; after all, she is an American writing for an American audience.  But when she has English Regency characters saying things like 'gotten', or  'the both of us', it is so inaccurate and unbelievable that it distracts  the reader's attention from the story. 'Gotten' is not, and has never been,  used in British English, and so no Regency lady or gentleman would have  used it. 'The both of us' is grammatically inaccurate as well as not being  part of British vocabulary. <br />If Ms Kihlstrom could make a little more  effort to avoid these mistakes, her books would certainly be considered  aming the better few in American Regencies.	1999-02-07

On the other hand, I am not in general particularly  fond of stories concerning the supernatural, but I found this book  entertaining and very moving, and I have re-read it a couple of times  since.<br />Ellen and Lord Wulfric (Corey Wolfe, whose title is *not* Lord  Corey Wolfe as the description on this site suggests, but the Marquess of  Wulfric) meet and get on extremely well; then a tragic accident results in  Corey's death. But not his departure from Ellen's life; he vows to find her  the perfect husband before autumn comes. The problem is, as they both come  to realise, the 'perfect' husband for Ellen is no longer alive!<br />The book  is alternately very funny and very moving; the scenes where Ellen first  meets her faithful ghost are hilarious, as are the scenes where Corey  provides a running commentary on events which only Ellen can hear. More  poignant are the scenes where Ellen and Corey realise their growing  feelings for each other, feelings which they believe can never be resolved.  More painful still is the fact that they cannot touch; Corey's ghostly  touch gives living things frostbite.<br />Just when the reader thinks that the  story can never be resolved (in any way other than, perhaps, Ellen's own  death), Ferguson arrives at a resolution which may seem a little hackneyed,  but it works - for me at any rate.<br />The book has flaws: some period and  dialogue inaccuracies which I won't go into - these are pretty par for the  course with many American Regencies, where US customs, vocabulary and so on  are not in keeping with the English society of the time. There are also  inconsistencies in relation to what Corey can and cannot do: in some scenes  he is able to touch and hold things (a pillow, a book, Ellen's shawl), and  in others he is not (in particular, when Ellen is in the boat in a storm,  Corey is unable to hold the oars in order to help her rowto safety). But  the story itself is well-written and interesting enough to render these  inconsistencies and inaccuracies less of a distraction than they would be  for me in a less well-written book.<br />I recommend this book; you will want  to keep and re-read it.	1998-09-09

Ripley seems to have  little idea as to characterisation, and the main characters do not ring  true to the original. And where have the supporting characters gone?<br />In  addition, as an Irish person I am both embarrassed and offended by the  appalling portrait of 19th-century Ireland.

Lord Ashe has his eye on Lissa Findlay (not Lisa), an opera dancer, and invites her to a private dinner so that he can offer her _carte blanche_. He is piqued - and appalled - to discover that she has accepted only because she is starving and has seized the opportunity to get some food for her brothers and herself.<br />His conscience pricked, Ashe arranges a job for Lissa as governess to his nephew and ward, thus providing a home for her and her brothers. This appears to be a satisfactory solution, except that Lissa's past leads members of Ashe's family to leap to other conclusions as to why he has installed her in his household. Ashe himself eventually comes to the conclusion, after (one would have thought) more than enough hints from members of the Findlay family *and* the obvious fact that Lissa is well educated, that she is not what she pretends to be.<br />Well written, amusing in many parts, and ! Dunn manages to convey in a subtle manner Ashe and Lissa's gradual falling in love. I found the ending and tidying up of loose ends somewhat abrupt, which was disappointing, but otherwise a gently enjoyable book.	1998-07-29

The premise is a little odd: Letty loves Lord Denham, so when he proposes, naturally she turns him down. There are a great many sillinesses, such as the adult and independent Denham letting his mother tell him what to do, Letty eloping with her sister's beau and Denham suddenly realising - without any indication of what brought him to that realisation - that he was in love with Letty.<br />What made the book even more disappointing is that the synopsis, as presented on this site and on the book's cover, is entirely misleading. The statement by Letty that 'I would rather be your mistress' does not form part of the book's plot at all; she only says it on the last page, by which time it is evident that the 'will-they-won't-they' is resolved.<br />Additionally, it is irritating to notice throughout the book examples of period inaccuracies; Mansfield is usually better than many American Regency! !  authors at avoiding these. Most obvious is the way in which the characters address each other; in the late 1700s it would have been completely unheard of for men and women not married to each other to address each other by their Christian names - and often unheard of even after marriage! When aristocrats wished to indicate a close friendship, they called each other by their titles or family names - so Lord Denham would have been Denham or Agneau (he is the Earl of Agneau) to his friends. But rarely would an unmarried woman friend have enjoyed such intimacy; it would have ruined her reputation. So Letty would never have called Denham 'Roger' as she did through much of the book.	1998-07-16

Olivia and her brother-in-law don't get on, though they try to tolerate each other for the sake of Clara, Olivia's sister and Miles' wife; mainly they avoid each other. Olivia is a 'bluestocking' with no understanding of Polite Society or relationships between men and women; she certainly does not understand the physical problems between Miles and Olivia which have led Miles to take a mistress. Thus her condemnation of Miles' behaviour makes it much harder, after Clara's death, for them to accept that they need each other's help and comfort. The way in which Olivia eventually helps Miles to come to an understanding with his children is, in the end, the key to their understanding of each other.<br />Elizabeth Mansfield's writing is sensitive and reflective as she pictures for her readers the coming to sexual awareness of a young woman who, even more than most in her time, has been sheltered from knowledge of male-female relationships. A number of the arguments between Olivia and Miles are very funny, although others - as they are intended - are saddening as the two of them contrive to drive each other further away by their mutual misunderstanding and pride.<br />Recommended; I certainly intend to keep and re-read my copy.	1998-07-07

The central male character is certainly no hero: he is a not-very-bright, not-very-handsome man who doesn't know how to love, so he treats women simply as sexual partners, to do only what he asks of them (which is pretty unadventurous). Prissy, on the other hand, is not a typical Regency heroine: she is, in fact, a fallen woman, a prostitute. The way in which Balogh tells the story of how the prostitute, now Gerald's mistress, falls in love with her protector and he with her is wonderfully touching. But even love isn't enough: they also have to learn to trust each other. The final resolution is heartwarming, and will bring tears to your eyes unless you're particularly hard-hearted.<br />Thoroughly recommended.	1998-07-02
