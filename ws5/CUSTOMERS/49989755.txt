It doesn't feel dated however.   <br /> <br />This book offers examples.  Before needle exchanges took place in the US, they were shown to work in Australia and other countries.  One author said drug users need to organize like the gay male community has.  At first, this sounded naive, but the author stated that it has happened in the Netherlands.  This book mentions solutions that work:  using bleach on syringes, having drug addicts teach each other about avoiding STDs, etc.  This book implies that drug addicts have learned to clean their needles, but that hasn't helped them to have safer sex.  I wish I could have learned more about cocaine generally:  how to spot a user, how to know if someone has re-started, how to encourage them to quit drug use because they may contract the virus. <br /> <br />I won't call this book homophobic, but it's a bit heterosexist.  Several authors state that, \\"cocaine users could spread HIV to their children and wives.\\"  There is little discussion of the many MSM who also use drugs.  What about the fact that they may be spreading the virus to non-drug-using male lovers?  The book never mentions that some straight-identified drug users engage in same-sex prostitution to score drugs.  Thus, though they do not identify as \\"gay,\\" they may get the virus through same-sex sexual activities.	2005-10-10
13972:US	49989755	RU0ZCAUI8YT7R	0837190347	431664987	Red over Black: Black Slavery Among the Cherokee Indians (Contributions in Afro-American and African Studies)	Books	2	9	14	N	N	Person-of-Color Unity Denied	According to Halliburton, Cherokees had black slaves and did not treat them better than white masters would have.  They discouraged interracial unions and would not allow part-black Cherokees to become tribal members.  They did not have a pronounced abolitionist movement like whites had.  They did not promote person-of-color unity; they clearly saw blacks as inferior.  Further, whereas modern whites may be ashamed of their slaveowning ancestors, modern Cherokees are not.  If the truth is the truth, I may have to let my P.C. assumptions go.  Still, there are many things that make me skeptical about this book.<br /><br />Unlike other historians who write, \\"This is the general trend and here is an example of it.\\"  Halliburton will give an example of Cherokee oppression of blacks and imply that the entire Cherokee Nation must have acted in the same way.  I've forgotten the difference between inductive logic and deductive logic, but this author seems to use the method that modern Westerners have rejected.  He brutally minimizes the impact of the Trail of Tears; you would think the Cherokees just wanted to have a fun adventure and wanted to come to census on moving, rather than being forced out by the very racist President Andrew Jackson and his administration.  He points to many wealthy, male Cherokees slaveowners; did poor or female Cherokees feel differently about slavery?  Halliburton cites numerous Cherokee laws against Cherokee-black miscegenation.  However, white states had those same laws and it didn't stop white men from fathering children with black slave women.  Why does Halliburton say nothing about sexual liaisons that must have gone on between Cherokee slaveowners and black female slaves?<br /><br />Please remember that Halliburton is a black professor.  He is writing for a black book series.  His book is written in the 1970s, during the height of the Black Power Movement.  He teaches in the Southwest.  Was his purpose to say that black are more oppressed than the many Native Americans in the region where he lives?  Was this book meant to ensure that blacks get the same or more benefits than what tribal members would receive in Southwestern colleges?  Some legal thinkers assert that it's bad to play \\"the oppression sweepstakes\\" in which group X tries to maintain that they suffered more than group Y.  Halliburton seems to not care about that concern.<br /><br />The Cherokees were known for accepting white culture much more easily than other tribes.  Couldn't having slaves be just one more example of that?  Halliburton says little on how whites encouraged Natives and blacks to distrust each other.  Maybe that is what is playing out here.  If Halliburton is correct, than why do so many African Americans (myself included) claim to have Native American blood?  Why did Katz's \\"Black Indians\\" book sell so well?  Why do people of many races want black-red unity to exist?  How is Halliburton's book helpful to modern projects to encourage black-red unity?  Who benefits from his research and absolutist descriptions?<br /><br />This book frustrates me so badly, even as I try to keep an open mind toward what the author is saying.	2005-10-06

Who knows? <br /> <br />On the one hand, lesbians have had to fight invisibility, so any focus on them can be revolutionary.  The art here is diverse in terms of style, and it even includes depictions of lesbians of color.  Whereas one can find heteroerotic and male homoerotic work throughout the centuries, this book only goes back to the late 1800s at most.   <br /> <br />Still, I think this book is meant more for hetero male titillation than for lesbians trying to learn their history.  Almost all of the art is made by men.  These women aren't just kissing; the work is very explicit.  You could only have this as a coffee table book if no children enter your living room.  This book promots male fantasy, rather than challenging what Adrienne Rich called compulsory heterosexuality.  At the time that so many lesbians, both French and non-French, were writing lesboerotic works in Paris, it's surprising that this material art is so male-identified. <br /> <br />Those who planned on reading this alongside \\"Lesbian Art in America\\" may want to think seriously about what they'll see and experience beforehand.	2005-09-29

I'm hoping this book corresponds to the Notes in a Nutsell for Felix Cohen's text.  Indian Law didn't have those highly useful cliff notes on tape.  It didn't have those cards with the questions on the front and the answers on the back either.  So I needed this Notes in a Nutshell in order to survive.  It was essential for writing an outline for the final.  Indian law is no cute little topic.  The rules that the US has used to jerk Native Americans and their tribes over are not easy to understand.  This borrowed much from difficult subjects like civil procedure and property, rather than anti-discrimination law.  If you choose to take this class, you will need this book in order to survive it.  Then again, I'm a person who hated all aspects of law school, including the subjects that sounded like they'd be interesting.	2005-09-28

However, Dr. Moon does not discuss non-Asians pretending to be Asian until one of the last chapters of the book.  This text really dealt with non-Chinese artistic responses to the Chinese and Chinese Americans and those two groups' counter response.  Most cultural studies focuses upon visual art or writings because any modern can read a book or use their eyes to analyze something.  However, and surprisingly, the focus in this book is on music.  Moon is knowledgeable about Chinese instruments and musical writing.  Music majors may be especially appreciative of this text. <br /> <br />This text must be a celebration of tenure, because I can't imagine a graduate student being able to pick up so much for a dissertation.  Further, this tenure is well-deserved:  it must have taken a lot to be a professor in Georgia and pull up so much historical evidence from San Francisco and New York City.  Sometimes the text is repetitive, but the reader can still notice that it took a lot of hard work to pull together and analyze all this material. <br /> <br />This book does not treat \\"white\\" and \\"yellow\\" exclusively; Native Americans, African-Americans, and even Eurasians are brought up.  Still, at one point Dr. Moon mentions a Black vaudevillian who take on the name Ding-a-Ling.  She totally fails to recognize the racialized phallocentricity here. <br /> <br />Dr. Moon is great at not seeing things as absolutes.  The time periods of the chapters overlap, as history actually doesn't have sharp beginnings and endings.  English Americans first dismiss Chinese music as \\"noise\\" but by comparing it to Scottish music, they recognize its musicality, at least somewhat.  Chinese music is seen as primitive by the white Americans mentioned here, yet they also use it to innovate or rejuvenate Western music.  Non-Chinese Americans deem the Chinese as perpetual foreigners, but Chinese Americans resist that label by mastering both Occidental and Oriental musical styles. <br /> <br />This book moves slowly, just like most history and academic books.  Still, it may be a great tool for ethnic studies majors and many other learners.	2005-09-28

If you read the book, you would never know which person wrote what.  However, there is so much information here, and from so many disciplines, that there is no way one person could have put all this together.  Surprisingly, this book has no endnotes.  All the references come at the end of the entire book.  bell hooks does this in order to lure in everyday readers.  I assume the authors had that same goal, but this book had far too many graphs and statistical numbers for a layperson to understand anyway.  I am not sure that the authors succeeded at trying to be both accessible and academic. <br /> <br />Sometimes, the authors do far too much summarizing, rather than analyzing.  Still, I applaud them for showing that they did their homework.  Most chapters are approximately 20 pages long, yet in the middle of the book, there is a chapter that is 50 pages long.  The book should have been divided into parts where that chapter should have come at the beginning or the end. <br /> <br />This book reveals disturbing things about homophobia and prisons.  Some incarcerated teens said they would laugh and ignore any AIDS prevention messages coming from middle-aged gay men.  In another chapter, prisoners presumed AIDS transmissions in jails comes from injecting drugs because they could not accept that men were having sex together in prison.   <br /> <br />The authors clearly have recommenations, but they come here subtly.  They want prisons to have clean needles and condoms.  Those aren't radical propositions, so they could have just come out and said it.	2005-09-27

The author analyzes what themes appear in American feature-length movies where AIDS is the main topic.  Why didn't anybody tell me that this book existed?  Why have I never heard of this author?  Why didn't anyone propose this study before?  The book cover pictures an AIDS ribbon overlapped by a roll of film.  Each film unit, with red behind it, begins to look like a ruby.  So many academic book covers are just boring, but this one was eye-capturing. <br /> <br />The Stonewall-initiated gay rights movement was not born by itself; it was heavily influenced by the anti-war movement, the feminist movement, and ideas about free love.  Similarly, Dr. Hart shows that AIDS films were not born of themselves.  He points to how melodramas and science fiction works first used the themes that AIDS films now employ. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the author wants to have his cake and eat it too.  On the one hand, he laments that AIDS films focus too much on gay men and thus will never convey to other people that they need to fight to protect themselves.  Well, since gay men composed a large percentage of those first infected in the United States, it makes sense that members of the gay community would want to document the struggle against the disease in their films.  He repeatedly states that most HIV-positive people in the world are not gay, but he is the one that limited his study to American works.  He criticizes works without gay AIDS sufferers for always mentioning gay men, the example of when young Ryan White was taunted by homophobic epithets.  However, that's why happened to the teenager:  the myth that AIDS= gay and gay = AIDS was used against him in oppressive manners.  There's no reason to look down upon the film for that reason; that's how it happened to Ryan White in his real life. <br /> <br />At times, Dr. Hart seems to hate all of these films, even the ones made for gay men, by gay men.  He seems to like films that dance around the topic of AIDS more than those thatdeal with them directly.  Though the reader can tell that Dr. Hart is HIGHLY educated, there is a way in which this book felt like a long undergraduate paper. <br /> <br />Because of the limitations of Hart's study, he fails to acknowledge the gems that he has left off of the table.  He complains that these works don't feature enough people of color.  Well, \\"Zero Patience\\" had many men of color, but it was probably excluded since it's Canadian.  He states that AIDS movies are disturbingly asexual.  Well, \\"Tongues Untied\\" was very sexual, but he excludes that because it's a documentary.  He never realizes that maybe AIDS movies just need to catch up to great things going on in other productions. <br /> <br />Dr. Hart mentions that oppressions that HIV-positive characters face in these films.  However, he never mentions the bigotry in some of these films.  Gregg Araki's \\"Living End\\" has been blasted for his misogyny.  \\"Parting Glances\\" can be read as weightist and anti-bear.  In Hart's section on AIDS-like films, he forgets the most important two films:  \\"Predator\\" and \\"Alien 3.\\"   <br /> <br />Using Hart's book as a stepping stone, a different author could write about AIDS films in the new decade.  He or she could also mention phenomena that Dr. Hart fails to discuss.	2005-09-27
43256:US	49989755	R1VOXP8Z8GB4X3	0789014416	824362659	HIV/AIDS and Children in the English Speaking Caribbean (Journal of HIV/ AIDS Prevention & Education for Adolescents & Children)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	AIDS, minors, and the islands	The title says it all: a handful of academics study AIDS and AIDS prevention regarding Anglophone Caribbean children.  This is not Jamaica-centric; several islands are covered.  The studies and statistics come in two forms:  talk of preventing mother-to-child transmission and dealing with the sexual behavior of Caribbean teens.  The studies are quite short in page length.  However, those who don't care for statistics (remember chi squares?), this book may not be your cup of tea.  Almost every chapter mentions when the first AIDS cases were found on various islands.  This book is a good starting point that probably came from a much-needed and highly successful conference. <br /> <br />This book stresses that while AIDS in the Caribbean is not as huge a problem as in sub-Saharan Africa, it is the next greatest affected world region.  Yes, Black Africa and Black America are occasionally brought up as comparisons (for example, the book states that drug use is a greater cause of AIDS' spread in Black America than in the Caribbean), but Thailand is often cited as a good model for Caribbean AIDS activists and health officials to follow.  Then again, while the book mentions that the Caribbean is not entirely black, the studies never once mention non-Black, HIV-positive Caribbeans.  These comparisons tell a lot about how a nation or region sees itself. <br /> <br />What's so saddening, but I guess unsurprising, is the stark poverty and sexism mentioned here.  If mothers can't afford milk formula, then they risk spreading HIV to their children via breast milk.  HIV-positive children die quickly if there is no one who can pay for AZT and other drugs.  Near the beginning, a male writer noted that Caribbean boys said with pride, \\"Sex is for male pleasure and female pain.\\"  Wives can't encourage their philandering husbands to wear condemns in this often macho and chauvinist culture. <br /> <br />I freely acknowledge that heterosexual sex is the main transmission method in the region.  However, this book downplays male-to-male sexual contact, to an extent.  First, it acknowledges that most HIV-positive Caribbeans are male, but then goes on to focus on women and children.  I wonder if it's somehow safer to talk about those groups under the guise that they are \\"innocent\\" AIDS carriers.  With hatemongers like Shabba Ranks and Buju Banton and the huge numbers of Caribbean gays who flee to North America and Europe to escape homophobic oppression, something should have been said about how homophobia may play a role in AIDS' spread in the island, but it never comes up here.  I'm suspicious as to why.  This is especially odd when this book is produced by a very gay-friendly press.	2005-09-20

However, here Murguia provides empirical work to illustrate the dynamics of Chicano-Anglo marriage.  This was not \\"Fools Rush In\\":  it's standard, yet rigorous sociology and statistics.  Yes, he makes predictable hypotheses:  Those in the city are more likely to outmarry; those born in the US are more likely to outmarry, those with English first names are more likely to outmarry.  Still, he uses marriage data from four Southwestern towns (varying in size, state location, and proximity to Mexico) to test his ideas. <br /> <br />This book is short in page length.  However, so much sociological data is thrown around, the reader must take her or his time reading what is stated.  Unlike other writings where the conclusions are just space filler, with this text they become essential for all of us who have forgotten the complex statistical terms we may, or may not, have learned in college classrooms or, as of now, Advance Placement courses in high school.  After awhile, I had to shorten things just to make it comprehensible.  Endogamous became \\"same-race marriage\\"; exogamous became \\"mixed marriage\\"; \\"Spanish-surnamed\\" became Chicano; and \\"non-Spanish-surnamed\\" became Anglo.  This book uses data from 1969 and 1974.  Since the book was published in 1982, I am surprised that Murguia didn't have more recent data.  Maybe this Internet age has spoiled me, however. <br /> <br />There are some things missing.  Murguia use a lot of proxy categories.  He only speaks of Anglo-Chicano mixed marriage, but what about Blacano marriages?  He mentions Catholic-Protestant mixing, but what about Jews who marry Chicanos?  He couldn't get info on the skin complexions of individuals, but I wonder if light-skinned Mexican Americans outmarry at much higher rates than Mexican Americans with more indigenous characteristics. <br /> <br />Oftentimes, authors have the same identities as their subjects.  Rachel Moran wrote on mixed marriages; she is a product of one.  Marjorie Garber wrote on bisexuality, and that is how she identifies.  The back sleeve shows that Murguia is clearly Chicano.  In this acknowledgment page, he thanks his wife, Maria Concepcion: presumably she shares his ethnicity.  Murguia basically champions mixed-race marriages, yet he seems to be a Latino man who chose a Latina bride.  I wonder why this subject interests him? <br /> <br />One thing is true: his predictions bare out.  In his study, 16% of Chicanos outmarry.  The numbers now are around 33% and growing.  Though this book feels dated at times, it is still prescient.	2005-09-16

The author recounts how a prominent civil rights figure foolishly stated, \\"No black committed suicide until integration.\\"  The supposed leader then goes on to name at least three brothers whom he knew that did kill themselves.  Head protects this person's privacy, but I wish he had named the person who could have made such a stupid comment.  That's just as ridiculous and uninformed as homophobes who say, \\"No blacks are gay.\\"  Head provides this strong anecdote to convince black men to seek therapy for depression, an illness of which he suffers himself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think the people who will pick up this book are the ones that would already agree that mental illness in the black community needs to be seriously addressed.  In that way, it's a shame that one has to read 200 pages of preaching to the choir.  For those who complain about supposed \\"race cards,\\" this book will really frustrate them.  Though the author speaks of the microaggressions that black men face consistently, neither the author himself nor the others he describes can point to one racist act that tipped them into depression.  I agree with the brother that racism is burden which negatively affects the mental health of black men, but I think many readers skeptical of that supposition will not be convinced here.<br /><br />The author says little about masculinity and rigid male gender roles.  Thus, this book applies to black women almost as much as it does to black men.  Concerns about gun violence, disproportionate prison populations, and stereotypes of the angry black man are gendered, but his discussion of racism and the need to have adequate mental health care was not.  One can only ask if he excluded women because he thought it would lure in more black male readers or if this tactic would get black wives and other female relatives to pick this up for the men in their lives.  (The author never states his wife's race; this makes me think she is white because I think he would have spelled out how his illness affected a black wife if that were his individual situation.)  Still, the end of the book does talk about how black women can convince their male loved ones to seek counseling.<br /><br />The book has deceptive chapter titles.  One of the best chapters, \\"If You're Black Go Around Back,\\" sounds like it would be another chapter on racism, but instead it spoke of imprisoned brothers and those who are homeless.  The author focuses on medicine as the cure and says little on counseling.  This is a problem:  Americans of all races and genders just want to pop a pill to cure their ills instead of seriously thinking about prevention, especially that in the long-term.  Because men, including black men, don't seek counseling enough, this was a huge, problematic missing piece of the book.<br /><br />This book speaks of (in)famous black men and their mental concerns, for example, Mike Tyson, Jayson Blair, and Dr. King.  The author said his psychotherapist was white and mentions Former First Lady R. Carter and gay Yalie Andrew Solomon in his book, so white professionals in the mental health field will probably fill very comfortable with this book and may recommend it to many others.<br /><br />Readers may want to read this alongside Ellis Cose's \\"Rage of a Privileged Class\\" or see the film \\"The Hours\\" at the same time because the depression and anger in all of these seems to come from nowhere. Though the author fails to mention it, movies such as \\"The Brothers\\" and books like E. Lynn Harris' autobiography cover black men seeking mental therapy as well.d out how his illness affected a black wife if that were his individual situation.)

There have been several books written on U.S. Latinos and their struggles against the epidemic, but this is the first I've found that dealt with Native peoples living in Latin America.  I hope that more authors produce books like this exploring different regions in the world. <br /> <br />People and cultures are so similar, yet so different.  In this study, epidemiologists fall into addressing AIDS.  The same happened with Dr. Abraham Verghese in Tennessee, as covered by his monograph \\"My Own Country.\\"  In this book, an HIV-positive nurse tried to say he got the virus from a prick in the hospital.  Another hospital worker states, \\"If that were true, you'd be the first case of that in Mexico, and people may trust nurses less because of it.\\"  The aforementioned nurse broke down and cried.  In Randy Shilts' \\"Conduct Unbecoming,\\" he stated that many HIV-infected American soldiers stationed in Germany would say they got it from a (female) prostitute, but experts noted that German prostitutes don't have a high incidence of the virus.  Thus, this book and others show, worldwide, how patients try to find any excuse they can to avoid admitting their male sexual contact as cause of their diagnosis. <br /> <br />On the other hand, this region is so different from the U.S. context.  The author states that young males kick it with each other, because the culture would not allow young females to be sexually active.  Married and other heterosexually-active men have sex with cross-dressing male prostitutes with ease.  Thus, any man can catch the virus while it has been contained, more or less, with certain groups of men in the 50 states. <br /> <br />As much as the author laments Mayans who will not be forthcoming with him, he is not forthcoming to some of them.  He tries to sanitize why his partner has AIDS, but thenwants rural people in an underdeveloped country to tell him all they business.  He does not address his white privilege and First World privilege in the slightest. <br /> <br />This book was divided into three, long chapters that did not seem to have a rhyme or reason to them.  This almost reminded me of old-timey travelogues: it felt like a LONG diary entry.  Students who just want to pull quick numbers about AIDS in the Yucatan will not be able to do so with this book.	2005-09-05

The photos of Zane with Jones don't appear until the end.  Some of the photos were clearly too old to have been clicked by Zane himself.

Every chapter sounded the same.  I am glad to learn that my suspicions were unfounded. <br /> <br />This book notes that the majority of the small work on older gay men and lesbians focuses on those between the ages of 40 and 50.  Thus, REAL gay seniors are ignored or understudied.  Many of the chapters note that those studies done on older gays tend to focus on middle-class, white men.  They actually don't do much to break this tendency, but I appreciate that they do point out this phenomenon. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, one can, at times, get lost in the regression analyses, ANOVAs, and all that technical stuff most of us have forgotten since taking statistics in college.  Still, this book does a good job of speculating on the ups and downs of gay seniors.  On the one hand, older gay men may have more stress because they don't have children to care for them and many of their friends have died from AIDS-related complications.  On the other hand, maybe older gay men and lesbians survive aging better than their heterosexual counterparts because they have faced, and hopefully conquered, homophobia.  There are many good points in this book like that. <br /> <br />I appreciated the chapter on Norway for its cross-cultural comparison.  However, Scandinavia has a long history of pro-gay and pro-feminist stances.  It wasn't a really good comparative point.  I hope some could do the same study and transplant it to South Africa, Singapore, Brazil, or somewhere that is heterogeneous and has strong homophobia. <br /> <br />Historians such as George Chauncey and John D'Emilio have worked hard to say that pre-Stonewall life was not as terrible as post-Stonewall gay generations may imagine.  However, none of that great work is cited here. <br /> <br />This book is really for psychotherapists and sociologists more than for everyday gay folk.  But I appreciate their effort.	2005-08-11

Dr. Neal asserts that the decades-old image of the \\"Strong Black Man\\" is often used to excuse misogyny and homophobia among black men.  He goes on record in detailing how black male adults use the excuse of white racism in order to get away with abusing black women, black children, and black gays and lesbians.  Thus, Dr. Neal posits that we need a \\"New Black Man\\":  one who is committed to supporting black feminism, fighting anti-gay bigotry, and providing childcare for one's biological or adopted children. <br /> <br />This book really, really, really needs to be read alongside Patricia Hill-Collins \\"Black Sexual Politics.\\"  This book is original and refreshing, but there are many ways in which it is just a man saying \\"I second!\\" to what Dr. Hill-Collins already brought up.  Both book name a lot of problems without providing many solutions, but that in no way denies that both are fierce reads.  SNAP! <br /> <br />This book would be a great introduction to black feminism for men or women.  It refers to many other texts on which progressive readers must get their hands.  But then again, I thought some texts were missing.  His ruminations on hip hop were almost exactly like the one in Rebecca Walker's \\"Daring to Be Bad\\" anthology.  He talks of black fatherhood, but never mentions Earl Ofari Hutchison who has written two books on the topic.  Still, he sometimes praises black women writers that I think are problematic.  Julianne Malveaux has written things that I think are obnoxiously homophobic.  I once saw a reading where Ntozake Shange was high and yelled out, \\"You can always a N*GGA to take you home!\\" <br /> <br />Throughout this book, Dr. Neal, a heterosexual brother, gives praise to his academic mentor Dr. Alexis De Veaux, a lesbian sister.  I loved this unity across multiple identities.  Due to \\"Will and Grace\\" and other cultural productions, it is often assumed that gay men and straight women can get along, but it's never brought up whether lesbians and straightmen can do the same thing.  This book answers that concerns; it almost reminds me of Steve Martin having lesbian friends in the film \\"L.A. Story.\\" <br /> <br />The New York Times, approximately year ago, asked, \\"What counts for a gay book now that heterosexual writers are writing compelling and non-marginal gay characters and plots?\\"  After years of writing from saints such as Audre Lorde, Essex Hemphill, Joseph Beam, Bev Smith, and many others, now black heterosexuals or blacks that do not posit their sexual identities are writing outstanding work championing gay rights.  Besides this text, books by Dr. Guy-Sheftall and Dr. Abdel-Shehid have begun a new and exciting tradition.  But to be honest, Dr. Neal spoke much more about sexism than homophobia and in no way do I feel that the straight black men that Dr. Neal critiques are somehow less homophobic than they are sexist.  In the same way that he provides a laundry list a canonical black feminist writing, he or some other progressive scholar could write an equally lengthy list of phenomenal works by black lesbians and gay men.  He gives catchy titles to all of his chapters but gives his gay chapter the borrowing, and possibly offensive title \\"Q***rs in a Barrel.\\"  He says he hopes his daughters will be able to state proudly whatever their sexual identities are, but he never says point blank, \\"I would  be just as proud of my daughters if they were lesbian or bisexual as if they were heterosexual.\\"  If Matt Groening and Barack Obama have made such statements, why hasn't Dr. Neal? <br /> <br />Dr. Neal is very humble.  He speaks of areas where he still struggles to address sexism or misogyny.  He shies away from naming himself the \\"New Black Man.\\"  Dr. Dyson once called Cornel West \\"the humblest man in the world.\\"  That moniker could apply to Dr. Neal.  His discussion on sleep apnea is important reading for heavyset brothers and other men who snore loudly at night. <br /> <br />Like Dr. Valdivia in \\"A Latina in Hollywood,\\" this had a gushy chapter on parenting to which I couldn't relate.  But if Cornel West and many others have written parenting books, it must be an important concern for many individuals out there.   <br /> <br />This is a quick read.  It may almost remind one of a series of magazine essays, rather than academic work.  Many black folk without elite educations should be able to follow it. <br /> <br />This was very strong and refreshing cultural studies.  I am definitely adding this book to my \\"Profeminist Men\\" amazon list.	2005-08-08

I can deal with Jarman:  independent film has to cut corners and period pieces usually have large budgets.  Here, however, it doesn't work.  There are authors that do an amazing job of bringing the past to live, think \\"Beloved\\" or \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\"  Reed fails at his task of re-vivifying this controversial Roman emperor.    Much of what modern people know about Heliogabalus is lies, made by homophobes across the centuries.  However, Reed tries to portray Heliogabalus as a cruisy, promiscuous, cottaging, flamboyant, size-queeny gay man and it just does not go far enough.  What we do know about Heliogabalus is that he may have represented more than that.    I am not quite sure why Heliogabalus is portrayed as a gender-typical gay man, rather than a transvestite or transsexual.  The historic record suggests that he wanted a sex change and to be castrated.  He proclaimed his lover his husband, but in this book, he and Hierocles are barely more than casual sex partners.  His manservant was a green-eyed Ethiopian, but the author never tells us how that happened.  Most Ethiopians are Black, with black hair and dark brown eyes like my own (an African American).    The historical story and the modern tale just don't match up.  Just like all the interludes in James Earl Hardy's second book, Reed's modern, added story suggests that his historical story is just admittedly too thin.  It is clear that the modern Masako represents Heliogabalus' many wives and touches upon why gay men would become emotionally involved with women.  However, who is Slut supposed to be?  How is Hierocles like the boyfriend that the main character leaves?  In this book, a dissertation adviser tells a character, \\"You can use fiction to recreate Heliogabalus' life, but not psychology.\\"  Now how many history Ph.D.s would suggest something like that!?    This book is filled with anachronisms.  In ancient Rome, words are used like \\"modems,\\" \\"venture capital,\\" and \\"spermatozoa\\" (humans didn't know that existed until the invention of the microscope.  Reed goes ever further to suggest that Ancient Romans faced AIDS and amy nitrate.  This wasn't creative; it just seemed like the author wasn't doing his homework.    This book is short and the pages could fly by.  However, it took me FOREVER to read it.  It is just not that good.  I still wish I knew more about the real Heliogabalus.	2005-08-05
137958:US	49989755	R8ZMOILIABXSU	1551302616	58823946	Who da' Man ?: Black Masculinities and Sporting Cultures	Books	2	2	3	N	Y	Watch Out!: Hardcore, Pessimistic Hyperbabble!	Don't let the vernacular/ebonicized title fool you:  this is a hyperacademic text that I doubt few sports fans, whether in Canada or the United States, will understand.  The author attempts to analyze how sports relates or fails to relate to topics such as race, masculinity, and nation.  Yes, this is an intelligent and thoughtful book by a man who I hope goes far in his career.  Still, it frustrated me in many ways.    Though the author says he is a fan of X and Y sport, you wouldn't think it from his analysis.  Whether it's basketball, football, track, he doesn't have anything good to say about the state of Canadian athletics or the few blacks involved in them.  For this author, the glass is definitely half empty, if not entirely empty.  Near the beginning, he questions whether professional sports is labor or art, but he never asks about pleasure.  Though football players have been given statistics that say they do not live as long as non-football players, most of them say they would not have changed professions regardless.  The joy of playing and watching sports never comes up at all in this book.  You would have thought a sports-hater like me wrote it, not someone who claims to be a fan.    The author always puts \\"race\\" in quotes.  It may have been profound when Skip Gates did that while editing a book years ago, it is not now.  Gates has already been criticized for it.  Acknowledging that race means little biologically shouldn't erase the fact that it means a lot sociologically and historically, the fields which this author ponders.  Race is no more \\"socially constructed\\" than any other terms.  \\"Masculinities\\" never gets put in quotes but those are topics that are highly malleable, nebulous, and significantly debated.  If the author is so uncomfortable with race, why is he so clearly writing in the field of Africana studies?    The author shows that he is well-read, quoting from diverse sources such as Judith Butler, Michael Dyson, C.L.R. James, etc.  However, Iam quite surprised that men's' studies icons such as Michael Messner, Robert Staples, Devon Carbado, or R.W. Connell never come up.  The author tries to avoid either-or thinking and logic.  However, just bringing up X and negative X doesn't make the discussion penetrable.  In fact, the author throws around all kinds of made-up terms like \\"good boy feminism,\\" \\"buggin' out militancy\\" etc.  that only add to this book being gobbledygook.  He wants to have his cake and eat it too, and somehow the author thinks that means he is saying something profound.    I applaud the author tremendously for showing that when many people say \\"black athlete,\\" what they mean is \\"straight, male, black athlete.\\"  He does a great job in trying to connect the dots between race, gender, and sexuality.  However, it may frustrate many that he leaves class off the table.  He does condemn some practices as \\"bourgeois,\\" but that's about it.  In a continent where many wrongfully think \\"Everybody is middle-class!\\" that is a problem.  Further, Messner and Kimmel have written extensively that class and dreams of upward mobility define boys' entry into sports.  The author uses the term \\"queer\\" a lot even though a study was done of GLBT Black Americans that adamantly showed that they do not like that term.    The author criticized writers for focusing too much on the US and not enough on Canada, but every other example that he brings up is from the United States too.  This author needs to realize that there are more Black Americans (approximately 36 million) than there are Canadian citizens regardless of race (approximately 30 million).  The author goes on and on about how black athletes are seen as not of the nation, of questionable citizenship.  However, in the US, no one questions that Black Americans are American.  It's rare for any person post-Marcus Garvey to say blacks should return to Africa.  Blacks have lived in the United States since 1619, longer than most white citizens.  Thus, maybe blackAmerican writers don't bring up black Canadians because the two groups are apples and oranges.  The author wants to place black Canadian athletes in the spotlight, but he can't do it without mentioning black American athletes about five time beforehand.    This is one of the few academic books that I've read which does not have a conclusory chapter.  Then again, his body chapters usually have conclusion.  Also, he has two introductory chapters when most professors just have one.  The book is riddled with pop-up boxes.  They discuss themes that anyone well-read enough to read the primary text would already know about.  They were highly unnecessary.	2005-08-01

Who says the academic discipline known as \\"queer theory\\" can't be applied to non-English literatures?  Here McKee Irwin uses a sprinkle of Foucault, Butler, Sedgwick, and Michael Kimmel to discuss masculinity in Mexican literature.  His biggest contention is that although others have theorized that the interracial heterosexual dyad or the cross-class dyad is the most striking feature of the Mexican literary canon, one very important dyad in this genre is that between men, especially sexual dynamics between men.  He finds a way to discuss the masculine, the \\"effeminate,\\" and other gendered and sexualized contours of this literary history. <br /> <br />This book, at times, tries to have its cake and eat it too.  On the one hand, he says that Mexican homophobia has been rampant and writers could not talk of homosexuality openly.  On the other hand, he says the nation didn't really become anti-gay until the \\"Famous 41\\" incident.  When examining text, he states that contemporary readers would never have thought of certain features of a book as homoerotic, then he goes on to list all the ways these books are homoerotic. <br /> <br />It is interesting that this author posits that Octavio Paz was heterosexual whereas Ilan Stavans, a straight Hispanicist, suggested that Paz was bisexual or gay. <br /> <br />Gender and sexuality are heavily intertwined, obviously.  However, homophobic readers may not like how gay-focused this is.  In fact, gay readers, and especially gay readers of Hispanic literature, may also be misled by the title.  Perhaps McKee Irwin should have called this \\"Mexican Male Sexualities\\" or \\"Mexican Male Homosexualities.\\"  This would not get confused with Stephen Murray's \\"Latin American Male Homosexualities.\\" <br /> <br />This book is intended for serious literary critics or comparative literature majors.  This is not a book you can just hand to someone who's interested in Mexican men generally.  Additionally, McKee Irwin covers Mexico proper.  There is nosuggestion here that Mexican and Mexican-American canons are one in the same.	2005-07-18

Warren Goulding reports, and partially analyzes, the serial killer Michael Crawford, and his numerous Native, female victims.  He contends that Canadians' ignorance of and indifference to this tragedy is a sign of racism. <br /> <br />This book will make one think deeply about voices from the bottom.  This book states that young, Native women from broken homes and who sometimes prostituted themselves are basically ignored by their nation when they are savagely murdered by a white man.  The killer had killed before, yet he was given a light sentence.  The lack of media coverage meant that residents of that Canadian state and First Nations people couldn't protect themselves and be on the lookout.  The killer sought Native prostitutes because white prostitutes may have been undercover policewomen and the police rarely hired Native women.  The slowness with which the Mounties sought this man may have led to more deaths and abuse of Native women. <br /> <br />This book sheds a bleek light on Canada.  In Michael Moore's documentary, he portrays Canada as peaceful and racially harmonious.  Books by Canadian authors such as David Murray or Daniel Coleman have suggested that racism exists up North.  However, this book suggests that horrendous crimes do too and that racism is systematic just as in the United States.  I am a bit worried that my fellow Americans will read this text and say, \\"Now see!  That's why having capital punishment is good for the United States!\\" <br /> <br />The author does a great job in tying race, class, and geography together in this book.  However, he woefully left misogyny out of the picture.  In his last chapter, he noted that Canadian, white, middle-class, female murder victims got the attention of the press, but these low-income, Native women did not.  Of course, it's racism.  However, the white victims were deemed \\"virtuous women\\"  following acceptable female scripts, whereas Crawford's victims did not.  Plus, Crawford's male sex and his victim's status as women is a sign of woman-hating at its worse.  Goulding suggests things may have been different if Canada had more Native journalists.  Still, this book proves that Canada needs more Native police and he says little about that scarcity. <br /> <br />Goulding's chapters started off non-linearly.  He describes the controversy and then goes into flashback.  After awhile, the chapter titles give the chapters away.  Each chapter has a quote from someone later cited and it's very unnecessary, but perhaps a sign that the author is a journalist and many articles do that.  The book has a boring cover.  It's funny that \\"just\\" is in red, rather than \\"Indian\\" as colonists referred to themselves as \\"white\\" and Natives as \\"red.\\"  A more striking cover would surely have attracted more readers.  The court narrative is highly boring.  Reading page after page of \\"the lawyer asked X and the person on the stand said Y.\\" was mind-numbing. <br /> <br />I am not very familiar with the true crime format, but I am sure this book is as good as any other example in the genre.  This was an enlightening, though often simplistic, work.	2005-07-18

It is definitely for essay lovers and the fans of columnists.  The flavor of the writing reminds me a lot of Clarence Page, Gore Vidal, or Richard Rodriguez. <br /> <br />The book has a universal tone to which black males and non-black males could relate.  This is not a militant discourse; conservatives won't be able to cry out \\"P.C.!\\"  Some authors recall when they acted criminally.  Others say anti-social tendencies start at home.  This book is filled with everyday men asking how controversies in the news affect their lives.  The specific one here is the Diallo murder and the subsequent police acquittal, but it could have been any other matter. <br /> <br />This book is subtly gay-friendly.  The first essay mentions homophobia as an ill hurting the black community.  The next essay is penned by a famous, gay African-American author.  The third essay is by the editor who quotes from James Baldwin and Countee Cullen. <br /> <br />This essay has diverse contributors, featuring journalists, lawyers, and police officers.  However, most of the essays sound alike.  I am not sure if the editor made all essays sound like his or only chose essays written in his style.  Unfortunately, this get repetitive after awhile.  There becomes no need to read the whole book. <br /> <br />People may want to read this book alongside the books \\"Envy of the World\\" or \\"Living to Tell About It.\\"	2005-07-18

Well, here, Professor Creese using history shows how unions are also gendered (as well as racialized and stratified by class).  Though union leaders say they fight for all workers, they really put the interests of the white, male worker with a family at home first.  False consciousness is again shown to be a Marxist delusion:  unions are very much interested in separating and differentiating between \\"us\\" versus \\"them.\\" <br /> <br />Like the grand majority of academic texts, the introduction here differs noticeably from the body chapters.  Oftentimes, introductions are so complex and impenetrable that they are there merely to impressive tenure committees or dissertation panels, making lay readers afraid to continue reading the book.  Other times, the introduction summarizes things so well that the body chapters are mere illustrations of a point that has already been well made.  (Though highly praised, Eve Sedgwick's \\"The Epistemology of the Closet\\" is a classic example of this.)  This book acts in the latter fashion.  The introduction uses sociology and statistics to make a clear illustration about inequality in the workplace; the body chapters are merely a history of a Canadian utilities company proving that point.  Thus, there is no need to read beyond the first fraction of the book, unless are you hardcore into Canadian union activism, or union busting, actually. <br /> <br />So much of what this book says is true, but it's still frustrating.  Women are pushed into low wage, dead-end positions.  People of color, on average, never earn as much as their white counterparts.  White, older, men get opportunities through their seniority but other workers are told they must come through the door already (over?)qualified.  Women, and assumably people of color, have to take cases to administrative courts just to get what is due to them.  This book will definitely put you in a bad mood if you are not already in one when you first pick it up. <br /> <br />If this book had not mentioned race, I would have condemned it for its lack.  However, the text is imbalanced, possibly even with the best of intentions.  This book deals heavily with biological sex, race is merely an afterthought, or an additional comment.  But Canada does not have as many people of color as the United States.  It does not have the stark and tragic history of slavery, genocide, and immigration exclusion.  Thus, people of color are not in the picture here as much just given the historical background of that country.  The author spells out myriad ways in which male supremacy is drenched in the workplace, but one would almost think the superior positions of white men in this union were mere happenstance. <br /> <br />This book reveals something profound about the Canadian identity.  When Professor Cleese cannot find Canadian studies to back her facts, she first uses numbers from the United States, and then from either the United Kingdom or Australia.  This proves its strong attachment to (Anglo-) North America and the (predominantly white) English-speaking world. <br /> <br />This book is small in size.  However, its print is equally small.  This will not be a quick and easy read for most readers.	2005-07-06

Owen Dodson was a black, gay playwright and poet.  He went to Yale's drama school and directed Howard's theater department for a spell.  Unfortunately, alcohol destroyed his powers, but he outlives most of the people mentioned in this book, nevertheless. <br /> <br />Gay historian John D'Emilio has written that biographies of famous gay men too often focus on the subject's sexuality at the expense of other phenomena, the exact things that probably made the person famous.  This book never suggests that Dodson directed explicitly homoerotic plays, so the de-gaying in this book is somewhat understandable.  However, as a reader, I got very bored with page upon page of \\"He directed this play and then that one.\\", \\"He hated X play and loved Y play.\\"  Yawn!  However, his struggles inside Howard University and the school's 180-degree turnaround on Afrocentricity was interesting.  All students and professors at Black colleges should peep this book for that reason alone.   <br /> <br />This book includes an absolutely fascinating chapter on the interaction between James Baldwin and Owen Dodson, \\"The Amen Corner.\\"  I'm not saying that Baldwin is \\"all that,\\" but he is the undisputed king of well-known black, gay men.  Thus, this chapter was exciting and had me glued to every word.  That chapter flew by in ways that the majority of the chapters just dragged. <br /> <br />So the book always acknowledges that Dodson was gay but gives close to no details about it.  Then, deep in the book, the author implies that Dodson was almost asexual and interviews one acquaintance as saying, \\"Dodson was a poor lover.\\"  Well, what does that mean?  Was he possessive?  Not good au lit?  Not hooked-up downstairs?  Too closeted?  Too demanding?  The author never explains and it is frustrating to the nth degree. <br /> <br />Dodson associated with a ton of famous black gays (Baldwin supra, Alain Locke, Countee Cullen) and even white gays (W.H. Auden, Carl Van Vechten, John Gielgud).  Of course, having lots of gay friends doesn't mean one has a great romantic life.  (Don't I know!)  Still, it makes no sense that he associated with all these fellow gay males and yet the author only quotes from heterosexuals answering whether they knew if he was gay or not and how did they feel about it. There was just too much straight speculation here on an openly gay man.  The book intimates that he had at least two male lovers in his life, yet it emphasizes his failed heterosexual relationships and almost says nothing on his gay ones. <br /> <br />There is sooo much left out of here.  Did he go to gay clubs and bars?  Did his family accept his gayness wholly or with strings attached?  Did the Howard University administration have a problem with it?  Did his students?  Did stereotypes of gay men in the theater protect him?  Did he face racism from gay whites?  Did he face homophobia from straight blacks?  He was in the military.  Did they consider booting him due to being gay?  Did being black make them ignore that question under racist ideas that black men can't be gay?  Did he prefer New York's gay cliques to Washington D.C.'s or the reverse?  He directed Hamlet often.  Did he think Shakespeare was gay, as many now hypothesize?  None of this comes up and it should have! <br /> <br />I am almost not surprised that Arnold Rampersad wrote the foreword for this book.  His biographies of Langston Hughes have been sharply criticized for downplaying that black poet's homosexuality too.	2005-07-05

In Robert Aldrich's amazing book \\"Colonialism and Homosexuality,\\" he discusses how a HUGE number of white men did not express their gay desires until they were out of the eyes of other whites and around men of color outside of the First World.  There are not enough works out there about gay men who lived gay lives before the Stonewall Riots or the Wolfenden Report.  Outside of that valid fact, this book was some fetishy mess. <br /> <br />Johnson O'Toole is a white man (he would say \\"British expat\\") who was born in India, spent a bit of time in London and lots of time in West Africa.  He is a gay man who has lots of hot sex everywhere he goes, most often on a one-time basis.  To his credit, there are many people, of various sexualities, that LOVE being abroad.  They would take a ticket to anywhere and learn any foreign language you dare them to comprehend.  Also, John D'Emilio has critiqued gay biographies that emphasize gay life over the other phenomena that probably made the man famous in the first place.  So O'Toole likes to travel; he talks about his jobs and his pets as much as all the hot sex with men of color.  Still, his pursuit of any male not of European ancestry is, again, just some fetishy mess. <br /> <br />Somehow O'Toole knows of current terms like \\"political correctness,\\" which he condemns, but this book is dangerously and annoyingly apolitical.  He has all kinds of sex with males of color who probably wouldn't identify as gay.  He never questions whether his whiteness provides him with access to all these sex partners.  He knows the term \\"PC\\" but not \\"white privilege.\\"  When his straight male peers pay female prostitutes of color, he participates as well.  He complains of how he dislikes heterosexual sex, but never once notes that he exploits female bodies of color in order not to out himself.  Again, he has heard of \\"PC,\\" but has never heard of Adrienne Rich's term \\"compulsory heterosexuality.\\"  He never once condemns colonizers for telling non-whites to embrace Christianity while they hire prostitutes at the drop of a dime.  Though the author is not that much older than his sexual partners, he almost always refers to them as \\"boys.\\"  He even once calls Nigerians \\"black b*st*rds.\\"  Ol' racist!  Even if he is gay. <br /> <br />So he is forced to have heterosexual sex.  He is kicked out of the army for making a pass at a man, but he never once uses the term \\"homophobia.\\"  He does not try to make friends with other (white) men suspected of being gay.  He is just infatuated with darker-complected \\"trade.\\"  He never once, even in hindsight, tries to look at his forced choices under the political vacuum in which they exist. <br /> <br />One cultural critic said Schwarzennegger's name says black twice.  Another cultural critic said filmmaker John Waters' name says \\"Number One\\" twice.  Well, the name Johnson O'Toole is obviously a false name, but definitely doubly phallic.  He never once explains why a person born in the early 20th century would have a yuppie first name.  He states that his is of English descent, not Irish, so why is his last name O'Toole?  How are you going to write under a pen name and then have photographs from your life in between the pages? <br /> <br />This book is only meant for men with ethnic fetishes.  It is superficial and written in a painfully small script.  It is just a stroke book posing as a serious autobiography. <br /> <br />I love independent presses.  They have served a crucial lifeline to gay male and lesbians writers.  Still, the drawing in crayola color pencils on the front cover and the spelling errors on the back cover and throughout the book does not help the author's cause.	2005-07-05

Like her minoritizing/universalizing schema, he invents an equation for defining AIDS performances.  He then goes on to describe seven aspects of this artistic contributing.  Like Professor Sedgwick, he uses huge words and it would benefit the reader to have a dictionary near him or her as they read.  Also, the two academics are dedicated to acknowledging and celebrating the works of gay artists. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, like Sedgwick, you don't have to read beyond Gere's introductory chapters to get the point.  The rest of the book is just lots of description.  I highly doubt that professors will assign the whole book, rather than just the first part of it, to students.  Only those who want to use the books for specific examples would benefit from reading the whole thing.  Additionally, some of the details are gross (drinking shakes made of junk, spilling liquids meant to represents distasteful bodily fluids, etc.)  The book covers cutting-edge dancers, and believe me, they succeed at shocking their audiences (or at least this reader). <br /> <br />Professor Gere is not only an academic describing performances after the fact, he was also a journalist who was covering AIDS and the dance community's response to it from the beginning.  He must be exciting in the classroom given the multiple hats he wears as academic, journalist, and activist. <br /> <br />AIDS has wreaked havoc upon gay males and many professional dancers.  Thus, of course, they would respond to the epidemic in their art.  I am glad that a person in the academy has recorded and is responding to this urgent work and action.	2005-06-24
198287:US	49989755	R1ZIOKTV03YTB5	0375421750	705358792	The Secret Epidemic: The Story of AIDS and Black America	Books	4	5	7	N	N	GBMs rendered invisible AGAIN!	This is a fantastic book but I am worried that it renders black gay men invisible once again. <br /> <br />According to the CDC's own statistics, the number one transmission for AIDS in black America is through unprotected sex between men.  Still, Levenson focuses on the stories of (straight) black female PWAs rather than gay black male PWAs.  He goes into detail about white gay organizations fighting with black (probably straight) organizations over funding.  Never once does he describe which type of non-profit would be mostly likely to effectively assist gay black men.  Levenson intimates that white gay men contract AIDS mostly through gay sex, but black Americans contract it mostly through drug use.  Again, this is not true:  statisticians have proven this fact again and again.  The author shows his deep empathy for the struggles of HIV-positive, rural, black women, but he says nothing on HIV-positive, rural, black, gay men.  Levenson, even unpurposely, implies that, \\"All the gays are white and all the blacks are straight.\\"  Black gay men are tokenized here and this book tacitly continues the fallacy that a person can only belong to one oppressed group. <br /> <br />In his defense, I wonder if Levenson takes the spotlight off of gay black men because this group has already spoken about their struggles with HIV so effectively.  (Examples include \\"Tongues Untied,\\" \\"Brother to Brother,\\" Essex Hemphill's essays, E. Lynn Harris' first novels, etc.)  J.L. King brought national attention to black men \\"on the down low.\\"  However, black gay leader Keith Boykin has attacked King's presentation as flawed and dangerous.  So maybe Levenson didn't \\"even want to go there.\\"  Levenson has lived in New York City and the Bay Area; he cannot possibly say he could not get contact with HIV-positive black gay men to tell their stories. <br /> <br />I wonder if Levenson felt that not enough has been written on black women and AIDS and thus he wanted to carve his own niche.  Black womendo have higher rates of education and work in the social services at higher rates than black men.  Thus, perhaps he focused on women because they will be more likely to read and spread the word on his text.  Like everyone, I am concerned how HIV transmission keeps jumping among black women.  Still, the reality is that the majority of HIV-positive blacks in the United States are male.  In fact, no HIV-positive, straight, black man is covered in this book. <br /> <br />This book is highly readable.  Levenson takes scientific jargon and public policy squabbles and makes them comprehensible to the average person.  His style must be highly influenced by Randy Shilts.  Though I love me some Keith Boykin, his \\"Beyond the Down Low\\" took forever to read whereas Levenson's book is an undifficult page turner.  His mastery of journalism, narrative, and academic research shines through as he blends these genres together wonderfully.  For those who love hearing conspiracies theories aimed against black America, this book is full of such ideas! <br /> <br />Like Shilts' \\"And the Band Played On,\\" Levenson discusses the battles that take place behind closed doors.  While Shilts covered the non-racialized (read:  white) aspects of AIDS, here, Levenson spells out how activists and some scientists have from the beginnings asked, \\"And what about people of color?!\\"  Levenson is considerate and fair-minded when covering sides of debates.  For example, he makes it understandable why San Franciscans wanted to horde funds when the numbers showed that AIDS was spreading nationally.  He makes Congressional Black Caucus members sound sincere, even as others have condemned them for being slow to take action.  I actually do think he gave scant attention to the failure in black churches and black national organizations,  But again, maybe he felt that Cathy Cohen had already covered that angle well in \\"The Boundaries of Blackness.\\" <br /> <br />Though Magic Johnson is mentioned once, there is muchabout blacks and AIDS that I felt he left out.  He says little about AIDS' origins in Africa.  He says nothing about Gaetan Duclas' (aka \\"Patient Zero\\") contacting AIDS while having sex in Africa.  He never mentions Haitians.  He says nothing about the AIDS-related death of the supposedly heterosexual black newscaster Max Robinson.  This was not a chronology of Black American AIDS; it was more a series of controversial matters and real-life narratives on this topic.   <br /> <br />The book says little about current arguments over the slicing of the AIDS pie.  For example, has AIDS in Africa overshadowed Black American AIDS?  Have new statistics stating that young gay men are not protecting themselves made AIDS seem more related to gays again?  This is not a comprehensive book, but it is provocative and does shed light on important matters.  All public policy majors and workers in public health departments should read this book. <br /> <br />I loved this book despite its major flaw.	2005-06-20

It often feels worlds away, as opposed to half a world away.  Still, the author's main result is to show that NZ's gay community has fractures just like any others.  He quotes leaders and everyday gays who ask:  Will images of gay men be seen as too sexual to the straight mainstream?  Do AIDS benefits truly help those in need?  Why are advertisers reluctant to advertise in our magazines?  Etc.  The author states that gay sex was a crime until the late 1980s to the early 1990s.  Then, it seems like the nation has become resolutely gay-friendly.  This differs so vastly from the United States where gay rights struggles have been long, difficult, and most crucially, not finished. <br /> <br />I love that the cover of the book shows both Polynesian and Caucasian men.  However, this book is disproportionately representative as whites, in a country that presents itself as biracial.  I thought much more could have been said about gay Maoris.  In fact, straight Maoris were brought up more than their gay peers.  The title \\"Emergent Tribe\\" hints that gays are a tight group like Maoris.  The author quotes straight whites as saying, \\"We wish we had cliques too.\\"  Yes, gay communities can seem tight-knit like communities of color.  However, I am confident that gay people of color would have a critique of facile equations and assumptions that all community members get along.  This book is heavily deficient based on its scant Maori coverage. <br /> <br />As a corollary, the \\"gay\\" in the title of this book truly does signify \\"gay male.\\"  When discussing gay and lesbian access to the media, the arts, politics, etc., the author never suggests that lesbians have a different or lesser stake than gay men.  A book that looks at masculinity at the same time that it approaches homosexuality is fine, so long as it is conscious of it.  This author is not.  The lesbian erasure may frustrate many readers and turn off other potential readers.  Still, it also opensa door for a lesbian-specific book on New Zealand to be written.	2005-06-13

Through his monographs, Stephen Murray has done a lot to cover same-sex love between men outside of the West.  Finally, this anthology is an attempt to cover non-Western lesbian and transgendered women. <br /> <br />Many books have said female bisexuals have tensions with monosexual lesbians.  (Examples include \\"Bi Any Other Name,\\" \\"Closer to Home,\\" and \\"Bisexual Politics.\\")  Halberstam has said that female-to-male transsexuals and butch lesbians have also had tensions.  In this anthology, the writers discuss lesbians, bisexual women, and transgendered women equally.  In fact, the lines between these identities get blurred.  This book is diverse covering Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  (Nothing is written on Arab lesbians, however.)  The contributors are all Western-educated; still, some are white and some are of color. <br /> <br />Unlike work on non-Western gay men, which often never says anything about non-Western lesbians, this often must mention the situation of gay men before it can describe their female counterparts.  One contributor said she is a bisexual sex worker.  I wish her good luck trying to find a professor's job after admitting that fact.   <br /> <br />The articles range in quality.  The chapters on mati in South America and female m-ah-u in the South Pacific were fantastic.  Though Thadani is a well-respected expert on lesbian South Asia, I thought her chapter was boring and unnecessary.  There is a large focus on Southeastern Asian islands.  Since few American immigrants come from those nations, I am not sure if this book will be less compelling to many readers. <br /> <br />I hate the cover of the book.  I think it's meant to be a photo of able-bodied and disabled women, with a primitive artistic twist.  It's ugly: they could have shown a photograph of a committed female couple of color (whether heterogenderal or homogenderal) to get their point across more effectively.  This book is incredibly academic.  I am not sure if the average lesbian or FTM would be able to comprehend it.  Still, I think it is a book that every lesbian or FTM of color should own.  I thank the editors for their efforts and vision.	2005-05-31

It's hodgepodge: half autobiography/half manifesto.  It reminds me of much output by ACT-UP and Q Nation members.  (I guess it's called Outrage! in Britain.)  Because the West has become less AIDS-phobic and gay-friendly, this book may feel incredibly dated.  Because it is true to life, parts may make you uncomfortable.  For example, Jarmen retells how he rejected a man once and I felt soooo bad for the guy.  This book also mentions public lice, black and white female impersonators fighting and other stuff.  This is not easy reading.  Still, for those who love Paul Monette, Tony Kushner, Robert Ferro, or their kind, this will be a book that you may want to have or read.	2005-05-23

Campo has created a poetic autobiography which describes his life as a gay, Latino doctor and poet. This book exemplifies that a person can be proud of being both a person of color and gay. In addition, we can be artists, healers, and so much more. Though not as effective as Gloria Anzaldua's work, Campo still demonstrates the wonders of inhabiting multiple identities and spaces. At times, he leaves his class-privilege unexamined. Some portions are repetitive. Nevertheless, I feel fortunate that I found and read this series of essays.  Knowing that a gay man of color can strive in a demanding field despite bigotry, can perform well at prestigious universities, and can have a long-term partner is quite inspirational for me.	2005-05-22

For those of us who have been starving since finishing Mercer's 'Welcome to the Jungle' or Fusco's 'English Is Broken Here', this is an excellent book to add to your reading list. Through complex theory and deep analysis, Munoz effectively articulates what many of us know but have difficulty proving to others: lesbian and gay artists of color are producing some of the nation's and the world's most revolutionary and counterhegemonic work. I am especially impressed that he examines work by Black, Latino, and Asian gays. This is a much-needed book for anyone who would like to see people of color come together in coalition. You will be impressed with Munoz's creation. This is not Hemphill's 'Brother to Brother' or Moraga's 'This Bridge Called My Back.' Some readers will be put off by the semiotic language Munoz uses. However, for those who can get through it, you will enjoy this book.	2005-05-22

Turns out, there was a waiting list for it that kept me in line for 4 months.  Unfortunately, it was not worth the wait. <br /> <br />The chapters in this text will make you want to salivate.  They are diverse topics on this matter.  I thought I was in for something great. <br /> <br />I was let down.  This book is for hardcore employment market experts, not everyday readers.  There are so many regression analyses and ANOVA charts, what little of college statistics that I remember could not help me out.  The book jumps from comparing women of color to the general workforce, white women, and men of color that it is easy to get lost. <br /> <br />The book has far more chapters about Black women than Latinas.  They should have named it \\"African-American Women and Latinas at Work\\" as opposed to the other way around.  Still, in discussing Latinas, they have one chapter on Puerto Rican women and another on Chicanas.  Thus, they were trying to be cognizant of Latina diversity. <br /> <br />I am not saying, \\"Don't pick up this book!\\"  I'm just saying I found it far less inspiring that I had hoped.	2005-05-21

Fortunately, I was surprised on both fronts. Cohen is an African-American woman (she never explains how she got the last name Cohen) and does try to be mindful of being 'another black academic out to trash black folks' (xi). In addition, she provides a poli. sci. framework in which to look at how African-Americans prioritized or failed to prioritize AIDS that I think could be used to analyze numerous other issues. Cohen investigates black people's response to AIDS through medicine, the press, religious organization, and the Congress from 1981 to 1993. The book is not perfect. Chapters are completely misnamed. (One chapter about the 'dreaded bisexual' only discussed bisexual men for a page at most.) She at times is overly critical of black institutions. (She often states that the black press never covered HIV+ black gay men or HIV+ women activists and I can think of numerous articles in the magazines she examines which actually did what she wanted.) Nevertheless, this was an incredible book. I encourage everyone to purchase it, especially those interested in black gay issues or African-American studies.	2005-05-20

Thus, while it may feel dated, so much of what it says is timely.  Masculinity is in flux still, but some powerful authors here note that people have made that claim for decades. <br /> <br />This book covers a range of topics, including working fathers, former athletes, women in male-dominated work environments, erectile dysfunction, etc.  Because of the potpourri here, some articles are good and some are rather poor.  It is repeatedly stated in this book that men's studies could not have come into existence without the pioneering lead of women's studies.  This book  corroborates that in its chapters.  By interviewing women about husbands and male co-workers, we learn more about the male sex.  This book and its chapters are very yin-yang. <br /> <br />All of the men's studies pioneer's are here (Kimmel, Messner, Brod, and Pleck).  Structurally, this book reminds me a lot of \\"Men's Lives\\" (which is in its sixth edition, at latest count) and \\"A Mensch Among Men.\\"  Depending on which came first, second, or third, this anthology was either the influence for those books or imitates them significantly. <br /> <br />The good chapters were examples of great sociology.  The book is not only pro-feminist, but gay-friendly as well.  Some chapters appear in other books, but they might have been printed here first.	2005-05-16

They want to continue George Chauncey's assertion that pre-Stonewall life was not terrible across the board.  They have two further projects.  First, the contributors want to show that gay and lesbian culture existed and flourished outside of just NYC and CA.  Additionally, they want to show that the intersections of race, class, and gender played a powerful role in setting the parameters for this historic gay life. <br /> <br />This book is well-written.  I felt more and more empowered as a gay person as I finished each chapter.  Though no author quotes Michel Foucault here (as most gay and lesbian studies authors do), his idea that powerlessness is never absolute plays itself out here.  This book documents gay and lesbian craftiness.  If you want to make private gay space at a time when homosexuality is illegal, place straight patrons at the front of clubs and gay patrons at the back.  Hire door managers and bartenders that have no problems excluding or kicking out homophobes.  If you can't have openly gay dancing, let customers know about private after-parties where such dancing will be allowed.  If you can't be openly gay at home, split an apartment with other gay guys where you all agree that you can bring guys for action.   <br /> <br />As necessary and idealistic as Beemyn's goals are, this book fails to meet those goals in several ways.  This book starts by saying, \\"We need to go beyond canonical gay historians like Chauncey, Newton, and Davis/Kennedy.\\"  However, all those authors have chapters in this book.  Further, other authors quote from their famous books consistently.  It is surprising that John D'Emilio does not have a contribution here.  However, he was working on Bayard Rustin's autobiography at the time. <br /> <br />The chapters move beyond NYC and SF.  As a Chicagoan and a person who knows about Illinois' strong history in gay rights, I was pleased to see two chapters about my hometown.  Still, though Beemyn asserts that gay men and lesbians live everywhere, the action in these chapters usually point to big cities.  Maybe all gay people do not move to NYC and SF.  However, if they move to Chicago, Detroit, Philly, and Washington, D.C., they are finding the next best things.  Chauncey's and D'Emilio's ideas about seeking more gays and more anonymity still ring true. <br /> <br />This book has more information on gay men than on lesbians.  However, lesbians are represented, admirably.  There are also wonderful coverage of black gay men and lesbians.  Beemyn states that race, class, and gender cannot be dropped from  this analysis.  Still, I wish he would point out that many advocates of \\"race, class, and gender\\" coverage purposely exclude \\"sexuality\\" and are very heterosexist, if not blatantly homophobic.  Beemyn could have mentioned that the contributors are taking the higher road when others have not.  Most of the authors acknowledge that white, middle-class, gay men had options and choices that people of color, women, and the poor could never have.  Still, this book often focuses on rich, gay, white men in bringing up race, class, and gender.  If \\"race, class, and gender\\" promotions don't encourage cover diversity, then what is the point? <br /> <br />Beemyn is a well-known bisexual activist.  Thus, while his own chapter mentions an interviewee that sought male and female partners, other contributors do not  mention actual bisexuals.  Thus, while the word bisexual comes up in this book often, it doesn't really alter the focus on monosexual gay men and lesbians.  This is well-meaning inclusion, but still superficial. <br /> <br />Some readers may not like the focus on bars and drag performances, but hey, that's the way it was.  This book gives scant mention to cruisy areas and John Boswell and others would say those are important sites of gay contact.  This book may be trying to be more respectable than the actual history makers were themselves. <br /> <br />Lord Alfred Douglas said homosexuality is \\"the love that dare not speak its name.\\"  However, the authors prove here that gay men and lesbians have been speaking up and enjoying themselves for decades and all  over the United States.  While the book does have its limitations, I applaud the editor for amassing those scant academic studies out there in this area.	2005-05-13

I have never seen one of Andy Warhol's films and that did not stop me from being able to understand this book.  Andy Warhol is a peripheral figure here and that helps to dispel the idea that he sucked all of his Superstars dry.  Though Holly has intense love-hate relationships with every drag queen she introduces, it is great seeing work on how trans women relate, or fail to relate, to each other.  This book portrays George Cukor, the Golden Age film director, as supporting Holly, but in his own biography, the writer noted that Cukor hated feminine gay men intensely.  I am not sure which book is telling the truth. <br /> <br />Holly shows how she has seen so much and been through so much.  Though she never mentions being directly involved, she stated that she saw the Stonewall Riots as they happened and she remembered when gay men were first coming down with what would be called AIDS.  She was there to see the rise of Studio 54.  She even mentions being around before the B-52s and Blondie became famous. <br /> <br />Holly goes through the struggles that many transgendered people face.  But she is never able to vocalize that or politicize the issue.  In this book, she faces homelessness, job insecurity, poverty, and rampant drug and alcohol abuse.  I wish she could have pointed to her life as a reason for gender conformists, of any sexuality, to support trans individuals.  Then again, this book, and Holly herself, are highly apolitical.  Further, her identification as a gay man, a woman, and a transvestite are blurred here.  In fact, she goes into detail about her sexual contact with women but speaks quickly of her contact with men.  I am not sure what explained the heterosexism behind that. <br /> <br />Though she has seen and done much, Holly is not a role model here.  She is terribly irresponsible.  She ruins romantic relationships that would have been life-sustaining for her.  She lies to people.  She runs away from problems, rather than facing them.  She never mentions saving any money.  She is obviously drug- and alcohol-addicted, but just laughs those issues off. <br /> <br />On the one hand, Holly admits that she is from Puerto Rico.  However, her identification with Puerto Ricans, and other people of color, is close to nil.  She portrays Puerto Ricans as aggressive and dangerous.  She referred to Puerto Rican lesbians as \\"chili ch*ch*s.\\"  She equally says nasty things about African Americans.  Though she stated that she supported the civil rights movement and has Black relatives, she pretty much abandons her ethnicity as she arrives on the Mainland.  Though she had physical relationships with Latino and Black men, she only romances white men throughout this book.  She seems like she can promote gays and feminine people, but she leaves people of color in the dust.   <br /> <br />Additionally, though this book is sprinkled with French expressions, one would never think that Holly knew or remembered any Spanish.  At one point, there is a headline written in Spanish that is so broken, even a freshman in high school-level Spanish could correct it.  Whether this signifies that Holly is illiterate in Spanish or that her writing assistant Jeffrey Copeland doesn't know any Spanish, I am not sure,  But it's pretty pathetic no matter what the cause. <br /> <br />The first two chapters of the book differ from the rest of the book.  Obviously, they want to place campiness and the height of her fame first before they got into her childhood.  Her epilogue says close to nothing.  She obviously wasn't thinking hard about the conclusion.	2005-05-02

I only found this, but I am pleased to have read it.  In this text, Professor Coleman analyzes the literary work of Canadian men of color and asks what it exposes about the intersection of masculinity and immigration. <br /> <br />Coleman juggles countless balls here.  He cites ideas from Judith Butler, bell hooks, Sigmund Freud, and many others.  (Then again, many have said literary criticism appropriates many ideas from other disciplines.)  Unlike most ethnic studies text which only focus on one racial group, Coleman explores the writings of South Asian men and Black men.  There is a touch of linguistic diversity here as he looks at the work of a Francophone Black author, though he never states whether he read the original French or a translated version. <br /> <br />There is one big problem with this book.  Coleman selects texts that explore the hypersexuality of Black men and the hyposexuality of Asian men.  These works points to depictions of Black men are Priapus-like and Asian men as castrati.  Authors have been wrestling with these controlling images for centuries (James Baldwin, Edward Said, and Franz Fanon, are just a few examples of such writers.)  Coleman never really states how Canadian men of color break the boundaries of these rigid projections.  He scantly mentions gay men of color writing in Canada and I wonder if they have produced more transgressive work in this area. <br /> <br />Professor Coleman was raised in a missionary home in Ethiopia.  Thus, he states that he relates to living in a country as an outsider, particularly one of a different race.  He intersperses his literary analysis with autobiographical anecdotes.  Even he admits that his may be patronizing.  I think it may point to his tacit desire to write a booklength story about his life.  Though he intends no harm, this may rub some readers the wrong way.  Perhaps it hints that he does not have much to say about the texts he selected. <br /> <br />Not all Canadian immigrants are of color, yet no books from white Canadian immigrants are brought up.  He stated that he already wrote on First Nations authors in the past.  A comparative work would be a great idea for his next book. <br /> <br />This text is a much-needed intervention.  I wish there were more professors in American colleges producing work like this.	2005-04-27

Some of the chapters may feel repetitive because the issues are the same; only the cultural/political context differs.  This is a great resource book for those interested in men of color that have relations with other men.  This may also be an important text for AIDS activists, especially those involved on a global scale. <br /> <br />The majority of books on bisexuality and bisexual activism focus on women, but this book assumes \\"bisexuality\\" means \\"male bisexuality.\\"  It may be a bit androcentric, but it's so unique that it fascinated me.  This book repeats a statistic that states more women contract HIV from drug users than bisexual men.  All the media hysteria about same-gender-loving men infecting \\"innocent\\" communities does not stand up to scrutiny.  A later book, \\"Beyond the Down Low\\" by Keith Boykin, explores this fact in further detail.  Nevertheless, the equation of male bisexuality with AIDS may bother some readers tremendously as novel as this anthology may be.	2005-04-19

He never explains whether he is in a love triangle or what some people refer to as \\"a V.\\"  He was a journalism major, so one wonders if he outed himself just to be able to write this book.

He describes his participation in an amateur acting troop to explain how 'we' (Westerners across racial ascriptions) cannot get past identity categories. Dr. Murray retells how acting directors told their participants that acting is all about putting yourself in the role of someone that you are not. Then when the participants are assigned to roles in a play about the Haitian Revolution, Murray is not given a role because the director said no one would believe him as a black slave. The play is meant to promote black autonomy and unity, but participants mention their (xenophobic? elitist?) dislike of Haitian residents in Martinique. During Carnival, when many men are in drag in this gender-rigid region, a real transsexual stays out of the festivities seeing them as a mockery. This is a fascinating project in which it's taken as a given that identities are in flux, but then added to the mix is how people of African descent who are citizens of a European nation deal with these matters. When Murray speaks of performativity, he is speaking of both definitions: the usual, stage-based kind, and the theoretical-political Butlerian kind. He said that he deals with Aime Cesaire because he's the governor of the island, not just because he is well-known in academic circles. He doesn't bring up Franz Fanon because the Martinicans seems to make no mention of him, though American and European university instructors can't get enough of him. To me, the most useful part of this book is the analysis of lingual use. Like Haitian-Americans and other polyglots, the Martinicans choose which language to speak depending on the circumstances. French is used in formal settings, but Creole is used in order to be intimate or emotional. Murray notices that a neighboring boy is allowed to speak Creole while his sister is not. Many Martinicais would not speak to Murray in Creole due tohis ancestry and fears that they would not be seen as worldly citizens for speaking a vernacular. The most hilarious scene in the book is when Murray recalls how the actors change not just their words, but their body language, hand gestures, and attitudes when performing a stage scene in French, then in Creole. This will remind many of Black American comics who use the 'Have you noticed how Black people do X and White people do Y?' routines. Undergraduate and graduate students in cognitive science or comparative literature will find this part of Murray's discussion highly useful. Progressives have been arguing that identities are not separate, but overlapping and informative to each other. Many heterosexist scholars put it like this: 'There's not enough analysis on race, class, and gender.' [Notice how sexuality gets left out of the picture.] Here Murray tries to juggle race, gender, and sexuality at the same time. Though he begins with race and ends with gender, it is clear throughout the book that his main interest is sexuality. In fact, he describes a beauty contest as his gender politic, but this section is scant and half-hearted. Class barely comes up at all. In his epilogue, Murray says something like, 'Whereas sexuality was the big issue on the island 5 years ago, nowadays, criminality and the influence of 'gangsta masculinities' is.' I am quite sure that the average Martinican would not agree with this statement. Murray really should have said that his interests are his own. Jamaica has kept homophobic laws on their books long after their creators, the British, have abandoned them. Dancehall music is full of violent, anti-gay lyrics. Gay men from the Caribbean have often successfully argued from asylum in the United States or Canada due to the bigotry in their homelands. Dr. Murray recalls that Martinican gay men got upset when he said that Montreal could be a prejudiced place toward immigrants and people of color. Just as African-Americans scholars have said blacks once looked at Brazil as a possible utopia, that idea of a utopic place as an alternative and a necessity comes up in this Francophone context. Given this context, Murray's discussion of Martinican gays is a fresh addition to work on Caribbean gays, and black gay men generally. This book will disappoint many. To begin, even if someone is sophisticated enough to say that categories like 'race' and 'sexuality' are 'socially constructed,' many would easily argue that they are still salient in modern societies and can't just be tossed aside. Also, like many anthropological texts, this is just another book where a scholar has an experience abroad, describes it in a diary style, and throws some academic jabber into the mix to sound polished. Because the United States has territories, this book may be helpful to American readers, especially those who want to do international comparative studies. Though this book is small in page length, the academic language is rigorous and thus this will take a while to read. Don't let my criticisms fool you: I enjoyed this book greatly. I found it highly informative and even humorous at times.	2005-04-18

It was published years before Alice Walker wrestled with Cuba's homophobia.  It came out before Cubans dealt with gays in \\"Fresa y Chocolate\\" and before Americans filmed Renaldo Arenas' \\"Before Night Falls.\\"  Still, it is wonderful to see that gay studies books were being published in the early 1980s; especially before the first cases of AIDS were found one year later.  This book mentions that gay American organizations helped gay Cuban refugees.  I didn't know that and love the gay solidarity that it illustrates. <br /> <br />This book puts gayness in context.  Many gay activists and everyday gay folk have said, \\"My sexuality is just one aspect of my identity.\\"  Just as Fidel and his rebels despised gay American sex tourists coming to their island, they did not like straight Americans doing the same thing either.  Not only were gay Cubans sent to concentration camps, so were any person that did not behave according to the average man or woman.  On the other hand, Allen Young said criminalizing homosexuality was purely a Soviet import.  We see a similar hypocrisy as Britain abandons legalized homophobia, but some of its former colonies (for example, India and Malaysia) still embrace it. <br /> <br />The information on Cuban gays here is scant.  Young gleans information from where he can.  He cites \\"The Men with the Pink Triangle,\\" a book on gays persecuted by Nazis, but that book went into specific detail about what happened in European concentration camps.  This book says close to nothing about the day to day of detainees on the island.  Really, this book is more about American leftists who always have some excuse for forgiving Cuban homophobia.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  In this book, Young says Cuban Communists claim to want to include blacks and feminists, but then they get upset when those groups want to express independent pride or criticize the party.  Leftists, in the US and elsewhere, to this day have a problem with any oppressed person talking about issues that are not about socioeconomic class. <br /> <br />Though the author does not expand upon it, this book deals a lot with the longings for a utopia.  Here he says leftists first could not critique the Stalinist Soviet Union and then Castro's Cuba because they so wanted a successful communist country to exist.  African-American scholars have noted that before the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, many Black Americans wished to move to Brazil.  David Murray, in his book \\"Opacity,\\" stated that many gay Martiniquais dream of moving to Montreal.  Again, the more things change, the more they stay the same. <br /> <br />This book helps to document what I heard: Che Guevara was a vicious, nasty homophobe.  This book uses the word homophobia though its wide usage did not come about until the 1990s; it's prescient.  Allen Young fails to mention Allen Ginsberg, the gay leftist poet who was critical of Cuban homophobia from the start.	2005-04-18

The author identifies as a lesbian.  She went to several LGBT pride parades and asked lesbians what they thought about bisexual women.  Her results are diverse; some may find them contradictory or inconclusive.  Still. this book has the potential to ease tensions between lesbians and bisexual women.  It raises the issue of how women-loving women establish communities but also police those communities' boundaries.  This is one of the few sociological studies of female bisexuality that I've found; most other books are the topic are autobiographical.  Rust does say something problematic about black lesbians that I think she could have omitted from the text.  Otherwise, I thought this was a great research topic.  I wish someone would explore similar questions among same-gender-loving men.	2005-04-18

The number of books on gay Latino Americans and gay U.S. LatinOs is burgeoning.  While a good amount has been written on gay Mexico (Ian Lumsden, Joseph Carrier) or gay Brazil (Richard Parker, Luiz Mott), little has been written about gays in Central America.  This book is a great start at bucking that trend. <br /> <br />This book also uniquely contributes to the understanding of heterogenderal couples (also known as \\"butch-femme\\" pairs).  Before Stonewall, often transvestitic prostitutes were the only known homosexuals in any community; closeted (usually masculine) men paid them for favors.  In this book, the reverse happens.  Also, both pro-gay and anti-gay  writings have usually focused on the gender-atypical partner in a heterogenderal couple.  Here, the butch men share their thoughts.  What they say resembles much of what George Chauncey wrote of gays in early 20th-century United States in \\"Gay New York.\\"  Butch-femme has been relatively abandoned by US gays, thus the opinions in this book may feel like rigid \\"role-playing\\" to some or many readers. <br /> <br />This book cites and compares itself so much to Shifter's and Prieur's studies on gay Latin America, that things get repetitive.  This is clearly a book where a graduate student took down field notes and a more tenured academic tried to whip them into a cohesive book. <br /> <br />This book also has interesting things to say about gay vernacular/lingo.  Themes like this are pursued in other books such as \\"Gay Men's English\\" and \\"Global Divas.\\"	2005-04-18

This book is huge!  (500 pages!) But I completed it all. <br /> <br />I think that those interested in the lives of pre-Stonewall gays will find this especially enlightening.  Lorca uses Freudian, problematic reasoning for explaining his gayness.  Like Gide and many other insecure gays, he harps on feminine gay men.  Like Langston Hughes, Yukio Mishima, and again Andre Gide, he was inspired by the homoerotic poetry of Walt Whitman. <br /> <br />In this book, it is implied that Lorca loved Dali and Dali was both repulsed and intrigued by that love.  So that scenario of gay man having unrequited love for straight man is played out here.  However, in the documentary \\"Split,\\" the viewer sees Dali courting a she-male.  In Manrique's \\"Eminent M*r*c*n*es,\\" he states that an American man, later in his life, admitted that he and Dali had a sexual relationship.  So Gibson's portrayal of Dali as exclusively heterosexual may be inaccurate. <br /> <br />In Lorca's last days, the fascists were taking over Spain and they may have killed him for prejudiced reasons.  Now, Spain has a Socialist president who is seriously considering legalizing gay marriage.  This book will help to track progress.  Lorca may be to Spanish gay men what James Baldwin is to American ones.	2005-04-15

Both gay and straight writers have contributed to this text: this book implicitly fights homophobia and celebrates sexual diversity. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the video stills and print reproductions included in this book are of poor quality.

One half-face is obviously that of a gender-typical Indian man.  The other is a person made up in Indian makeup and accessories, but one doesn't know if it's a woman, a hijra, or a guy doing drag.  I think the point is that gendered and sexual identities are in flux on the subcontinent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about as far as I can go in terms of saying positive things about this book.  I think this may be an example of too many cooks spoiling the soup.  Suparna B. is trained in anthropology but her heart lies in cultural criticism.  I am not quite sure if the two disciplines can complement each other.  This book breaks down into an anthropology chapter, a gender chapter, a gay male chapter, and a lesbian chapter.  I think separately these chapters will be helpful to students and activists.  Surprisingly, there is no conclusory chapter here; maybe she wanted to cut the fat and stick to the meat.  Still, this text is a miss and not a hit.<br /><br />This book is all over the place.  In the anthropology chapter, she condemns \\"Lone Ranger\\" anthropology where outsiders come in rough shod and act as if they are the be-all-to-end-all, but she also critiques anthropologists that identify with their subjects and try to \\"empower\\" them.  She does not do a good job in explaining what a third path or synthesis should be.  The lesbian chapter is scant.  It reminds me of Paula Gunn Allen's scant lesbian chapter in \\"Sacred Hoop\\" which (homophobe?) Ward Churchill critiqued.<br /><br />Yes, the author is bright and will probably do well in academia.  Still, much of this book could be written by anybody who can interview Indian activists and has access to research libraries.  The author goes on and on about how Indians are pushed to study India, rather than other regions, and anthropology graduate students are encouraged to live somewhere for two years and just write about it.  Here, the author does not really prove that she spent years talking to real people.  She mentions frequently \\"virtuality\\" and I think someone could have written this book entirely over the Internet.  She does a ton of summarizing facts or newspaper articles.  This is needed since readers probably don't have the facts, but it still eats pages and reduces the amount of time that she can focus on analysis.  I wonder if many dissertations-turned-books are all over the place like this.  Hopefully, Suparna B. will concentrate more when she writes as she advances in her career.<br /><br />What is great is how she positions homosexuality on the subcontinent.  She is very mindful in explaining how economics and the Indian superstructure affect gay male, lesbian, and transgendered identities.  Many gay male and lesbian activists of color have lamented how homophobes will label same-sex love \\"a white disease.\\"  Here, the author states that some Indian bigots may assert that, but she also states that some Indians say they do what they feel at the moment and thus gay identity, not gay sex, is the Western phenomenon.  This book does promote social constructionism in ways that most gay and lesbian studies experts would applaud.<br /><br />Like all progressives, I want more works that don't treat identities in isolation.  I want sharp thinkers to juggles issues surrounding race, gender, sexuality, and nationality.  However, this book has good intentions that fail.  I was expecting to love this book and I did not.t she spent years talking to real people.

His chapters are boring and confusing.  There was not a single chapter that I found enlightening, even though some of the movies discussed are excellent in their own right.  I am surprised that such a guru of Latino gay and Latina lesbian issues could write such a poor book.  Maybe this is an example of publish or perish.

Also enclosed is a photo of a black woman.  Instead of being correspondence between two blacks, it turns out that these letters were written by an Irish-American woman to her black male lover. <br /> <br />History buffs and amateur genealogists should love this book.  Outside of the interracial context, this book answers how do you find more information when you come upon a historical artifact.  The answer is to look at old census documents, old maps, old magazines.  Also, let people know what you found and see if someone may know helpful third parties.  Just as modern techniques show that we leave our DNA everywhere, for approximately 150 years or so, Americans have left photographs and writings everywhere.  Your reality can be found, even a century after the fact. <br /> <br />The editor of this book said that the contributors knew this book must be a collaboration from the start.  I actually think a historian with a background in women's history, African-American history, and local Massachusetts history could have written this book all by her- or himself.   <br /> <br />The extant letters were written by Alice to Channing; there is no existing two-way correspondence here.  However, the book stated that when relationships fell apart, women often asked their paramours for their letters back.  So while I thought that Channing may have kept these letters, it was actually Alice who did so.  In that same vein, the book uncovers much more about Alice than Channing.  In fact, it stands out that the chapter devoted to her is deep whereas the one devoted to him is scant.  Still, you gotta work with whatcha got. <br /> <br />This book is inspiring in that it proves such relationships did exist before Loving v. Virginia. However, that is where the inspiration ends.  This relationship was riddled with abuse, jealousy, \\"gold digging,\\" and misogyny.  Just as FrederickDouglass wed a different white woman than the one to whom he wrote love letters, Channing never divorced his white wife to marry Alice.  Patricia Hill Collins has soundly condemned the idea that this pairing is Root's \\"love's revolution.\\"  That stands out here.  In fact, modern census figures show that couples co-habit interracially much more than they wed interracially. <br /> <br />While this book does mention Smith College at several points, it never brings up that Northampton is now nicknamed \\"Lesbianville, USA\\" by its own residents.  Greenwich Village was known for its tolerance toward interracial couples and gay couples.  The authors here never state whether Northampton residents of that era would have been equally open-minded. <br /> <br />This book does leave some questions unanswered.  Alice was 32 when she wrote to Channing and 40 when she married another man.  Did she pursue Channing because she didn't want to be an \\"old maid\\"?  Channing was obviously literate, but the authors never suggest how he learned to read.  They mention several times that the Civil War was a close memory for all involved.  During the slavery era, it was illegal to teach blacks to read.  This book never answers how Channing became one of the exceptions. <br /> <br />Critics have complained that books don't bring up issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality enough.  Well, this book juggles all of those balls.  In fact, this book spells out ways that the interracial component of this duo may have been the smallest worry of the couple's concerns.  Alice never brings up race in her letters, but the authors suggest that clearly race was a salient issue at this time.  I am pleased that I found this book.	2005-03-18
320869:US	49989755	R1GZOP5N5W1IH9	1590333705	513290286	The Black Male in White America	Books	3	1	1	N	N	good intentions, at least	This book contains (unlucky) 13 chapters on aspects of black men in the United States.  Many books on black men and black male activists have lamented about how black men fare in education, the workforce, and the prison-industrial complex.  This book covers those familiar (played out?) topics.  However, it touches on novel topics such as black male expression in the theater and black men in journalism.  This book gives a tolerable nod to diversity among black men by discussing boys, MSM, and the foreign-born. <br /> <br />On a positive note, I think everyday readers could pick up and understand this book.  On the other hand, this book is RIDDLED with typographical errors.  I am almost sure that a typist typed up these articles and the editor never bothered to assign someone to proofread the anthology.  As a result, black men with fancy academic degrees are made to look like freshman in high school or other people that have never had exposure to a typewriter or don't know about \\"spell check\\" in  their computer programs.  Trust me, there are enough errors here that it conspicuously interrupts the flow of the book. <br /> <br />Throughout this book, the authors try to emphasize that race and gender must both be juggled; one issue can't be dropped in thinking of the plight of black males.  This group is often compared to black females and white males for comparative purposes.  Comparisons to white females are hardly brought up.  I am sure that the editor did not want to \\"play the oppression sweepstakes\\" and imply that somehow racism is more pervasive than sexism.  LatinOs and LatinAs are brought up occasionally as well. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this book is men's studies by naivet.  Any topic that even tangentially discusses black men is brought up here.  For example, one writer details the similarities between the late artist Equiano and the living artist George C. Wolfe.  Black masculinity is not brought up; this chapter is just here because it happens to discussblack men.  The same is true on the chapters about foreign policy, journalism, and the sciences.  Male privilege, male rituals, and rigid masculinities are never brought up.  Most men's studies authors are much more conscious of these matters than the authors here.  I wonder if authors approached the editor and begged to be included just to avoid the \\"publish or perish\\" rule at universities.   <br /> <br />The author provides a weak introduction and conclusion for the book.  This book breaks down starkly into three areas: 1) lists of black male achievers, 2) statistics on black males, and 3) policy recommendations for black men.  Thus, I wonder why the author did not divide the book into parts.  The authors here are BIG on role models.  Just by mentioning that black male individuals have thrived before is their proof that others can carry that torch.  The suggestions at the end of the book are helpful, but unrealistic at a time when the party that \\"promotes self-reliance\\" and decries \\"big government\\" is in power. <br /> <br />I just absolutely disagree with much of what is said in this book.  One author gives Joe Jackson, father of the Jackson 5, as an example of \\"strong\\" black fatherhood.  In reality, his sons have spoken openly of how abusive their father was.  Later, a man celebrates Bill Clinton's appointment of blacks to high offices.  He never mentions that Clinton shamefully fired Jocelyn Elders and he doesn't mention Lani Guinier (and Clinton's backstabbing of her) at all.  A chapter on Caribbean and African men in the US implies that they are all PhD's and entrepreneurs.  Trust me, there are plenty of foreign black men in the US who are not class-privileged or upwardly mobile economically.  The chapter on black MSM never spells out if MSM are different from openly gay men and it makes a predictable statement that any person on the street could have made about preventing HIV among this populations. <br /> <br />The book is the size and length of a required text for a college course.  However, I could not imagine any professor using this as his core book on a syllabus.  While it is nice that the cover does not contain something predictable like a male symbol or a drawing of Africa, I wonder why the editor chose a Mondrian-inspired cover.  Did he want readers to ask, \\"What's black and white and red all over?\\"	2005-03-10

Under the reasoning that help must be culturally-sensitive and arise from within communities themselves, the study's writers want there to be community forums nationwide where these problems can be addressed and solutions can be brainstormed. <br /> <br />The authors present four main problems:  education, health, employment, and the criminal justice system.  Instead of placing the body chapters write next to the chapters on action plans, they separate the two.  This is because the book spells out problems for far long than it presents solutions.  Progressives have been criticized for critiquing without constructing.  So I appreciate the authors' efforts, but there is very little in way of solutions here.  In fact, the solutions are just lists without explanations.  It's almost as if someone just wrote a bunch of ideas on construction paper and went no further.  <br /> <br />This book is incredibly short.  It is obviously meant for the masses, rather than policy wonks.  It is vaguely sociological or psychological.  I can imagine a freshman citing some of the statistics here for an introductory course in those fields.  With poems, drawings, and large print, obviously this was meant for laypeople.  Really, I can't knock the authors' desire to be accessible.  Just let theory-heads be warned. <br /> <br />This book was written in 1993.  Bill Clinton is not brought up at all.  Since it was published at the start of his administration, I am certain that the authors are referring to Bush the First's reign.  However, the more things change, the more they stay the same.  This is still a timely issue with valid statistics included.  Bush the Second has done little to alter what was tallied during his father's rule. <br /> <br />Womanists may beg the question, \\"Why weren't black females included?\\"  The authors never once state that they compiled a companion book on black women.  They never once say that they want similarforums on black women to take place.  Most of the comparisons in this book are between blacks and whites, regardless of gender.  There are some comparisons of black men with white men, but I saw only one comparison between black males and black females.  Thus, one wonders why this book is not title \\"The Black People's Crisis.\\"  There is really no need not to bring up black women if the facts relate to both genders in the community. <br /> <br />This book is not as good as books on black masculinity that came before it (for example, Robert Staples) or books that were published after it (for example, Devon Carbado).  This is for people who want a few statistics and want to look at issues in a simplistic and cursory manner.	2005-03-04

It is not New York City, then nothing, then San Francisco.  However, this book won't feel as compelling as books on gay men and lesbians in the South because the Midwest is not as strongly red (I mean the 2000 election term, not the Lenin-inspired term) as those states. <br /> <br />The entries here are short.  Half are from women; half are from men.  With contributions from Kitty Tsui, Edward Thomas-Herrera, and Ricardo Garza, the book tries to be racially-diverse.  Two major themes come up in this book:  growing up gay/lesbian in conservative, rural areas, and first-time experiences now as openly gay adults, usually in a metropolis. <br /> <br />This book may feel too Chicago-centered to many.  Those still in rural areas and others from Madison, Minneapolis, etc. may feel left out.  One of the authors works in Chicago and naturally editors get contributions from those they know, in a snowball sample manner.  Despite the logic here, this book may rub people the wrong way by implying that all or most Midwestern gays will eventually find their way to the Windy City.  Still, perhaps gay denizenship is regional.  Chicago might be the Midwest equivalent to the East Coast's NYC, the West Coast's SF, and the South's Atlanta.  Fair enough. <br /> <br />I thank the editors and the contributors for their efforts in promoting a possibly needed dialogue.	2005-03-02
347944:US	49989755	R188FP9JMKRVI4	0814756867	421601602	Why I Hate Abercrombie & Fitch: Essays On Race and Sexuality (Sexual Cultures)	Books	3	27	33	N	Y	the gay bruthaman breaks it down!	This book consists of diverse musings from Dr. Dwight McBride, a gay black man and the chair of African-American studies at Northwestern.  He covers myriad topics such as Toni Morrison, the \\"Ellen\\" coming-out episode, gay personals websites, and much more.  He bar-hops a lot too. <br /> <br />McBride brings up several concerns consistently, and these are the areas where black intellectuals have consensus.  He assesses and envisions both the present and future of African-American studies on college campuses.  He is forthrightly in support of affirmative action.  He is very concerned about who gets to speak and who is taken as truthful in our society.  (He does not mention postcolonialist theory but I wondered if he borrowed some of these ideas from Bhabha and Spivak.)  He throws around a phrase \\"compassion fatigue,\\" a very right-on concept in this post-PC, Bush the Second era. <br /> <br />I absolutely love the cover art here.  It takes \\"Paris is Burning\\" and gives it a butch twist.  I have got to find out more about the photographer.  In the same way that lay reviewers screamed to know more about the cover work on Siobhan Somerville's \\"Queering the Color Line,\\" I think other readers and viewers will be equally curious here. <br /> <br />The title of this book is bold.  As much as members of the Left condemn multinational corporations, there is a reason to fear them too.  I guess McBride is not worried that Abercrombie won't seek revenge upon him.  (He never mentions that hit pop song from 1999, by the way.)  The title is both anti-capitalist and diva!-tized.  It both imitates and stands against the class-privileged, spoiled youth that might did the clothing chain. <br /> <br />McBride refers to the black, gay demographic study \\"Say It Out Loud!\\" in several places.  That study clearly stated that the grand majority of LGBT blacks don't like the word \\"queer,\\" yet he freely and frequently uses it here.  That must be a sign of spending most of one's time on a college campus. <br /> <br />In the book \\"A Latina in Hollywood,\\" Dr. Valdivia has chapters that are specific to LatinAs and many that apply to women across racial categories.  Similarly, McBride talks about many black, gay matters, but he also focuses on non-gay-specific black matters.  When the subtitle states \\"race and sexuality,\\" it really implies \\"race AND/OR sexuality.\\"  I think this is a great way for double-minority scholars not to be doubly ghetto-ized when it comes to their opinions and ideas.  I support this flexibility and think that those interested in intersectionality might find it particularly useful. <br /> <br />McBride is great at bringing up race and sexual orientation matters simultaneously.  He notes how a mainstream press article on \\"the lack of black men\\" really means the lack of STRAIGHT black men.  He calls out heterosexism that many readers wouldn't have bothered to consider.  In saying that it takes longer than one sound byte to justify affirmative action, he notes that it takes just as much extended time to challenge homophobic marriage arguments.  Despite being an Ivy League graduate and a professor at a prestigious university, McBride tries to bring up socioeconomic issues as much as possible.  I love the multi-hued vision here. <br /> <br />Still, there are times when he could have employed that same double vision and failed to do so.  He assesses Dr. Cornel West, a heterosexual black male scholar and never mentions how valiantly pro-gay West has been for years.  He analyzes Toni Morrison but never mentions that several black gay writers have deemed her work homophobic (Crichlow and Simmons, for example).  He repeats the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy but never mentions that foes accused her of both being a lesbian and lusting after a male boss.  When discussing the Ellen episode, he mentions Oprah Winfrey as the racial signifier, but never mentions Jenny Shimizu, who made the show for me, a Japanese-American lesbian model who shatteredthe show's problematic tendency to make all the lesbian characters white. <br /> <br />Even more, I had problems with this book structurally.  In a beginning chapter \\"Straight Black Studies,\\" he mentions heterosexism in black studies for a second and then proceeds to discuss James Baldwin at length.  He could have put his musings in the last chapter, another Baldwin essay.  With a title like that, you would have thought he'd add to ideas from Simmons' \\"Some Challenges Facing the Black Gay Intellectual\\" but he disappointingly fails to do so.  His chapter on Anita Hill says NOTHING on the matter that Morrison's anthology \\"Racing Justice, Engendering Power\\" hadn't.  It was really just a way for him as a black gay man to say, \\"Yes!  I support the sisters.\\" <br /> <br />His largest chapter is subtitled \\"Race in the Gay Marketplace of Desire.\\"  Much of what he says is on point and will open the eyes of many.  However, he says that he is going to mention extremely explicit things about himself.  He quotes Reid-Pharr and Gary Fisher to ease the reader in and then he says rather tame things about himself.  His confessions are not half as erotic as things written by gay academics such as D'Emilio, Delaney, or J.M. Rodriguez.  I think he could have found Kobena Mercer's and Richard Fung's work helpful here.  When he does mention himself, he says he dates \\"the rainbow coalition,\\" yet only provides anecdotes between him and white men.  Like the classic essay \\"Playing with the Master's Tools,\\" this essay becomes Eurocentric.  It almost can't even imagine romance between two black men or two men of color.   <br /> <br />Though I like this book and hated Reid-Pharr's \\"GBM: Essays,\\" I do think the texts have much in common.  I think the editors of this series want scholars to throw in everything and the kitchen sink.  Lay readers will like the second part of this book while the first and last parts may confuse them.  Bringing up Hugo, Sisyphus, Marx, and several others demonstratesthat McBride has much cultural capital and is not limited to race or sexual orientation as topics.	2005-02-16

He wrote this book in 1982 and sooooo much has happened in Black gender and sexuality politics since then.  The Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill controversy, the literary and filmic success of \\"The Color Purple\\" and \\"Waiting to Exhale,\\" rap music, the AIDS pandemic, the O.J. Simpson trial, and many other phenomena have happened since that time.  Still, this was an impressive foundational book. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the more things change, the more they remain the same.  Staples laments that more Black men are going to jail, less Black men are going to college, and that few Black men have the skills needed in a rapidly changing economy.  Two decades later, these issues are still salient and often have gotten worse!  Some readers may find this book depressing. <br /> <br />While Staples focuses on adult male Blacks here, he is not androcentric or ageist.  His curriculum vitae covers all parties in the Black family.  He's written on Black women and Black children in other spaces.  He even mentioned that he has researched Black singles, of both genders and several sexualities.  Along those same lines, he does not look at race as the be-all to end-all: he mentions class, region, and education often.  He mentions Latinos and other people of color.  This is not a unidimensional text.  Staples is kinda red; he is from the old school.  He critiques capitalism and slams the military.  I thought Angela Davis was the only activist speaking out against \\"the military-industrial complex\\", but I guess not.  Even when I do not agree with Staples' point on Black gay men and lesbians, I still LOVE that he made homosexuality a subject when many Black male writers avoid it at all costs, and still avoid the issue two decades later. <br /> <br />Not only is Staples an amazing pioneer, but his imitators are not better.  After reading this book, I realize how inferior, and practically plagiarized, Kunjufu's and Cose's works on Black masculinity are to Staples.  I think many will disagree with some of Staples' assertions, but even still, he is thoughtful.  He seems like someone awesome to which to speak or for whose class one would want to take. <br /> <br />His introduction is more complex than the body chapters.  Though very scholarly, this book reads quickly.  I had to use my diction a few times (needed to look up \\"internecine,\\" \\"ipso facto,\\" and \\"cavil\\").  His chapter on racism against Black men were well-researched while his chapters on Black gender politics were anecdotal and hypothetical.  Yes, the latter subject is less researched.  Still, the first chapters are what almost everyone in the Black community would agree upon while the latter section is where the divisions arise.  <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Staples asserts that he supports feminists and women's liberation.  However, many may think he really feels just the opposite.  Some may feel that this is not a pro-feminist work by any means.  Unbeknownst to him, Staples is really trying to flesh out what a Black men's studies would look like.  He asks legitimate questions:  Do oppressed men really oppress women like their majority counterparts do?  Does majority feminism apply in communities of color?  How does a person juggle their privileges with their disadvantages?  Even if the reader doesn't agree, one must respect the convictions of his theorizing. <br /> <br />I feel honored that I was able to find and read this book.  I do think it would still be relevant in current writings by professors and students.	2005-02-10
363224:US	49989755	R2BJQO9T082U74	9766401365	840081879	Confronting Power, Theorizing Gender: Interdisciplinary Perspectives in the Caribbean	Books	3	5	7	N	Y	Caribbean masculinities	This book results from a conference sponsored by the Gender Studies Program at the University of the West Indies.  Most of the authors are faculty members of that system.  The book tries to flesh out what gender studies in and of the Caribbean would look like.  It divides into four sections: cultural theory, education, history, and literature. <br /> <br />I had some concerns that this would just be a repeat of Rafael Ramirez's text \\"Caribbean Masculinities.\\"  Though Dr. Ramirez provides a prologue, only one chapter exists in both books.  Still, other chapter are included or part of book length works (Parry's and Crichlow's chapters, for example).  The contributors are both male and female.  With the exception of one person, all of them either work in or come from the Caribbean. <br /> <br />Though Jamaica does receive the most attention, the contributors try to be diverse in their coverage of the Caribbean landscape.  A chapter on Dominicans illustrates lingual diversity.  However, there is no chapter about Haitians, Caribbean Francophones are not mentioned in this book.  There is a chapter on an ethnic group in Belize.  I suppose the editors think of the Caribbean as any nation that touches about the Mexican Gulf. <br /> <br />I thought the section on education and history were the strongest.  The theory section in the beginning would be informative for readers who know little about gender studies.  However, it may bore those who know a lot on the topic.  By far, the worst section is the literature section.  Perhaps that is why it is placed last.  It is uneven: the penultimate chapter is 80 pages while the ultimate chapter, not a conclusion I might add, was only 17.  It was the real yawner section of the book. <br /> <br />This book tries hard not to equate the Caribbean solely with people of African descent.  Still, its discussion of East Indians in the region is scant.  What is amazing is how so many topics that concern African Americans seems to concern Caribbean nations.  Preparation for the changing economy, the superior educational performance of girls and women compared to boys and men, the effect of \\"gansta\\" personas on musicians and their male audiences, and much more must be controversies both within and outside of American borders.  One thing that annoyed me is that one writer quotes bell hooks as not having a \\"z\\" in the word \\"socializing.\\"  Hello, bell hooks is American and writes in American English.  The two writing styles are not so different that one should edit out the specifics.  Worse, they do not even admit that they are doing it.  It's practically like a misquote and misrepresentation.  Both Black Americanists and pan-Africanists should find this text useful. <br /> <br />On the cover and at the beginning of each chapter, there is a drawing of a skeleton in a man's suit.  I think he's a skeleton and not a living man in order to erase racial specificity.  However, the skeleton brings up issues of voodoo.  Thus, readers will still code him as black.  Further, this voodoo/zombie image is somewhat a stereotypical image of Caribbean men.  I am not sure why they use it.  I doubt that it's helpful to their project.	2005-02-03

This study tries to be exhaustive, factoring in if fathers worked in the same field, level of education, rural/ethnic background, etc.  The study shows how superiors often open doors for people like them whereas they are indifferent or close doors for people unlike them. <br /> <br />The author studies men because there were few employed Canadian women at the time.  Hence, this is men's studies by default.  Though androcentric, it is by no means misogynist.  The info is very dated, but it will still be useful for those who want to think about employment opportunities, especially from an international comparative perspective. <br /> <br />This book helps to shed light on the glass ceiling phenomenon.  It may help to explain Quebecois separatism which is still a controversial matter today.  This book could be a useful tool for Americans who are trying to ensure that equality exists as our country becomes increasingly bilingual. <br /> <br />This is a short text.  However, the reader must read carefully to understand all the charts displayed and the analysis given.	2005-01-20

Though most of the articles are by women, some are by men.  Though most articles are by people with European last names, there are some contributors with Asian names.  Like many gender studies anthologies, there is more information on femininity than masculinity.  However, I blame no one since men's studies is such a recently emerging field.   <br /> <br />This book focuses more upon Southeastern Asian island nations than other places.  There are no articles on Vietnam or Myanmar in this book.  Still, given that Indonesia is approximately the fifth most populated country in the world, the work here is novel.  I mean, how often do you hear about Indonesia and Malaysia in American books?   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this book says little about feminism in the region.  Further, each chapter begins with a summary that tells you everything you need to know.  Really, students could get away with reading the summaries and not having to read the rest of the text. <br /> <br />My main reason for being proud to own this book is because of the cover painting by Arunothai Somsakul.  I definitely have to find more of her work; it's pure beauty.  I missed whether the editors explain the title.  But I find it misleading in two ways.  First, it comes off as somewhat sexist that men are labeled \\"pious\\" while women are labeled \\"bewitching.\\"  Too, this book is not about religion in Southeast Asia.  It focuses on fertility, employment, and family dynamics, not spirituality. <br /> <br />It's funny to me how books become timely.  There were no fears about tsunamis when this anthology was collected in 1995.  However, this book covers the nations that were worst effected by the recent disaster.  Anthropological and other academic studies of the area may have some useful impact on the recovery efforts taking place as I write this review.	2005-01-15

I understand that \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" is a famous country song.  It's even mentioned in the film \\"Swingers.\\"  However, I thought this book would be mostly about gender deviancy or noncomformity, like in Moe Bandy's hit \\"Where's the Dress?\\"  Still, this was a strong mix of gender studies and cultural studies and I was not disappointed.    This anthology has female and male authors.  It analyzes femininity and masculinity in the country genre.  Still, it's mostly women's studies.  Most authors discuss how female country artists faced and still face double standards that their male peers never have to consider.  Like strong cultural studies, this book tries to look at all aspects of art, from production, reception, visuality, and of course to album sells.      Most progressive thinkers have abandoned the idea that identity categories stand alone.  The authors here do a great job in juggling multiple balls.  Besides gender, class and region are brought up often, and to a small amount so is sexuality.  Race is somewhat invisible here.  But to the contributors' credit, they analyze the whiteness of the industry and make a point of mentioning that several country artists are of mixed Native American ancestry.    Just as academics try to discuss masculinities, rather than masculinity, this book could have had country musicS in its title, rather than country music in the singular form.  The difference between female and male artists is stressed.  Further, the Nashville Sound is differentiated from other forms.  It's brought up that some artists styled themselves as \\"Western\\" rather than \\"Southern.\\"  The book ends with an analysis of a country offshoot called alt.country.    I was surprised to see that a Southern press was publishing books with Southern academics about a Southern genre that is quite comparable to what is being published on the Coasts.  The last essays are easier to read than the first, but I think the chapters are set up chronologically.  I think many will findthe most interesting and useful chapters to be those on the icons, Patsy Cline and Elvis.    This book will reminds many of the cultural studies on rap.  Talk of authenticity, developing a regional sound, sexism within the industry, and image counting as much as, if not more than, the music itself comes up often in hip-hop literature.  I am sure that a student could write a solid A paper comparing this book to \\"Black Noise\\" or other scholarly work on rap.    I am indifferent to country music.  Besides I live in a Blue State.  Still, I enjoyed this work.  The contributors should be commended.	2005-01-11
413674:US	49989755	R3HUHRLO0QBR86	0226468178	78921765	Money, Morals, and Manners: The Culture of the French and the American Upper-Middle Class (Morality and Society Series)	Books	3	14	21	N	Y	American (white) men vs. des hommes francais (blancs)	Lamont is prescient.  This book is timely now.  When Americans are saying they should boycott French fries, Franco-American relations are at an all-time low.  Dr. Lamont analyzes the differences in how well-educated American men think in comparison to their French counterparts.<br /><br />She divides the research into 3 themes: elite men divide who they think are good and who they think are bad based upon money, morality, and mannerisms/culture.  She looks at the macro level showing how one nation may use more of one or two of the three traits than the other country.  She also gets specific by show how the ideas mean different things to individuals.  For example, American men like men who know many concrete facts whereas French men like men who are witty and have good grammar.  Lamont does a great job in quantify and classifying ideas that most people would think are nebulous and intangible.<br /><br />This is men's studies by default.  Those who uphold \\"race, class, and gender\\" rhetoric may be disappointed.  She excludes people of color saying few of them fit this elite category.  She supposedly compares these men to a small group of women, but the women were only brought up once in the book.  When Lamont speaks of the \\"elite\\" she is talking about education rather than income.  Some of the careers mentioned here (teacher, reverend, bank employee, etc.) do not sound that unique or rare to me.  Lamont explores race in her next book.  Fans of men's studies and white studies may find this work helpful in formulating theory.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this comparative work will do little to encourage multinational tolerance.  I think Lamont makes French men sound somewhat weird.  Many think nothing of cheating on their wives.  How is that honest and helpful to a relationship?  One French interviewee said he does not care if his employees are competent, so long as they are working on improving their lives.  Hello?  Sometimes competency is necessary.  Is that why part of Paris' airport collapsed recently and 4 people were killed?  Because being witty and quoting Rousseau means more than being an expert in your technical field?!<br /><br />Chapter five is a summary chapter which might as well have been an introduction instead.  Students with little time to read this book before class can just read that chapter.  Though Lamont rightfully compares the big city to the boondocks, those differences didn't really play out.  Since they were neither here nor there, they might as well have been excluded.  I am impressed how she got so much information on such esoteric matter from each man in just approximately two hours.<br /><br />I liked Lamont's second book better.  This was took forever to read unlike her more recent book.  That book brought up schisms that materially affect nations whereas, truth be told, the Americans and the French are never going to come to blows about anything.  Still, this shows she's a deep thinker and that she continues to improve as a scholar.	2004-12-24

Until recently, few statistics were collected about Latino health concerns.  When concerns were listed for women, they were based on white women.  When concerns are listed for minority women, they are usually based upon African-American women.  Further, Delgado noted that many Latinas are unfamiliar with the Anglo-American health care system, partially due to its cost.  So many Latinas gather health knowledge by word of mouth.  She wants this book to be a user-friendly resource. <br /> <br />The book is divided into many timely topics, such as diet, diabetes, depression, and HIV/AIDS.  She usually starts chapters with anecdotes from Latinas and ends them with a list of resources and national organizations or helplines.  Delgado promotes a holistic approach in which concerns of the mind and heart are mixed in with concerns that are usually proscribed as just related to the body.  She emphasizes health problems which disproportionately affect Latinas.  While she compares Latinas to women of other races, I didn't see a single statistic that compared them to LatinO men.  Hopefully, a LatinO expert will produce a male equivalent to this book. <br /> <br />I am somewhat surprised that a Ph.D. wrote this, rather than an M.D.  I am almost sure the book would have been different if written by a different expert.  The pages are made of cheap brown paper which I am sure was done to make the text affordable; it's a lengthy book.  Spanish phrases are thrown around, but this is a substantially English text, not a bilingual one.  However, a Spanish translation is available. <br /> <br />I think this book would be a great resource for Latinas with children.  It's user-friendly which some readers may feel is dumbed-down.  However, hopefully most readers will find this a useful text when they want to get some easy information about pressing health problems affecting a sizeable and growing part of the American population.Doctors and librarians in predominantly Latino neighborhoods should make sure they have this book available for their patients and patrons, respectively.	2004-12-12

This book does not focus as much on education as the title would imply. <br /> <br />In America, I'd say that most people associate Asians with East Asians, rather than South Asians.  Most Americans would associate South Asians with Indians, rather than Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.  Religiously, most of the Americans that I know would think first of Hindus, rather than Muslims.  Discussions of Asians in the American school system revolve around struggling against a \\"model minority myth\\": rarely are Asian American academic concerns related to concerns of working-class learners.  Thus, reading this book was novel compared to the typical discussions on my side of the pond.   <br /> <br />This book felt more like a sociology text, rather than an education text.  Archer is very interested in constructionism.  Whether dealing with gender, Asian students, or multiculturalism in the schools, she focuses upon how things changed.  Less academic readers may want to read the middle chapters first or only, rather than the introductory or conclusionary chapters. <br /> <br />Archer dismisses theorizing on intersectionality saying it only rigidifies identities that should be seen as being constantly in process.  I love how she juggles issues of race, class, and gender simultaneously.  However, I think intersectional theorists such as Kimberle Crenshaw, bell hooks, Essex Hemphill, among others have written some of the most eye-opening work out there.  In this book, Archer merely modifies masculinities with various adjectives, be they Islamic, laddish, black, gangsta or Britsh.  Archer is constantly placing race in single quotes.  Maybe when Skip Gates put race in double quotes a decade ago, it was novel and served a purpose.  However, it is has now been well-argued that race is no more essentialized than gender, religion, or any other identity.  The single quotes got very tedious after awhile. <br /> <br />Whereas most writers would discuss the oppression that a marginalized group faces first and the oppression that cause later, Archer does the opposite.  Before concentrating on racism in Great Britain, she mentions the many ways that these male students raise double standards against Muslim women.  Race and gender inform each other; they're never seperate.  Here Archer effectively illustrates how male ethnics may use ethnic women as their bearers or reminders of a home culture.  Equally important, Archer points to how the interviewees said different things in front of her as opposed to her South Asian interviewers.  However, she never questions whether these males would have had different responses if their interviewers had been male. <br /> <br />Archer is a clearly progressive, anti-oppression activist.  However, this book doesn't make the Muslim males look good.  The quotes are garbled in stutters and sentence fragments.  The interviewees are constantly saying \\"That's just the way things are.\\"  Archer does a thorough job in applying her theoretical analysis to their comments.  However, I doubt British teachers would use this book in rethinking some of their biases.  The quotes are filled with \\"hh\\".  How do you even pronounce that!?  There are many inaudible lacuna.  Why didn't she get better recording equipment?  To be fair, the interviewers aren't that articulate either.  Still, this corroborates stereotypes, rather than counteracting them. <br /> <br />Archer quotes heavily from Claire Alexander's book \\"The Asian Gang.\\"  You'd almost think she was just proving Alexander's conclusions. Though she lists R.W. Connell in her bibliography, she consistently uses the term \\"hegemonic masculinities\\" without giving him his due. <br /> <br />Despite my critiques, I enjoyed this book.  Archer is a great researcher and this book should be embraced by many, both in and outside of Britain.	2004-11-30

Thus, his project is to flesh out the contours of an academic discussion of men's fashion.  As much as he mentions sociology, this books employs philosophy and economics heavily. <br /> <br />This book is not for everyday guys that just like to shop or read magazines like \\"Maxim.\\"  It's a rigorous academic examination.  Though the book is small, its discussion is heavy material.  It takes a while to get through it.  Those who love Valerie Steele's fashion analysis will love this too. <br /> <br />This book looks at an \\"Anglo-American\\" phenomenon, but the emphasis on on Anglo, rather than American.  The author often mentions a fashion house called Next which we don't have in the US.  He mentions a 1980s discussion of \\"the New Man\\" and I don't think that was brought up in the US, unlike \\"metrosexuals\\" who are highly discussed on both sides of the pond.  I don't believe in American isolationism, so having to focus upon a country other than my own didn't bother me.  I just couldn't relate to many of Edwards' references. <br /> <br />Though the chapters intend to have separate topics (marketing, shopping, magazines, etc.), the examination pretty much blends together.  Many chapters do not touch upon their primary subject until the last few pages of the chapter.  For example, the New Man isn't brought up until the last pages of chapter three.  Next isn't mentioned until the end of the chapter called \\"The Marketing of Masculinities.\\"  The penultimate chapter discusses economics for the most part and doesn't bring up masculinity until the very end.  Chapter Seven, \\"Express Yourself: The Politics of Dressing Up,\\" is obviously the most important chapter as the author refers to it throughout the text.   <br /> <br />This book looks at the suit and its effect upon masculinity frequently.  So other men's clothing items or trends (baggy pants, kilts, athletic jackets with letters, military uniforms, etc) get placed to the wayside.  The author mentions pornography for women on several occasions and it has almost nothing to do with anything, or at least he fails to explain its relevance.  There is a 4-paged template of men's fashion ads.  Any person, of any gender, who would read this book knows what a men's ad for a suit looks like.  This was just a way to kill trees.  Though this book was published in the late 1990s, the author says nothing about the Internet.  Perhaps it wasn't as big in Britain as it was here, but this is a shock that the most important human tool of the decade never came up.  Clothes were advertised and promoted over the web, remember?	2004-11-12
470063:US	49989755	R16B2U2MZXVW0F	0415930758	127354923	Hopeful Girls, Troubled Boys: Race and Gender Disparity in Urban Education	Books	4	14	14	N	Y	race, class, and GENDER!	In this book, Dr. Lopez evaluates low-income Dominican, Haitian, and West Indian students to see how gender differentiates their views of society, school, family, and the workforce.  Dr. Lopez is \\"a subject from within\\": a Dominican-American who was raised under the same circumstances as her subjects. <br /> <br />Progressive academics have argued for years that thinkers have not produced enough theory that juggles issues of race, class, and gender.  Here, those three issues are tackled.  Equally important, race and class are taken into account and gender is the primary lens of analysis.  This is rightfully called gender studies as both men and women are examined.  Dr. Lopez observes a homogenous school, thus this book makes almost no comparisons between Caribbean Americans and European Americans. <br /> <br />Gender aside, this book looks at the sad state of public schools in many parts of America.  Post-911, Giuliani has been embraced as \\"America's Mayor.\\"  However, this books points to the former mayor's assault against NYC public schools and illustrates why Black and Latino residents have historically resented him.  In the school examined, teachers don't have offices.  The walls are crumbling.  The students don't even get textbooks.  There is absolutely no mention of extracurriculars, so my guess is that they don't have any.  There is more emphasis put on students' going through metal detectors than getting a good, critical education.  Teachers and security guards spend more time ripping off boys' hats than making sure that they learn or feel safe. <br /> <br />The most important point of this book is how Dr. Lopez shows that gender matters.  Women may not like police, but they are not physically assaulted by them.  Women are given responsibilities at home and ordered to submit to authority and learn to exhibit the habits that teachers reward.  Women value education even when they are getting shoddy ones.  Women get away with antics in the class for which men are severely punished. <br /> <br />Many progressive readers may feel that Dr. Lopez is preaching to the choir.  Race and gender are not separate worlds; they are categories that sit by each other constantly informing each other.  For those who don't know this, this will be a shocker.  For those who do, much of what Dr. Lopez says is nothing new.  The second chapter which concerns men's fears of physical violence and women's fears of sexual stereotyping is nothing new, again. <br /> <br />Dr. Lopez has a purposeful project of challenging those thinkers who would say it's their own fault if Caribbean-American men and women don't succeed in American schools.  I applaud her for that.  However, she states that Caribbean boys don't study because they are insulted by the simpleness of the books they are given.  I highly doubt that every unsuccessful male student does poorly because he is not challenged.  Surely, some male students, of whatever ethnicity, would get As knowing that a 4.0 GPA from a bad school would still give them accesses to college admissions and scholarships.  No such male is ever mentioned in this study.  Dr. Lopez said that none of her subjects considered performing well in school as \\"acting white\\", but maybe that's an African-American concern rather than a Caribbean one.  Dr. Lopez details that the streets are more important to males than the home, but this gendered divide of the public and private is a well-established topic; she never recognizes that. <br /> <br />Dr. Lopez puts the chapter on families after her chapters where she observes the students in class.  I would have put it before so that the book had more of a chronological flow.  She describes 4 classes in the chapter on girls, but only one on the chapters on boys.  I am not sure to which gender this may show a partiality.  Because she looks at how gender differentiates individuals in and outside of the schools, anti-sexist teacher may be frustrated by her results.  Nothing is clearly spelled out to show how teachers can affect change in such a way that males start attending college as much as females.  But I don't fault her for being holistic, and possibly exhaustive in her examination. <br /> <br />As the only Caucasian group to which the subjects have contact, they often compare themselves, and somewhat rag upon, Jews.  This may feel anti-Semitic to some readers.  But remember that New York City has its own unique ethnic conflicts that can't be applied to the rest of the nation.  Dr. Lopez interviews many people who want to be doctors, lawyers, and Ph.D.s  I love of hearing of people of color aiming high.  However, I would have loved to have heard more people aiming to be teachers, business owners, or public administrators.  Regardless of race, only 19% of medical school applicants will get into any medical school whatsoever.  I hope these subjects don't end up without a paddle.  The careers cited can be just as difficult to enter as the rap world or the sports arena. <br /> <br />Dr. Lopez has a bright career ahead of her.  Despite my critiques, I appreciated this book.  I think it will be embraced by many.	2004-11-01

I was expecting to read this during winter break because I couldn't possibly read it outside of off-time.  However, once I started, I couldn't put it down.  It just took a few days to breeze through.   <br /> <br />Whether you love or hate her, Alice is a powerhouse.  Even outside of the book and film The Color Purple, she invented the term \\"womanist\\", she fought female genital mutilation, she revived Zora Neale Hurston.  Alice is a major player in the history of African-American women.  In fact, this book tells even more.  She taught the first college course on black female authors in the country.  Langston Hughes and James Baldwin sought her out, as opposed to the other way around.  One of the reasons that I couldn't put the book down is because every 10 pages something would come up that I would find fascinating and feel that I was a better person for having known about.  Sometimes this book is a little gushy, but that's not surprising since Miss Alice is a born genius.  Maybe this is just a result of the biographer really enjoying her subject. <br /> <br />The biographer took ten years to create this book.  Sometimes I think journalists should stick to articles rather than books, but Evelyn White is an exception to my rule.  In fact, I think her journalism background helped to make the book move quickly.  I worship Frida Kahlo, but it's taking me forever to wade through Herrera's definitive biography on her.  White saved me and other readers from that challenge here.  She makes a point of letting people know that Gwendolyn Brooks is the first black woman to win a Pulitzer, not Alice.  She is a cool sista that all readers should keep their eyes on. <br /> <br />This book can be disheartening.  White details stories that make female artists look sooooo hypersensitive, vindictive, gossipy, and catty.  Later for \\"sisterhood is powerful!\\" cliches.  In this non-fiction work, older female artists bicker with younger ones.  Black women and white women duke it out.  Lesbian writers and bisexual ones roll their eyes at each other. <br /> <br />At the end of the book, the biographer straight up admits it:  Alice can be grounded and non-plussed by the forces against her, but she can also be shady and she reads men and women, of many racial backgrounds, left and right.  For example, she wrote to a critical reader, \\"I take what I find useful from people and discard the rest.  Have you ever thought about doing that?! SNAP!\\"  [She didn't really snap, but I added that for diva! effect since it's such a shady, attitudified comment.  LOL!] <br /> <br />This book concentrates on the beginnings far more than the ends.  Thus, much is made of Alice's younger years while the last 15 years or so are summarized in a chapter or two.  Much is written on \\"Meridian\\" and \\"The Color Purple\\", but nothing is said about \\"The Same River Twice\\" or \\"Anything We Love Can Be Saved.\\" <br /> <br />The chapter titles will be meaningless to any person just flipping through the table of contents.  You will only understand the titles' meanings once you are well into the meat of the chapter.  Thus, there's no \\"Color Purple Chapter\\" or \\"Alice Marries Interracially Chapter\\" for those who just want to skim for key books and events.  Unlike most authors who start with a bang to get your attention, White saves the best till last.  She concludes chapters with a bang I imagine in hopes that the reader will be encouraged to keep going. <br /> <br />No person interviewed in this book ever says, \\"Yeah, I knew Alice, she was coo'.\\"  Every person is quoted as if they sounded as witty, sophisticated, and profound as Walker's writings.  The biographer surely must have touched up quotes.  There are long cites of poetry and book reviews.  This gets tiresome after awhile. <br /> <br />The issue of sexuality is incredibly scant here.  In \\"The Same River Twice\\", Alice said she wanted homophobic readers to experience a gay character, thus she made Celie.  She freely admits that she has had relationships with both men and women.  Yet the biographer doesn't mention Alice's same-sex relationships until the end of the book, makes it sound like it only became an issue late in Walker's life, and only mentions the topic scantily.  I was surprised to read that Walker was more of a \\"political lesbian\\" than an actual one.  I think those who want to hear more about non-heterosexual matters will be disappointed.  I also wish there was more on Walker and her admiration of Fidel Castro. <br /> <br />My aunt, who has a Masters, once said, \\"I've only read two books cover to cover: the Bible and the Color Purple.\\"  Alice is really an icon.  Anyone interested in all the themes that she has spearheaded must read this text.  I especially think that anyone majoring in English, women's studies, or African-American studies must experience this text.  I give great applause to Alice Walker and Evelyn White despite any critique I may have formulated.	2004-10-27
483286:US	49989755	R4BARQNJGFC8U	1858560403	327755600	Black Masculinities and Schooling: How Black Boys Survive Modern Schooling	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	excellent academic text!	This book is wonderful, yet disheartening.  The author analyzes the dynamics between Afro-Caribbean male high school students and their teachers in a majority-black school near London.  It just rattles my soul that the oppression of black males in academia is so universal.  Like in the United States, in this British school, teachers fear black males and will discipline them at the drop of a dime.  They are constantly comparing them to Asians and deeming them lacking.  Racism in other countries could be discussed, but racism at the school and in Britain was denied by faculty.  Even the black faculty are not supportive.  In this school, white males could wear many hairstyles, but black students were banned, in an unwieldy, poorly-written rule, from having \\"ethnic haircuts.\\" <br /> <br />This book shows the dynamic two-way street that is education.  Several types of teachers are listed, but so are several type of black male students.  Black males are not rendered a monolithic entity.  Thus, the author writes masculinities in the plural for the title.  Students are unfairly castigated by staff, but they also get over on the school in all kinds of sly, humorous ways.  Black male students are just as critical and thoughtful as the many teachers that condemn them.  The author cites Foucault and proves that he understands his ideas about power and discourse.  Oddly enough, the author protests against categorizing people, yet he practices it throughout the text. <br /> <br />This book is well-written.  It uses serious academic and political terminology.  This is not for the unsophisticated reader, even teacher, that is not familiar with top-level cultural criticism.  I love the book cover.  It shows a black male with an expressionless stare that communicates a lot.  He is robed in a school uniform and set against a graffiti tagged background; this purposely points to two contrasting influences. <br /> <br />I am surprised that the teachers opened up to this researcher.  Nothing they say meets his approval.  They are either deemed racist if they criticize the students or naive exoticizers if they praise them.  The researcher is obviously biased.  He labels the school Township School in reference to apartheid-era South Africa.  Though he offers recommendations to both parties in the last chapter of the book, clearly he assumed the glass was half empty or entirely empty before he even began his work. <br /> <br />This book surprises and troubles me in several regards.  First, the relationship between black males with white males or females of any race is never really explored.  In American educational studies, academics (like Cornel West) have pondered why black boys are at the top of the social ladder, but at the bottom of the educational one.  White love of black culture is brought up in this book.  However, the dynamics between black males with those of a different race or gender is not brought up at all.  The reader gets little information about whether students that are not black and male face the same issues or have the same opinions. <br /> <br />In America, academics have wondered how black male students are the best athletes and musicians, but the poorest students.  They've opined that schools which don't like them as students, love having them on teams and in extracurricular activities.  Here, sports and culture get mentioned only to a small extent.  I wonder if British schools focus solely on academics.  Maybe that's one reason why Afro-Caribbean male students feel alienated and indifferent to the institution. <br /> <br />This book contains example after example of black males being \\"excluded\\" (what we Americans would call \\"suspended\\") for no reason at all.  The United States has a rich history of civil rights protests and litigious activity.  Here, no student ever mentions their parents' suing or protesting the school.  Maybe British black people are not as prone to \\"fight da power\\" as we are here.  I don't mean to be culturally superior, but these students would have been aided if someone challenged these schools in the pocket book or through the media. <br /> <br />Whereas the author emphasizes teachers' racism, he lets the black male students off the hook for their rampant sexism, at to a lesser degree, their homophobia.  This is highly problematic.  Perhaps the many white female teachers here are oppressive to these black males because the black males are equally oppressive to them.  Sexism from any type of man is inexcusable, yet the author says little on this tragedy. <br /> <br />It was fascinating to read this as a person on the other side \\"of the pond.\\"  The author said that black British boys listen to jungle as the music which defines their black manhood,  In the US, most people haven't heard of jungle music and it's associated with white male youth, not their black counterparts.  One teacher comments that she dislikes how black British students are picking up ideas from \\"Long Beach, New York.\\"  The author doesn't correct the teacher.  He must have no idea that Long Beach is in California and that New York has an area called Long Island.  LOL! <br /> <br />This book was excellent, despite my critiques.  I actually enjoyed it much more than African-American discussions of the topic (aka, Mahabuti and Kunjufu).  I definitely recommend this text.	2004-10-20

This should not have been called \\"Song of a Manchild.\\"  This is the cackle of a coocoo bird, the screech of a looney tune.  I'm all for artists' pushing the envelope for their audiences, especially when it comes to gender and sexuality, but this is just goofy and a big, old joke! <br />Black gay men face ridiculous amounts of racism and homophobia.  Many people in this country are fighting tooth and nail to keep gay marriage illegal.  Yet in this book, no one cares that a man is getting pregnant besides the character that is supposed to be his life partner.  If people are afraid about men acting \\"outside of their traditional roles\\" how likely are they to be non-plussed that a black man is pregnant?  <br />In this book, it's implied that pregnant men look like men with beer bellies.  Pregnant women don't look like non-pregnant, fat women.  If a man were pregnant, John and Jane Doe would notice and be shocked beyond belief about it.  Still, here, the main character isn't thought of as an oddity by anybody.  What world do these characters live in? <br />The main character asks a guy, \\"How do you know you haven't been with a pregnant man before?\\"  Later, a flirtatious store employee says, \\"Pregnant guys are the hottest!\\"  Did I go to sleep for 20 years?  What place has multitudes of pregnant men?  How can this be portrayed as not hyperfantastic? <br />The main character's best straight female friend gives him an egg as easily as someone would help another person put on their earrings.  Extracting eggs from women is difficult.  That's why female infertility is more difficult to cure than male infertility.  That's why more couples choose surrogate mothers than get extracted eggs.  Again, totally unrealistic! <br />The main character and the guy on the book cover have gym-chiseled bodies.  The book is filled with anecdotes of both men and women flirting with the main character.  What is the likelihood that a muscular man would allow himself to become pregnant and not be scarred by losing admirers of his physique? <br />I really think this book is a disturbing attempt to overturn \\"Roe v. Wade.\\"  The character recalls that he has a view about abortion that I am almost positive no teenaged boy would have.   <br />This book is just scattered with black gay men making stupid choices.  One character refuses taking AZT though it could extend his life and reduce his AIDS-related symptoms.  One character purposely becomes HIV-positive.  He even celebrates it as a type of \\"pregnancy.\\"  At a time when black gay men are dying from disproportionate number of AIDS, this was scary to me as a reader.  This author is being absolutely irresponsible.  This book is downright dangerous. <br />His lover speaks completely in hip-hop jargon, yet he's supposed to be a successful real estate agent in the Bay Area.  He's supposed to be masculine (read: butch) yet he's constantly watching E!, the cable channel.  He doesn't support the main character's pregnancy, yet the main character decides to name \\"their\\" son after him.  This couple goes from barely speaking to each other to getting married out of nowhere.  I have never heard of a fictional couple more in need of serious counseling, yet it never takes place here.  The main character barely mentions doing actual work at his job, yet he can spend $6,000 in one visit to a baby's store.   <br />One of the first things the main character mentions is that he saw and loved the film \\"Before Night Falls.\\"  He is constantly checking out and flirting with Latino men.  Black-brown romance is rarely brought up in fiction; that was refreshing to see.  However, the main character repeatedly disses or rejects Latino men and stays true to his black boyfriend though he's not a very good partner.  Latino readers may be offended by gay LatinO portrayals here. <br />The author peppers the book with scandals and music from 1999 to 2001.  This gave a realistic flavor to the book, though it also seemed like a long product placement. <br />Vernacular that is probably rich and touching in real life comes off as poor writing here.  The main character has dreams that are nothing but page filler.  He asks long soliloquies of questions.  Unlike with Shakespeare, it doesn't work here; again, it's just page filler.  The ending is rushed. <br />This is not a strong first novel.  Like many black gay men, I am desperate for writing that reflect my live and those of my brothers.  This does not happen in this book.  There are so many realistic topics to bring up about black gay men, yet the author chooses this ridiculous route.  I feel sorry for the GBM authors that haven't gotten published when this has. <br />This book takes a circuitous route in thematizing the issue of rebirth.  However, it is done poorly here.  I doubt any reader will want to take a new direction in his life after reading this text.  This is not redemptive; it's just silly.	2004-10-19

This was Spring of 1994 in Providence, Rhode Island.  Though he spoke of being openly (...)and how voters can protect pro-choice provisions, when members of the International Socialist Organization made a comment, he growled at them.  He wasn't the cuddly, chubby bear that he appears to be.    In this book, he says Democrats keep losing presidential races because they cave into too easily to their dedicated leftist members.  This was written before Clinton got into office and way before Bush, Jr. was the president.  However, it's still timely as the November 2004 election approaches.  I would not be surprised one bit if Clinton, and later Lieberman, took advice from this book.  You'd almost think Frank was a campaign organizer or lobbyist rather than an elected official from the ideas he proposes.    In a time when even the media portrays anyone who identifies as \\"liberal\\" as being scary, Mr. Frank proudly does so.  He doesn't cave into this postmodern mumbo-jumbo about fearing labels.  Still, he demonizes people on the left for no reason.  When we have Limbaughs, and Lotts, and Santorums, why chastise some of the Democratic Party's most faithful voters?  Why marginalize and otherize anyone?    This book is easy to read.  Though most lawlerly writing is boring and confusing, this was the fun style of lawyerly writing that anyone can finish quickly.  I think undergraduates that quote this book will look good in front of their political science professors.	2004-10-11

The devastating impact of AIDS on black gay men is apparent here:  not only is the book dedicated to the deceased such as Essex Hemphill and Assoto Saint, but also 2 of the 11 poets had already succumbed to the virus.  With all this talk of \\"SGL,\\" \\"thugz\\", and \\"the down low,\\" it may surprise many that there are many black men who do identify as gay.  The poetry here is short.

However, every man in this book is young, thin, and handsome.  I hate seeing older gay men, fat gay men, and the guys who wouldn't be asked to model for a magazine not being portrayed here.  This \\"metrosexualization\\" of gay men will ultimately be harmful to the community.

The first half discusses three types of homosexual relations found in a Costa Rican jail.  This will be the section that non-academic readers will enjoy.  It's fun reading about men in a Latin American country saying, \\"Yup!  I love relations with dudes.\\"  Some of the interviews are filled with wild, sexy tales that will set your imaginations on fire.  However, this book has many disturbing examples of prisoners abusing men and women, sexually and non-sexually, both in jail and outside of it.  Though not writing in Spanglish, many colorful colloquialism shine through in the translations here. <br /> <br />The latter half consists of policy recommendations to curb the transmission of AIDS in Costa Rican jails.  Academics and policy wonks may prefer this section.  The author conducted self-improvment and AIDS education workshops for these prisoners.  Obviously biased, he recounts how the interviewees thought the programs were phenomenally helpful.  Some of this policy recommendations do not have the slightest chance of being enacted.  Still, it is good that ideas are tossed around from well-intentioned observations.  This book may be helpful for prison officials in the United States as well as AIDS activists that want to improve their outreach to American Latino MSM. <br /> <br />Many books on Latin American gay men say that heterogenderal relationships are the norm, but egalitarian couples (also called \\"internacionales\\") are becoming seen.  Here, the author suggests that class is the basic determinant for which homosexuality is most common.  This book gives clear evidence of how both types can exist in a Latin American country.  Still, the older type (in this book called \\"cacherismo\\") wants to see the newer type wiped out.  And heterogenderal coupling is not made to look respectful here.  Thus, despite thinkers who argue that there are homosexualities, rather than homosexuality, those men within those models still fight to ensure their way of loving remains the norm.   <br /> <br />I now understand why the author writes to prolifically on gay men in Latin America.  This book is a fun, quick read at the same time that it grapples with competent anthropology and decent policymaking.	2004-09-20

It's not only about lesbians of color, a triply-oppressed minority group, but about how social workers can aid them. <br /> <br />The editor said she solicited articles and these are the only 7 that she got.  You can feel the gleaning taking place.  The book is short, as are the chapters.   <br /> <br />It's fascinating how most contributors prioritize sexual orientation of the 3 characteristics.  However, the books makes quite clear that lesbians of color could lead easier lives if there were less class equality, more affirmative action, and more pay for women's work.  In the light that sexuality is emphasized here, white lesbian allies and allies that are gay men of color may find this book much more useful that straight women of color and other groups that share similarities with lesbians of color. <br /> <br />The chapters are just not well done.  One researcher asked several social workers to describe the needs of lesbians of color, gay men of color, white lesbians, and white gay men.  She then just describes what the interviewees said about lesbians of color.  Why make them describe the other groups if you are just going to throw the results out and fail to do anything comparative?  One article is about adopted lesbians; however, of the 13 women interviewed, only 2 were of color.  The author says little about transracial adoption specifically in her piece.  Yes, the author rightfully says not enough has been written about adopted lesbians, but why bring the issue up if you are not going to specifically talk about adopted lesbians of color?  Further, with the exception of Latina lesbians, the specific needs of black lesbians, Native lesbians, and Asian lesbians are not spelled out here in the slightest. <br /> <br />In so many ways, this book is the female counterpart to Longres' \\"Men of Color.\\"  That book is sooooo much better than this one.  It's long; the articles are strong; specific concerns of black, Latino, Native, and Asian gay men are spelled out.  This book pales in comparison, almost embarassingly so. <br /> <br />There have been so many fantastic lesbians of color writing in the United States:  Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Paula Gunn Allen, Merle Woo, Gloria Anzaldua.  It just does not make sense for this anthology to be so poor.	2004-09-05
536653:US	49989755	RT49A7GPRVCN6	1560232587	592660598	Everyday Mutinies: Funding Lesbian Activism (Monograph Published Simultaneously As the Journal of Lesbian Studies, 3)	Books	4	0	2	N	N	lesbian activism	This anthology proposes discussing how lesbians fund lesbian-specific activism.  Activism is broadly defined here, ranging from the arts, sciences, law, non-profit groups, publications, etc.  The writing styles here are diverse, ranging from personal narrative, question and answer, journalistic style, etc.  Unlike other books, the variety in styles works well here. <br /> <br />This book will introduce readers to key leaders in the lesbian community (Kate Kendell, Jewelle Gomez, P. Lyons & D. Martin, etc.)  It will also cover prominent lesbian organizations such as the National Center for Lesbian Rights and 100 Lesbians and Their Friends. <br /> <br />The chapters are short.  Each interviewee and interviewer has a page-length photo.  I am sure this was done for egalitarian purposes.  Haworth Press tends to have summaries and keywords for each chapter in their books.  This eats up page space.  Each chapter here had lesbianism, lesbian activism, and fundraising as keywords.  They could have been more concise by just mentioning these terms in the introduction.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the reader has to glean fundraising ideas from this book.  You won't find a \\"Top 10 List for Raising Money for Lesbian Causes\\" here.  Each chapter talks more about the individual lesbian's personal journey into activism.  You get ideas but you have to read for them carefully.  The book is a little bit preachy.  Almost every chapter urges lesbians to not fear asking straights for money and to not look as money as an evil patriarchal tool.  At a time when non-profits are hiring development directors more than any other positions, this is a let-down.  People not interested in activism won't like this book, but people who are, regardless of gender or sexuality, will. <br /> <br />This book also provides almost nothing for middle-class lesbians or those lesbians who want to stay in the middle class.  The book mentions two types of activists:  donors that inherit huge fortunes who can thenuse that money for lesbian empowerment or lesbians who forgo sturdy wages and either go on welfare or earn poverty-level wages in order to have the time to do activism.  For those who are not incredibly rich or don't want to be poor, there is little here for advice. <br /> <br />Many lesbian activists and theorists have asked themselves, \\"What are we first:  women or gay people?\\"  This book solidly chooses the former.  Many of the contributors started off in feminist activism and then moved to the lesbian counterpart.  Work or alliance with gay men is hardly brought up at all.  Many women are now running national gay and lesbian organizations right now (Urvashi Vaid, Cheryl Jacques, Joo-Hyun Kim), yet these lesbians and their work isn't brought up at all.  Similarly, straight women will find this book much more useful than gay men. <br /> <br />This book was a novel idea.  It wasn't perfect, but it's still nice.  I do think lesbians interested in activism should peep it.	2004-09-01

It has diverse chapters, essays on cosmetic surgery, gun lovers, leathermen, etc.  Unfortunately, it's descriptive, rather than analytical, and just feels like pages upon pages of \\"yak, yak, yak.\\"  The author tries to be funny often and usually fails.

Mapplethorpe's \\"Black Book.\\"  However, this photo book is not inspiring.  There are much better responses to Mapplethorpe out there than this.  (Essex Hemphill's poem in \\"Looking for Langston\\" for example.) <br /> <br />There's a long history of gay photographers showing black men and white men in homoerotic poses together.  With Rotimi's title, you would think he's doing the same thing.  First off, few if not none of the works here show black men and white men together here.  Secondly, the book is about 90% black men.  He should have titled this book \\"Black Men with a Few White Guys for Novelty.\\"  I really think the title is meant to lure in the white purchaser of his work, rather than truly centering black men as artistic subjects. <br /> <br />Finally, the photos are not that great.  One photo could be described as an insult to Mother Africa.  Just because black men are being portrayed doesn't make the work transgressive.  I was deeply disappointed in this book.  I predict than many others will be too.	2004-08-29

It has a nice cover and some really interesting chapters.  I liked this book much better than Guttman's \\"Changing Men.\\"  A Puerto Rican press with ties to AIDS funding published this book.  I wonder if not having a mainland distributor somehow limited the publisher's reach.  !Que lastima! <br /> <br />The book is subtitled \\"Working Papers.\\"  This practically sounds like a professor xeroxed students' term papers and just threw them in a binder after putting punchholes in each page.  This book is for the most part quite polished.  It has a nice mix of contributors:  male and female; Caribbean and American; graduate students and full professors.  The contributors look at song lyrics, elections, prison inmates, and nomenclature to discuss masculinity in this region.  The chapters vary widely in terms of length and complexity.  Perhaps this is why the anthology is humbly presented as just \\"working papers.\\" <br /> <br />A good portion of this book is simply how to conduct men's studies research in the Caribbean, period.  The authors are very conscious of this as a new terrain.  Upon reading the table of contents, one would think only the last chapter deals with gay men in this area.  However, gay relations, gay identity (or lack thereof), and homophobia are themes constantly presented in this book.  This book is sufficiently representative of the Caribbean, covering the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking, machos and non-machos, as aforementioned men of various sexualities, etc.  However, there is nothing on Cuba.  I wonder if its status as a Communisti country somehow makes it unique in terms of gender, or doing research period.  Richard Parker's chapter was unnecessary as it dealt exclusively with Brazil and not the Caribbean.  I wonder if they included him just for the name recognition.  Commentators on the Caribbean in other books havestrongly stated that issues of gender cannot be separated from race and class matters.  However, in this book, only one or two chapters bring those matters up.  That is a bit of a letdown. <br /> <br />I truly applaud this book, wish the best for its contributors, and encourage all to read it.	2004-08-23

This book tries to break that mode by discussing working-class white men, Choctaw men, and African-American men. Usually, cultural critics and literary critics embrace gender studies, rather than historians. Here, however, historians juggle this ball with positive results. This book cover topics like literacy, slave escapes, humor, unions, military schools, inter alia. The authors are male and female, despite this being a men's studies text. <br /> <br />The book strictly covers the post-revolution and pre-Emancipation era. Those looking for a talk on modern Souther masculinity must turn elsewhere. This book does represent the entire South, rather than focusing on one state and assuming that it was representative of all of them. <br /> <br />The book states interesting things about Southern, white men. Not only did Southern men purposely differentiate themselves from their Northern counterparts, they also strictly saw themselves as not European. The changing economics of the South is also analyzed, noting how it changed concepts of manhood accordingly. <br /> <br />The book is not flawless. The first chapter, \\"Refuge of Manhood,\\" details how Southern voluntary soldiers distanced themselves from women and African Americans and demanded guns and uniforms. However, these two concepts are never really brought together. The chapter ends up just being a laundry list. In \\"Fraternity and Masculinity,\\" the author attempts to compare white artisans to black ones. However, she focuses much more on whites than blacks and never once explains why or bothers to note this as a problem. <br /> <br />The best chapter is \\"The Absent Subject: African American Masculinity and Forced Migration.\\" In it, the author says that whites and Northern blacks looked at slaves as fools and eunuchs for not running away or committing suicide. Here, Edward Baptist gives precise details how male slaves often created their sense of manhood by caring for women and children or doing shoddy work on the plantation. They also embraced Christianity, hoping the afterlife would be the promised paradise the Bible suggests. As a black person whose grandparents did not leave the South until the tail end of the Great Migration, I was blown away by this piece. Big applause for Edward E. Baptist. <br /> <br />Sometimes the chapters felt like they were all details and little analysis. The chapters are quite short but are well-written. Readers will applaud the contributors because surely this dated information would be hard for any person, even academics, to find.	2004-08-21

Unfortunately, they don't have much to say either.  The chapters here are incredibly short.  This book was the result of a conference.  This becomes obvious when reading so many of the entries that sound like speeches, rather than well-elaborated texts meant for reading. <br /> <br />Some articles are brilliant.  For example, the narrative from an older transgendered person almost brought me to tears, and to action.  The books last chapter on homeless, HIV-positive, older gay men was also eye-opening.  Still, one article seemed like an advertisement for a visual clinic, that wasn't even gay-specific.  In fact, much in this book would apply to all senior citizens, not just the gay ones.  One chapter that seemed like it would talk about intergenerational couples in film went on to discuss this group in biography and real life.  Why not put it in the title of the chapter then?   <br /> <br />The book is written by a mix of men and women.  However, the chapters are male-dominated, thought the editors' seem to have gender equality as a goal.  This is shocking given that women live longer than men, regardless of sexual identity.  Some chapters did not discuss people of color at all.  However, others did so impressively, but you wouldn't know it from their chapter titles. <br /> <br />This was a nice book to get the conversation going.  However, it has many rough edges.	2004-08-21

Since so many conservatives think that racism no longer exists, the market will cure all evils, and blacks do poorly because of individual rather than social failures, Dr. Royster puts these ideas to the test.  She interviews 25 white men and 25 black men who studied the same vocational courses at the same high school to see if they did just as well in the marketplace.  Though the black men get just as good grades and attend classes just as much, their individual initiative does not explain why their white counterparts consistently found jobs easier, were paid more, worked in fields in which they prepared, and were just generally better off. <br /> <br />So many people nowadays feel that racism is so nebulous in the post-civil rights era that surely it must not exist.  Dr. Royster explodes this idea and gives American racism a real face.  In this study, white employers would forgive white males with criminal backgrounds but condemn black men in the same situation.  White teachers gave black males verbal support but they only went out of their way to find actual jobs for white, male students.  White males had tons of contacts who could find them jobs, no questions asked; while black men were consistently asked to prove their skills and proceed through bureaucracy.  White male job applicants met white employers in predominantly-white parks, golf courses, churches, and many other places where few black males would have access.  White employers would rather tell white applicants \\"You didn't get hired due to affirmative action\\" rather than \\"You were far from the most qualified person.\\"  The only successful black in this study said he has to constantly grin and bow and that white co-workers purposely used racist epithets hoping to make him explode and get fired.  Though white males unanimously agreed that \\"who you know\\" gets you into doors, they never once realize that they know more well-off peopole than black men.  In addition, though white males consistently fared better than their black counterparts, white employers would continually imply that they must give preferential treatment to them to counteract affirmative action policies. <br /> <br />This book is well-written and sophisticated, though I think lay readers will be able to understand it generally.  This book doesn't become overly descriptive and fall into simple narrative.  The first individual interviewee discussed isn't brought up until page 66 of this 200-paged book. <br /> <br />Dr. Royster stated that she originally intended to interview black and white females as well, but didn't due to time constraints and a lack of an interviewing pool.  Thus, this is men's studies by default.  Still, since the trades mentioned here are predominantly male, this exclusion makes sense.  In fact, Dr. Royster suggests that black males have limited contacts because they can only go to similarly-classed black women, rather than the powerful white male mentors that young white males had.  This was a fascinating gender politic. <br /> <br />Dr. Royster describes herself as \\"a very, light-skinned African American.\\"  Hence, white subjects revealed things to her that she is sure they wouldn't have revealed to a phenotypically black researcher.  This undercover interviewing is fascinating, but lead to truthful and accurate results. <br /> <br />Though a new scholar, Dr. Royster critiques the most famous living black sociologist, Dr. W.J. Wilson, yet he even has to admit that her research is excellent.  (See the back cover of the book.) <br /> <br />I wasn't expecting this book to be a sociological study.  I thought it would be a history of racism in labor movements and unions.  Still, I was not displeased by the results.  I am a better person for having found and read this text.  Big applause to Dr. Royster.	2004-08-17

However, few commentators or academics have discussed gays in Iceland.  This book tries to break that ice (pun intended).  It consists of narratives of gay men and lesbians of various ages discussing coming out, finding love, and fighting homophobia. <br /> <br />This book is incredibly simplistic.  There is no analysis here whatsoever.  This is very much meant for lay readers, rather than scholars.  The chapters are quite short.  What few photos there are  are grainy and poorly produced.  There are many photos of the contributors as children, yet this was not specifically a gay youth text.  While there have been many books on gay Asia written by whites (Peter Jackson's \\"Dear Uncle Go\\", Bret Hirsch's \\"Passions of the Cut Sleeve\\", and Gary Leupp's \\"Male Colors\\" are examples), this is the first time I've seen an Asian person write on gay Europe.  The book was narrated in English and linguistic errors were kept.  They are cute and do add flavor.  But when you read it, in your head, you'll think a gay Arnold Schwartzenegger was doing the narrating. <br /> <br />This is a very slim, quickly consumible text.  One reason for that is there is little about which to comment.  Iceland has very  gay-accepting laws.  The editor mentions that gays can't adopt, but there are few children to adopt in Iceland anyway.  This island with its small, homogenous population just has no reason to abuse its own, no matter what the sexual identity. <br /> <br />This book ends with a photo of men carrying a bear flag.  I think leather and bears are being conflated here, but it's nice seeing the movement be international.	2004-08-17

Professor Duggan taught a gay studies course that I took at Brown University and she was so awesome.  I read this book about two years after taking that class.  I think the times that cultural studies scholars and legal scholars get together are pretty rare, so this is an excellent example of collaborative potential.  This book asks and answers many questions.  For example, why did most feminist historians not join anti-porn movements?  The discussion on the Supreme Court's \\"Bowers\\" decision may seem dated in light of \\"Romer\\" and \\"Lawrence,\\"  but at the time it was pretty eye-opening.  I think I may have cited it for a sociology paper.  Duggan takes a swipe at Joan Scott that makes me wonder how progressive academics gossiped about it.  This is a wonderful collection by two tremendous scholars and I highly recommend that many critically-conscious people peep it.	2004-08-10

Dealing with privilege is necessary, but difficult.  Men's studies and critical white studies are very informative fields.  However, those scholars walk a fine line and must avoid assuming that men have it bad just like women or whites with people of color. <br /> <br />Here, an analogy of AIDS and gay men is potent/present.  In this book, the contributors point to HIV-negative men who feel guilty about seeing people die and \\"surviving the epidemic.\\"  This fear, and sometimes obsession, is making some men think, \\"Let me become positive so I can stop the worrying.\\"  This counterproductive worrying can cost lives, so the contributors rightly argue that HIV-negative men need the space to describe their trepidations.  Until there is a cure, prevention is the key and counseling these men is a great prevention strategy.   <br /> <br />Still, this book falls apart quickly.  It's a very small text with few chapters.  I think that is so because there is little to say here.  The chapters head in disparate directions, and yet, it's still a repetitive book.  This book is really just for therapists to talk to other therapists.  Only the personal narratives near the beginning will be useful for wider audiences. <br /> <br />I think this phenomenon is restricted to a very limited populations.  The authors are mostly from AIDS epicenters like NYC and SF.  Most of them worked in AIDS organizations for years, especially in the first decade of the epidemic.  At a time, when statistics say a huge number of gay men don't know they are positive and many don't know any person with full blown AIDS, the concerns expressed in this book cannot possibly be deemed widespread.  Thus, only a certain type of reader would enjoy or relate to this book. <br /> <br />Most of the chapters are highly flawed.  Alex Carballo-Dieguez, an amazing, outstanding Latino AIDS researcher, has a chapter here.  However, most of his chapter details homophobia in Latin America.  He only does a cursory job in answering whether Latino men in the US would have the same fears that the white non-Hispanic contributors describe.  I think this chapter was meant to add a multicultural flare to the discussion, but it feels contrived.  Still, a Jewish gay man has a personal narrative in this book and a director of GMAD, Gay Men of African Descent, is quoted.  So there is some diversity. <br /> <br />Peter Newman tries to apply postmodern theory to this question.  He argues that safer sex ads can't help positive and negative men at the same time.  This chapter felt like whining.  It doesn't understand how you have to work with what you got and make lemonade when handed lemons.  At the end of his chapter, Newman even confesses that his discussion is just mental stroking.  Just because no strategy is perfect, doesn't mean a critique like this is necessarily constructive. <br /> <br />Most importantly, this book can be dangerous.  It rightfully admits that some gay men are burnt out by \\"always condoms, all the time.\\"  However, this book implies that two monogamous men can do without them.  No way!:  in a time when men are cheating on spouse of either gender and bringing AIDS home, no one can afford to make a compromise here.  Even if there is condom fatigue, there is no effective solution in stopping the virus from spreading. <br /> <br />I do not recommend this book at all.  There are better AIDS education publications out there.  For real, this book is downright dangerous.	2004-08-09

The chapters are precise, well-written, and wel-edited. <br /> <br />This book reminds me of Trevisan's \\"Perverts in Paradise\\" (Brazil) and Gevisser's \\"Defiant Desire\\" (South Africa).  Like many books that try to define sexual orientation issues for a country, it brings up deceased gay writers, living gay writers, current gay rights battles, and essays from current gay community activists. <br /> <br />Unlike its American couterparts, this book says little about straight female homophobia or gay male sexism.  In fact, gay men are rarely mentioned at all, neither as allies nor oppressors.  I think this may be an attempt to focus on lesbians and not take any swipes at any other groups.  Then too, this book mentions very little actual lesbophobia.  Never is it mentioned that New Zealand has a \\"Bowers v. Hardwick\\" like the United States or a Clause 28 like Great Britain.  Many of the studies analyzed seemed like they were conducted using government funds.  This book makes lesbian life in New Zealand look nice, though the contributors never clearly state this. <br /> <br />Because New Zealand is a multicultural society, I was concerned whether this book would reflect that diversity.  Though the only explicit Maori chapter was fluff, other contributors make sure not to portray lesbianism as only white.  The editor comes out as biracial.  One contributor analyzes the work of an Indo-European, lesbian author.  Others bring up Maori matters often.  I am impressed by this effort. <br /> <br />This book does do a lot of gleaning.  American lesbian academics like Robson, Faderman, and Lorde are quoted often.  I think they'd be proud to discover that their writings have an international audience.  Still, in this book, New Zealand lesbians have to appropriate much from straight women's studies and American and British lesbians' texts in order to define themselves.  This fleshing out illustrates that New Zealand lesbians must see themselves as having a lot in common with all women in their nation and with English-speaking lesbians around the globe.	2004-08-09

In this work, Dr Mari Yoshihara struggles with that issue as she attempts to flesh out and analyze what happened when fin-de-siecle, class-privileged, white women &quot;embraced the East&quot; or supported and practiced Orientalism. <br />  <br /> In this book, Professor Yoshihara (a Brown alumna) jumps genres and mixes mediums. She demonstrates a strong knowledge of how Orientalism impacted business, material art, literature, anthropology, and vice versa. She proves her strong understanding of the histories and cultures of the United States, Japan, and China. This juggling is one of the resons why I love American studies and think the discipline has so much potential. This book continually brings up race, class, and gender simultaneously: Michael Dyson was correct in saying that bell hooks has to stop patting herself on the back for being a scholar able to do this. This was an impressive interdisciplinary book that should be of interest to women's studies majors, Asian Americaninsts, and comparative ethnic studies scholars alike. <br />  <br /> On the one hand, a famed white actress who performed in yellowface also helped send nurses to wartorn Japan and A. Smedley applauded Chinese communists for their goals. On the other hand, Amy Lowell excluded Chinese women from her poetry anthology and white female artists purposely portrayed Asian women as submissive and stereotypical. Still, Yoshihara stresses that the women discussed were neither hardened racists or iconic anti-racists. Their success depended on Westerners who wanted to see these images and continues to this day by Asian scholars that are honored by this attention to them and their predecessors. This book demonstrates how power comes from all sources and social constructionism affects every phenomenon. <br />  <br /> Yoshihara admits that the United States, China, and Japan are and were patriarchal. Though other academics have condemned discussions that conflate gender with sexuality, here she consistently brings up both topics and illustrates their intense interconnectedness. While the author only looks at Orientalism via Japan and China, she sets up a framework for others to discuss other nations. In &quot;Playboys in Paradise,&quot; the author mentions 1950s Americans' fascination with Polynesia. I think a grad student could write a great work on Orientalism during the Vietnam War based upon Dr. Yoshihara's work. <br />  <br /> In the text, the Professor states that she is only talking about upper-class women. She may have wanted to admit this in her title then. You can barely differentiate between quotes and text because she only left aligns them, rather than italicizing them or indenting quotes on both the left and the right. I, and I think most modern Western readers, were more familiar with the topics in the last few chapters. Thus, I wonder why this scholar placed the most recognizable material at the end.  <br />  <br /> Professor Yoshihara is trying to avoid the black-white paradigm, but I think a mention of black-white race relations would have added, rather than distorted, her examination. Ruth Benedict wrote inaccurate gendered inaccurate reports about Japan that seem very similar to Patrick Moynihan's attack on African-American families. Mari mentions that white women sometimes wore Asian garb just to do something new. As a reader, I wondered why she did not contrast this with white men who paraded around in blackface for very purposeful racist ends. Works by Marjorie Garber and Eric Lott exist for the writer to flesh out this comparison. She discusses patronizing white female artists and their relations with East Asians of both genders. This reminds me much of Carl Van Vechten's dynamic with Harlem Renaissance writers or Jean Genet's rapport with the Black Panthers. <br />  <br /> The author leaves otherthings unexplored that I would have addressed. For example, she doesn't bring up regionalism. Most Asians historically have lived on the West Coast. Were white women there more likely to embrace them or reject them than, say, white women in Boston? On page 64, a white female painter's depiction of a Japanese mother holding her child to a mother. In the painting, you see the baby's face so close to the mother that her face becomes invisible. This seems like a blatant Orientalist attempt to equate Asian women with children, yet Yoshihara doesn't bring it up. <br />  <br /> This book is awesome and Professor Yoshihara obviously has an exciting career ahead of her. This book will help modern readers to think about films like &quot;Kill Bill, Part One,&quot; Madonna's videos and concerts, Bjork's album covers, and the &quot;Notes of a Geisha&quot; novel. I can't recommend this work enough.	2004-08-03

When one sees &quot;Black Women/White Men,&quot; one would think of a collaboration. In fact, if black women are mentioned first, one would think that they are leading the dynamic. However, none of this could possibly be said about the legalized rape of enslaved African-descent women. The subtitle is more appropriate; this could have just been called, &quot;The Sexual Exploitation of Female Slaves.&quot; <br />  <br /> Then again, that assumes that the author had this as a main theme. This book barely covers that theme at all. This book was about the oppression of African slaves, period, one aspect of which is legalized rape. Because sugar cane cultivation involves heavy lifting and uses of dangerous weapons, the slave trade in the Caribbean was highly gendered, and gendered toward men. So naturally, the author talks more of the abuse against slave men, reiterating the silliness of the book's title. <br />  <br /> I was expecting this book to talk about the Sally Hemings and Thomas Jeffersons of the Caribbean and I imagine that most readers would imagine the same. However, that history was quickly summarized in one page in the middle of this book. I really think the author gave this book its deceptive title, dare I say it, in order to appear like he's discussing a &quot;sexy&quot; issue.  <br />  <br /> When I think about colonialism, I usually think of it as solely a British, French, and Spanish phenomenon. So I was intrigued to be reminded that the Danish had empiric aspirations as well. However, this book stated that the Danish were never heavily involved in settling the islands discussed. The Danish West Indies became the American Virgin Islands, so this is Black American history and should be recognized as such, especially for those interested in African-American history like myself. <br />  <br /> The book is riddled with spelling errors. I am not sure if that arose due to the author's use of English as a second language or thelimited resources of the press that printed this book. The author quotes ad nauseam to limited historians and hisotrical figures. Now, to his credit, maybe little has been written about these islands and their histories. Still, after awhile, it feels like the reader is getting a skewed and strikingly incomplete examination of the topic. The author compares the Danish Caribbean situation to its French counterpart in Saint Domigue (aka Haiti). However, he barely mentions anything about the islands' Spanish-speaking neighbors. Surely this is due to a lack of understanding of Spanish on the author's part. With Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic all in this same area, it seems like a major fallacy to exclude them in a comparative analysis. <br />  <br /> I am glad this book exists. However, it is second-rate and I predict that it will disappoint many as I was.	2004-08-02

It's a lifespan text, ranging from childhood memories to the aging process.  One of the last sections is on gay men and aging.  This ads to the growing and needed literature on older gay men.  This book is full of exercises and thus might not go as in depth as readers who want to delve deeply into various topics.  Key issues covered here are drug recovery, AIDS, depression, etc.  The author works out of New Mexico, rather than San Francisco, so I think he's probably had to work with gay men that have had to face much homophobia outside of many coastal, liberal environments.	2004-07-20

Professor Hill Collins asserts that Black Americans will not be able to advance at the rate they could unless they develop a progressive gender politics.  Many activist black women have critiqued the overall community for not taking gender issues seriously.  Still, this book gives it a fresh perspective that takes multiple identities into account, especiall in the post-civil rights era.<br />Hill Collins does a fantastic job in stressing that Black Americans are not a monolithic group.  In her discussion about the media, she looks at black portrayals dividing depictions by gender and class-based groups.  In discussing marriage, she analyzes \\"same race, opposite gender\\" mandates as they affect straight sistas, straight brothas, and Black gay men and lesbians separately.  She understands that identities do not work in isolation by sit side by side continually interacting with each other.<br />Hill Collins does an excellent job in showing how all Black people are affected by any oppression.  She shows that straight Blacks are harmed by heterosexism too since that same system that deems gays deviants deem Blacks globally as hypersexual.  In a chapter on gender violence, she claims that Black men who dismiss the rape of Black women may feel differently given that so many Black men are being raped in jails.  <br />Many talking heads say that older Americans are not as eager to employ new technologies.  However, Hill Collins, a graying woman, does well in mentioning how the internet and other new technologies are affecting Black folk.  Her analysis of J.Lo, the film \\"Booty Call\\", and the rap \\"Get Yo' Freak On\\" shows that she is very knowledgeable about youth culture.<br />I was disappointed how little sexual orientation matters got brought up in her \\"Fighting Words.\\"  However, in this book, she demonstrates thoroughly that she stands against homophobia.  Not only is there a whole chapter dedicated to condemning heterosexism, gay issues are laced into every chapter.  Like Guy-Sheftall's recent work, she is really trying to push Black thinkers that only want to talk about race, class, and gender (purposely in that order) to the exclusion of sexual orientation.  She even praises media depictions of Black lesbian and gay characters.<br />It's funny that bell hooks is the most famous Black feminist when Hill Collins outshines her here by leaps and bounds.  Hill Collins isn't as repetitive and demeaning.  Her work isn't dependent upon personal anecdotes.  She takes sexual orientation seriously and not just as a side issue.  She dedicated to helping Black gays and lesbians and not just yelling that straight Blacks aren't homophobic.  I can't wait for the day when Hill Collins gets all the credit she deserves.<br />Many might not like this book.  She offers many critiques and close to no concrete solutions.  The introductory chapter is full of caveats and can be easily skipped.  Hill Collins cites Cathy Cohen, Dorothy Roberts, Professor Guy-Sheftall, and other progressive womanists so frequently, one may wonder what original ideas she is even proposing.  Her discussion of blacks in the media is overly pessimistic.  <br />Still, I loved this book.  I think both academic and common readers will be able to digest it and find it useful.  I predict great things ahead for this right-on sista.	2004-07-14

There is one article on India, but all the rest focus on sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.  Though this book focuses on men, most of the contributors are women.  A professor of men's studies once wrote in a book that mostly women take his courses, so this doesn't surprise me.<br />The chapters have many important thoughts.  They point to how completed the issue of gender and work is, especially for poor countries with high unemployment and low GDPs.  The problem is that this book is a little boring.  The cover is dull.  The chapters wonder a bit.  <br />This may be a helpful books for sociology and development studies majors.  Nevertheless, most others will find the book pretty useless.	2004-07-12

This book not only brings up gender matters, but Jewish identity, obesity, intellectualism, the birth rate, among others.  <br />The reader can instantly tell that the author had to read much information in order to come up with his thorough and concise descriptions.  I am always frustrated that historians haven't picked up many of the important contributions from cultural studies.  This book, however, was a good mix of history, Jewish studies, and gender studies.<br />This book brings up fascinating phenomena.  For example, the author stated that stereotypes of French Jewish men as less manly were so pervasive that to call a Jewish man &quot;unmanly&quot; could automatically be understood as both patriarchal and anti-Semitic.  Male Dreyfusards considered themselves the saviors of a female Truth, yet discouraged actual women from being too vocal in support of their cause.<br />This book will make you think about modern problems.  Articles say that anti-Semitism is on the rise in France just as in the 1890s.  Modern Americans worry about sedentary, middle-class jobs just as the French did more than a century ago.<br />Despite being impressed with this book, I know that it will frustrate many.  The author freely admits that he does not solve whether Dreyfus committed treason or not and that his focus is upon the undercurrents of the debate.  Still, social conditions in France are covered more than the Dreyfus Affair.  Dreyfusards are analyzed more so than Dreyfus himself.  Non-Jewish thinkers are discussed more than Jewish ones.  This book goes into descriptions of physique magazines and urban crowds way afield of the main discussion.  Each chapter foreshadows a talk about French author Emile Zola and then in the Zola chapter, the author is only brought up in a few pages.  The remoteness of Forth's discussion is going to frustrate many readers.  This will only reaffirm ideas that historians shouldn't dabble into gender matters and other sociocultural issues.	2004-06-30

I felt that this book was fairly accessible, but the academic and heavily sociological tone may turn off some readers.<br />This book tries hard to be inclusive.  Though about gay men's masculinity, it brings up women, feminine gay men, and even straight men.  Unlike much work that can only investigate one axis of identity, this book brings up age, class, and race well.  It has impressive works on Latino and Asian-American gay men.  However, I was disappointed that there was no chapter on black gay men.  Some readers may be disappointed that bisexual men are not really covered here and that gay men are consistently contrasted with straight men as if the two categories were exhaustive.  Chapters discussed populations in Spokane, Southern California, and Texas.  With the exception of New York City, this book seemed very West Coast-focused.  That's probably due to the editor's residence, but the point is that this book's conclusions might not be true all over the nation.<br />This book was a decent mix of men's studies, gay studies, and sociology.	2004-06-16

He principly looks at the role that men's magazines Esquire and Playboy played in this phenomena.  Still, he examines film, history, and other items caused this too.<br />This was a unique blend of history and cultural studies.  For readers that look down on cultural studies as fluff, this book has much \\"concrete\\" information for them to appreciate.<br />I appreciated most that despite the all-encompassing title, the author both emphasizes that this was a middle-class white trend at the same time that he does write women and people of color into the picture.  For instance, he mentions that Helen Gurlie Browne was the female Hugh Hefner; he adds that \\"Ebony\\" does much of what \\"Esquire\\" does.  In discussing exotica, the author not only brings up the American fascination with Polynesia, but with Britain as well.<br />The author avoids viewing men as a monolithic category.  He stresses that youth or the valorization of youth was employed as a tool to get grown men to spend.<br />The author is a British academic.  It's funny to read a book about the United States with words like \\"programme,\\" \\"colour,\\" and \\"enrolment\\" in it.  Further, I'm impressed that an academic outside the US had access to so much American material.  An American who wrote a similar book on any other country couldn't have done so with out a sabbatical to that land.<br />This book may frustrate Marxists.  The brief, somewhat flippant introduction tries to address this, but not really.  Hearing about men spending money and buying butter (rather than guns) may make one think the author is celebrating this trend, rather than just reporting on it.  Though this book is positive, rather than normative, some readers that resent American materialism may have difficulty processing through this book.<br />This book definitely sees heterosexuality and doesn't just take it as a privileged given.  The author constantly has to mention that advertisers had to convince straight male shoppers that buying leisure items didn't make them gay.  Still, homophobia is not cited enough here.  The question of where this leaves gay male consumers is never even a thought here.<br />The author quotes so much from Ehrenstein and Chudacoff that it may feel difficult to point to what new territory he is covering.<br />This book will help readers to think deeply about modern magazines like \\"Maxim\\" or current catchwords like \\"metrosexual.\\"  I highly recommended it to anyone interested in men's studies, American history, and the marketplace.	2004-06-07

Both professors and students quote hooks, Hall, and Bhabha all the time, yet few refer to Mercer's work.  I find this to be such a wasted opportunity.  In this collection, he writes on diverse topics such as Robert Mapplethorpe, black hair, Michael Jackson, etc.  I saw him once in person and he kinda reminds me of a black George Michael.  This was strong cultural studies that I think many black thinkers and gay thinkers (and when I say \\"thinkers\\" that includes \\"paper writers) should find useful.  I don't agree with all of his conclusions.  Still, there is so much  here that would make any paper in cultural criticism look very well informed.  My only question for the author would be:  \\"When are readers going to get more great works of yours like this out there?!\\"	2004-06-02

In this way this book was a much-needed intervention.  It divides into the following three parts:  sociology, cultural studies, and autobiography.<br />The book is pretty representative.  Firstly, it includes both Muslims and Jews:  most books cover either solely the former or the latter.  Women and gays are brought up.  It's geographically diverse, discussing Iraq, Turkey, Israel, Egypt, etc.  Like the editors, the contributors are both Arab and non-Arab.  Most importantly, this book covers all the topics one would imagine coming up in this area:  the military, circumcision, moustaches, heterosexual relationships, father-son dynamics, etc.<br />I have three opinions on the text.  First, readers will be surprised to see that these academics do not feign objectivity in the slightest.  They are very opinionated and critical.  Sexism, Saddam, and Gaza-based violence are called out and condemned very pointedly.  Second,  masochism comes up a lot here.  This book is filled with guys enduring pain solely because their communities expect them too.  Ouch!  Third, this book just wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.  I ended up reading it intermittently.<br />This book was written pre-911.  However, post-911 readers will still find it incredibly useful.  As more people become interested in the Mideast, let's hope they are interested in studying its intersection with gender matters.	2004-05-26

William Leap has written previously about the attributes of what he terms \\"gay English.\\"  Here, a collection of scholars ask and answer whether gay English has encompassed the globe.  Any person who is interested in issues of cultural imperialism, regardless of their sexual orientation may want to read this book.  <br />This book provides a good global sampling.  It moves from Western countries to non-Western ones to communities of color in the United States.  Some articles just ask whether the word \\"gay\\" is now being used in various countries and when.  Others asked how the concept of sexual orientation as an identity melds or clashes with old sexual categorizations in particular countries.  Some articles just detail what terms same-gender-loving people use in magazines and at clubs.  Others are deep comparative literature and ethnography which ask larger questionss about the society at large.  One of the great things about this book is that gay Americans who don't know much about other countries can learn about those countries generally as well as their LGBT communities here. <br />I am sure that William Leap had an original, revolutionary idea when he coined his term.  It doesn't surprise me that he would spearhead amassing articles from academics discussing the phenomenon globally.  However, so many contributors quote his work that I wonder if they had to cite him in order to be included here.  <br />Often times in books that cover global phenomena, the Western chapters are huge and the non-Western ones are scant.  The total opposite occurs here.  The articles on Germany and France were small.  The ones on Indonesia, Thailand, and communities of color in the US were huge.  In fact, in Indonesia, gay have invented their own language!  This begs the question of whether American or Anglo-American cultural imperialism is more of a concern outside the West, rather than inside it.  Still, the book consistently answers that foreigners are not just consuming American ideas hook, line, and sinker.  They are active agents who adapt concepts to their own prerogatives.<br />I do recommend this books to others.  It's academics but the chapters that cover one's own community may very well speak to you.  The communities of which you are not familiar may intrigue you as well.	2004-05-22

His primary purpose is to illustrate the severe homophobia in black Canadian communities and demonstrate how it hurt many black men.<br />He spends the beginning pages of his book emphasizing how unique and revolutionary his project is.  I think he patted himself on the back too much.  He quotes from Audre Lorde, Essex Hemphill, James Baldwin and many others who have already stated years ago what he is simply re-articulating.  This book reminds me a lot of \\"One of the Children\\" and \\"The Same River Twice.\\"  <br />What makes this unique is that he is speaking about Canada; lots of American black gay men and lesbians have written books like this.  In fact, I wish he would have spoken more about Canada.  He mentions nothing of the descendants of American slaves who fled to Canada; he only mentions blacks of Caribbean origin.  He doesn't really talk about immigration matters at all.  In a recent book on Pilipino gay men in the US, it was stressed that their immigration status weighed heavily on them; nothing is mentioned here.  In a time when Canada has legalized gay marriage and US has DOMA, this is a let-down.<br />He uses the term \\"same-sex\\" rather than \\"gay.\\"  Unfortunately this term is awkward.  Their is a different between same sex and same-sex loving.  I really think he would have benefitted from activist Cleo Managa's term \\"same-gender-loving\\" or SGL.  Readers must note that he never uses that disturbing epithet \\"queer.\\"  Further, he implies that \\"buller men\\" and \\"batty bwoys\\" are synonyms, but I wish he would have made it absolutely clear.<br />This book goes on and on about black homophobia.  First off, there are many straight, black academics that are gay allies.  He even qoutes Gates, hooks, and West (all of whom are American citizens).  I doubt this book would inspire straight blacks to take up homophobia as a crusade.  If he meant that there are no Canadian black straight allies, he should have said so explicitly.  His list of black homophobic writers seems like plagiarism from Simmons' \\"Challenges Facins the Black Gay Intellectual\\" from the \\"Brother to Brother\\" anthology.  Furthermore, white gay racism is for the most part not challenged or spelled out.<br />The body chapters are much more easy to read than the introduction.  Non-academic writers may want to start in the middle of the book.  He quotes much Caribbean patois that gives the interviews some flavor.  However, it is not as extensive as the Spanglish found in Moraga's or Anzaldua's books.  So those who don't know the lingo should not be afraid to go forward with this book.  He interviews two guys, one named Michelle and one named Loqueshia, yet he never discusses how the very flamboyant face different experiences from those who can be closeted.<br />Despite my critiques, I don't think there is such a thing as too much black, gay writing.  Big applause for the author.  In a time when black Americans of all sexualities are discussing the \\"down low\\" phenomenon, I think this text may be very helpful for many.	2004-05-10

The editor's journey is fascinating.  She starts by saying she sought her validation in dark-skinned boyfriends and that because she was brown and didn't know her ethnic identity, she made up that she was Tahitian.  Finally, she's come to terms with her identity.  Still, this book may dissatisfy many.  Let's start off with the title.  With a name like &quot;miscegenation blues,&quot;  it seems that from the start the glass is half empty for these writers.  Further, the title continues a long line of oppressive literary works that  deem mixed-race women &quot;tragic.&quot;  Second, the author, a transracial adoptee and lesbian, takes white lesbians who adopt children of color to task.  You would think that a multiracial identity would push the author to celebrate all types of mixed phenomena, but she doesn't.  This may feel dangerously essentialist to some.  I think readers will flock to Maria P.P. Root's books before this one, but I applaud the contributors here for extending the selections of writings out there by and about women of color.	2004-05-10

Gilman's purpose is to show that for centuries in the West, issues of obesity and masculinity have worked hand in hand.  He looks at Greek philosophy, canonical authors, fictional detectives, baseball players, and modern male stomach staplers to spell out how fat men have been treated and portrayed.  What Garber did for bisexuals and Halberstam did for masculine lesbians, Gilman now does for fat men.<br />Constructionists will love this book.  Gilman makes a point to show that the chubby are treated differently from the obese.  He illustrates how Falstaff transformed from Shakespeare's comedies to Verdi's operas and how Sancho Panza changed over the course of Cervantes' work.  In the baseball chapter, fat men are maligned; in the detective chapter, they are praised.  Gilman had much more than one thing to say about fat men in Western cultural history.<br />Gilman is juggling many balls here and I have mixed reviews about his results.  On the one hand, it's intriguing how he can jump from plays to opera to the law to biography to current events.  However, his principle interest is how medical theories affected cultural productions; you'd never guess this from reading the table of contents.  And sometimes it just doesn't add up.  For example, he states that at the same time that writers were inventing fat detectives that solved crimes with their guts, scientists were describing the importance of fat cells.  Still, he never truly explains that or if the latter caused the former.<br />The subtitle of this book is purposeful: Gilman is quite cognizant that he is only scratching the surface on fat men.  He avoids Eurocentricity by restricting his analysis to &quot;the West.&quot;  I sincerely hope that this book will encourage other scholars to write on fat men in the Muslim world, Asia, or pre- and postcolonial Latin America.  Still, there's so much that Gilman left out of the picture.  Though I doubt he's homophobic, I disliked that henever once brought up the bear movement, especially when it would have been easy to do so in his last chapter.  He makes scant mention of sumo wresters and Al Roker, but besides that you almost never hear about men of color (including those in the West).  When I flipped through the index and saw &quot;Fat Joe,&quot; I assumed he meant the chunky Latino rapper, not some Dickens character.  Further, rap is the standout cultural arena where fat men (most of whom are of color) have made a positive name for themselves (examples include Biggie Smalls and Big Pun) yet Gilman hardly gives them a sentence.  What up wit dat?!  To his credit, he does a great job in being inclusive of fat Jewish men, however.<br />This book can be depressing to &quot;swallow&quot; as a fat male reader.  Is it any consolation to find that for centuries Westerners have considered fat men to be lazy, stupid, immoral, and shameful?  When Gilman looks at how fat becomes a proxy of other traits, he mostly focuses on short lifespans.  I think a better look at other  dynamics would have been more interesting.  <br />Lastly, and of least important, fitness lovers may hate this book.  Gilman does little to admit that obesity is a health hazard.  His focus on representation does not touch valid issues that too much weight can be dangerous.<br />I am so glad that Gilman wrote this book and that I found it.  I'm just not all the way impressed after finishing it.	2004-05-02

In a time when anti-addiction programs are under increasing scientific, quantifiable scrutiny (think:  DARE), this book is a timely addition.  <br />I like this book; I mean, it was okay.  It's just that anybody who's traveled abroad and has access to a university library could have written it.  Brandes got invited to a Mexican man's peer group and he's reporting on it.  He went back to his university, read up on Alcoholics Anonymous, DF, and Latino masculinity and instantly had the literature to back up his observations.  Blue and yellow make green.<br />Brandes' has two audiences here and it will be difficult to please both groups at once.  The chapters \\"Meeting and Moving\\" and \\"Illness and Recovery\\" has close to no cites or academic jargon.  Everyday readers will enjoy the narrative, but academics will be bored.  Chapters such as \\"Religious Adaptations\\" and \\"Gender and the Construction of Manhood\\" have plenty of cites and academic theory.  Ph.D's and anthropology majors will love this; everyday readers or people just concerned about alcoholism in Mexico may be confused and turned off by these portions.<br />As an Anglo American and a non-Christian, the author does try to point toward his positionality in Mexican AA meetings.  On the one hand, these working-class Mexican men refer to him with the formal pronoun (Usted).  On the other, he receives critiques during the men's testimonials just as any other member would. Further, they look down on him for not being married or having a permanent female partner.  Still, the author sometimes forgets to pinpoint his status as a First Worlder.  He notes that he was frustrated by all the noise, children, drunk men, and dogs that would find their way into these AA meetings.  However, that's life in a metropolis in the developing world.  Men and children; in-groups and out-groups; evennature and civilization can't be easily separated as they can in middle class regions of the developed world.  Instead of appreciating this potpourri of people, worlds, and phenomena, the author wishes they'd go away so that he can focus on his sole interests.  Kinda problematic.<br />From the beginning to the end of the text, Brandes registers his surprise that this Protestant-initiated support group could work so well in a predominantly Catholic nation.  While he focuses upon religion, I think other angles were left aside that could have been explored in more details.  For example, what the men face here is just like what fraternity brothers on American colleges face, what boys in manhood initiations worldwide experience, even what the Puerto Rican and black drag queen in New York City endure.  Men seek tribes, are forced through rites of passage, and are coerced into towing the party line.  This is classic men's studies, yet Brandes only uncovers masculinity matters halfway.  <br />He mentions race/ethnicity a little.  For example, many of the men are Mexican Indians who were pushed into alcoholism as they adjusted to city life and learning Spanish.  He gives this scant coverage when another academic, perhaps in Latino/a studies, would have dug deeper.  (...) However, in this book, Brandes says he has observed this phenomenon.  This was the first \\"straight\\" book that I've read to corroborate gay Latino writers.  I applaud Brandes' honesty here.<br />The author never mentions performativity here.  The recovering alcoholics in many ways are on stage.  People use the podium in order to act or express frustrations.  Audience members have critical responses.  Moderators are critiqued for their roles as well.  Brandes may want to read some Judith Butler.  This book was filled with drama yet the performativity of life is never brought up.  <br />Don't get me wrong.  I have no regrets about reading this book.  I wonder if some of the ideas here could help to start AA chapters in working-class neighborhoods or Mexican-American barrios in the United States.  Bravo to Brandes, despite my strong critiques.	2004-04-11

There is the personal (&quot;Our America&quot;), the journalistic (&quot;There Are No Children Here&quot;), and the academic (&quot;Slim's Table&quot;).  In this book, the author tries to analyze how 26 young, poor black men think, and not just what they do or the choices they make.  He has some very counterintuitive findings.<br />As great as a book this is, reading it can be depressing to the nth degree.  The interview subjects are just clueless about how society is organized and how the marketplace is changing.  They come off as so naive and uninformed!  This could really help fortify racist fallacies about black mens' intelligence.<br />Further, the people in power who are most interested in hurting black men could have a field day with this book.  The subjects almost never say racism is a big deal.  They blame themselves entirely for what has happened in their lives.  They believe that a positive attitude will change all their woes.  This type of &quot;pull yourself by the bootstraps&quot; lets racism and classism in American institutions off the hook.<br />Further, this book may hurt people who believe in or benefit from affirmative action.  The author observes that those who have had the most exposures across races and classes are the most cognizant of racism and classism in this country.  Many people might read this and say, &quot;Well then blacks would be less angry at others if they didn't observe us.&quot;  or &quot;If diversity makes blacks bitter, they should not be exposed to it.&quot; etc.  Thank goodness the Supreme Court already stated that affirmative action is legal in Michigan where the author works.<br />Speaking of Michigan, I am surprised that the author did not complete his study there.  Like Chicago, Detroit has problems with segregation, unemployment, and post-industrialization.  Why keep making Chicago look bad when many urban areas are hard places in which to live for African-American men?<br />Despite my critiques, I enjoyed this book.  I actually do recommend it for antiracist activists and other progressive thinkers.	2004-03-29
735763:US	49989755	R23FNZ4YHX8Y0	0754617556	169190483	Masculinity, Power and Technology: A Malaysian Ethnography	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	Chinese Malaysian mechanics	A Swedish sociologist interviews and observes Malaysian male mechanics of Chinese descent and asks them how their jobs affect their sense of masculinity.<br />I guess there is a whole field called \\"gender and technology\\" in which tools and occupations are examined simultaneously with gender.  That makes perfect sense, yet seems so novel.  This was a unique slant on men's studies and I hope more books from this perspective are produced.<br />I give the author credit for his balancing act.  He wants to problematize the false objectiveness of ethnography, so he discusses his role as observer.  At the same time, he doesn't want to just have a diary and this book is theory-heavy and not overly subjective.  Still, some readers may hate the personal info.  Some readers may hate the postmodern jargon.  The first chapter describes a day in the life of the mechanics.  It differs drastically from the rest of the book and  readers who want solid academics may be turned off if they don't venture farther.  With the exception of this chapter, the other chapters follow a logical path and are uniform.<br />This book illustrates that the womanist assertion that race, class, and gender must be examined as interrelated, not separate, is being taken seriously.  The author tries hard to keep bringing all three topics to the foreground.  He does mention much on gender; for example, he describes how female mechanics are differentiated from male ones.  He never says anything about the upper-class until the final few pages.  Though he often repeats that Malaysia is very ethnically segregated and that the Chinese there are a minority, he says little about the interactions between the Chinese, Malays, and Indians.  I never knew if the Chinese were oppressed or supposed to be \\"a model minority.\\"  I wish he spoke more of how working-class, Chinese men relate or stand against other demographic groups.<br />Along with the womanist assertion, almost every men's studies texts I've ever read mentionssome dividing line between men.  Instead of race, age, or sexuality, this author stresses that the men who received English educations have different outlooks than those who received Chinese ones.  Fascinating!  I learned much about Malaysia that I didn't know before.  <br />To be honest, the author presents a totally different image of Chinese men than most Americans, and possibly most Westerners would have.  As opposed to be stoic and emotionless, the author stresses that these men believe in luck, astrology, and other non-concrete phenomena.  Instead of portraying an obedient, self-erasing stereotype, he talks about Chinese men gambling, drag-racing, drinking and many type of classical macho behavior.  <br />As much as the author stresses how his commonalities with the men helped him to solicit information, I wonder if he would have written a  more in-depth book if he were a mechanic or had a mechanical background himself.  Further, this book talked about the interviewees being small businessmen (purposely gendered) than it does being mechanics.  The pressures of making money and staying open takes as much space here as does fixing cars.<br />Despite my critiques, I sincerely enjoyed this book.  I applaud the author for having a novel idea.  I am sure he will keep producing successful, informative writings.	2004-03-23

But is identifying as a filmmaker an equally difficult struggle!?  Well, in this book, non-straight Asian-Americans do not just speak about themselves, but they purposely dissect their political activism.  In this book, activism is given as much weight as race or sexual orientation.<br />Activism here takes several forms.  Be it promoting gay marriage in Hawaii, fighting xenophobia in a church setting, or coming out to one's Asian American studies students; the range is broad.  Activists of all kinds of identities will relate to this.  Further, straight Asian-Americans will see how they face some of the same struggles and this book may go far in promoting pan-sexual unity in Asian America.<br />The best article was by Pauline Park.  She relates how as a transgender Korean adoptee, almost no organization accepts her in her wholeness.  Still, this hasn't stopped her from accomplishing a lot in New York.  Every reader will be blown away by all that she has done.  The worst article came from David Lee.  His piece says almost nothing about being activist.  Though he critiques privileging white men over Asian man, you can tell he isn't taking his message seriously.  I don't even know why Kumashiro put his piece in the book.  I am quite sure other submissions had to have been better than this terrible contribution.<br />I doubt most Americans ever think about non-straight Asian Americans at all.  However, if they do, they probably think first about monoracial, monosexual, gay-identified, male-born men.  Kumashiro obviously wanted to have new centers.  Most of the contributions are by women and their pieces are far stronger than those of the men.  There are many works by biracial people and bisexuals, including Kumashiro coming out as bisexual.  Not only is this a trans-inclusive work, but many contributors trouble gender binaries by hardly mentioning their gender at all.  There is a great piece by a man who has Klinefelter's syndrome; this is fascinating as many activists want to use the phrase \\"LGBTI\\" to include intersexuals.  Southeast Asians are often called \\"the forgotten Asians\\" and this book has a respectable amount of contributions from them.  Still, this book is lacking in strong works by non-straight Polynesians.  One Chicana-Samoan lesbian talks more about Chicanos and hardly about Samoans in her work.  Another man talks about Native Hawaiian issues; however, he is not Native and the lack of mentioning what his race is makes me think he might be completely white, thus defeating the purpose of the book.  When gay Pacific Islanders like Greg Louganis, Benjamin Cruz, or Esera Tuaolo are making press, this paucity is quite surprising and disappointing.<br />This book is for everyday readers.  There are no footnotes or postmodern jargon.  Readers will have a much easier time with this book than they may have with \\"Q&A\\" or \\"Racial Castration,\\" previously released gay Asian-American books.  The selections are arranged in alphabetical order.  Because I think the purpose of the book is to get more straight Asian-Americans to embrace sexual minorities, I'm completely shocked that the work \\"queer\\" is thrown around so often and without question here.  Many readers will be turned off and I don't know why the editor didn't think more about this.	2004-03-11

In this study, the authors try to find out why by observing classrooms, surveying students, and interviewing teachers.  At last, men's studies is being produced from/about the Caribbean.<br />The book starts off by saying that gender is not a universal topic and that race and nationality are factors for which one must accommodate.  The authors point out that some of them are black, but most are white.  Further, the cover shows a white face and a black face staring in opposite directions.  Despite all of this, this book compares black males to black females, not black males to white ones.  Though the study takes place in an entirely black context, it really is a gender-only analysis.<br />Some of their conclusions are obvious.  Boys are more aggressive.  There are few male teachers, etc.  Any educated reader could have hypothesized their results.<br />Additionally, very unintentionally, the authors point to glaring sexism in the West Indian school system.  Female teacher prefer male students over female ones.  A pregnant female student would be asked to leave, but the siring male would not.  Girls are expected to be obedient and task-oriented while boys are allowed freedom and sometimes encourage to be anti-intellectual.  I wish the authors would have applauded West Indian girls for learning in such an unfair environment.<br />I was surprised and delighted to see that the authors bring up and criticize homophobia in the Caribbean school system.  If teachers are homophobic, then gay male students won't feel accepted.  If male students have to expend energy proving that they are straight, they are siphoning off energy that could go toward studying.  All those concerned about the plight of gay and bisexual black boys in schools should see this text.  Further, homophobia is connected with discrimination against \\"nerds.\\"  The authors do a great job in showing how hegemonic masculinity hurts both gay and non-gay males.  (I bring up that term because the authors faithfully cite Connell's pioneering work even though other writers have asked whether his ideas apply to men in the developing world.)<br />Finally, the authors have no suggestions at the end.  I guess this positive rather than normative analysis helps them to look objective.  Too, it would seem like the answer is to have more male teachers and privilege the plight of males more.  In zero-sum settings like this, that would put women and girls at a disadvantage, so maybe the authors didn't want to go there.<br />As an African-American male, I was surprised to see that \\"male underachievement\\" is not just a problem  here, but in several places in the Black Diaspora.showing how hegemonic masculinity hurts both gay and non-gay males.

Unlike the double meaning of Cornel West's title \\"Race Matters,\\" there is nothing inventive in this.  I'm surprised that academics would want to scream anything for a book like this.<br />The contributors mention that the idea of \\"women in development\\" (or WID) has changed to \\"gender and development\\" (or GAD), yet has not looked specifically at how masculinity issues affect men in developing countries.  Further, it is honorably noted how women's issues won't be advanced without male participation.  If men don't agree to use condoms, AIDS will still spread in southern Africa.  If men don't learn to respect children, they will sire boys that will commit the same injustices they have, etc.  This book definitely had impressive goals.<br />The book's contributors are equally male and female; also, it seems ethnically diverse.  While the book has chapters involving Asia and Latin America, half the book focuses on sub-Saharan Africa.  This is left unexamined.  Is that where most development scholars work?  Is that where funds tend to be directed?  Is that where masculinity issues are the most glaring?  It's surprising that the cover of the book shows a Latin American male worker and his sons when the majority of the subjects in the book are African males.<br />This book must be applauded for two reasons.  First, I appreciated its mention of boys and the violence that grown men perpetrate against them.  One chapter mentions that development agencies must do more to re-program child soldiers who have been abused by rebels and goverments in power.  International child advocates may want to read this book for that reason.<br />Second, along with the aforementioned example of how dominant men do not just oppress women, but also other males, this book highlights the diversity of males in developing countries.  Examples include older men vs. younger men in South Africa, classic bugarrones vs. modern pingueros in Cuba, or tribal differences in Namibia.  Obviously, the scholars here borrow from feminists of color that say women are not a monolithic category and that race and class must be taken into account.  These authors apply that claim to men.  This book was gay-inclusive or at least tried not to be rigidly heterocentric.<br />Still, the chapters wondered on and on, with very little structure.  The points that authors want to make to other development scholars usually had nothing to do with the actual groups or phenomena they later described.  This book was totally disorganized and not much fun to read.<br />I applaud the contributors for trying to bring men's studies and development studies together.  Still, this was quite a flawed production.	2004-02-17

This is a revolutionary book that many men, whether Jewish or non-Jewish, should read.  If I understand correctly, most men's studies texts were produced in the 1990s and yet this text deals with two identities and was written back in 1987.  Further, this book was published before the success of \\"Seinfeld,\\"  the infamy of \\"The Jerry Springer Show,\\" Al Gore's nomination of Joseph Lieberman as a vice-presidential nominee, and other big events among Jewish-American men.<br />The book discusses various issues such as Jewish pro-feminism, circumcision, Talmudic dictates on male homosexuality, etc.  Contributors were both male and female.  About half of them were rabbis.<br />This book was very pro-gay.  It really peeled the onion on many matters.  For example, there is a great article on a straight Jewish writer whose work gets confused with that of an openly gay writer.  I love the way the editor recognizes sexual diversity among Jewish men.  However, I wish there was an actual article included by/about an actual Jewish, gay man.  While the book does include an article from writers of a gay, urban publication, they never point to actual homophobia in Jewish circles or anti-Jewish attitudes in gay circles.  Even in the mid-1980s, openly gay, Jewish men such as Harvey Fierstein, Tony Kushner, and William Rubenstine were out there (pun intended), thus this silence seems quite unnecessary.<br />The first section of the book is the most boring and obtuse.  I hope this does not scare readers off from the gems further along in the text.  Additionally, some articles are short, chatty, conversational works; others are erudite, complex theology and literary criticism.  This gives the book a slightly scattered vibe.  Many readers may be unsatisfied with the portions of which they have the least interested.<br />Overall, I am glad I found this work.  I applaud Harry Brod's efforts immensely.	2004-02-11

This book is an incredible example of men's studies, cultural studies, and Sinology.  In this text, the author argues that, unlike the all-inclusive yin-yang, the best way to understand Chinese masculinity is through the concept of wen-wu.  Wen are scholars; wu are soldiers.  It suggests that Chinese men must be masters of all mediums; have strong heads and bodies.  Using canonical texts and later films, he begins by analyzing Confucius as the ultimate wen symbol and Guan Yu as the ultimate wu and moves on to discussing how these concepts are modernly portrayed.  <br />This is not a static or essentialist text.  He begins by stating that originally wen-wu could only be possessed by Chinese men and moves to saying that women, Westerners, and other Asians may now have the traits and affect the traits' very definitions.  He mentions that upper-class men mostly championed wen and their lower-class counterparts mostly wu.  He illustrates how both Confucius and Mao distanced themselves from financial matters; now in times of globalization, businessmen (purposely gendered as such) are considered the new models of wu.  He also states that wen-wu together is traditionally privileged but that many Chinese men will drop one or the other depending upon context.<br />This was not primarily a comparative ethnographic text.  However, it is fascinating to see how honored Chinese masculinity differs from its Western counterpart.  In China, body and mind matter and mind usually trumps.  In the West, we worship the Stallones and condemn the nerds.  In the West, the knight always wins a maiden.  In China, men who distanced themselves from romance and sex with women are praised for their self-control.  If I were more skeptical, I'd be shocked that such a differing world could exist.<br />The author often compares the distant past with the last 100 years.  This was highly informative work.  However, I wonder if he missed something by not detailing a more completehistory.  For example, he basically jumps from Confucius (born many centuries before Christ) to intellectuals in the Communist era.  In talking about the West, if I said, \\"First you had the Crusades and now Bush has captured Saddam,\\" something would be clearly absent.  This may be the case with this book.<br />Louie analyzes few texts and those who know more about China may be dissatisfied with this.  He quotes academics from numerous nations.  However, most theory he uses is Western while topics for discussion are Chinese.  It's questionable whether scholars in China proper are just not writing in the field of men's studies or if Louie just hasn't found their work.  Louie does not exalt Confucius or Guan Yu.  His deconstruction may feel like undressing icons and borders on blasphemy.  Film buffs will especially love the penultimate chapter on Bruce Lee and his progeny.  I am surprised that he didn't mention Jet Li (and that cutie Russell Wong) in that section.<br />Though within the men's studies genre, this book does not omit women.  Chapter 6 discusses Chinese women's writers' portrayal of masculinity.  Still, as Chinese authors have written for centuries, I'm surprised he didn't mention earlier texts that had female readership if not authors.  While Louie mentions violence against women and uses the term \\"misogyny\\" throughout the text, many readers may feel that he doesnt' condemn sexist behavior by Chinese men or male characters enough.  Nevertheless, he does show Chinese female thinkers as having agency when they lament about supposedly having \\"no real men\\" in their country.<br />I did find a place where he took liberties.  He mentions a Bruce Lee film in which a gay Chinese man fondles the martial artist.  Louie's response is, \\"At least Chinese film shows that gays exist.\\"  (And I love that this was a gay-inclusive, non-heterosexist text.)  However, Chinese-American scholar Jachison Chan pointed to this same film clip stating that Lee's work should be criticized for its homophobia.  My guess is that Sinologists would be able to find other holes in Louie's assessments.<br />Still, I loved this work.  I think men throughout the Chinese diaspora should find this work.  Non-Chinese men should also give it a read.	2004-02-11

This is the scholar's Ph.D. dissertation, yet I've seen it cited at least thrice by prolific, longtime professors.  Sinha's research is a fascinating combination of colonial studies and gender studies.<br />In this book, Sinha discusses four controversies that took place during the 1880s in colonized India.  The reader can instantly tell that she did a ton of research, combing through Indian and British, mainstream and radical newspapers, as well as court cases.  She carefully details myriad arguments advanced by many activists.  The uniting theme is how the British stereotyped Bengalis as effeminate as a way to resist any of their assertions for empowerment.<br />This text should be embraced by numerous anti-oppression academics and activists.  The facets of the struggles she describes will remind many of things that have happened in the United States.  The Indian struggle to enlist in the British military reminds me of the 1990s fight of gays to serve openly in the American forces.  The chapter on changing Indian marriage customs reminds me of current fights in France about Muslim girls' ability to wear scarves at public schools.  Unlike most stereotyping and against ideas proposed by Althusser, Sinha demonstrates how Bengalis were differentiated from men in other Indian states.  This book was a clever example of region, not just nation or colonialism.  <br />Importantly, Sinha draws the contours of the two-way street that is power.  Obviously influenced by Foucault and Lacan, she illustrates that Bengalis resisted British force and that British stereotyping of this Indian state says as much about the UK as it does about its former imperial subject.  Sinha states at the outright that many of the proposed British laws were never enacted.  Still, she spells out how Bengali outcry led to rich discussions about small, historical events.  One can see the diversity of both Indian and British populations.This book is deep.<br />I do have a few critiques of the book.  With the exception of the introduction, little is said about Bengali effeminacy.  That topic is merely one ingredient in the overflowing stew that was India before independence.  The controversies detailed would have still erupted whether Bengali men were stereotyped as effeminate or not.   In many ways, a subplot of the research is given more space in the title of the book than its body.  I applaud Sinha for pointing to an effeminacy not connected to male homosexuality.  While many homophobes in the waste often conflate the two, this is not the case worldwide, and wasn't even true historically in the West.  (Think about it:  the ancient Greeks may have approved of male homosexuality, but they did not conceive of that love as violating gender norms.)  Still, this book was much more about biological sex than socially constructed gender.  Many of the chapter dealt with rule affecting Indian women and the patronizing arguments by British men, British women, or Indian men to support or refute these measures.  African-American feminist writers once produced an anthology that stated, \\"All the men are black, all the women are white....\\"  This book, similarly, was an intersectional work that looked at a group of women of color.  This occurred much more often than effeminate Bengalis or British masculines were addressed.<br />This book is small in terms of page length.  However, the print is small, the paragraphs are long, and there are no photos besides the one on the cover.  The reader will have to be careful moving from line to line.<br />There are many writers with projects like Sinha's, but most are in cultural studies or literary criticism.  I'm surprised to see an academic working in history to come up with such a profound, critical text.  She should really be applauded, once again.  <br />Sinha only focused on one decade in one state of one nation (though a very populous one).  I should hope that other colonial and post-colonial scholars learn from her insights and keep running with her torch.	2004-02-01

In this book, LaMont asks white and black, American, working-class men about those they consider immoral and around whom they set boundaries.  Eventually, she results in describing how these men conceive of race, immigration, and class in this country.  She then compares these two groups with white French and North African counterparts, respectively.<br />This was impressive sociology and cross-cultural analysis.  Lamont found a way to assess nebulous ideas like morality and show how they help to shape very concrete lived experiences like race.  The author is great at juggling multifaceted identity matters, unlike most writers who can only deal with &quot;one issue at a timie.&quot;  She quotes few other scholars, so this book read quickly and would be much more accessible, even to its subject population, than other academic books.<br />Her analysis of black American men and North African men was very fair.  Still, when she described men's lives in details, she usually referred to her white subjects.  She states that neither white nor black American men think much about immigrants.  However, she was studying subjects in New York and New Jersey.  Things may have been quite different if she were studying California or Texas, and even she implies as much.<br />It's not that I like how many writer blab ad nauseum about their &quot;positionality.&quot;  However, I wish this author would have discussed herself more.  In this postmodern age, most researchers have abandoned pretending they are not there and the evidence speaks for itself.  She never explains whether being a woman helped or hurt in getting American and French men to open up to her.  How does she know that black or Arabic men didn't say to her what they would expect that a white, class-privileged, French woman academic would want to hear?  She never even explains why she limited her study only to men.  This was unintentional men's studies.  It's particularly shocking in that working-class American women, at least, often don't have the choice to not work.  She never explains why she would even want to leave them out of the picture.<br />Just like her own last name, she writes French names in a surprising way.  Lebleu without the B in upper case?  Lheureux rather than L'Heureux?  Maybe this is a new trend now that France is a member of the European Union.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  In this country, almost everybody identifies with the middle class and this comes at the detriment to poor folk.  Further, there is not enough writing about Arabic men in the West, particularly in English.  So Lamont's study is a much-needed text.  It would be fascinating to hear what French readers have to say about it.east, often don't have the choice to not work.

In this country, almost everybody identifies with the middle class and this comes at the detriment to poor folk.  Further, there is not enough writing about Arabic men in the West, particularly in English.  So Lamont's study is a much-needed text.  It would be fascinating to hear what French readers have to say about it.	2004-01-30
810405:US	49989755	R2WVKWNI59VYNO	0415271479	830209132	Men and Masculinities in Contemporary Japan: Dislocating the Salaryman Doxa (Nissan Institute/Routledge Japanese Studies)	Books	5	13	13	N	Y	chipping away at the archetype	As the subtitle of this anthology clearly states, the editors and contributors are trying to show that not all Japanese men are middle-class, company-oriented, gender-typical, childcare-shunning, heterosexual males in intraethnic marriages.  However, it still indicates how the Japanese law presumes that the salaryman is the national everyman.<br />Typically, books discuss either women, gay men, transgenders, and gender rebels separately and exclusively.  This books peels the layers of the onion discussing most every aspect of gender- and sexual diversity.  One chapter on transgenders discusses gay men and some gender-typical gay male readers may be offended by the equation, however.<br />This anthology had a good mix of male and female contributors ranging from Europe, the United States, and Asia.  Thus, this is a  book about \\"us\\" and \\"them.\\"  However, because many writers had American ties and I hear that Japanese students learning English are taught the American style, I was surprised this book was written in British English (dare I say \\"the Queen's English\\"?)  Examples of this include s's instead of z's (\\"theorise\\"), titles not punctuated (Mr, Dr), and none the less not spelled as one word.  As diverse as the contributors were, they pretty much relied upon academic quotes from Western scholars (Butler, Connell, Foucault, Halberstam, etc.)  I am not sure whether this means Japanese scholars are not producing work on gender diversity or that the contributors themselves are at the forefront of this field.<br />The last three chapters are from Japanese in political organizations (gay activists, fathers' responsibilities and rights advocates, those unlearning domestic violence).  The two chapters before that concern working-class Japanese men.  The first half of the book could have been organized as well.  Therefore, I am surprised that the editors not to break the chapters into parts and have commentaries at the beginning of each.<br />Given its size and power (despite the recession oft-mentioned by the authors), it should come as no surprise that Japan is diverse in terms of gender, class, biological sex, and sexual orientation.  Still, claims of homogeneity within and outside of its shores persist for Japan.  Finally, a book chips away at this inaccuracy.  I would really like to hear what Japanese nationals think about this text.	2004-01-26
827085:US	49989755	R2RJCGEYLT8ZV3	0822332175	808383278	Global Divas: Filipino Gay Men in the Diaspora (Perverse Modernities: A Series Edited by Jack Halberstam and Lisa Lowe)	Books	4	26	26	N	Y	Manila Must Be Burning!	This book starts of with the author and another gay Pilipino man going up to a bakla and asking, \\"Why so sad, sister?\\"  Miss Thing responds back, \\"My beauty can't stand the drama in this gay club!\\"  SNAP!  [They didn't really snap but this whole book will put you in a diva!, swishy mood, so I added some flourish.]<br />Now if some camp like that doesn't convince you to read this book, then I don't know what will.  Seriously, many have noted that homosexuality is the love that dare not speak its name, Pilipinos are the forgotten Asians in America, and the subaltern has no voice.  Thus, by creating a book where gay, immigrant, femmy, Pilipino men are the center, Manalansan has valiantly filled a tragic void.  This book says much about gay men of color and gay immigrants.  It shows how many gays have other issues on top of homophobia to battle.  This was a critical intersectional text.<br />In this book, the author places a minority within a minority within a minority at the center.  His main point is that non-Western same-gender-loving immigrants are not some homosexual primitives waiting for white, Western gays to liberate them.  The subjects here are active agents in their lives.  They balance multiple cultures and influences.  They oftentimes look at this country and its mainstream gay community and find it lacking.  This book is quite empowering.<br />Manalansan covers multiple topics here, including how gay male Pilipinos juggle Pacific and Western constructions of homosexuality, an argot called swardspeak, the difficulties that these men face in New York City, everyday struggles besides homophobia, bakla beauty pageants, and bakla anti-AIDS activism.  The author does an excellent job in inviting the reader into the gay Pilipino immigrant's world.  I thought the chapter on AIDS was the best; activists from all kinds of ethnic backgrounds should find it useful.  The author ends many chapters with a review of the literature that I found somewhat awkward and at times overly opinionated, however.  Like many academic books, this is just an amassing of the author's individual articles (and a celebration of his tenure?), but readers who haven't been exposed to extensive Manalansan writings will find this whole book especially refreshing.<br />Quotes from interview subjects are first cited in Taglish (Tagalog mixed with English phrases) and then translated into complete English.  Even without being a comparative literature or cognitive science major, I found this code-switchi fascinating.  Moraga and Anzaldua have already demonstrated how they practice Spanglish as  U.S. Latinas.  This is the first time I've seen gay men's and Asians' use of this intriguing practice.  Manalansan discusses  swardspeak, a gay Pilipino slang.  So the Brits are not the only ones with their Picadilly parlary.  Along with the Latino practice of picardia as detailed in Fernandez-Alemany's book, this is another example of gay men of color having their own catchy phrases and in-words.<br />To the book's credit, I think straight Pilipinos and non-Pilipino, gay immigrants will find this book useful as well.  Still, this book is filled with academic jargon and I don't any gay, Pilipino immigrant without an extensive background in gay studies and cultural critcism would understand it.  As a black gay man, I found this book very depressing.  Any time brothers are mentioned it is to put them down in nasty, racist fashions.  After this book, absolutely no one can say it's blacks' fault that people-of-color unity is so fragile.  Further, given that Manalansan teaches in the Midwest, I'm surprised that Midwestern gay Pilipinos are not brought up here.  They exist after all!  To only mention those members in New York and California re-establishes that ideas that diversity only exists on the Coasts.<br />Still, I loved this book.  Do peep it!	2004-01-14
843883:US	49989755	R3V3BLX4JU8RBK	0743456076	851671395	The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love	Books	3	57	78	N	Y	a feminist assessment of patriarchal masculinity	bell hooks states that feminists have not discussed how to improve the lives of men and this is her attempt.  In 11 chapters, she details her ideas that men must be open to feminism and feminists must be open to men, that patriarchal masculinity is the problem, not males, and that much harm comes to the life of boys.<br />Professional critics have called this book that non-race-based equivalent to \\"We Real Cool.\\"  However, I'd say it's the male counterpart to hooks' \\"Communion.\\"  This book is an ideal tool for feminist women raising sons.  It also may be a good introduction to feminism for progressive men or men who want to be progressive.  hooks cites many canonical men's studies texts and progressive books on boys and men that many readers will find useful.  (Again, it's a shame that this book lacks a bibliography, just like most of her most recent works.)<br />While this book discusses romantic love, that type of relationship is not the main issue here.  Readers that have already heard enough about hooks' views on love from her autobiographies and recent works will find this refreshing.  Many loving dynamics are detailed here.  Most importantly, hooks discusses the troubles faced by little boys.  I'm impressed that a childless writer is so devoted to children.  This almost reminded me of Rosie O'Donnell's autobiography the way a grown woman is so concerned about minors.<br />I would say that I have three major complaints/critiques of her book.  First, as much as she constantly assesses and promotes feminism, what comes through is that anti-oppression books can help men.  Her gender analysis just happens to be her angle.  A civil rights activist could have said that organizing could help men or a Communist discussing anti-classism could make the same argument that hooks makes here.  Thinking about justice, breaking out of boundaries, and imagining utopias has never been the work of just feminists.<br />Second, hooks critiques feminist self-help books for not discussing politics and the larger superstructure.  However, the majority of self-help books, even ones that she cites, are apolitical.  She needs to critique the whole genre if she is going to find so many individual examples unsatisfying.  People who feel that hooks was too hard on Naomi Wolf will be equally surprised at how she goes after Susan Faludi here.<br />Third, recently, everytime bell hooks mentions sexual orientation issues, she starts off with \\"Lesbians and gay men can be as conservative as anyone else, but here's one bit of info that I find useful from their activism......\\"  If a white person started every comment on race with \\"People of color can be just as conservative as anyone else, but....\\" or a class-privileged person said, \\"Some poor people deserve the barrel they are in, but here's what I find useful on class-based activism....\\", etc., hooks would be livid, yet she does it with gays.  I understand hooks' point that gays are just people just like straights.  However, her statements are somewhat course and insensitive.  I think this flaw still highlights how bell hooks has continually marginalized issues of sexual orientation while she champions issues of race, class, and gender.  Her recent ability to add imperialism to the mix shows she can build on her theorizing, so her stance on gay rights is incredibly problematic.  There's a great chapter in Carbrado's \\"Black Men on Race, Gender, and Sexuality\\" that discusses hooks' shortcoming.<br />At the end of almost every chapter, hooks presents cultural criticism.  Her subjects are broad including the Harry Potter series, the film \\"Life as a House,\\" and other popular works.  I am curious as to whether she is trying to satisfy her fans that are most familiar with her cultural studies work.  I wonder if she is trying to prove that her new march toward self-help writing is not meant to show she has lost her cult crit skills.  Coming from an African-American woman who almost always discusses black issues, this book was pretty light on race matters.  African-American readers, like myself, looking for that topic will find that the only chapter that is the exception is \\"Popular Culture: Media Masculinity.\\"  I applaud hooks for pointing out and proving that black authors have an array of writing interests.<br />Like always, this book is annoyingly repetitive.  hooks comes close to admitting this in her introduction.  If I remember correctly, she seemed reluctant to discuss domestic violence and war in her classic text \\"Talking Back.\\"  Now, she has taken those problems as a centerpiece of her work.  The cover of this book shows that Renaissance painting where God's finger points down toward Man's (this was the basis for the cover to \\"E.T.,\\" btw).  The cover has a pretty shade of blue.  I think readers will find the cover quite inviting.	2004-01-02

In ten quick chapters, bell describes how black men hurt and how they can heal.  This book was an interesting mix of chicken soup, history, and cultural criticism.  For those who have been disappointed by bell's recent books on love and autobiographies, this book is her return to her prime.  It reminded me much of \\"Sisters of the Yam\\" and \\"Talking Back.\\"<br />Two things stand out in this book.  First, bell finally critiques rap.  She mentioned in a previous book how a magazine dropped a discussion between her and Ice Cube because they expected her to go off on him.  In \\"Outlaw Culture,\\" she chose to criticize \\"The Piano\\" (with its disturbing depiction of Maoris) rather than rap at home.  Just as Spike Lee did a great job in portraying drugs in \\"Jungle Fever\\" (and gay black men in \\"Get on the Bus\\" for that matter) after being pushed by critics, bell tackles rap in a sharp, yet critical, way.<br />Second, she condemns Ellis Cose's harmless \\"Envy of the World,\\" oddly.  She chews up that book in every chapter.  The last time she read somebody in every chapter was Sharazad Ali in \\"Breaking Bread.\\"  Surely, Cose cannot be deemed an enemy the way Ali rightfully was.  He's not half as irritating as Camille Paglia.  Like a brother once said to her regarding Spike, \\"bell, why you messing with that brotha!?\\"  She practically tells him, \\"I'mma whoop you more if you don't cry like you mean it!\\" for no reason.  All the time she spent attacking him, she could have used citing Devon Carbrado, Don Belton, Robert Staples, and many other black male writers on masculinity that she forgets.<br />She finally drops the subjects of her past loves as they were already heavily discussed in at least four of her books.  She rightfully remembers the abuse heaped upon her by her father. However, she brought her brother's business in public in a way that is somewhat unfair.  bell has 5 sisters, so it is easy to protect their privacy.  However, despite only calling her brother by his first initial, since there is only one of him, anyone in the southern town in which she was raised will get to see his business brought out in print.  To a small extent, this reminds me of how Clarence Thomas trashed his sister for taking welfare benefits once.  So much of this book, and many of her books, focuses on tensions between black men and black women as romantic partners.  She may need to think deeper about tensions between black men and women as siblings.<br />bell is fair-minded in stating that racism (and other -isms) have scarred black men, but they are also responsible for some of their plight.  She cites the beginning of troubles not with \\"The Man\\" but in family life.  Though she hyperbolically states that most families are dysfunctional, her meditation on intra-family injustice will be valuable to many readers, black-male and non-black-male.<br />I think many readers will find this book highly useful.  Still, many will find her oft-stated idea that problems will decrease if black men embrace feminism.  Even if every black man read Michelle Wallace, paid child support timely, and contributed to Carole Mosley-Braun's presidential campaign, there would still be a lot of suffering that still needs to be solved.<br />This book is riddled with typographical errors that any editor doing her or his job would have corrected.  Once again, bell demonstrates how thoroughly well-read she is, yet she supplies no works cited section at the end.  Thus, all the brothers who may benefit from the texts she upholds will not get the opportunity to do so.l, since there is only one of him, anyone in the southern town in which she was raised will get to see his business brought out in print.

856058:US	49989755	RG7E20PLGMFR7	0292781458	162523960	The Bear and His Sons: Masculinity in Spanish and Mexican Folktales (Music; 14)	Books	2	1	1	N	Y	anthropology and men's studies juxtaposed	In this text, an anthropologist compares the folktale style of a Spaniard and an indigenous Mexican to detail how culture, gender, language, and family background affect storytelling characteristics.    The tales and discussion revolve around major men's studies themes such as how men make money, how men deal with female partners, and how they deal with other men.<br />At the start of this book, I was so intrigued and interested.  But I eventually lost my enthusiasm.  His point is obvious:  of course, numerous factors in a man's background would influence how he tells a story.  In spelling out which factors influence what, Taggart compares the two principle men to other storytellers he encountered and it becomes incredibly tiresome and repetitive after awhile.  <br />Too often, U.S. Americans forget that our country is not the only one that has indigenous peoples.  I appreciated learning more about Mexico's counterparts.  Given that languages are becoming extinct and folk culture is dying against the strength of globalism, it is great to see these tales being preserved and academically analyzed.  Taggart contrasts Spanish-speaking Mexicans with Spaniards and the Natives, thus demonstrating complexity and pushing aside dichotomous thinking.  As the Latino population in the US grows, it will be important for all Americans to learn more about how Spanish and Native styles have intersected in this hemisphere.  This is about the third book that I've read recently where a First World scholar did not have access to Native women as interviewee subjects; this is men's studies by default.  I hope readers can get a chance to hear Native women's voices some way.<br />Almost every tale in this book was European-derived.  That's logical given the comparative work that Taggart attempts.  Still, the indigenous Mexicans were not culture-deprived do-nothings before colonialism.  I would love to have heard more about their homegrown stories.  Further, it would have helped if the author made more parallels to US culture.  He mentions that one tale, &quot;Blancaflor&quot;/&quot;White Flower,&quot;  has Jason-and-Medea- like elements.  However, in the title tale, &quot;The Bear and His Sons,&quot;  the tale has elements resembling Paul Bunyun and Babe the Blue Ox, yet the author never mentions this.  It would have helped U.S. readers understand better.<br />This book does a much better job of introducing anthropologists to men's studies than the other way around.  Taggart tries to juggle multiple disciplinary balls, including some Freudian ideas in the introduction.  I did not find that effort necessary.  This book is for those who liked and understood that Levi-Strauss article that college professors love assigning more than for other readers.	2003-12-23
861783:US	49989755	R2N90GOL22RC9Y	0313312877	430788088	Movies, Masculinity, and Modernity: An Ethnography of Men's Filmgoing in India (Contributions in Sociology)	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	Indian masculinity in the cinema screen and aisles	Of the Indian Americans with whom I attended high school, only the women watched Indian films.  With their dancing, singing, and bright colors, Indians of both genders somewhat equated them with American soap operas or musicals.  However, in this text, Derne states that the majority of Indian filmgoers are male and film is a critical vehicle by which they define and develop their masculinity.<br />Derne does an expert job in showing that even outside of America, movies and pop culture are major societal forces.  He excellently demonstrates how the dynamics in the theater are just as important as what happens on screen.  He does a great job in discussing inconsistency.  For example, he illustrates that male filmgoers in the subcontinent love films where authority is challenged, yet resist attempting it in real life.<br />Due to culturally-based gender segregation, Derne wouldn't have been allowed to interview female cineastes.  Therefore this is another men's studies text by default.  Still, I really appreciated this look into Indian masculinity.  Women readers and feminist critics should not feel alienated here: Derne does discuss women and their film attendance habits frequently.  <br />Derne barely mentions the US or UK at all.  He never implies that Indian film is a response to British imperialism or postcoloniality.  He never mentions the cultural imperialism of the US.  Bollywood (a term he doesn't really employ) is not considered an imitation of Hollywood.  In fact, he states that most Indians feel that US films are too short.  This book placed a population of color in the center and out of the margins in phenomenal ways.<br />Some of the comments on gender are shocking.  On the one hand, Indian women are forced, and often wish, to constantly stay modest and avoid public spheres.  Modesty about sexual matters is emphasized by most of the male interviewees.  Yet at the same time, Derne states that directors have said no Indian company would invest in a film without a rape scene.  If the US is so risque, why do American films avoid rape and Indian film emphasize it?  I guess gender relations and gender-based inequality are truly culturally variant.<br />Derne cites Dickey, an author that studied filmgoing in South India so much that he almost seems like he plagiarized that text.  There is not a single photo in this book: a sign that he didn't want the text to be just another cultural studies rag.  The conclusion is merely a rehash of the previous chapters.<br />I hope more books on Indian men will be produced.  This was a great first effort.	2003-12-17

The Image of the Pakeha Male- A History	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A compelling history of Caucasian men in Kiwiland	Phillips attempts to trace the history and shifts of how New Zealanders believe their white male members should act and think.  His history moves from the pioneer days of the late 1800s to the 1980s when progessive Kiwis were protesting rugby games against South Africa.  This book focuses on men's relationships with male friends, war, rugby, the temperance movement, and the gendered division of labor.  I learned much about New Zealand, as an American.  In partincular, I learned that American cowboys and pioneers didn't stop westward in California; some actually sailded to NZ.  Phillips does a great job in showing the catch-22 of stereotypes.  On the one hand, men were encouraged to drink with &quot;mates&quot;, but on the other, they are supposed to be responsible family men.  They are encouraged to go to war, yet they uphold fallacies that all soldiers are gentlemen.  The author purposely titles his book with a question rathen than a sentence fragment.  His point is to interrogate how individuals are forced to live up to an idea and that many are excluded from that ideal from the start.  This book was filled with interesting quotes and pictures.  This was a great mix of sociology and history.  Anyone interested in men's studies will love this book.  Though Phillips is clearly a liberal, I think men of all political persuasions would find useful information and analysis in this book.<br />This book is amazing in that it was produced years before the critical white studies movement emerged in the United States.  I think all those who are trying to study whiteness as ethnography should read this, especially Americans reading it from a comparative perspective.  Still, to an extent I wish the movement began before Phillips wrote his book because he could have benefitted from those academics' insights.<br />Phillips resists Eurocentricity by refusing to assume that what white men are expected to do is the same as what Maori men are expected to do.  Both the author and Iwish that a book on Maori masculinity would be written.  The little info he includes about Maoris is quite informative.  Still, I must critique him for not mentioning more.  Phillips details extensively how Kiwi men differentiated themselves from Brits and Aussies, and to a small extent Americans, yet, he says little of how they did so with Maoris.  In the US, many white men don't notice their race until a person of color walks into the room.  I am almost sure that New Zealand whites must think similarly.  If New Zealander men defined themselves by their participation in wars with Maoris than being different from Maoris must play a huge role in that image.  Phillips fails to mention any of this.  From what I hear, New Zealand whites are struggling with xenophobia as the number of Asian and Middle Eastern citizens increase, just like Australia and the US.  Phillips doesn't touch these issues.  In many ways, that lack of analysis made the book incomplete.  The Maori exclusion here is not racist at all; but it's still unsatisfying.<br />Similarly, women could have been brought up more.  They are only in the last paragraph.  In the beginning, Phillips states that Kiwi manhood was shaped by the gender imbalance against women.  Still, he never discusses if that put New Zealand women in an advantagous position compared to their sisters in the United Kingdom or Canada.  Kiwi men are mentioned as &quot;shaggers&quot; and fathers, but rarely as men invested in loving women.<br />This book is structured chronologically but it has a huge section on war smacked in the middle.  I believe Phillips would have been better dividing the books into parts, not just chapters.  The last chapter is the most interesting, but also the most predictable.  Phillips initials all the men's names in this book and that makes it more difficult for scholars and readers who may want to investigate his sources.  Sometimes the book is repetitive and it feels like few sources are used.  However, Phillipsput much effort into this book and it shows honorably.<br />I am sure that the author's first name is an Anglicization of the common French male name &quot;Jacques.&quot;  Nevertheless, it's funny reading a book on manhood by a guy whose name is jock (an American term for a male athlete).  The cover has cheesy cartoons of men and typically masculine tools.  I am sure the author played no or little role in the cover design, but it still makes the book look less serious than it actually is.  You might think it's a romance novel rather than historical non-fiction, if you didn't read someo of the work.<br />I'm critical, but I loved this book.  I definitely recommend it to all.	2003-12-07

The contributors of thie anthology apply ideas in men's studies to Southern Africa.  Principly, they ask how do black men and white men formulate their sense of manhood in post-apartheid South Africa.  The book is divided into parts on fatherhood, performing masculinity, sexuality, and male tools.  The entries are diverse covering topics such as surfing, quasi-Nazi activities, gun abuse, HIV/AIDS, police officers, etc.<br />Through reading this book, I learned a lot about South Africa, especially over the last decade.  The book is scholarly without being inpenetrable.  The articles are relatively short if one excludes reading the footnotes.<br />Before I read this book, I read Lindsay's anthology on modern African masculinities.  In that text, the contributors worked to show how men's studies ideas could not be transplanted to the Continent.  However, in this book, men's studies gurus were cited, followed, and praised.  Thus, it's little surprise that those leading figures (namely, Connell and Kimmel) contributed an afterword or spoke at the pre-book symposium.<br />The majority of the articles discussed black African masculinities.  This is not surprising giving the racial make-up of the region.  Still, the articles on white African masculinities should be of special interest to those in the burgeoning field of critical white studies.  Only half of one chapter discussed what the South Africans called \\"coloureds\\" (what we would call \\"biracial\\" in the United States).  Even the editor himself apologizes for his lack of material on South Asian men in that region.  <br />Though the title states Southern Africa, only two chapters and the introduction discuss dynamics outside of South Africa.  Only one contributor had an African name.  Though each was clearly anti-racist, most contributors were whites who had access to black interview subjects.  Forgive this essentialist examination; I just think readers should know this text is not about \\"subjects within\\" for the most part.<br />Halberstam and Sedgwick in the US have been critical of how masculinity studies have often failed to look at whow women can be masculine.  This book has one chapter addressing that concern.  I especially love how gay-inclusive this book is.  Much men's studies may as well be called \\"straight men's studies.\\"  For example, the author of \\"Iron John\\" states from the start that his book will not touch gayness.   Here, not only is homosexuality not dropped out of the masculinity equation, the specific dynamics of male-on-male relations in that region are detailed.  Constructionists amony gay studies scholars should find this text highly useful.  I think any bigot who would dismiss gayness as \\"unAfrican\\" will be especially challenged by this book.<br />I wish this book had at least chapter on pro-feminist men in Southern Africa.  Though innocently done, this book makes black men look like savage, misogynist, tyrants and white men like defeated, racist, crybabies.  There is also little discussion of men addressing matters in multiracial settings and with uniting efforts.	2003-11-23

They question whether Connell's theories on masculinities can apply to the African continent.  In exploring masculinities, they see four lines of inquiry:  1) the idea of the African \\"big man\\" is changing; 2) colonialism helped to shape African views on manhood; 3) independence struggles were gendered; and 4) the modern era has affected African masculinities.<br />This book brilliantly discusses how Africans are subjects, rather than objects.  Though whites, imperialists, and colonialists are brought up often, African wars, unionizing, bravery ceremonies, and other willful actions are emphasized.  Though Foucault is never mentioned in this book, the idea that power is never absolute resounds clearly here.<br />Though the editors very consciously view their work as lying within the men's studies field, in no way are women left out of the picture.  The desire to find wives, keep wives, and be with wives is a continual staple of African manhood.  See my discussion of female masculinity, infra.  Further, men are not only distinguished from women, but from children, or what are called \\"junior men.\\"  The ability to pay for a child's education or for the building of a school in one's birth village helps to define masculinity often.  This is not a unideminsional text:  manhood is consistently matched with issues of age, wealth, marital status, parental status, and occupation.<br />Traditional scholars should not be scared away from this book.  Many academics may feel that masculinity is a nebulous topic that should be left for babbling postmodernists.  However, this book would satisfy traditional scholars.  The book discusses history, economics, and sociology in very concrete ways; it merely adds gender into the broader picture.<br />From one-third to one-half of this book focuses on Nigeria.  This may disappoint some.  However, as the scholars are English-speakers, English-speaking African nations areprobably the easiest place for them to study.  Additionally, Nigeria is the most populous nation on the Continent.  Still too, East Africa and Southern Africa are not forgotten.<br />Only two of the contributors have African names.  Forgive my indirect promotion of essentialism.  I just think people should know in advance that the writers are talking about \\"them\\" and not \\"us.\\"  This work definitely felt much more arm's length than a \\"scholar from within\\" approach would have enacted.<br />Unsurprisingly, \\"Africa\\" means sub-Saharan Africa here.  Maybe postcolonial theorists have already agreed to lump North Africa with the Middle East.  The surprise in the title comes from the word \\"Modern.\\"  Almost no article limits itself to the 1960s and afterwards/independence and its aftermath.  Some articles reach back into the 18th century, let alone the height of the imperial age.<br />The editors do wrestle with Judith Halberstrom's reminder that not only men practice masculinity.  This anthology includes two entries on masculine women.  Nevertheless, I was slightly disappointed that while the editors cite Murray's book on African homosexualities, no other contributors ever once mention African gay men.  How sexual orientation affects gender on the Continent is not touched.  This book might as well have been called \\"Men and HETEROmasculinities in Modern Africa.\\"  Further, though the AIDS pandemic is ravaging the region, it is not mentioned at all.  Very odd and disappointing.<br />I probably would have edited this book differently.  Let me give an example of my critique.  In the chapter on Mali, a phenomenon was described and then its history was brought up.  It would have been much more coherent to mention the history and then discuss the phenomenon.  This scholarly technique merely excludes people outside of the academy, even though it may help the contributors get tenure.  <br />Endnotes take up much space here, so the book reads faster than what one would originally imagine.  Still, you must read at a sophisticated level in order to understand what is going on.  <br />I liked this work.  I hope more scholarship is produced on African men and other men of the developing world.  This was an important intersectional work.  I applaud the thinkers paving the way in this burgeoning field.	2003-11-03

This was an interesting example of ethnomusicology.  Schade-Poulsen produces an extensive, almost exhaustive, look into rai, including how the music is produced, why it is (un)popular in the West, what some Algerian men think of it, what happens in the cabarets and weddings where it originated, etc.<br />As a Western reader, I was fascinated to see how this Arab phenomenon differs from its Western counterparts.  In the West, recording artists beg for attention, whereas the rai musicians seemed to avoid it.  Here, youth rebel against their parents by playing music loudly that the older generation fears or just doesn't get.  In this book, it is stressed how young men don't listen to rai in front of their fathers out of &quot;respect.&quot;  In the West, artists usually don't cover another artist's song unless the other artist is older or dead.  In Algerian music settings, musicians perform anybody's latest hit.<br />Similarly, this book offers a much different view of a predominately Islamic country compared to what Western media usually shows.  Though this book was published before September 11, 2001, recent history especially makes this contrast important.  Schade-Poulsen describes few of the Algerians that he met as having any interest in fundamentalist political movements.  Like young guys in the West, the men here just want to have fun and be boastful.  Though Islam condemns alcohol and prostitution, both are mentioned here often, and in a way that shows no embarassment from those interviewed.<br />Whereas America's New York, Hollywood, and Washington, D.C. have their distinct purposes for fame, most countries have capitols where all the action takes place.  This book, in contrast, focuses on Oran, the birthplace of rai, as opposed to Algiers.  Similar to Liverpool in Britain or Abiza in Spain, this book illustrates how music scenes may thrive outside of &quot;the City.&quot;<br />The big question on my mind is whether this book could be described as &quot;men's studies&quot; or not.  The author mentions that due to Algerian customs on gender segregation, he was not allowed to interview female rai performers and listeners.  This book does examine Algerian men's opinions on gender and manliness.  It says much about male-female/heterosexual relations, infra.  Still, this look at men is by default.<br />Different people will prefer different chapters.  Some may like the description of rai's production.  Others may prefer the discussion of how rai listeners practice or put off practicing Islam.  Others may like the interviews of rai fans and detractors.  Still, some may feel that the chapters took such different directions as to make the book feel motley or hodgepodge.<br />My biggest struggle with this book is how sexism is left unchallenged.  If the author critiqued his Algerian male subjects, he may have come off as imperialist and racist.  Further, such a critique may have warded off interviewees from telling what they really think.  Still, the way that women are placed as second-class citizens so uncritically here disturbed me.  Too, in this book, Arab men praise white women and badmouth Arab ones.  This may be an example of the grass being greener on the other side.  (Let's be honest, some Western men, across racial identifications, often talk about their desire for a foreign wife from the developing world.)  Still, it came off as both sexist and Eurocentric, highly problematic.<br />Schade-Poulsen states that his research interests focus on male-female relations.  So did the subject fit his interest or did he make it do so?  I wonder whether the chapter called &quot;The Rai of Love&quot; was his concern more than his interviewee subjects.<br />I also have questions on this work.  He mentions that he was only in Oran for a few weeks or a season.  I find it odd that he could witness so much and meet so many people in such a small amount of time.  He quotes often from Virolle-Souibes.  I am impressed with how multilingual the author is.  But did he just take that writer's ideas and translate them for English-reading audiences?<br />Despite any critiques, I appreciated this book immensely.  I hope more academics, both Arab and Western, write compelling books on Arab men.	2003-10-15

In this historical text, an Australian scholar details how colonial travels affected what we would now call gay men and how gay men affected colonialism.  In the first half of the book, Robert Aldrich how this phenomenon occurred for painters, poets, businessmen, and political activists, and men in other professions.  In the latter half of the book, he discusses this phenomenon region by region (Papua New Guinea, North Africa, South Asia, etc).  Included in this book is a whole chapter dedicated to the ultimate gay European colonizer, E. M. Forster.<br />This book is a stellar example of gay studies and historical research coming together.  It is immediately obvious to the reader how much work the author had to put into writing this.  As a large history text, this book takes FOREVER to read!  Undergraduate students assigned this book could get away with just reading the first two chapters and the conclusions, as the author's point becomes obvious and may feel repetitive to some readers after awhile.  Still, given that this book is much-needed and superb, all will benefit from reading it cover to cover.<br />For gay activists who mention famous historical figures who were gay as a way of combating homophobia, this book will be a useful tool.  Just as Marjorie Garber in \\"Vice Versa\\" demonstrated how many of these figures who are labeled gay could more accurately be labeled bisexual, Aldrich shows that many famous gay Westerners either came out, had their first homosexual experience in, or were influenced by the developing world.  This book will be a certain wake-up call for those who falsely assume that Stonewall is the be-all to end-all of gay history.<br />To be honest, I think many straight readers will be frustrated at how speculative some of Aldrich's allegations about famous Westerners are.  However, the author is fair-minded in stating his claims.  For readers of all sexual orientations, the discussions about taboo topics like rape, pedophilia, incest, etc. mentioned in this book may be unsettling.  Still, even for gay readers, the discussions of famous gays who hated themselves, chose celibacy, or married women to whom they were not attracted will feel sad as well.<br />Most importantly, this book was very disturbing, at times, for me to read as a gay man of color.  It comes as no surprise that for centuries, some white men have had sexual fetishes for men of color.  No one really has to read an academic work to find out that myths about black men's sexual organs, Asian men's submissiveness, or Arab men's exotic sexual activities are nothing new.  In the interracial sexual affairs detailed here, the perspectives of men of color consistently are marginalized to that of white men's feelings.  Further, the author admits that many of these Westerners who had sex with men of color abused them, degraded them, or acted in other racist fashions.  Still,  the author could only work with the historical evidence available to him, most often the writings of the white men.  Additionally, this book does mention that it took traveling outside of the West that allowed many Westerners who only got involved with other Westerners to explore their gay desires.  The author mentioned that he wrote a book on how Northern European gay men have treated Southern Europeans, paralleling the First World-Third World dynamic.  In fairness, the author also spells out how tolerance to homosexuality outside of the West encouraged some white men to fight imperialism.  Some anti-imperialists were subjected to homophobia solely because others wanted to silence their anti-colonial protests.<br />Aldrich does a fantastic job of discussing how Australian white men played a part in this history.  Not only were Australians colonized by Britain, but also they had a colonial relationship with New Guinea.  Being that most gay books focus on Europe and Anglo-America, this was quite novel.  Still, I find it odd that while Aldrich conducted extensive research on Africa, Asia, and Oceania, he hardly mentions Latin America.  Garcia Lorca's autobiographer stated that the poet become more openly gay after visiting Latin America, so there is much reason to include this region in the analysis.  It's obvious that the author speaks many languages, so I am sure that not knowing Spanish or lacking a Spanish translator could not have been a barrier for him.  I think this must illustrate how Americans think of Latin America as strongly black and Native and part of their Third World whereas Europeans and Australians think of it as an extension of Spain and therefore highly Westernized.  (For that matter, the author never discussed how gay white Americans were influenced by Native American tribes that tolerated same-sex activities or gender-fluid individuals.)<br />Along these lines, the author labels the last part of the book, \\"The End of Empire,\\" yet the chapter here is nothing more than another discussion of French gay men in North Africa just like the chapter before it.  Aldrich mentions that some post-colonial governments had a backlash against what they viewed as Western perverted corruption.  (I'm thinking of Cuba as an example and this is another reason why a discussion on Latin America would have been helpful to the book.)  I wish he had expanded upon that idea.  The fact is, several men in the developing world have cited homophobic persecution as a reason for seeking political asylum in the developed world, including Australia.  Thus, nowadays, the phenomenon that Aldrich details is occurring in reverse, though he makes little note of it.  Perhaps by giving more attention to men of color he could have achieved that.<br />Despite my critiques, I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  Robert Aldrich should receive as much praise as George Chauncey has for his book \\"Gay New York.\\"  This text was a vital addition to gay history and gay studies.drich conducted extensive research on Africa, Asia, and Oceania, he hardly mentions Latin America.

This book continues the recent trend in studying female masculinities, especially lesbian masculinities.<br />I applaud the editors for being so diverse and inclusive.  First, there is a black drag king on the cover.  Too often, readers assume that if a black person is on the cover, then it's \\"just\\" a black book.  Here, the editors proudly show a black king not fearing being pigeon-holed.  In fact, there is much racial diversity here, including a work on whiteness and drag kings.  Further, drag king lovers are included.  I especially enjoyed the poem \\"A Voice from the Audience\\" by king fan Ann Tweedy.  This book even has an entry from a male-born contributor.<br />My only warning is that this book is HIGHLY academic.  Less experienced readers may be disappointed.  However, professors and students or women's and gay studies will love it.  Do peep this work if you can.	2003-08-30

This book peels the onion on the dynamics of men are caregivers.  The first section details their existence in this important activity.  The second describes how men differ from women while performing the role.  The final section looks at special topics and populations of male caregivers.  The first two sections are more for academics and the last section may be more suited for clinicians or lay readers.  I applaud the editors for seeking multiple audiences.  More importantly, this book looks at differing male caregivers (gay as compared to straight, sons as compared to husbands/partners, etc.)  Further, the discussion of various diseases (Alzheimer's, breast cancer, etc.) may be of interest to caregivers of either gender or individuals in the medical fields fighting those diseases.  At times, this book gets bogged down in statistics and scholarly jargon.  Still, this was an important contribution to men's studies and public health literature.	2003-08-23

The person who organized the 1963 March on Washington for Civil Rights was a black gay man!  Two eminent scholars, Carbado and Weise, who have done much to open space for black gay studies continue that tradition by compiling some of Bayard Rustin's most famous speeches.  The book starts with a well-done biography of the leader.  The next sections are speeches on a range of issues which show how thoroughly ahead of his time this brotha was.<br />Near the end of their biography section, the editors admit that much work has come out recently to highlight Rustin (two biographies, a documentary, etc.)  Their contribution is that readers finally get to see what Rustin was thinking verbatim.  Due to homophobia and Far Right domination, Rustin was often silenced and marginalized.  However, he was a feisty figure who also wasn't afraid to butt heads with top dogs.  Similarly, his ideas will both impress and disgust readers.  This was one opinionated brotha!  Still, I love the way this collection disproves many myths:  that gay black men don't care about civil rights, that only heterosexuals made black civil rights happen, that James Baldwin was the only black gay man who can be recognized in the struggle, etc.  Moreover, Rustin was on the forefront of issue far beyond just his race and sexuality.  He spoke of feminism, international affairs, pacifism, labor rights, etc.  In a way, it's almost limiting that the editors bring up only \\"two crosses\\"  in the title of this book.  Just like Frida Kahlo, Bayard Rustin juggled many balls and now modern readers get a chance to witness how excellently he did it.  I think all progressives, regardless of their race or sexual orientation, will be blown away by this black, gay hero.	2003-08-12

This book is a quick read, but you can tell the author put substantial amount of time researching each paragraph and page.  In his introductory chapter, Weems sums up the book.  This will be helpful to overburdened undergraduate students.  However, those who complete the text will be satisfied by it.  <br />The best chapter is the one on African-American consumer action.  In that chapter, he discusses how black folk often fought racism economically.  For example, he stated that black customers caused the store closing of the family of Emmitt Till's murderers.  This chapter illustrates the fresh studies and perspectives still left for African-American scholars to bring forth in their (some woudl say) already crowded field.  <br />This book would be an important tool for ethnic studies majors, business professionals, and historians.  It's a wonderful text that should make the author worthy of tenure anywhere.  I love the way that he refuses to think of the African-American community as a monolithic blob: differences in class, gender, and living environment are addressed here.<br />The book is not perfect.  It never mentions Madame C.J. Walker, the first black millionaire.  It never discusses how white business people often fail to advertise their products in black publications for fear that the product will be perceived as &quot;a black thing.&quot;  Further, topics are introduced, but their history is often not elaborated upon.  For example, in the chapters on the 1970s, black film is brought up.  However, black films go back to Oscar Michaux and others.  It makes little sense that the topic was not brought up in the beginning, rather than the end, of the book.<br />Still, this book is worthy of a read from many, black and non-black, inside academia and outside of it.	2003-08-11

However, the researchers are sensitive to the poor and make their study make sense, even in a politically correct manner.  This was an anti-classist text.  It was a wonderful mix of sociology and business research.<br />The researchers ask, &quot;Who are the poor?&quot;  &quot;How do they spend differently than the middle-class?&quot;  They undress myths that the poor spend foolishly or spend more on &quot;sin&quot; products.  The book only asks at the end how advertisers may best reach them.<br />The book isn't perfect.  It tries to put a human face on various phenomena with these cheesy real-person quotes.  It fudges the question of whether the poor tend to live in urban or rural areas.  It discusses many studies that the researchers themselves conducted, often in a haphazard manner.  Still, I enjoyed this book.  Those who love capitalism but hate poverty in the US will also get much out of it.	2003-08-07

In 11 diverse chapters, the contributors here try to talk about what has shaped and what affects fatherhood.<BR>The book starts off great with a history of fatherhood. Next it discusses how fatherhood intersects with other identities (race, class, religion, rural-versus-urban environment). Then, there are these concluding boring chapters about psychological paradigms to explain fathering. This book should have been divided into parts: one on analytical models; the other on intersectional matters. I would suggest that the psychological models come first, but maybe the editors didn't want to bore and ward off readers.<BR>In many of these chapters, the contributors summarize the literature and present little analysis. On the one hand, it shows how well-read they are and allows future researchers and sociology students to just borrow their work. Also, it doesn't bog readers down in statistical (read: boring and confusing) jargon. On the other hand, it gets tiring reading chapter after chapter of \\"X said this and Y said that and Z said this beside that.\\"<BR>One of the editors, the late F. Bozett, wrote heavily on gay fatherhood. It is shocking how gay fathers are not discussed here in the slightest. With all the other identities discussed, it begs the question of how fatherhood is affected by sexual orientation.<BR>This is not a \\"how-to\\" book for dads and expectant fathers. However, the cover, title, and tone of the book make that abundantly clear. This was a good tool for people interested in men's studies and family behavior.	2003-07-20

It can be divided into two sections:  the first is a statistical analysis of the phenomenon, the second is a more direct look at men in traditionally-female careers.  The second part was easier to understand and more interesting; in some ways, it should have come first.  This is a slim text, but an enjoyable read.  At times the book gets repetitive, but it is also a great example of sociology and gender studies.<br />The statistical section shows that the inquiries can be operationalized, but often these chapters said little.  In a different article (which this book cites), an author talked about the \\"glass elevator\\" that men in female professions receive.  She says better in one chapter what half this book fails to articulate.  The chapters on specific careers (elementary teaching, secretarial work, stripping) are diverse and rigorous.  Each author has a different approach which is eye-opening and insightful.<br />The great thing about this book is how it neither ignores nor obsesses over gay men.  Typically, men in predominately female workforces are suspected of being gay.  The last chapter focuses on gay men and they are brought up often here.  However, men in these jobs are accused of other things as well:  being child abusers, being womanizers, not caring enough, etc.  I applaud this book for its lack of homophobia.  I do wish men of color were discussed more, however.  In one section of one chapter, a statistician hints that this phenomenon may affect men of color differently, yet research here focused on whites in the US, Britain, Australia, and Scandinavia rather than on minority men or men in the developing world.  Unfortunate.<br />The book raises many questions that I wish it had answered.  For example, it said that men in traditionally male jobs feel less stressed than those in female-dominant jobs.  Well, does that mean men are less suited for this work?  This book also does little in asking how men's studies or men's consciousness groups may be affecting this scenario.  Further, a book in the same series as this one has discussed how women don't devote as much time to their careers given the childcare and household demands they face.  Important employment matters are never wrestled with in this anthology.<br />Still, I'm glad this book was published.  The occurrence is something that needs to be pondered for those of us who want gender equality in the workplace.	2003-07-08

Topics include minority stress, HIV/AIDS, smoking, education, and more.  The contributors have Spanish and non-Spanish last names, thus suggesting this book was a multicultural collaboration.  This book effectively brings psychology and ethnic studies together.  The chapters are quite short and easy to read.  Still, the book felt flat.  There is not much to learn here.  This book would only be useful to undergraduate psychology majors and not many others.  I mean, it's an okay survey book.  I just wasn't blown away like I thought I would be.	2003-06-18

Many chapters were ethnically diverse (covering blacks and Latinos) as well as nationally diverse (including chapters on Japanese fathers and Swedish men).  Class matters were also brought up throughout the book.  The book never says the word \\"gay\\" once and seemed innocently (naively?) heterosexist, but I can forgive it this time.  Further, many of the studies were conducted in the late 1980s and can't take into account all that the Clinton era did for families or improved since the Reagan-Bush years.  I would recommend this book to sociology majors, feminists, and anyone concerned about the modern family.	2003-06-03

This books uses census figures and other sociological numbers to evaluate the status of immigrant women in the American employment arena.  This book carefully peels the onion asking not just if immigrant women work, but where, why, for how long, and for how much.  <br />I did not know where on the political spectrum the RAND Foundation lied, so I was very worried that this would be a horridly xenophobic and racist text.  However, this book is refreshingly objective, though you could guess that the researcher has a progressive perspective.  <br />This was a very important intersectional text.  I hope that policy makers, feminists, and immigration activists read it.  This book shatters myths about immigrants.  First off, throughout most of American history, immigrants have been predominantly female, unlike common misperceptions would have it.  On the one hand, myths that immigrant women steal jobs is untrue: they replace older workers and other Americans who don't want certain jobs.  On the other hand, most female immigrants are not self-employed:  the idea that all immigrants are energetic, self-starters is false.<br />This book is thin.  However, you must read slowly in order not to misread the facts.  About one-third of this book consists of statistical charts, but everyday readers should not be scared by this.  The researcher repeats himself often.  I loved the introductory chapter about the history of women and American immigration.  The penultimate chapter on whether immigrant women utilize social services was important, but kinda broke the flow of the text.<br />The fact that the title asks questions (note the plural) \\"Who Struggles?  Who Succeeds?\\" is an important statement to how diversity is respected.  Different demographics about immigrant women are brought up when necessary.  This book states that Pilipinas are doing incredibly well.  This surprised me because many Asian-American studies books refer to them as the \\"Forgotten Asians\\" in comparison with other groups.  Still, this book illustrated the intense difficulties of Chicanas; Latino immigration activists should find these numbers especially helpful in their work.  Now that 75% of all immigrants are from outside of Europe, race is important but not the be all to end all.  It was emphasized without being overemphasized.  This may make some people less afraid to approach the work.  The author separates \\"immigrant women\\" from \\"native-born women\\", so those in the \\"1.5 generation\\", who were born abroad but almost entirely raised here, may feel falsely represented.  Additionally, this book compares native and foreign woman more than it does foreign women and men.  Please be aware.<br />I found this book by accident, but I am pleased that I did.	2003-05-22

I'm glad I bumped into this book at a local college library.  This books is full of statistics, partially gained from the latest census but definitely from other resources additionally, about men's education, habitation patterns, jobs, opinions, health, and other life matters.  I loved finding out so much information about men, both like me and unlike me.  Nevertheless, it does scare me a  little that the government has so much info on any group.<BR>This book will be helpful to high-level policymakers and everyday conversationalists alike.  This book will be especially beneficial to college students and men's studies enthusiasts.  This book was a first edition of a series; I can't wait to read later editions and other entries in the series.<BR>In each entry, current statistics are given and the future is cautiously predicted based upon them.  This book doesn't take long to read.  However, with all the numbers floating by, one must read carefully in order to avoid miscomprehension.<BR>This is not a sexist text.  In the series, there is a text on American women and on Americans of both genders.  Besides, numbers don't hurt; it's what is done with them that could.  I sometimes this book did compare men and women more (otherwise one doesn't know if a stat on men is abnormal or a privilege).  Still, please do not confuse the gender exclusitivity here for something oppressive.	2003-04-27
1143815:US	49989755	R2IANQV8WFY6TK	041592801X	584869790	Getting By on the Minimum: The Lives of Working-Class Women	Books	5	9	11	N	N	(Straight white) women, class matters	In this sociological study, Professor Johnson compares the job availability, work satisfaction, financial oppression, and (lack of) educational options between working-class and middle-class women in the Baltimore area.  <BR>This book successfully helps to shatter the myths that America has no class, that everyone is \\"middle-class,\\" and that any American can make it out of poverty.  The Horatio Alger and Betty Boop myths are just that:  most working-class women grew up working-class, marry working-class men, and never leave that class.<BR>This book was a sharp example of sociology at its best.  In the book, theory and real life compliment each other.  Thinkers often forget everyday folk and everyday folk don't read theory.  Still, Johnson is able to explain how academic theories apply to real women and real women often think the same things about their lives that academics conclude.  Johnson has the ability to be critical of her subjects' thoughts at the same time that she lets their voices come through respectfully and clearly.  I am not sure if the subjects would be able to read this book.  However, this book would be pretty accessible to many, if not most, readers.<BR>All feminist activists, anti-classist activists, progressive thinkers and human resources wonks must read this book.  This was an incredible addition to the burgeoning collection of intersectional studies of women.  Too, this was an interesting look at Baltimore and important for people who want to think critically about labor matters.<BR>Though I'm giving this book five stars, I do have criticisms of the text.  For example, Johnson introduces a term \\"gray-collar\\" which is meant differ from white-, blue-, or pink-collar, yet the term is not well-defined.  While Johnson quotes from many other women's statistical works, for the most part, she resorts to classic male theorists (Marx, Weber, Bourdieu, etc.) for most of her support.  I found this odd coming from someone who seems so feminist.  Further, she sometimes introduces topics that upon which I wish she would have expanded (how racial intergration made some class-disadvantaged white females not want to finish high school and how unions have a masculinist, exclusive vibe, for examples).<BR>Most importantly, I am displeased about Johnson's rigidly narrow interview pool.  The title of this book says \\"working-class women,\\" yet in the first chapter, Johnson clearly states that she only means white women.  Moreover, she adds insult to injury by stating that she is only interviewing whites because there's already enough research about black women and Latinas out there.  Further, she only interviews women with \\"partners.\\"  Though she uses this gender-neutral term for subjects and herself, no one here has a female partner or identifies as lesbian or bisexual.  Johnson implies that she comes from the relatively-homogenous Australia and that her partner is male, so I wonder if she only wanted to interview women of the same race and sexual orientation as herself.  She should not have titled this book \\"working-class women\\" if she only meant \\"working-class, STRAIGHT, WHITE women.\\"  I think a study of how class affects women of color, bisexual women, and lesbians would only add to a healthy discussion, not subtract from it.  I found the author's perspective somewhat disturbing, and bordering on heterosexist and white-supremacist.	2003-04-27

In 2001, the new president of Harvard ridiculed Professor West's scholarship and implied that he had better meet with him weekly to prove that he is creating work worthy of Harvard.  Further, while it was okay for the Harvard president to have served on Clinton's campaign committee, this guy condemns West for working on Al Sharpton's forthcoming presidential bid.  As a result, West and the openly gay African scholar Anthony Appiah left Harvard and relocated to Princeton.  At a time when Brown University has become the first Ivy League to have an African-American president, black folk are getting dissed at Harvard.  The editor of this anthology tries to use West's tragedy as a jumping off point for discussing black men in the halls of tertiary education.  However, he never details what happened to West.  Anyone not up on what happened to West in 2001 wouldn't understand Jones' point in the slightest.<br />This anthology attempts to ask what keeps black men from going to college and tries to answer how we can get them to attend, finish, and possibly go on to graduate school.  This project is wonderful, but as the example above illustrates, I am uncertain about the results here.<br />Cornel's forward aside, one of the book's best accomplishments is demonstrating that Cornel West is not the only brother out there.    Each contributor has a page showing his photograph and listing his many accomplishments and publications.  This is one strategy that is going to show brothers they can make it because others have paved the way for them.<br />This book is a huge gray area.  On the one hand, there are incredible chapters here.  For example, Skip Ellis describes how he became the first black man to get a Ph.D. in computer science.  However, Irving McPhail has a long confusing chapter that is supposed to discuss black men incommunity colleges and it doesn't do so until the very end of his chapter.  The book tries to explore the tragic paucity of black men in higher education in an exhaustive manner.  Nevertheless, much of what is mentioned here could have been discussed in a quick journal article, rather than a 15-chaptered book.  On the one hand, this book has a great diversity of writing styles.  On the other hand, it's incredibly hodgepodge.  <br />Additionally, this books focus on gender seem undirected.  Many authors emphasize why they are focusing on black men; other authors stress that what they discuss applies to all genders of African-descent people.  I am not sure if this incongruence celebrates multiple views or illustrates a lack of focus.  And finally, this book is not much different from the editor's last book \\"Brothers of the Academy.\\"  I kinda don't know why he bothered to compile a second work after reading this.	2003-03-26
1200459:US	49989755	R121DNA2KHCB5V	0873585135	376404525	Warriors: Navajo Code Talkers	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Nice photographic project	&quot;Windtalkers&quot; was not the only cultural project to document a phenomenon about which more Americans should learn.  Here is a book of actual pictures of Navajo veterans that served during World War II.  The photos prove that there were more than just a few of them.  Additionally, many of the men (and I don't recall seeing any Navajo women vets in this book) wear their veterans hats.  This illustrates how many Native Americans are quite patriotic despite what the government did to their ancestors, and potentially still does with many tribes.  There is a history of non-Natives photographing Natives which only serves to exoticize and de-humanize them.  I doubt that's being done here; still, critical thinkers may want to be wary when evaluating this work.  My one critique of this book is that there is very little text included.  Besides photos, there is nothing much here.  Still, I can't criticize a photographer for not being an academic.  But be warned that this is just a coffee table book.  I'd like to see more complex works being written about these brave individuals.  Still, this was pretty excellent.	2003-03-09

It's about a Catholic theological student who eventually leaves his studies in order to live life as an openly gay and politically active young men.  This was a nice coming-of-age novel.  It's very 1970s-gay-liberation and may feel outdated to many.  The public sex that is celebrated in this book would horrify many in this AIDS era.  Still, it was good for its time.

Therefore, she analyzes the HIV prevention organizatoin Proyecto Contra SIDA in San Francisco, the political asylum case of gay Brazilian Marcelo Tenorio, and LGBT Latin@ chatrooms.  She describes these phenomena as \\"subjects in process\\" in order to avoid the traps of essentialism and identity politics but to promote the transgressive and postmodern qualities of the aforementioned events.<br />Rodriguez makes her knowledge about Latin American history and politics obvious.  This book equally mentions Latin@s in the US and Latin Americans outside of it.  By mentioning a Brazilian asylee, her Spanish internet lover, the independence debates on Puerto Rico, and Chicano clubs in the Bay Area, Rodriguez proves her commitment to pan-Latinidad.  In many books that address racial and sexual minorities, only one gender is featured.  Manrique's \\"Besame Mucho\\" or Moraga's \\"This Bridge Called My Back\\" are examples of that.  Rodriguez, however, brings up people of all genders (and there are more than two) here.  Further, this book mentions gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered equally. Thus, I understand her use of the controversial term \\"queer.\\"  The author is just pretty darn inclusive.<br />Given the three phenomena she analyzes, the reader can easily tell that Rodriguez is trying to expand the perameters of what is considered cultural studies.  She cites critical race legal theory which is surprising because critical legal theorists usually already borrow so many ideas from traditionally-trained academics, like herself, outside of the law.  The book is short in page length, yet it still takes quite a while to read.  The bibilography is a great guide for works by \\"queer\\" academics of color.<br />Rodriguez is an extroverted, sex-positive lesbian academic similar to Gayle Rubin, Joan Nestle, and (as of late) Lillian Faderman.  I think her students will be shocked at how open she is about her sex life in this text.  On the back cover of the book, Jose' Quiroga praises her writing.  Rodriguez writes in an exhaustive fashion about cultural products just like Quiroga, so I wasn't surprised to see his name here.  I don't mean to imply that LatinAs can only imitate their white female or LatinO counterparts; it's just that her influences in this book stand out.<br />The front cover of the book shows a split papaya (or guava?).  She informs us that this is a poster for San Francisco's Proyecto, but its symbolic representation of the female body is quite lesboerotic and reminds me of Georgia O'Keefe's flowers.  The front and back covers are red, gold, and purple:  a somewhat loud clash of colors.  It somewhat reminds me of the Venezuelan flag, but Rodriguez states that she is Cuban-American.  I think the vibrant color scheme is meant to represent the ideas of Latin@s as being lively and living in warm climates.<br />I really liked this book, but I do have to make two warnings.  First, the reader should know in advance what this text is.  THIS IS A VERY ACADEMIC CULTURAL STUDIES TEXT FROM A PhD.  Though Rodriguez proves that she is very knowledgeable about \\"queer\\" Latin@ organizing, this book does not answer \\"How to start a Latin@ LGBT club,\\" \\"Who's Who Among Gay Latin@s,\\" or \\"What is the history of Queer Latin@ Activism.\\"  Potential readers who assume this book is a repeat of \\"Compan~eras\\" or \\"Chicana Lesbians\\" will be disappointed.<br />Additionally, many of Rodriguez's analyses could be interpreted differently.  For example, she states that gay Latino academics (like Mun~oz and Quiroga) transgressively \\"queer\\" scholarship by discussing more than one medium within the same text.  Well, given that homosexuality was the love that dare not speak its name and that the subaltern had no voice (as writers have mentioned in the past), it's not surprising that academics have to glean from what they can find in order to discuss \\"queer\\" Latin@ cultural works.  What she thinks of as subversive, I think of as a reflection on oppression.  Still, this was a great work.	2003-02-26

This book is written by two feminist, African-American scholars.  Either one or both have connections to Spelman, the nation's only college specifically for black women.  In this book, the authors want to show how antiracist struggle could not have been successful without the black women visionaries who played a part in the movement, even if they wouldn't have called their ideas feminist.  The chapters cover the authors' biographies, other black scholars talking about how they learned to embrace feminism and gay rights, the either/or bind between civil rights and women's rights, the black church, black silence on intraracial sexual assaults, black gays and lesbians, and rap music.<BR>This is a positive text; the authors discuss where they would like to see black activists go, rather than just rehashing old schisms.  Further, it recounts history to show that there have always been black feminists and black gay rights activists, thus negating fallacies which say these two groups are white-created by-products.  Too often, even in progressive black literature, \\"race, class, and gender\\" are deemed of primary importance, but sexual orientation must take a backseat, even if authors are not homophobic.  Here, almost every chapter says something about gays and combatting homophobia.  I was loving it.<BR>This book would make a great contribution for professors trying to put together courses about black feminism or about gay issues in African-American communities.  The bibliography of each chapter could basically be a syllabus for many cool courses.  Unfortunately, in many ways, the book is just a review of the literature rather than a new analysis of these matters.  The chapters remind me both of papers I wrote and papers I read while an undergraduate student.  <BR>Still, this was an important black feminist book.  Sadly, many readers may find Patricia Hill Collins too high-level and bell hooks too repetitive and paranoid, so this book would be a great look into black women'sissues for more everyday readers.  Regardless, this text was a great addition to studies of intersectionality and womanism (though the latter term is never brought up here).	2003-02-18

They analyze gender blending, pro-feminism, being an ally, and a host of other issues.  The gods of men's studies are all here:  Messner, Kimmel, and Connell.  There are great contributions from African-American critical thinkers as well.  I didn't devour this book as voraciously as I thought I would, but it was still good.  It's a welcome addition to the movement to show that those with male privilege can take feminism seriously too.	2003-02-18

The great thing is, he makes a point of speaking to lesbians, gays of color, and the HIV-positive in all these countries.  This would be a great book for gays and lesbians of color to read.  There are two chapters on Thailand and this may feel a little exploitative and sex-touristy, but Miller is an obvious progressive and wouldn't mean to offend intentionally.  While reading this book, you will ask yourself how Miller got the money to do so much travelling and investigating in the first place.  Readers will wish they had the opportunities that the author had.  This book was both informative and fun.	2003-02-18

This anthology is based upon writings from a conference on the matter.  The authors ask many questions.  How does/did public sex shape the gay community?  How does the attack against public sex hurt AIDS education?  How are prostitutes affected by the Times Square \\"clean up\\"?  Why are radical queers uniting with anti-gay conservatives to close bathhouses?  How is the public/private divide collapsing as gay rights becomes old news?<br />This book showed academics working as sex radicals and sex radicals working as academics.  Gay studies undergraduates are going to be surprised at how risque and sex-positive their stodgy professors can be.  Readers of all educational backgrounds will be shocked when they see what sexual act is portrayed on the cover of this basically non-pornographic text.<br />This book had authors diverse in their gender, sexual orientation, and HIV status.  This will give readers of all sexualities a glimpse at how members of the gay community can conflict with each other.  For instance, the venom at which these contributors condemn Signorile and Rotello has not been seen since the constructionists' attack against the late historian Boswell.  Still, as complex as this book was, it may be an example of too many cooks spoiling the soup.  Further, this book is VERY New York-centered and many readers from other localities may not be able to relate. <br />Let me leave with two examples of problems in this book.  Kendall Thomas interviews a black gay man and black lesbian who started radical sex establishments  in the City.  He introduces his first question with reference to the 1980s Bowers decision and Pat Califia as if these clubowners were as erudite as himself.  Later, Munoz jumps from Adorno to Warhol to tearoom art to the psychology of HIV-negative gay men all within 15 pages.  I think these two academics are two of the most awesome writers out there and yet I found myself rolling my eyes during both discussions.  <br />This book is unique, yet it gets repetitive after a while.  It is quite challenging, yet I still ask myself, \\"What were all these contributors thinking?!\\"  <br />I am glad I got the chance to read this book, but some of the balls being juggled here were dropped.	2003-02-13

It is part of a book series called \\"Hot Issues\\" which prints texts that deal with subjects that teenagers may want to understand like drug abuse, depression, and stalking.  This is a VERY slender book.  I read it within one sitting.  It has nice photographs and charts; it also has a nice font that is easy on the eyes.<br />The author is great at reciting history (mentioning Pocahontas' marriage to John Rolfe, the Loving v. Virginia decision, the fact that Plessy was only one-eighth Black, etc.); she helps multiracial youth understand that they are not some new trend or phenomena.  She emphasizes how immigration has helped to increase the amount of race-mixing in this country.  She is great at explaining how many famous Blacks have both white and Native American ancestors.<br />Still, I have some criticisms of this book.  First, this book is still black-white dominant.  It has graphs comparing whites' and blacks' views on race that say nothing about Natives, Asians, or Latinos.  It focuses on black-white mixed people even though numerically there are more Eurasian and Anglo-Latino mixed folk.  Even though the author has a Spanish name and works at a university in a highly Latino area, the book says extremely little about Anglo-Latins and Latinos generally.  She misquotes Tiger Woods:  she said he identifies as \\"Cablinasian\\"; in actuality, he USED TO identify that way.<br />Despite the fact that I found this book at a university, it is clearly intended for a teenage or adolescent audience.  So I like Maria PP Root's books and the autobiographies of Rebecca Walker and Kevin Johnson more than this, but that's because I am not the intended audience for this book.  Again, I think multiracial teens will love this text, but most adults, especially those who have read multiracial books for adults, may be disappointed.	2003-02-07

In the first section of the book, he reviews the literature and explains how his theory differs from past academics' work.  Dilley creates a chart that organizes the acts of closeted and out men in the past five decades.  I haven't seen such a solid gay diagraphing since reading Eve Sedgwick's ideas on minoritizing versus universalizing.  In section two, Dilley uses real-life narratives to differentiate between men who would identify as homosexual, gay, or queer (and yes, there are differences).  In the final section, he details gay students' organizing at the University of Kansas, one of his alma mater.  <br />Most books on young gays are autobiographical anthologies.  Finally, we have a book where a scholar is trying to think of this population theoretically.  This is an intersectional work:  Dilley emphasizes how college affects men's identities just as much as he emphasizes how much homosexuality does.<br />Few studies of gays are cross-historical like this.  One would imagine that elderly gay men would be too closeted and afraid to talk about their earlier search for a sexual identity.  Additionally, so many of the men who would fit under the \\"gay\\" label in this chart have succumbed to AIDS over the past two decades.  I've heard people differentiate between generations of gay men playfully, but this is the first study which illustrates just how time period and age affect a person's gay status.  So Dilley really needs to be commended for this study.  I can imagine that this book would be a great reference book for college counselors and dorm monitors, not just for thinking about what motivates gay campus activists, but what motivates their closeted counterparts as well.<br />The majority of readers, especially non-academic ones, will enjoy section two, the narratives, the best.  All readers will both relateand be surprised by what the respondents have to say.  Here, gay men talk about tales of woe, triumph, embarrassment, shame, and pride:  human phenomena for which we should all understand.  Many of the events here made me laugh, gasp, frown, and smile.  Additionally, in this section, Dilley shows off his skills as a journalist and biographer.<br />Too often, gay school narratives center around prestigious schools along the coasts.  Perhaps due to the fact that he teaches in downstate Illinois, Dilley includes a wide variety of college types, especially Midwestern, public schools.  The sample is so diverse, it kinda made me sad that my own alma mater wasn't mentioned.  Dilley notes that he has collaborated on work with my college-years mentor Kris Renn yet he never mentions Brown University. (Oops!  What was I say about elite coastal schools!?)<br />Still, this book had its problems.  While I think gay men will love the hot sex stories recounted here, straight people and lesbians may be shocked.  In both the theoretical section and in the real-life narratives, gay men discuss having sex way before ever falling in love.  This may push people to buy into notions of gay men as oversexed, predatory, and promiscuous.  <br />Though Dilley makes clear that one paradigm does not necessarily preclude another, I still found the distinction made between \\"gay\\" and \\"queer\\" students odd.  He defines queer students as willing to do drag and be performative, but in the time right after the Stonewall Rebellion, gay men were very into performance, especially around gender.  The book shows an advertisement for a gay campus dance in the 1970s where the characters are in drag, i.e., performing \\"queerly.\\"  Further, in describing \\"homosexual\\" men from an earlier era, almost all the respondents were music or art majors:  stereotype or reality?<br />Dilley employs the term \\"non-heterosexual\\" to be inclusive of homosexual, gay, queer, straight-acting, closeted, and questioning men.  I applaudhis sensitivity and inclusiveness, but this term gets cumbersome after a while.  While this book is filled with gay men mentioning they dated or married women, none of the respondents identified as bisexual.  The last chapter even has \\"fluidity\\" in its title, yet bisexual-identified men are still not brought up.  (Neither are transgendered men, in either direction, for that matter.) Bisexual activist readers may be particularly irked by this.<br />On most campuses, lesbians and bisexual women have played very important roles in promoting gay rights.  Their exclusion from this study seemed unnecessary.  I particularly feel this way because masculinity, one's identity as male, and other topics brought up in men's studies are not really analyzed here.  This book includes biographical sketches of a Latino man, an Asian-American, and an African-American.  Nevertheless, white gay men with black fetishes got more coverage than black gay men themselves.  I harshly criticize the author for being so callous in this matter.  Further, Dilley states that fraternities do much in helping to forge gay men's sexuality, yet he never mentions the famous black or Latino fraternities.  Also, working-class men are rarely addressed here.  Most of the respondents seemed to have gone on to graduate school.  Gay men who never attended college might find no use for this book.<br />When I saw this book at a store, I immediately had to buy it.  Once I got it home, I found myself less and less pressed about reading it.  I am so glad this book was made and I wish Dilley much success.  Still, I didn't devour this text like I thought I would have.	2003-02-04

The contributors are diverse (women of color, white women, and even a couple of men).  The writing styles are different (personal narrative, high cultural theory, public policy analysis, statistical numbers crunching, etc.).  The topics vary too.  I think the best chapters come near the end of the book and deal with breast cancer and HIV/AIDS.  There is also regional diversity in terms of the participants studied.  This book does include chapters on Asian women, Latinas, immigrants, and Native American women.  Still, the book mostly focuses upon African-American women.  In fact, chapters that mention nothing about race tend to address black women.  Instead, they use signifiers (\\"the projects\\", \\"Rural Louisiana\\", etc.)  As great as this book was, I see one big, potential problem.  The authors describe the health beliefs of women of color to highlight how Western, Eurocentric medicine may be missing them or not helping them.  Unfortunately, in some ways, this book makes women of color look superstitious, primitive, and almost illiterate.  By discussing Black women who don't accept that they passed sickle cell anemia to their children, Latinas who say they'd rather die than suffer from breast cancer, and Southeast Asian women who drink teas in order to shoo away evil spirits, women of color--facing so many barriers as it is--look so backwards here.  I wonder if the editors pondered this problem.	2003-01-26

At the time this book was written, AIDS was mostly a disease of adult men; thus, women and children with the virus were a minority within a minority.  This book has more chapters on children than women and I wish the opposite was the case.  There is only one chapter on international HIV-positive women and children:  this may bother some people since that is the population in which the illness is most rampant.  This book has lots of useful facts in it (but remember that it was written a decade ago).  It discussed how AIDS affect reproduction, healt care providers, and family structures.  People concerned about women and children with AIDS could really employ this as a good reference for educating the public.	2003-01-23

The book has a discography, drawings from fans, and much, much more.  Most notably, there is a photo of Jon Moss kissing Boy George smack on the mouth.  Remember, this was 15 years before VH-1's \\"Behind the Music\\" documentary.  Further, there are photos of Mickey Craig's children and Roy Hay's (ex?) wife.  Additionally, attention is paid to the other members, though Boy has a disproportionate emphasis.  I still own my copy of this book and I am pretty sure I'd never part with it.  If I ever met Boy George, I'd probably want him to sign this book as much as I would an actual Culture Club LP (I am dating myself) or CD.	2003-01-23

In this text, she tries to find a middle ground in which racism is acknowledged but low self-esteem is addressed.  Unfortunately, assessing racism takes up so much of the text that many readers may completely forget the message about self-esteem.  Further, while hooks affectively points to where black self-esteem is lacking, she says very little about how it can be regained.<br />In so many ways, hooks is beating a dying horse.  Her book Salvation could have been attached to her book All about Love and Rock My Sould could have been attached to Salvation.  Whereas in her love books, she clearly spells out the definition of love and emphasizes love in every chapter, here self-esteem gets lost in the mix and is given charecteristics but never concretely defined.<br />hooks loves patting herself on the back for being able to talk about race, class, and gender simultaneously.  In this book, her love of male heroes Malcolm X and Dr. King shines through.  Though consistently pro-black, in this book hooks actually praises whites for their resistance to sexism and rigid gender roles and condemns blacks for embracing those two oppressions.  Still, hooks uses kid gloves when critiquing McWhorter and other black conservatives in contrast to her complete trashing of Wolf, Roiphe, and Paglia in her book Outlaw Culture.<br />hooks is great at summarizing black history.  She re-illustrates how thoroughly and widely she reads.  <br />Nevertheless, she quotes Nathaniel Branden so often, one wonders if she has just taken his book(s) and given it (them) a chocolate-y twist.  If you've read her other books, so much of this book is repetitive.  We already know she has conflicting feelings about rapper Foxxxy Brown and detests Sharazad Ali and \\"Waiting to Exhale.\\"  hook often mentions \\"terrorism\\" in this 911 era, but her use may seem pat and overblown to some readers.  hooks has added \\"imperialism\\" to her mantra of \\"white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy\\"; this only begs the question more of why she can't use \\"heteropatriarchy\\" or explicitly state how homophobia is just as rampant in this society as other oppressions.  Further, hooks has always declared that she adds bibliographies to her books to avoid user-unfriendly footnotes, yet this book cites many books and has no bibliography.<br />I'll still read anything that bell publishes, it's just that this book was not that great.	2003-01-20

If anybody remembers how Haitians were treated or Axl Rose's xenophobic and homophobic rant, AIDS has been blamed not just on gay men, but also on immigrants.  Finally, scholars have created a book that looks at the spread of AIDS in one immigrant group.  The book develops smoothly:  it first discusses migrant workers in general, then migrant workers and AIDS, then the perceptions of this group to AIDS, then a discussion of AIDS prevention strategies among this group.  The editors are a good mix of Latinos and concerned non-Latinos.  The book is fair in considering how people in the US bring AIDS to Mexico and vice versa.  Substantial treatment is given to both genders when thinking about the spread of the disease among migrant workers.  Nevertheless, some Spanish language purists may be irritated the authors' use of the redundant \\"Latino male\\" and the oxymoronic \\"Latino woman.\\"  The book is very cognizant of the fact that much migrant AIDS transmission comes from male-to-male sex; this book could be considered an addition to the burgeoning opus of Latino gay books.  The book is riddled with spelling errors, be warned.  Regionalism is left unanalyzed.  For example, there is a chapter about AIDS among Latino migrant workers in Pennsylvania which never once says how this population in PA differs from the majority of Latino migrant laborers in CA and TX.  Further, the book's statistics suggest that AIDS is most prevalent in areas with Black agricultural laborers, so it somewhat re-emphasizes that more studies need to be done in that group.  <br />Despite my criticisms, I found this book quite useful and I hope that more scholars produce work regarding immigrants and HIV/AIDS.	2003-01-18

I mean Latino, Communities	This anthology details the origins, extent, and solutions for drug use and trafficking in Latino communities.  The chapters focus on various stages of distributing drugs (addiction and selling) and curing the abuse (prevention and counseling).  Several Latino subpopulations are emphasized as well (adolescents, women).  The contributors have various writing styles.  Some of the work was number-crunching, others were historical or merely descriptive.  AIDS was a backdrop to the discussion; there was one AIDS-focused chapter and a few chapters ended with the topic.  However, the overlap of drug use and prostitution or male-to-male sex in the AIDS spread was not brought up; I found that kinda disappointing.  This book was compiled over a decade ago and it may be dated.  The use of \\"Hispanic\\" rather than \\"Latino\\" is an example of this fact.  The book differentiates and highlights Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans.  Though other Latino groups may feel left out, I applaud this goal to recognize ethnic distinctions within the Latino population.  Though there were some Spanish-surnamed authors, I get the sense that this was mostly Anglo writing on the Latino populations.  This may feel a bit colonizing to some readers.  Still, I am glad there's a book out there that documents the problem and the cure amongst this racial minority group.	2003-01-15

A real diva is here!  SNAP!	This book is a mixture of biography and collected works of Richard Bruce Nugent, the most openly gay writer of the Harlem Renaissance.  His 1920s story, \\"Smoke, Lillies and Jade\\" has been called the first African-American fictional account regarding homosexuality.  The book also includes many photos of Nugent and his gay peers as well as Nugent's artwork.  <br />The book is divided into five sections, emphasizing Nugent's fictional and non-fictional work.  However, the best part of the book is the historical introduction; it should have been highlighted somehow.  This book is a veritable \\"Who's Who?\\" of the Gay Harlem Renaissance.  Unfortunately, this excellent documentation of the numerous gay Black authors writing in the early 20th century leaves the impression that little is known about Nugent or little is worth saying.  Still, I found myself wanting to read every footnote because they show how much material is out there that has yet to be reviewed scholastically.  Heads up, gay studies graduate students!<br />Though the excerpts of Nugent's writings span a fifty-year period, the grand majority of it comes from the 1930s.  Nugent, in \\"Smoke\\" and most other writings, was a blatant cheerleader for the Renaissance.  I found his work challenging, though at times incredibly boring.  It's admitted that his artwork is faux Erte, but it's implied homoeroticism must truly be relished.  Be warned that it's very campy.  I applaud Nugent in his continual inclusion of women in his artwork, non-fiction, and fiction.  You would never have to worry about him saying some foolishness like \\"Hated it!\\"  Besides, if I read this correctly, Nugent never went to college, yet his writing is quite sophisticated.<br />Surprisingly, this book reminds me of Little Richard's biography, even though that was written during one of Richard's homophobic stages.  Both Richard and Nugent were/are frequently X-rated in order to get laughs and push the envelope on societal norms.  Like Dennis Rodman,Nugent swears that because Blacks rejected him, he only pursued \\"Latins.\\"  This fetishization may really disturb gay Latino and Italian-American readers.  But remember:  gay whites of the era like E.M. Forster also celebrated \\"difference\\" in ways that we would now deem politically incorrect.<br />Skip Gates' forward is scant, but it does reprove his commitment to an anti-homophobic, African-American scholarship.  The biographer is a white gay man \\"interested\\" in Black culture.  Shockingly, he never cites Eric Garber, the non-Black scholar who was the first in gay studies to report on the gay underpinnings of the Harlem Renaissance.  It's a shame too, because many of Garber's insights are still useful, yet they go unacknowledged.  Wirth includes a section in which Nugent remembers Carl Van Vecten, the gay white celebrity-maker who promoted the Renaissance.  This section is confusing and says little.  It somewhat re-centers Van Vechten and feels slightly Eurocentric.  Still, the biographer has a Ph.D. in chemistry from CalTech yet he writes like the most sophisticated gay studies Ph.D.  I give him much credit.<br />Finally, this book has been categorized under \\"racially mixed persons.\\"  Though it is mentioned that Nugent had some Native American ancestors, interracial romantic liaisons and passing come up much more often than multiracial identity matters in this text.<br />All people who want to challenge the idea that gayness is a \\"white thing\\" or \\"recent phenomenon\\" need to read this book.	2003-01-07

It has writings from academics whom I totally admire.  And I understand why people would study gayness as it relates to 1960s popular culture.  Still, this book has very little about Warhol and his sexuality in it.  A person is better off reading a biography of Warhol, especially those written by the people who knew him personally.  This was quite an unimpressive anthology.	2003-01-05

Gary Fisher was a graduate student, fledgling writer, and Black gay man living in the Bay Area before his death in the mid-1990s.  This book consists of two parts:  a sample of short stories and poems and an autobiographical sketch based upon his diaries.<br />I don't know whether to thank the author, editor, and publishing company for challenging me and most other readers or to throw this book into an incinerator.  One reviewer in the gay press called this writing \\"outre\\" and I wholeheartedly agree.  I am thoroughly surprised that this book is available at non-pornographic outlets.  Rafael Campo, Don Belton, and Eve Sedgwick all have raved about Fisher or helped this book come into fruition.  I admire all three of those writers and enjoy their work, so I have no idea what they were thinking here.  E. Lynn Harris' fans would roll over and die if they read this book!  It's one thing for art to push the envelope, but an actual Black gay man made all the poor and crazy choices that Gary Fisher made.  I had to work hard to keep my eyes in their sockets trying to get through this book.<br />While the fiction and poetry demonstrate the potential Fisher had, they are worthless.  Things don't really get started until the autobiographical portion begins.  This book invokes every \\"disrespectable\\" aspect of some gay people's lives; the Far Right could have a field day with this text.  The shock value and goriness is very reminiscent of David Wojnarowicz's \\"Postcards from America\\" and Eve Sedgwick, the editor, basically admits as much in her conclusion.  Adding racial matters into the mix only intensifies the uncomfort I felt.  Issues such as dangerously unsafe sex practices, size-queeniness, Uncle Tom-ism, coprofilia, anonymous and public sex all come up and readers will be thoroughly shocked at how.  The action in this book comes out of nowhere.  Fisher never clearly states when he started to identify as gay, when he decided to practice masochism, when he tested positive forHIV, or when he met Eve Sedgwick.  They all kinda just happen.  Furthermore, he is a closeted gay and a black self-loather.  He never once challenges homophobia or racism.<br />Eve Sedgwick praises Fisher's feelings on race as \\"complicated.\\" Ha!  Fisher makes very clear that he hated being black.  Throughout his life he hardly associates with other blacks.  He lets white gay men do all kinds of degrading things to him.  While he listens to black music, you hardly hear anything about black literature, heroes, or friends.  He does have sex with some black men, but he places white men on a pedestal and even enjoys when he is called racist epithets.  Not only will straight Black readers be appalled, but gay Blacks will be both appalled and embarrassed.  If bell hooks hated \\"Paris Is Burning,\\" you can just imagine how she and others would trash this book.  He is very race-conscious, but this guy didn't have an ounce of Black pride.  Additionally, Fisher thinks in strictly black-white terms though he moved to California, a state with many Latinos and Asians.  Sedgwick makes clear that Fisher wanted the book's title, but it nevertheless underlines all the ugly issues that his life brings up.<br />Possibly due to Sedgwick's editing and institutional connections, this book has the format, height, and font of many gay studies texts from Duke University Press.  This is odd to see in a non-academic book.  Some of the autobiographical part is ramblings of his fiction.  I understand that characters sometimes speak to writers when they are creating art, but this made the book even more confusing, capricious, and repetitive.  Fisher asks many rhetorical questions that need question marks, yet Sedgwick fails to edit them in.  Fisher obviously read much yet music seems to have moved his life far more than literature did.  <br />I do love the fact that Fisher was attracted to heavy guys.  There is a lot of prejudice against fat men in the gay community and this one aspect of Fisher was a breath of fresh air.  At a time when many coming-out stories are being produced by gay men, few are done by gay Blacks and SM-practitioners.  Also, Fisher is an \\"Army brat\\" and not enough has been written about their lives.  This book adds to the collection of AIDS writings which is formidable.  The reader does get to observe how AIDS has robbed us of someone who had talent.  And it is provocative in a way.<br />STILL, LET ME WARN ALL READERS THAT THEY BETTER HAVE A STRONG STOMACH, NO POLITICALLY CORRECT LEANINGS, AND AN INCREDIBLY THICK SKIN IF THEY ARE GOING TO READ THIS BOOK.  YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED!	2003-01-02

After a time when talking heads of all sexual orientations have tried to emphasize that \\"gay does not equal AIDS and AIDS does not equal gay,\\"  the contributors in this anthology ask how the AIDS pandemic does shape or affect gay and lesbian identity.  In this book, various psychologists analyze this question in terms of coming out, volunteering, and gay rights advocacy.  Moreover, the editors see this book as a lamentation to all the psychologists who have died of the illness.  The first chapter begins with a therapist summarizing his dealings in the AIDS era and the last chapter consists of a late, HIV-positive psychologist theorizing about the future of AIDS prevention funding.<br />This book is the second volume of a very sharp and needed series on gay and lesbian psychological issues.  Herek and Greene re-prove that they are on the cutting edges of this field and are great champions in extending research into this area.  The contributors are diverse in terms of gender and race.  I am saddened that this book will be hard to find outside of university libraries and away from the access of everyday gay men and lesbians.<br />Each of the articles summarizes a lot of the research that has been done on AIDS and gay identity.  Most readers will be surprised how much research has been done on these questions.  The book includes a chapter on AIDS volunteerism that I found confusing.  However, the chapters dedicated to Black, Puerto Rican, and Asian-American gay men fighting HIV were incredible.  The book has a very important chapter on HIV and lesbian.  Still, in many instances throughout the chapters, \\"gay and lesbian\\" really signifies \\"gay male\\" and this may rub feminist and pro-feminist readers the wrong way.  Then again, there is information here about Asian-Americans and lesbians that highlight that no group can be seen as not being at risk or in need of AIDS education.  Some readers, especially now, may be disturbed by the focus on AIDS in the US and the exclusionof global AIDS concerns.  <br />All in all, gay and lesbian psychotherapists and gay rights activists must get their hands on this book.	2002-12-17

On the one hand, Mr. Whitam and the people (graduate students?) who worked under him must have had major funding to compare gay men in three different countries to those in the US.  On the other, the cruddy font that was used and the lack of sophistication in the writing suggests something more amateur.  This book was very informative for me when I was writing a paper on homosexuality in Brazil at Brown University.  Plus, the whole constructionism vs. essentialism debate is tiresome when almost no one argues in favor of essentialism.  Well, this book kinda does, and reasonably so I might add.  This book basically implies that the world over, gay men are interested in art and witty gossip.  This may rub many readers, and especially rigorous academics, the wrong way.  Also, some of Whitam's theories lead to obvious or empty conclusions.  For example, he says something to the effect of \\"gay males either hate sports, like sports, or are indifferent to sports.\\"  Hello!  Those are the only options for everyone!  One's answer would be the same despite gender or sexual identity.  I love that scholars are finally writing comparative books on homosexuality in the modern world.  Still, this book was a little second-rate.  It may be a good addition to the libraries of those collecting books on Latino or Asian gay men, however.	2002-12-17

This would be a great book for Latino or ethnic studies majors to have in their personal libraries.  I have one criticism:  some of the articles are long on description and short on analysis.  Further, don't let the title fool you.  Talking about the &quot;late 20th Century&quot; may seem passe now.

It repeats cases involving gays fighting for employment, citizenship, child custody, etc.  However, based upon its date, it doesn't include \\"Romer v.

Similarly, to this day, all the blacks are men and all the women are white, when it comes to talk about elected officials.  Finally, here is a book to break the silence.  McCain Gill discusses each black women that has ever been elected to Congress by the mid-1990s.  Her style is journalistic and biographical.  This would be a great book for all women of color majoring in political science.  Further, for sistas thinking about running for office, this is a great tool for learning about the passages that have already been cleared for you.  This book may seem a little dated now.  Too, I wish someone would write a book like this that mentions all women of color, not just blacks.  Still, I enjoyed this book and I thank McCain Gill (a woman, unlike another review suggests)for this positive contribution to womanist studies.	2002-11-20

On the one hand, it feels a little dated, but on the other, the reader can tell how much it has thoroughly influenced many of the anthologies of lesbian and gay writing of color to come after it.  This book is a smorgasbord of poems, essays, diary entries, and other writings from Latina lesbians.  It has some cheesy, Cocteau-influenced pencil drawings too, which I won't bother to discuss.  In the style of Anzaldua and Moraga, this is another book which celebrates bilingualism and has essays in English and Spanish, without translations, by the way.  However, unlike the two previously mentioned Latina lesbian authors, there is little \\"Spanglish\\" here.  Unlike Latino collections, that focus upon Mexican-Americans, this book has a healthy selection of writings from Puerto Ricans, especially Black Puerto Ricans.  I'm sure this is due to the New York residence of the editor, but I was loving it regardless of its reasons.  Also, this is one of the few Latino anthologies which includes writings from Brazilian-Americans.  Unlike so much lesbian writing where the narrator is always the blameless heroine, the authors here lead real lives:  they make mistakes and write about stuff that could make many readers uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, there are many essays that say little about race and also many that say little about sexuality.  In this book, women are much more likely to say they are lesbians who have had sex with men than to identify as bisexual and this may rub some bisexual readers the wrong way.  Whereas the writers had much to say about sexism of men and homophobia in communities of color, they said little about racism in the gay community and I tend to think this was done purposely because the authors may want to encourage a large white lesbian readership.  Many of the authors only use their first names; this type of anonymity would be seen as closet-y and shocking nowadays.  Still, even today, there is not enough Latina lesbianwriting out there.  So this is a precious, early effort at filling the void.  I did enjoy reading this book, even as it sometimes felt rough around the edges.	2002-11-14

Gay immigration is a very urgent issue and I'm glad the matter is being documented.  But this book left me so sad and dissatisfied.  On the one hand, activists globally can learn from Austalia's example.  This book starts with a decent chapter on the history of gay Australian immigration.  This was also a longitudinal study: something you rarely find in sexual orientation-related research.  However, the book is very sloppily-written.  It reads like a scrapbook or diary.  So many of his discussions are internal and unimportant.  There's no way an American scholar could get tenure with a book like this.  Usually, I praise gay male authors that remember to include lesbians in their research.  But the lesbians involved in the study get scant mention and thus become negligible.  Like studies of gay Asians in white-dominated countries throughout the world, this text is filled with cute, young Asian guys having no choice but to partner with size-, age-, and looks-challenged white mates.  This book will kinda rub the younger non-Eurocentric gay men of color the wrong way.  You would think that binational gay couples have risked thick and thin to be together.  In this book, the Australian officials encourage gay couples to cheat on their applications and all kinds of pairs that have no intention of staying together apply for couple status.  Most every respondent said the immigration controversy is affecting their health negatively.  Further, the author says things about his long-term partner that no spouse should say about another in print.  There's no bigamy allowed in Australia for straight citizens, yet the author is not fazed in the least to apply for immigration status for his Thai extra lover.  Worse, he gets mad when he finds that his Thai lover is cheating but never criticizes himself for cheating on his first lover with the Thai national.  Bottom line:  America is so far away from enacting gay immigration (which is a shame) and this book will do NOTHING to help that goal happen, as poor and tragic as this work is.	2002-11-07

So many books either talk about desegregation alone, mixed-race marriages alone, or multiracial children alone.  This book brings all those themes together under the interracial label.  The essays in this book are short.  In fact, some are quite choppy.  They are mostly reprints from magazines and oftentimes the title in this anthology does not fairly represent the words of the specific contributors.  Still, this book has some well-known, excellent writers here.  For people sensitive about racial mixing, the point-counterpoint approach may be painful:  you have been warned.  Still, this was a good introductory book for people, especially young students, to start thinking about various race-related issues.

This book may be good for gay and lesbian Christians just beginning to think about radical politics.  But I was not particularly moved by this book.

In this book, Mayer looks at how issues affecting African-Americans have consistently played a role in presidential elections for the past 40 years.  Each chapter focuses on a specific election.  Though Mayer is knowledgeable that the black-white paradigm is breaking down, he still focuses upon it.  This will rub many non-black people of color the wrong way.  He may have been more prudent to say &quot;African-American&quot; rather than the overgeneralized &quot;race.&quot;  Furthermore, he is clearly a progressive and conservative readers will accuse him of bias.  Plus, like West, Guinier, and many others have said, people don't want to talk about race; so there will be tons of readers that will resist this book, period.  That's unfortunate because Mayer's book is an example of strong political science.  And remember, this is a white male scholar saying, &quot;Race has and still matters.&quot;  I'm sure readers won't find it as easy to label him biased as they would a black academic.  It contributes greatly to the field of presidential studies and voting behavior.  The fact that this book covers a 40-year span rather than an instant moment in time is also an achievement.  (Then again, many can argue that such a book could have covered the presidency since Washington.)  The conclusion offers mixed hypotheses that readers across the political spectrum should hear.  Mayer's book is an important addition to the study of American history.	2002-11-03

At first, this book looked really simplistic, like it could have been called &quot;Get to know Puerto Ricans&quot; or something.  However, it turns out that this book is a part of a series to introduce Americans to the new face of immigrants; it's a very-needed, pro-immigrant, anti-xenophobic series.  I also wondered why this is such an easy and quick read and then I discovered that the book is written for high school students, though I found it in a university library.  Still, this would be a good, quick reference books for any ethnic studies majors at the undergraduate level.  Puerto Ricans may find the info here a given and already known, but for non-Puerto Ricans, it will be a great learning, introductory resource.  For those who live outside New York and know that Mexican-Americans are the majority Latino group, it will be interesting to read phrases such as &quot;Puerto Ricans and other Latinos&quot; as opposed to &quot;Mexican-Americans and other Latinos.&quot;  The cover is gorgeous:  I want to meet the hot woman and man on the cover more than I want to meet the author!  This book celebrates the triracial background of Puerto Ricans being Taino, African, and Spanish.  The author breaks the black-white paradigm by not only discussing Puerto Ricans' relationships with those two groups but also with non-Puerto Rican Latinos, Jews, and Asians.  I did feel this book was a little scant on the debates about Puerto Rican independence.  Still, this was an informative &quot;Who's Who of Puerto Ricans?&quot; text.  For example, I never knew Jimmy Smits was Puerto Rican (I had only heard about his father's heritage, Surinamese).  Also, the author notes that many famous people that are grouped as African-American are also part-Puerto Rican (Clayton Powell IV, Sammy Davis, etc.).  Finally, there's something I like that the author probably didn't intend:  I thought this was a great book about a US territory.  Most students have to do reports on Nebraska, Delaware, or Wyoming sooner or later.  But few Mainlanders realize that the people in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Island are our peers.  This book will help to overcome this problem.  I liked this book and plan on reading more in the series.  As a non-Puerto Rican, I learned a lot.	2002-11-03

First, there are already enough anthologies of personal essays from mixed people.  This anthology both shows and proves that mixed people can be subject to rigorous academic study.  Second, most books on mixed people, focus on black-white.  This book focuses on part-Asian, and not just Asian-white and not just biracial in the USA.  Still, I have to agree with other reviewers that this book is a little dry.  So many of the articles are just academics commenting on OTHER people's studies.  The chapters read quickly, but while some are rich, others have little to say.  For instance, the chapter comparing white-Asians to black-Asians said less about black-Asians than many of the other articles in the book.  Further, this book is broken into four sections and the best section is the one where people speak more personally and avoid sociological studies.  The best essay is about lesbigay mixed Asians.  I applaud the editor for her piece.  I'm glad this book was made, but lots of it left me unimpressed.  As a whole, this was decent enough, just some things were problematic.	2002-11-02

This is the second great book on gay voter behavior that I've found from Haider-Markel.  This book discusses the history of American gay rights, gay voting traits, and gay/lesbian officials in office.  Though I found this book in a university library, I think the book would be quite accessible to non-academic readers.  You can tell the editors did much numbers-crunching and studies-summarizing.  There are no photos or charts here, which is a shame.  This is a survey book and those knowledgeable about gay rights or gay studies may be frustrated.  For example, presidential candidate Michael Dukakis was an outspoken foe of gay rights, yet this is not mentioned here.  In discussing gays in the judicial branch, nothing is mentioned of BJ Cruz, the openly gay Supreme Court justice in Guam.  The status of gay rights and gay voters keeps morphing, so I hope the editors keep printing updates of their text.  All in all, this was a decent introduction to the topic.	2002-10-31

The book is small and each chapter is too.  I don't know if it's because it's printed by a smaller press or what.  Regardless, unfortunately, the reader sometimes gets impressions of stories and characters rather than something more in-depth.  I was much more excited about the autobiographical section, yet it too turned out to be short and scant.  The best chapter was one in which a Native woman talks about her first days at an Ivy League college.  Noticeably, it's located at the end of the fictional section and just before the factual section:  could this have been shifted?  There are four positive things here.  First, Power's respect for elders shines through.  This is quite an anti-ageist text.  Second, she celebrates biraciality.  From her own story to a story about an Anglo-Latina to one about a Native with red hair, Power loves seeing the races come together in bodies and children.  Biracial rights activists will love this book.  Third, the author is uneasy about Christianity.  Clergy members and saints are not viewed highly here.  I think her point is to challenge assumptions that all Americans must be Christian.  She is trying to maintain a space where Native spirituality can remain intact.  Fourth, she mentions Chicago often.  Though I've never met any Natives in my hometown, I think she makes Chicago look good and she is accepting of it as a decent place for urban Indians.  Still, this book mentions so much death (murders, death by childbirth, stillborn babies, suicide, etc.).  Unlike Native feminist scholar Paula Gunn Allen who said Native female work celebrates life, this book definitely repeats so many of the tragic Native tropes of death, abuse, and alcoholism.  I wish the author the most success, but I'm not quite sure what to think about the book overall.	2002-10-27

I read it years ago and it was made years before that.  In many ways, it should be treated as a Stonewall-era text.  Even the title is influenced by Friedan's \\"Feminine Mystique\\" which has been thoroughly criticized by younger feminists.  In the \\"Gay Mystique\\", the author talks about his life as a gay man.  I read it in one sitting; it's a quick one.  He shows that he's proud to be gay without having to bash queens and say trite statements like \\"What I do in bed is my own business.\\"  The thing that hit me the most is when he said, \\"Most of my friends are Black and Jewish gay men.\\"  He could just be reflecting the demographics of New York City.  Still, it spoke to me that he was trying to factor in race and religion into his talk of sexual identity matters.  The \\"gay\\" in this title means \\"gay male\\"; some female readers may be bothered by the androcentrism here, but it's reflective of the time in which it was written and I can definitely say this is not a sexist book.  For those interested in reading the classic gay rights and gay studies texts, you should try to find this book.  (Good luck, btw!)	2002-10-27

Plenty of anthologies have proven that bisexuals can write compelling biography and cultural criticism.  But here is a unique book where  bisexuals show they can go toe to toe with high-level (...) theory.  This anthology was very diverse in terms of gender and race.  It covers areas such as Freud's Dora, E. Lynn Harris novels, and Jane Bowles.  I would really recommend this book for many a bisexual theoryhead.

This is an anthology that resulted from a lecture series at Brown University.  (It's surprising that a legal book comes out of a university that has no law school.)  In their articles, writers try to blend social construction theories with family law issues.  The point is to show family law is still a dynamic field.  A ton of famous, famous professors contributed to this book.  Examples include Posner, Halley, Minow, et al.  Nussbaum, like always, has an interesting contribution as well.

I knew something important happened when my mother saw the film \\"The Wedding Banquet.\\"  She saw a family of color dealing with a gay family member and she saw how the Chinese mother looked silly being so devestated by her son's sexual orientation.  This book works in a similar way.  This was the first book I've ever read that was entirely in Spanish.  The editor had an article in \\"Companeras\\", a Latina lesbian anthology, where the editor there said she reprinted whole Spanish dialogues in order to preserve the truth of people's words.  Like that editor and others (such as Anzaldua and Moraga), I think Romo-Carmona wanted to be true to the contributors.  This is a slim book and the essays are quite short, but as someone who learned Spanish in the classroom, it took me a while to read.  It's amazing too that this family-oriented book came from the lesbian sex-positive/radical Clies Press.  Like Anglo PFLAG materials, this book began and ended with the parents of famous Latino gays (authors, elected officials, ppl who have been on TV) writing.  Almost every author is supportive of their gay child and every submission ends with them saying \\"I would never kick my child out of the house.\\"  The last contributor, noted author Jaime Manrique, even registers his shock about how supportive the parents are here.  So this book is positive, rather than normative.  The authors are quite diverse in terms of ethnicity/nationality.  The book is somewhat scant on bisexual and transgendered issues, but they are covered at least.  In many articles, the parents write and then their gay children add in:  this gets very repetitive.  Probably due to the author's gender, this book is heavily lesbian and woman-slanted (even more mothers write than fathers). That's cool because it fights lesbian invisibility, but we still need to recognize the burden that gay Latino MEN carry.  One contributor says straight up that it's okay for her daughter to be gay, but that would not be acceptable for herson.  There are many great entries from parents whose gay sons have died of AIDS.  Some articles feature gay parents who discover their children are gay.  Nevertheless, abuse, alcoholism, custody battles, and other family tragedies do come up often in this book.  A big critique that I have of this book is that racism in the US and the US gay community is hardly brought up.  For example, many of the gay Latino children seem to have non-Latino partners (including the editor) and the parents never discuss it.  Still, I loved this text and want every Spanish-speaking parent of a gay child to read it.  My parents never even considered going to a PFLAG meeting until they heard that a black chapter was being formed.  If straight people only feel comfortable discussing gay family in race-similar environments, then we just have to deal with that reality.	2002-10-23

With examples from Neil Miller, Colin Spencer, Lillian Faderman, etc., plenty of authors have tried to write gay world histories in the past two decades.  However, here is a pioneering book from the 1970s.  I almost shouted with glee when I found a copy in a used book store in Berkeley.  De Becker describes homosexuality in many cultures.  What's great is the inclusion and emphasis placed upon non-European examples here.  This book may be male-heavy, but it is still quite lesbian-inclusive, especially given its publication in the 1970s, a time when gay men and lesbians fought.  Because De Becker is trying to be exhaustive in his work, he covers everything he can on gayness, and some of it may offend modern readers.  For example, he include a picture of a mother spanking a naked girl in the Renaissance, for some reason.  Also, there are many photos from movies and art from the 1960s, that would seem cheesy to modern readers.  Still, this is a classic gay studies text.

However, this book felt Eurocentric to me; he mentions little about well-researched areas of same-sex love in Asia or Native America.  Also, Spencer's work is cursory; other authors have gone into depth in many of his topic areas.  I liked Neil Miller's book on gay and lesbian history since the invention of the word \\"homosexuality\\" in the mid-1800s better than this book.  This book is also male focused and may rub lesbian and bisexual women the wrong way.  Still, for first-time readers of gay studies, this may be a good, initial, comprehensive book.	2002-10-18

It resembles both his rigorous scholarly \\"Sexual Politics,...\\" and his social commenting \\"Making Trouble.\\" This book will be both a challenge and a pleasure to everyday gay folks and nerdy queer theorists. The book is a compilation of essays regarding gay rights in the 90s, civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, and other such topics. Some people may not like the scrapbook feel here. D'Emilio chose to start the work with the heady academic stuff and that may scare off readers who will really enjoy the rest of it. Many of the entries are speeches he gave and they become repetitive after a while. Still, he does a great job of assessing gay rights in the last decade and summarizing the struggle over the past half century. D'Emilio is ever the counterintuitive thinker, but that's exactly what open-minded gay people need to be reading. A lot of the chapters center upon boys, but D'Emilio still maintains his status as a very pro-feminist, anti-androcentric gay male theorist. He does include this chapter about his changing sex life which implies that he and his partner are celibate; a fact that I highly doubt. However, his discussion about NGLTF is wonderful; there hasn't been enough analysis of gay institutions. At times, the book is kinda preachy and defensive. Still, I'm glad he opens a space for gay work that is not as light as \\"The Advocate\\" but not as heavy as Foucault.

Sometimes I wonder what's left for ethnic studies scholars to write about.  I mean, once you know early Chinese American men weren't allowed to bring their wives over and that Asian immigration substantially increased after 1965, what's next?  Once African Americans have studied slave narratives and the Harlem Renaissance, what's left?  Though Professor Ma analyzes issues that many other Asian-Americans scholars have already done (Chan did Fu Manchu comics, Zia did the Vincent Chin murder, Bow did Joy Luck Club), she provides a fresh theory by which to look at Asian-American matters.  Basically saying that it's hard to escape Said, Ma suggests that Asian-Americans are trapped in reproducing Orientalism, even as they try to escape it.  Admittedly, Ma applauds herself noting that she covers topics from the 1920s to the present in multiple genres.  Still, she makes this great thesis that Orientalism and Asian-American identity have a four-staged \\"deathly embrace.\\"  At first, I planned to just read selected chapters, but Ma's introduction and thesis enticed me to read the entire book from page one.<br />Unfortunately, the rest of the book somewhat disappoints.  First, not all of the chapters deal with Asian-American agency.  This group had no part in the manufacture of Charlie Chan or Fu Manchu.  How can Vincent Chin, a hate crime casualty, be blamed for Orientalist narratives?  The penultimate chapter discusses Ishiguro, an Anglo-Japanese, not an Asian American.  Further, while Ma exhausts ideas about Orientalism, she says little about Asian-American identity.  I thought for sure she'd rely upon Wei's book on student activism or Espiritu on panethnicity, but it didn't happen.  She leaves several stones unturned.  For instance, while she discusses African-American viewers' pleasure with Bruce Lee, when discussing the video game Mortal Kombat, she never mentions that many African-American players  prefered to be the black character Jax (short for Jackson?  specifically Jesse Jackson?).  The book even ends with a defensive two-paged epilogue where Ma basically says, \\"I knew you weren't going to like this book?!\\"<br />Two things are abundantly clear here:  Ma's generational status and her age.  Ma knows Chinese fluently and immigrated here after years of living in China.  African Americans and Afro-Brazilians often fantasize about Africa as just a place to dance and beat drums.  Most Irish Americans can only imagine what Ireland was like before the famine in the 1840s.  That's what ethnics in America do:  have dreams about their homeland.  Yet here, Ma consistently attacks Asian Americans whose multilingual skills and travel experiences are not as extensive as her own.  At times, this book feels more like comparative literature than ethnic studies.<br />Like bell hooks' rants against Spike Lee, Ma has an axe to grind with Amy Tan.  This attack has the trait I described above.  It somewhat reminds me of Africanists who derided Eddie Murphy's portrayal of African royalty in \\"Coming to America.\\"  Again, this is due to Ma's 1.5 generational status.  Though I haven't read Tan's children's story \\"Sagwa,\\" I watch its cartoon everyday.  Just as Black parents have embraced \\"The Lion King\\" and Latinos have embraced \\"Road to El Dorado,\\" if I were an Asian-American parent, I would want my child to watch \\"Sagwa.\\"  Far from maligning China, the show consistently presents the country as full of tales and history and wonders.<br />Ma admits that she saw no problems with \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\" as a child outside of the US, yet she attacks Asian-American actors and viewers for embracing \\"Mulan.\\"  What kind of age bias is that?<br />Ma mentions biraciality often (Fu Manchu's daughter, Tan's characters, she even says Bruce Lee was 1/4 British).  Still, she neither stands against miscegenation nor celebrates diversity here.  Maybe it's because I'm also reading \\"Sum of Our Parts,\\" but it struck me that Eurasians are just here, with nothing more said.<br/>This was a slim text but it spoke profoundly.  This was interesting, though confusing, cultural studies.  This was quite a risky and ambitious text, but I'm not blown over by the result./>This was a slim text but it spoke profoundly.

This book has two plays about gay men and couples dealing with their identities and loves years into the AIDS crisis.  I think it would be a good idea for some producer to get these plays performed nationally. (Maybe someone, probably Harvey, already has and I just don't know it.)  Despite his status as stereotype, he truly is  a role model and a good guy.  <BR>Allow me to mention a funny anecdote.  I was a freshman in college when I bought this book.  Everytime straight ppl saw the title \\"safe sex\\" on my bookshelf, they thought it was a manual and wanted to borrow it for information.  I wonder if Harvey purposely titled his book in this way, just to grab the attention of ppl of all sexualities.	2002-10-03

I feel quite conflicted about this book.  This is a collection of essays in which Awkward discusses scholars looking beyond their own identity groups.  For example, he writes about black men and feminism and white scholars examining black texts.  So he's proven himself a strong anti-essentialist.  Also, his work on feminism situates him as a role model for non-sexist men, particularly non-sexist brothas.  Still, he writes in a rambling and confusing style, even more so than most academics.  I liked Part Two of this book, where he discusses specific cultural products, much more than Part One.  This book included some really interesting cultural studies.  Still, it felt uneven and it is hard for me to embrace it in its entirety.	2002-10-02

This is another example of what happens when good articles are extended into poor booklength works.  The author's mother said the author's father forced her through a glass window once and yet the author blames her mother and all women with a backbone on fatherlessness in Black America.  Daniel Moynihan's 1965 report on the Black family has been attacked by African-American thinkers of both genders, yet Barras hardly sees a problem with it.  This book does nothing but blame women for being victims.  Like all conservative rants, it blames feminists, rather than sexism for the problems that women have.  This could have been an exciting, thoughtful book; instead, the author speaks in hyperbole and sees no problem with being ridiculously one-sided.  Further, she's a journalist, not an academic or an author.  Thus, not only should the book be seen as amateur, but it's written in an allegorical style that I found silly.  This book should not be embraced by the African-American community.  As a pro-feminist brotha, I can't understand why a sista would created this misogynistic tool to harm Black single mothers and womanists throughout the nation.	2002-09-30

Most have answered France.  (Please see Stovall's excellent book.)  However, many have suggested Brazil.  This book is a collection of writings from African-Americans about their experiences in Brazil.  It proves that we have the power to dream and to think globally.  This book, in many ways, reflects Black American hopes rather than Brazilian realities.  In fact, all the gushy writings from deceased, bourgeois, light-skinned, Black conservatives will rub most living progressives of color bonkers.  Still, this was an important book.  I read it for an African-American studies course on Brazil at Brown University.  I am glad I had a chance to peep it.	2002-09-25

The subtitle of this book is &quot;Scholarship, Policy, and Practice&quot; and this feels like something that is part-social work, part-therapy, and part-public policy.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing.  Are too many cooks spoiling the soup?  Perhaps this book is best for directors of Latino non-profits or governmental agencies in Latino communities.  I particularly like the section of the book that focuses on specific populations; namely Latino fathers, and Central American refugee families.  Too many books on Latinos stress the same old stuff (Latinos are diverse; their numbers are increasing; language and immigration will be an issue unlike with most blacks or whites, etc.).  So this book was definitely trying to do something special.  I just don't know if they effectively acheived their goal(s).	2002-09-24

Eric Marcus records that men of color were questioned when they attended Mattachine events before Stonewall.  Books and films concerning the Stonewall era and covering both coasts include Blacks and Latinos, but not Asians.  Most work on gay men of color focus upon their struggles with HIV/AIDS.  Urvashi Vaid writes that groups for gays and lesbians of color are largely invisible, underfunded, and short-lasting.  When taking all these givens into account, an oral history about gay male Asian organizing pre-Stonewall and pre-AIDS is quite revolutionary and needed.<br />I am sooooo glad Wat had the vision and dedication to make this book.  I was worried it would be a rough-around-the-edges dissertation, but it is smooth, well-conceived writing with a nice cover and everything.  Finally, we get to hear about how gay Asian-American men negotiate their identities and make their own choices.  This book is a gem.<br />This book is very much about the rise and fall of a gay Asian organization.  Constructionists will love it.  Essentialism is avoided in this work.  Wat does a good job in predicting where gay Asian-Am activism is headed as well.<br />There are some problems with this book.  Based on pure truth and no dilution from the author, a lot of this book focuses upon older white tops ordering around and manipulating Asian younger bottoms.  People-of-color loving gay people of color will have a hard time swallowing these sections of the text.  There's a catch-22 between the author and his interviewed subjects in which the subject's talking just prattles on but the author's analysis and academic sitations completely slow down the flow of the book.  I'm kind of disappointed at how other gay men of color are erased from this history.  For example, many of the subjects said they first met and spoke of organizing at a gay club that was half-Asian and half-Latino, yet no Latino is interviewed for this book, while whites are.  The best chapter in the book deals with gay Asiansas they try to become a part of mainstream Asian-American activism, yet the chapter is named after some \\"rice queen.\\"  Further, gay Asian in this book means male and \\"yellow\\", rather than \\"brown\\" or Polynesian here.<br />A few anthologies have chapters about gays of color and their organizing, but I can think of no book-length discussions.  I am so glad I found this book.  I think progressives and activists of all colors should read this book.	2002-09-16

Whereas \\"Q&A\\" and Russell Leong's book have already opened the doors for gay Asian-Am non-fiction, there are still too few venues for the fictional counterpart.  This anthology fills that void.  Proof of its worth is that many of these writers have gone on to have whole novels published.  Despite the need for this book, I see problems.  It has this boring cover that automatically makes the book look used.  I don't know if the publishing company has limited resources or if they want readers of all races and sexualities to not be turned off by the book or what.  But the drab cover made me think it would contain drab writing.  The editors have a 1.5 paged intro which proves they hardly had any vision for this book.  The book is littered with photography and art that is not interesting in the slightest.  The table of contents is confusing.

(bell was wrong, btw)	I didn't read all of this book, but I know it's a winner.  Female readers should not be threatened by the introduction being written by Gates, a man.  He has consistently supported work by women and gay men and shown himself to be quite the cool straight man.  In this book, many academics analyze well-known texts by black women.  You'll be relieved that it's critical, and not gushy or essentialist.  Here's my one big problem.  In her discussion of Walker's \\"The Color Purple\\", hook condemns Walker for turning Celie into a capitalist after all the racist, sexist, and classist (and possibly homophobic) exploitation she faced throughout her life.  However, what hooks fails to realize is that Celie created a business called \\"Folks Pants\\" that made clothes fit for both genders and all sizes.  The \\"folk\\" in the title has very socialist implications.  hooks should be pleased that Celie finally has some agency and can live by her own means and on her own terms.  Methinks hooks is jealous of Walker's success.	2002-09-01

I encourage many to read this book, but I feel compelled to give my criticisms first.<br />Valdivia is trying to write Latinas into media studies and cultural criticism, a very noble project.  But like bell hooks, a scholar by whom Valdivia is strongly influenced, the author pats herself on the back too frequently about her interdisciplinary discussions of \\"race, class, and gender.\\"  Also like hooks, though non-homophobic, there is an unfortunate way in which \\"race, class, and gender\\" are written in capital letters but sexual orientation is written in the lower-case.  Like many Latina/o scholars, Valdivia gripes about how racial discussions overly focus on white vs. black, yet she has to use a lot of African-American scholarship to make her points.  While the last half of the book is clearly about Latinas, the first have is just about women in general; this book is much more likely to be in a women's studies syllabus than an ethnic studies one (which is unfortunate).  As much info as I learned about the media here, the author gets many facts wrong.  She says \\"Set It Off\\" is directed by a woman; it's directed by F. Gary Gray, a man.  She calls Madonna \\"self-named\\"; actually Madonna is her birth name.  She says \\"You Can't Do That on Television\\" was inspired by the Xuxa Show and that can't be because the former came on before Xuxa worked on Brazilian TV in 1984.  Speaking of Xuxa, the author is way too forgiving.  In a minority-heavy nation like Brazil they may worship the rare blonde like Xuxa.  In the white-majority US, there are plenty of blondes and Xuxa would be nothing special, yet Valdivia inadequately addresses this.  The author includes this silly chapter involving her daughter.  All parents think their children are little miracles.  Valdivia can't be critical here.  For example, she states her daughter's school has Mexican-American students, yet the mother doesn't find it problematic in the slightest that all her daughter's friends are white.  Finally, her descriptions go on too long; whole sections describing Victoria's Secrets catalogues and Xuxa's success had to be skipped because they were so exhaustive.<br />This book is critical, so maybe it just put me in a critical mood.  In truth, I loved this book.  If you like Coco Fusco's and Cherrie Moraga's works, you should love this too.  I mean, this was a good attempt at a Latina analysis of media.  In fact, this taught me a lot about the media generally because I'd pick up a book on Latinas, not a book on the media alone.  Many critics say writings from \\"identity\\" scholars lack structure, but in every chapter Valdivia clearly maps out her project.  Academics tend to either focus on Latinas/os in the US or Latin Americans abroad.  Valdivia identifies as both and writes about both, excellently I might add.  Given that Rosie Perez is \\"mulata\\", Rigoberta Menchu is indigenous, and Xuxa is white, Valdivia shows that she accepts and celebrates Latina racial diversity when she is analyzing these figures.  This was some strong cultural studies.	2002-09-01

This is Gates, a Harvard black scholar, opining about multiculturalism debates in the early 90s.  It said some useful stuff which may seem a little dated now.  For example, he asks why can't all campuses be like Berkeley where there is no racial majority?  Well, that question is totally moot post-Proposition 209.  As all Harvard black scholars have become recently controversial, this book will be a good intro book for lay readers to see what the controversy is all about.  This book is written in a simple fashion that any person should be able to understand.  Do not sleep, however!  Gates has written many articles and books that only elite readers could understand.

The author observes black teen mothers and their struggles and puts a human face on conservatives' favorite scapegoat.  In our days of \\"Maury Povich\\" where baby daddy and baby grandmas call these young girls \\"sluts\\" in front of all America, the author notes that many grandmothers force their sons to accept paternity as soon as they see how much the new babies look like the fathers did when they were younger.  The author's style is observational and may not be methodologically-sound for many.  And sometimes, the conversation does get too internal.  Still, I wish the author a good academic career and I thank her for increasing the scholarship on black women, particularly young and poor ones.	2002-08-31

Former Panthers and the academics that write about them are starting to seriously realize that the Panthers were never just about race alone.  Biographies by Elaine Brown and Assata Shakur deal with gender and the Panthers.  Edmund White's biography of Jean Genet discusses how the Panthers dealt with a gay, white, foreign supporter.  Now, in this book about an Afro-European Panther named Johnny Spain, Andrews looks at how a mixed-race individual was affected by the Party.  Andrews writes in a simple style that would make this biography accessible to almost any reader.  By moving from the stereotyped tragic mulatto to becoming a \\"bridge person\\" and cross-racial activist, this book is about redemption.  I can imagine it influencing mixed-race men in the same way that Malcolm X's autobiography has influenced monoracial black men (though X was one-quarter white).  One major theme of this book is how inhumanely prisoners are treated in American jails.  This book should be appreciated by prisoners' rights activists regardless of race and multiracial activists regardless of their views on prisoners.  ...  Finally, there is a book that works against this tide.  I would strongly encourage every mixed man in the US to read this book.	2002-08-29

Halberstam dedicates the book to Gayatri; perhaps having a lover of color influences her racially-diverse perspective.  Then again, maybe its the influence of the ethnic studies professors at her college, UCSD.  Whatever it was, it's great.  Halberstam makes a point of saying how butches of color face different issues from white butches.  She states from the start that works on masculinity as it affects men of color and working-class men were much more informative to her research than books on hegemonic masculinity.  Halberstam even criticizes white lesbian academics like Faderman when they fail to confront racism in their academic subjects.<BR>I only have one big problem with this book:  Halberstam's discussion of the Latina character Vasquez in \\"Aliens\\" is all wrong.  Halberstam implies that Vasquez is lesbian and she goes on to state that Vasquez dies first, dies tragically, and was in general not dynamic.  In the film, they show Vasquez panicked over the death of a man, impliedly her lover.  They very consciously render her straight.  She was one of the last characters to die, not the first.  Further, she died valiently  (and heterosexually in the arms of a white man) by killing herself in order to kill more aliens.  In such a strong book, I don't understand why Halberstam felt the need to fudge the facts.	2002-08-29

Ayers Chiong is the wife of a Pilipino man, the mother of two biracial daughters (one who looks Asian and one who looks white), and the head of an interracial family activist group.  She researches Massachusetts' former laws that required all students to be defined by one race only.  She next investigated one urban school and one suburban school in the state to see how teachers, principals, and librarians were addressing multiracial children.  On the one hand, she does a great job in illustrating how the issue is always pushed to the side:  books for Afro-European children urge them to identify as black, books marked \\"interracial\\" are about interracial friendships--not people, issues facing Anglo-Latinos are deemed bilingual issues--not biracial ones, etc.  On the other, Ayers Chiong does not get to her hypothesis and methodology until page 44.  Many chapters can be skipped and it's not a long book.  She continually cites Giroux, who turns out to be the editor of this book series; one wonders if he demands that authors pay homage to him.  The section on results is quite short.  Further, she includes an afterwords in which she admits that the US government now allows individuals to check more than one box, thus her point is now moot.  She is quite critical of those who want multiracial children to identify with their minority racial group only; many educators of color, even progressive ones, will be rubbed the wrong way by this thought.  Still, the more I read the book, the more I must acknowledge that Ayers Chiong is a strong writer and a dedicated educator.  I wish the author much luck in her career, but this was kind of a mediocre work.	2002-08-21

Too often it's assumed that all environmentalists are white, class-privileged neo-hippies and that people of color are too busy with &quot;real&quot; issues.  This book shows that activists of color are extremely dedicated to fighting pollutants in their community.  This book stresses that a disproportionate number of communities of color have been targeted for toxic wastes sites, etc.; so it is not environmental classism, but specifically environmental racism.  This book does a good job in showing how Blacks, Native Americans, and Latinos are equally engaged in fighting this tragedy.  This book may be too simplistic for longtime activists.  For non-scientists like myself, many of the chemical compounds mentioned and stuff like that went right over my head (figuratively, of course).  Still, this helped me learn more on the topic and is a good starter book.  I think this book can help bring progressives across color lines together.	2002-08-20

Given the photos of only white women and children on the cover and its brief chapter titles, I was worried that this would be some revery about the author's own immigrant background, at the total exclusion of modern female immigrants of color.  I am pleased to see that I am wrong.  In this book, Gabaccia shares her deep knowledge of American immigration with the world.  She carefully analyzes how immigration did and does affect women.  This is a wonderful intersectional contribution to women's studies and immigrant history.  The author does say that she will compare immigrant women to their male immigrant husbands and peers and to native-born women; she barely meets this goal.  However, she does a great job in comparing the lives of immigrant  women with native-born minority women and working-class native-born women.  In fact, what impresses me most about this book is how inclusive she is of people of color.  She neither forgets that not all blacks in America are the descendants of slaves nor that many Chinese and Japanese individuals moved here voluntarily many decades ago.  Additionally, she says much about Jewish immigration and this should please Judaic studies enthusiasts.  This book is steeped in labor theory, and may frustrate some non-academic readers.  Eventually, Gabaccia does come around to discussing domestic dynamics and community activism.  The book is small in page length, but it is full of so much valuable information that it will take some time to read.  I recommend this book to many readers wholeheartedly!	2002-08-10

The editors pose that managers are so often presumed to be men that academics have yet to flesh out both how managers shape masculinity and how masculinity shapes managers.  This book is steeped in theory from organizational behavior and labor relations studies, so lay readers may find it intimidating.  The topics cover a range of rather interesting perspectives.  There is one big problem.  Though the introduction emphasizes that male managers often oppress women and marginalized men, it never goes further in discussing said marginalized men.  This book is strikingly bare in its coverage of men of color, gay men, immigrant men, etc.  Perhaps this is because most of the contributors are Australian or British, nationalities not as diverse as the United States.

I recommend this book to any reader, but be warned that it has problems that I think the editors could have easily avoided.	2002-08-10

Thus, it feels a little dated.  Further, it's a collection of documents that fueled the debate, rather than an analysis or an autobiography from one of the expelled gay soldiers.  Still, when I was writing my senior college thesis, this book was useful to me.  Its best item is an affidavit submitted by the late gay scholar John Boswell.  There are better books on the topic, but this one wasn't bad.	2002-08-09

This book addresses that absence.  I didn't read as much of it as I should have, but I was pretty impressed by what I did see.  This book is not academic; it's testimonies from real lesbians who have or are serving.  It really makes it clear how lesbophobia is a key element to the oppression of women in the military period.  In fact, I'd recommend this book to feminist readers of all sexualities.  This text re-emphasizes how the military is always at war.....with women!	2002-08-02

This book comes from a Jane Doe lesbian in the military.  She later did an adult photo spread in a lesbian porno magazine.  She details being raped while on duty at least four times:  a true testament to the rampant misogyny in the armed services.  Still, whereas Margarethe Cammermeyer's book is meant to inspire straights and gays, this book really lets it all hang out (sorry for the phallocentric language).  This book will offend some readers, but it's good for looking at the life of a real, meat-and-potatoes woman discriminated by an American institution.	2002-08-02

She analyzes the special status of Haitian Americans.  They are triply invisible: they're black, they're black foreigners, and they're black non-Anglophone foreigners.  So much literature says that immigrants will simply blend into the melting pot, but clearly that is being proven by new scholarship as not true for immigrants of color in very race-conscious America.  Thus, Haitians do not have the choice to simply become Americans; that would only leave them with the less-desireable choice of being black Americans.  It is through this lense that she interviews several Haitian informants living in New York City.  She contextualizes the discussion by talking about the race and class divisions in pre-independence Haiti (then called Saint-Domingue).  I found this very informative.  Next she states that the Haitian constitution deemed all its citizens black and therefore blackness is associated with independence and pride on the island, unlike its stigmatized minority status in this country.  These multifaceted conditions are what lead various Haitians to either reject or accept unity with black Americans, especially along class lines.  Next, Zephir discusses the trichotomous issues that arise when Haitians choose to speak Creole, French, or English.  Zephir is a rigorous academic, yet a comprehensible writer.  Her discussion about language may bore ethnic studies majors and her discussion about multiculturalism may upset typical cognitive science majors.  Zephir ends with a discussion with Haitian children in the American school system which I found capricious.  This book has a boring cover and is printed in this miniscule font: unfortunate signs that Zephir intended this as a book only for university libraries.  Still, for those students and professors that find a copy, they will truly enjoy her insights.  Zephir is fair in her discussion of Haitians versus black Americans.  Too many people assume that blacks in this country only come from the American South and have no relation to immigration matters.  This book proves that wrong in a diverse and compelling manner.	2002-07-27

Suzanne Oboler is a well-respected Latino studies professor at Brown University.  In this book, she interviews immigrants from Latin America and asks if they identify as Latino and see themselves as having anything in common with other Latinos, those outside of their national origin group.  Basically, she asks Latin Americans in the US themselves whether they accept this country's racial categorizations.  What she finds is that working-class Latinos merely look at others as fellow Spanish-speakers and shrug US racial classifications off (though not in a hostile way) whereas Latin Americans from middle-class backgrounds were quite aware that the minority label opened access to affirmative action programs and other tangible benefits and thus embraced the label.  This conclusion seems counterintuitive and is fascinating.  Oboler grounds her discussion by talking of Puerto Rican and Chicano activism in this country.  Even though she is of Peruvian descent, she is knowledgeable about the more populous Latino groups.  This text is well-respected among ethnic studies scholars.  Anyone interested in books on Latinos and Latinas in the US must obtain a copy of Oboler's work.	2002-07-24

The book is full of photos and drawings over the past two centuries of Inuit peoples.  You see men, women, and children.  Many photos show them in traditional dress; many in modern clothing.  Most importantly, the propaganda with/against them is portrayed.  So you see manipulated images encouraging the forced Western schooling of Alaska Native children, or whites parading in Native furs, etc.  I am glad to see the focus on people as well.  With Africa, for example, people show the animals and jungles more than the people, thus reinforcing ideas that Africa is just a place for wildlife and not humans.  This book does have some pictures of landscapes and seals, but they are kept to a minimum.  Thus, the (non-Native?) reader is not left with the idea that Alaska is just some wasteland with which American policymakers can just do anytything.  Too often, Alaska Natives and Hawaiian Natives get left out in discussions of indigenous peoples in the US.  Further, given a recent disappointing case from the US Supreme Court, this book on Alaska Natives is a very important contributions to Native history, American history, and the histories of people of color.  (I also think Canadians should be interested in this book.)  My one criticism of the book is that none of the photos are in color.  I am sure that was done to reduce costs; still it re-inforces the image of Natives as being a thing of the past when they are always portrayed in black-and-white grainy photography.	2002-07-22

I read this book years ago for a class called &quot;Women and Public Policy&quot; at Brown University.  The author interviews approximately 25 political feminists and 25 political women opposed to feminism and tries to analyze what makes them tick.  The author's introduction shows that she is a progressive and an anti-essentialist feminist.  However, her excuse for only interviewing white women still comes off as she just doesn't know enough political women of color or she just isn't prepared to analyze race and gender issues simultaneously.  Further, the comments by the antifeminists will make feminists and pro-feminists want to vomit.  This was an okay book, I just have concerns about the author's purpose and vision.	2002-07-21

I may be a little sketchy on the details.  But I think it contributes nicely to Asian-American studies with its focus on the history of activism.  The articles talk about Asian Americans, particularly on the West Coast, who were influenced by Black Power, feminism, and the antiwar movement, and decided to start their own political groups.  Its focus is on the 1960s and 1970s.  I would add it to any Asian American studies collection.  Further, I am sure that this book is required reading in a number of ethnic studies courses around the nation.  So I'm a little shaky on the facts, but I recall this being a decent book.	2002-07-20

Once you've read one book on immigration in the US, you read them all.  They repeat the same stuff (how immigrants of color now are treated like Southern Europeans from a century ago, the Chinese Exclusion Acts, the changes in the law in 1965, etc.).  Social work texts get bogged down in internal, lengthy discussions about the worker-client relationship.  In Balgopal's book, he connects the dots between American immigration history and politics with social work.  For example, Jane Addams and her Hudd House was not just a social work center, but a major resource for aiding immigrants.  Further, the authors cite studies that most social workers and immigration activists probably have not laid their hands on.  Thus, this book was a crisp policy discussion and not just some &quot;feel-good&quot;, non-rigorous text.  Balgopal's introduction was excellent; his chapter on Asian immigrants was the weakest in the book, and his conclusion was bland.  Still, Longres' chapter on Latinos was excellent and the chapter on black immigrants was superb.  This book was written before 911 and I can't blame the editor seriously, but still, a chapter on Arab and North African immigrants would have been a welcome addition.  I am pleased that I had the opportunity to read this book and I am glad that the editor had the vision to compile it.	2002-07-17

In this book, he claims that all these ideas that Brazil is wonderful because it is so racially-blended are nothing but a racist attempt to erase the contributions of and downplay the struggles faced by black Brazilians.  Now that even white American conservatives are embracing multiracial people and activism, do Nascimento's thoughts may rub many the wrong way, especially mixed-race individuals.  Still, this is an important Afrocentric text.  Black Americans know too little about their brothers and sisters in Brazil.  This book introduced me to the term &quot;Quilombismo,&quot; a Brazilian concept paralleling Afrocentrism or Negritude.  Do Nascimento is trying to change the defaults through which people see his country in order to help the blacks there.  He called African Americans &quot;African at heart, but kind of cold like their white English-speaking peers&quot;; I laughed hard reading that.  Every Afrocentric reader will learn much by grabbing a copy of this text.	2002-07-14

It's nice, but you can guess everything they discuss.  Like all Latino studies books, they spend numerous pages bringing up Latino diversity.  Like all books on providing therapy to a minority group, there's discussion about the dynamics between minority client and majority therapist.  The standout chapter in this book is one about Latino masculinity, by Dr. Bacigalupe:  excellent!  This book makes little mention about gay Latinos or those in interracial couples.  Like the editors, co-authors often have one Spanish last name and one English one; this makes me think that this was a joint Latino and Anglo project.

It covers a range of localities (Spain, Zimbabwe, Greece, the US, Britian).  It basically looks two phenomena.  First, masculinity as it is affected by something else.  Examples include \\"how do Spanish men who frequent prostitutes see their masculinity?\\" or \\"why do working-class British men both love and fear black men?\\"  Second, this book investigates gender and change.  Examples include \\"Women are members of the American police force, now what?\\" and \\"Gay men in the UK are perceived as rich and masculine, rather than feminine and unable to get work, how did this change arise?\\", etc.  Surprisingly, the authors often refer to \\"Anglo-American\\" this and that, but this book seemed very British to me.  Perhaps, British scholars look to American ones as their peers more often than the reverse happens.  Additionally, this book is quite small: in an American anthology, the chapters would have been much longer.  There's better stuff out their on masculinity studies, but this was still a decent enough book.	2002-07-05

The fact is: it's easier to set up a gay and lesbian literature course than it is to set up such a course in any other discipline.  The fact is:  gay literary ancestors left more about their existence than did gay royalty, gay militarists, or gay scientists.  The fact is:  even today, there is still a gross generalization that all of every school's gay and lesbian faculty  are in the English department.  Thus, a book that interrogates the intersections between English studies and gay studies is terribly timely and necessary.  Spurlin has compiled a diverse anthology that not only should gay and lesbian studies scholars, but all gay and lesbian faculty anywhere, should read.  The authors included are quite diverse in terms of race and gender.  There are two amazing pieces here.  First, DiGangi discusses the importance behind debates regarding Shakespeare's sexual orientation.  Second, Ruth Vanita has an outstanding article about homophobia among postcolonial literary critics and why her book on historical gay South Asia was so needed.  With the exception of these two essays, every other submission left me disappointed in one way or another.  The most disgusting, practically nefarious, example comes from Jay Ken Lorenz.  In his article, he discusses the life lessons he learned by hosting a gay and lesbian film studies course at a conservative university (Georgetown); however, he ends with an unnecessary, capricious, stupid, naive, and downright racist anecdote about how he threw a dodgeball at a young Asian-American \\"sissy\\" boy and ended up breaking his nose.  Susan Talbert's piece is this pessimistic diatribe about why lesbian teachers should NOT come out.  Jody Norton's essay on transgender issues in English classes was so obtuse that I could not read past three pages or so.  tatiana de la tierra's article says it's \\"from the US-Mexico border.\\"  However, instead of getting the sense of border-crossing in Anzaldua's or Gomez-Pena's way, de la tierra is merely speaking about working at an American college that happens to be kinda near the border.  Marcia Blumberg's chapter about the AIDS quilt said nothing about English courses.  My critiques can go on.  Further, most of the authors had an axe to grind.  Of course, gay men and lesbians, and particularly teachers from our community, have much over which to be angry.  However, that anger, when written, is usually meant to motivate people to bring about change.  Here, the authors just sound surly with no purpose in their meanness.  This book has left me quite frustrated.  I am clueless as to the author's vision.  I am waiting for a better book on this crucial topic to come along.	2002-07-01

It spoke about how gays deal with sexual orientation issues in the workplace.

This book is a study of the tactics that gay men use to keep their sexual orientation hidden from their (often homophobic) co-workers.  It scares me how accurate it is.  Let me give you an example, I once had a male teacher who said, \\"I was once going out with this woman who blah, blah, blah.\\"  Well, many straight people would think, \\"Okay, girlfriend equals straight.\\"  But a critical reader would see that the man said, \\"Once!\\"  Many openly gay men used to date women.  This book mentions tactics like acting weird so that co-workers just dismiss you as asexual, emphasizing your love of sports in order to hide the fact that you're not involved with a woman, being so liberal that when you mention gay rights co-workers think you are a leftist rather than gay, etc.  If straight people read this book, gay men would never be able to hide.  This book was both a gift and a weapon.  Some have critiqued it asking why anyone would want to study, and subconsciously encourage, men to be closeted.  However, this book does talk to men about their being out in the workplace and how they did it.  We need more studies like this.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  However, it could be incredibly dangerous if placed in the wrong hands.	2002-06-24

In this book, researchers theorize whether classic political science or statistical theories have explained or will explain the trends in gay rights.  Topics in this text include:  the likelihood of gay or lesbian candidates winning office, the proliferation of anti-discrimination laws in the workplace, the tendency of certain voters to support gay rights and certain voters to oppose them, etc.  David Segura contributes an important and insightful chapter on whether tactics to increase the number of elected officials of color will conflict with attempts to increase gay political representation.  The book ends with a wonderful analysis made in the early 1970s regarding the political effectiveness of gay leadership.  In fact, the book's strength is how much it reveals gay political history.  In fact too, the latter chapters are much better than the former; the reader may want to read this anthology backwards, rather than forwards.  Also, the contributors were from colleges, big and small, throughout the nation.  So there's no hint that the work is legit merely because some Yale or Stanford faculty member wrote it.  I have a few criticisms of this book.  First, it truly is meant for the poli. sci. professor or student; it's not meant for John Doe Gay Man or Jane Doe Lesbian.  The book is full of statistical variables, political science jargon, and numerous charts that will confuse un-trained readers.  Second, though researchers are prudent in trying to determine who supports gay rights most, some of their findings border on the stereotypical.  For example, it says that Jews and women are likely to support gay rights.  Then what explains Dr. Laura?  It says the very religious tend to oppose it.  Then what explains pro-gay allies like Bishop Desmond Tutu or Coretta Scott King?  This was an excellent book for poli. sci. students, especially lesbian or gay ones.  However, it may be too complex, repetitive, and confusing for other audiences.	2002-06-22

If you have an understanding of civil procedure, you can get the gist of this subject.  The lecturer has a dead-pan voice that may turn off some listeners.  Also, so many of the most exemplary cases involve out-of-state car fatalities and divorce cases, so be prepared to be depressed.  Still, I found these tapes useful.  I'm a little concerned that the professor could have added more material.  Still, I found his lecture to be a valuable study aid.	2002-05-23

This was 5 tapes of gobbledygook.  Most S&S lectures have maps where the professor says what subject will be covered and how you should prepare for an exam in that area.  Also, the lecturers usually say, \\"Okay, that was the end of that subtopic,now onto the next issue.\\"  Not Cox!  He starts babbling right away and doesn't stop.  Obviously, he assumes everyone will love corporations as much as he does.  His rapid-fire style and internal logic is quite irritating.  I would avoid this subject.  I'll forgive my mentors, Sum & Substance, for letting this mistake happen.	2002-05-23
1534754:US	49989755	R3D9SSVN31MOVA	0898623715	793696678	Women of Color: Integrating Ethnic and Gender Identities in Psychotherapy	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Dense psychological study of fascinating topic	This is an anthology which investigates the psychological needs of women of color in the US in detail.  Most of the contributors are women of color themselves, but there is one contribution by a man.  The chapters are divided into regional groups (Latinas, Native Americans, Jamaican women), psychological strategies (feminism, psychopharmacology, and integrationist theory), and special populations (professional women, lesbians, mixed-race women).  The articles are long and detailed.  The non-psychologist may be scared off, but should try to forge ahead in completing the book.  The authors sometimes quote old sources; I'm not sure if this is their being thorough or signifying that little source work exists.  The authors often quote other contributors to the volume; I'm not sure if this is the decision of the editors or if this signifies that the authors are the best experts in these areas.  I found the theory portion of the book to be the most tiresome.  However, the whole book is a good review of the literature and does a good job in pointing to the further scholarship that needs to be done.  The book carefully states that women of color would be better off having women of color as their therapists, yet it also faces that reality that most of its readers will be white female therapists who &quot;want to be helpful.&quot;  I would recommend this anthology seriously to all psychotherapists and any readers interested in womanist/mujerista research.	2002-05-22

In this book, they attempt to elucidate how Asian and Asian-American clients may be different from others and how to serve them most effectively.  The topics are divided into descriptions of specific ethnicities, Asians in different phases of the life cycle, and special Asian populations (refugees, the monolingual, gay Asians, etc.).  This book is neither too academic for lay readers or too plain for academic readers.  This book varies on its authors' views about whether Asian clients should be given same-ethnicity therapists.  The chapters are quite short.  My big problem is that the chapters in total repeat themselves often and verge into the stereotypical.  After reading a chunk of the book, you'd think all Asians were shy, academic, family- and community-cloistered, etc.  I would recommend that all therapists in Boston, Hawaii, and the West Coast get this text.  Still, it left me unfulfilled in some areas.	2002-05-22

I wish her career well.  However, I wasn't thrilled by this book.  Zack edits an anthology on \\"microdiversity\\", basically investigating the fac that there is more diversity within races than between races and mixed-race individuals substantiate this.  Zack basically goes back and forth on whether racial categories should be used strategically or obliterated.  The anthology has some interesting pieces from Native Americans.  It is lacking on pieces from Latinos.  It is very academic: everyday fans of Maria Root's books may be stumped here.  The book ends with this awkard, unnecessary essay by a Jewish woman that is not even bi-religious.  This book isn't terrible, it's just that there are better books on multiraciality out there.	2002-05-21

So why does the author limit his audience?	Richmond Ellis posits that gay male Latin American autobiography differs from its Spanish counterpart in that homosexuality cannot be divorced from issues of race, gender, and politics.  In this book, the author looks at several writers, most gay, but one straight, to examine this topic.  The authors he selects are of various races (black, mestizo, European) and numerous nationalities (Cuban, Mexican, Argentinian, Chilean).  Most importantly, he illustrates how both the right and the left in Latin American have oppressed gay men.  The author uses \\"gay,\\" \\"queer,\\" and \\"homoerotic\\" selectively, but equally.  He thus sidesteps the boring and tired essentialism vs. constructivism debate.  He has a great chapter on the newly popular Reinaldo Arenas.  Though others have already written great essays on Arenas (Sanchez Eppler, Manrique, Bejel), Richmond Ellis' addition is welcome and unplagiarized.  This book is quite academic; however, everyday readers shouldn't be afraid to give it a try.  The introductory chapter discusses Bom-Crioulo, the first homoerotic text in Latin American writing, as well as Kiss of the Spider Woman.  So, in ways, this is a veritable encyclopedia of male homoerotic Latin writing.  Modern Western activists may be disturbed at how few of the texts end with two men walking hand in hand into the sunset.  Rape, incest, and gay-bashing do come up in this book.  Still, Spanish-language scholars should fall in love with this book as thoroughly as English-language scholars have fallen in love with Eve Sedgwick's \\"Epistemology of the Closet.\\" I would recommend that every gay Latino man, in the US or abroad, read this book.<br />However,I have a serious critique that I will later illustrate.  You can tell that Richmond Ellis intends this book for a limited audience.  He wants this book to sit in university libraries rather than be available to common fans of gay male writing.  And that's a shame that he didn't see more potential in this book.<br />First, thecover is bland and has no artwork.  Similar books like \\"Eminent Maricones\\" and \\"Reading the Ambiente\\" have vibrant covers that lure in readers.  Had Richmond Ellis put a photo of a hot Latin guy on the cover, his book would fly off of store shelves.<br />Second, he translates Spanish into English throughout the text.  But at one point, he's discussing a Latin American author who tried to hide a homoerotic moment by writing the details in another language.  While Richmond Ellis translates the sentence, he never says the language is French.  It's almost as if he assumes the readers are Romance language scholars and not your average monoglot American.<br />Third, principles from gay studies are left out in many areas.  For example, he mentions two slaves who share fruit as a sexual metaphor, but never mentions the homoerotic, Chinese tale of the \\"shared peach.\\"  He describes a Westernized author who has a lover in Egypt and India and never compares that to E.M. Forster.  Later, he describes how one man removes the sickly skin of an ill lover and never makes parallels to gay couples in the age of AIDS.<br />I have no solid proof of the author's race.  However, he has a completely English name, he never identifies as Latino (or even mixed-race) in the book and on his university's website he \\"looks\\" white.  So my guess is that he's an Anglo.  I don't mean to wander into essentialist territory for no reason.  My problem is that outside of the works he's analyzing, he rarely relies upon gay Latino support.  In his intro chapter, he mentions Bleys, Molloy, and Williams Foster, all Anglo writers who write on gay Latin American topics.  He also cites Lumsden, Lancaster, Murray, and other Anglo sociologists that discuss gay sexuality in Latin America.  However, with the exception of brief mentions of Manrique and Bejel, he cites no gay Latino academics.  There is no mention of Almaguer, Munoz, or Longres.  Quiroga has written on many of the same authors as Richmond Ellis has, yet he never cites him once.  I am somewhat concerned about the author's unconscious biases here.	2002-05-15

Two female editors of Essence magazine, a publication for black women, produce this anthology of writings from black men.  Because of this, I get the sense that the book is intended for readers of various genders.  (And let's face it, women are more interested in studying how men think and what makes men tick than men are.)  The book is a photographic spread, an inspirational text, and a veritable \\"Who's Who?\\" of famous African-American men. The book is similar in art to the Latino book \\"Suave\\" and its text is very similar to Tavis Smiley's \\"How to Make Black America Better\\" (Smiley having an entry here as well). Approximately 100 famous black men relate biographical vignettes about their struggles and triumphs.  Each entry includes a small bio of the author, so the book feels like an encyclopedia in ways.  The chapters are divided into such topic areas as family, success, art, etc.  Unlike most texts on black men which bemoan high rates of incarceration, systemic racism, police brutality, etc. (recent books by Kunjufu and Cose are examples), most of the entries in this text discuss the men's relations with their wives, children (especially sons), fathers, and mentors.  Thus, black manhood is displayed as relational to how one supports black individuals and the black community.  The authors are diverse; they include older brothers, mixed-race brothers, gay brothers, brothers from the Continent, etc.  This is a feel-good text; controversial topics are avoided.  The dark sides of some of the entrants' histories are not mentioned.  (For example, there is no mention of Jim Brown's history of misogynist attacks, or Damon Wayans' and Amiri Baraka's continual homophobic performance pieces.)  Still, this book was a great concept and sincerely motivating.  Plus, I like having photos of hotties like Sinbad, Forrest Whitaker, and Omar Wasow.  I would recommend this book for black men, women, and families.	2002-05-12

I went to the law school where this author used to be dean.  She didn't teach conflict of laws (she taught marital property) and the students who did take conflict of laws said it was incredibly hard.  Conflict of laws is basically civil procedure to the second power.  I am still not convinced that I would be able to site a conflicts issue in a civ. pro. question.  Nevertheless, this Gilberts was helpful.  It's long, like the Gilberts for property, torts, and other multistate bar subjects.  However, its length is due to the fact that it covers civ. pro. concepts that you will need to understand.  This Gilberts has a lot of charts that will help you digest the material.  It's most helpful when the charts come at the beginning of the chapter, but unfortunately most charts don't appear until the end.  This Gilberts mentions DOMA (the Defense of Marriage Act) and it suggests how big that issue will be in the courts in the future.  This commercial outline was quite helpful.	2002-05-11

Kantor posits that psychotherapists too often fall into two camps with gay male clients:  they are either bigoted and only work on \\"curing\\" the homosexuality or they are overly activist and blame all ills on homophobia.  Thus, the author encourages and maps out a therapy which acknowledges that SOME gay men suffer from mental illnesses, regardless of homosexuality or homophobia.  The book is filled with anecdotes from gay men that testify to mental difficulties.  At times, the quotes made me angry, at times they made me laugh.  The author is a psychotherapist writing to his peers and thus the book may not be for the lay gay reader.  However, it is not academically impenetrable either.  The author's point is valid.  However, he feigns objectivity in a postmodern era in which you would think that opinionated writers would not try to hide behind the third-person narrative.  On the one hand, this author may be a straight man laughing all the way to the bank or getting tenure by positing this point.  On the other hand, though the credits say the author has written a book on homophobia, he never once comes out as a gay man.  In fact, he dismisses gay men who would seek treatment from one of their own.  One might get the sense that this is a gay man callous to his community.  The author criticizes leather men and drag queens and sees no political valor in camp.  Thus, if he is a gay man, he's in a longterm, monogamous relationship and can pass for straight and thus dismisses the rest of us.  In addition, the author states that some of his anecdotes were obtained by eavesdropping on other people's conversations.  That seems completely unethical to me.  (I'm surprised his peers haven't said the same to him.)  I can buy many of the arguments in this book.  Nevertheless, this book could seriously be used as a weapon against gay men.	2002-05-07

Still, when this was written little work was being produced by gays south of the US border.  This book has a few good incites.  It's a good addition to people who have collections on Latino gays.

This lecture series is long even though the material is quite simple.  I have two problems with this product.  There are four tapes on agency and partnership, respectively.  First, for each subject the professor spend three tapes telling the rules and then the last tape saying, &quot;Okay, now here are the rules from the new Restatement.&quot;  They should have said the most updated rules from the start.  Second, (and please forgive the age-ism here), the back cover shows the Munch is an older gentleman.  When you listen to the tapes, you will learn that he has an old man's voice.  Whereas other tapes have younger people cracking jokes because they know many of these law subjects are tedious, here you have the kind of old professor that will make you go to sleep.

I consider myself to be a huge bell hooks fan, but this book wasn't doing it for me.  Usually, I can reading her cover to cover in a day and a half, but this time I find myself just barely picking through this.  It's odd that her book \\"Salvation\\" on blacks and love was more interesting and only half the size of this tome.  bell prides herself on bringing up race, class, and gender issues simultaneously, yet race and class drop to the wayside here.  (To her credit, age and sexual orientation is brought up often.)  I think readers unfamiliar with her work are going to be put off by her constant pointing to patriarchy and her continual assessment of feminism as a key aspect in women's search for love.  Usually, bell has something brilliant to say in every chapter, and this time, I can't quote much that made me say, \\"Ahh!  Good point!\\"  bell can't really write bad books, it's just that this one did not blow me away like her previous texts.	2002-05-02

There is a chapter on African-American men, Latino men, Asian-American men, Native-American men, and white men written by men from those respective backgrounds.  In each chapter, the men discuss burdens that men of their race must bear and characteristics of their cultures that men outside of that culture may not understand.  The editor, Mr. Cooper, compares racial tensions to the operations of a dysfunctional family and says each group of men plays their role in that dysfunction.  The editor is a Promise Keeper, a member of a movement of Christian men that recently announced that they must do more to curb racism among Christians.  Though the book assumes that every one is or should be a Christian, the valorous principles of men's studies are present here (examples:  the book doesn't put down women, it discusses the burden of rigid gender roles, even the editor admits how often powerful advice from other men makes him cry, etc.).  I was disappointed, though not surprised, that non-Christian men and gay men (both groups of whom have many men of color in their population) were not brought up.  Each chapter ends with a section on what men of that racial group can do, what men outside that racial group can do, and further questions meant to stimulate action.  As most of the authors are counselors, this book is modeled in that self-help style.  It is written for the average American man, so academics and certain activists may be frustrated by it.  Many of the ideas are borrowed (examples:  references to Ellis Cose's \\"Rage of a Privileged Class\\", a psychological model of race that the editor mimicks for two consecutive chapters, allusions to the Woody Harrelson's \\"White Men Can't Jump\\", etc.)  It may appear that the authors assume that if a man is from one race, then he has no connections to another.  However, the editor and another author are mixed, prejudice against interracial coupling is condemned,and the white author discusses his experiences in a majority-black neighborhood; thus, mixed-race readers should feel included.  When you consider who the intended audience is, this is a much-needed and well-done book.  Though a little simplistic, it goes a ways in encouraging anti-racist activism among men who are often quite conservative and suspicious of diversity.	2002-04-29

Where are the bisexual men?  Why are bisexual activist usually women?  If the whole world thinks bisexual men are the ones guilty of spreading AIDS to \\"innocent\\" straight women, then why are they so invisible?  These are some of the questions that this anthology attempts to answer.  A big and important question they pose is the following:  \\"too often writing lumps gay and bisexual men together, so how do bisexual men differ from gay men?\\"  The editors specifically state that they would like readers to read this book next to/along with their other book \\"Bisexual Men in Culture and Society.\\"  This book is the academic-scientific book compared to its more pop culture, literary companion.  As much as this book complains of women dominating the bisexual rights movement, with few exceptions, the articles in this book are written by women.  This book cites the stats that say Black and Latino men exhibit higher rates of bisexual behavior than white men; this book does a good job in trying to be racially-diverse. The worst article is by Paula Rust.  I was so disappointed by this entry when her book \\"The Bisexual Challenge to Lesbian Politics\\" was so excellent.  Finally, the cover of the book is cheap and tacky.  I am glad I bought the book, but then again I'm fascinated by the subject.	2002-04-20

Unfortunately, this book had too much of the yucko former and not enough of the cool latter.  <BR>The purpose of the authors is that sexuality studies of \\"Hispanic\\" texts must be done more and is quite worthwhile.  The book has good representation of men and women.  It has a good article on Reinaldo Arenas.  This will probably be useful to Spanish literature majors, but not many others.<BR>Final comment:  please forgive the essentialism coming.  Both editors mention their opposite-sex spouses.  So if I'm reading this correctly, the editors are straight people who find queer theory useful.  In this way, they prove that the Eve Sedgwicks of the world do not just discuss English-language literature.  This book shows that gay studies can be useful to straights.  <BR>I'm not too impressed with this book, but that's not to totally disparage it.	2002-03-17

This is the editor's much needed attempt to buck that trend.  However, it is written for social workers much more than for the topic population.  In addition, it is nowhere as excellent as Leslie Feinberg's \\"Stone Butch Blues\\" or Dorothy Allison's texts.  Boys gotta do better in this area.<br />What is odd about this book is how little class is actually brought up.  When you read lesbian texts, they spend much time criticizing androcentrism in the gay community.  Gay people of color have done the same with racism in the community.  But this book attacks classism only to the slightest degree.  Many of the articles only spend a page or two on it.<br />The best thing about this book is its diversity.  There are several chapters about gay Latinos.  Even in highly white countries like New Zealand and Australia, the author tries to bring up race issues.  In every survey done, they try to get input from men of color.  Of the research subjects, there is age diversity as well.  This is especially impressive in the AIDS era when many older men have succumb to the illness.  Lastly, it is very bi-inclusive.  Many \\"queer\\" texts put \\"bisexual\\" in the title and then never address their issues.  Though this book has no bi-specific chapters, it does mention men who are married, men who have had relationships with women, etc.  Even the cover has a photo of a man with a supposed girlfriend.<br />Half this anthology is written by the editor.  And unfortunately, his pieces are the worst in the text.  Though I give this book a mediocre review, I don't discourage people from buying it.  It was interesting; just not superior.	2002-02-20

I read this after borrowing it from a library, but now I really wish I had a copy to keep.  If you are a good liberal, you already know that women of color are doubly oppressed.  You know that many ppl think all the feminists are white and all the antiracists are male, so the topic can get tired.  However, this book was really well done.  It covers Black, Latina, Asian, and Native women equally.  It talks about women of various class backgrounds and immigration statuses.  The articles are accessible to non-academic readers without boring highly educated readers.  I particularly love one article which discusses the &quot;domesticization&quot; of bright black girls in public schools.  This book may be a little dated by now.  But for what it was at the time, it is quite excellent.  All womanists and mujeristas should get a copy.	2002-02-14

This book has a great photo section.  It helped me to see the ugly side of Josephine that wasn't fully presented in the great movie by HBO.

In this book, she notes the severe lack of studies out there on black female viewing habits and then presents this book as her intervention against this paucity.  The book can be broken down into to parts.  In one part, Bobo summarizes the feelings of a dozen black women as they watch Color Purple and Daughters of the Dust, two nominally womanist movies.  In the second part, Bobo includes her own essays on why Steven Spielberg's movie betrays Walker's text, etc.  This book may feel essentialist and highly unscientific to some readers.

This book analyzes and exposes the many white early feminists and their racism.  It is well-written and this professor (a Brown University alumna) has a brilliant career ahead of her, I'm sure.

Many may even argue that this discussion has already been stated by women of color for decades and does not need a new book-length analysis.  However, racism from white women is part of the history of womanism or Third World feminism.  Thus this is an important text.

In general, I don't care for Ellis Cose's writing.  (I guess I don't think that journalists make good book authors.)  I groan at the fact that every time there is an article about Black Americans in Newsweek, it always has to be pinned by Mr. Cose.  But I have to give it up to the man this time:  I enjoyed this book.  In \\"Envy\\", Cose asks why black men have so much cultural currency in this country, yet have almost no financial, academic, or institutional power whatsoever.  (Cornel West already asked this question in \\"Race Matters\\" years ago, but I digress.)  He deals with this question as it relates to school, the prison complex, and fatherhood.  At the end, he offers solutions for Black men.  This book is both politics and self-help, in the same fashion as bell hooks or David Abalos.  Cose really argues persuasively that brothers can think differently and choose new directions.  To a small extent, Cose portrays black males as a monolithic group, with the exception of class backgrounds.  (For example, he says nothing about Muslim brothers or gay brothers.)  However, this book was very Latino-inclusive.  I think East Coast Caribbeans should peep this book as much as any African-American male might.  It's funny that Cose's table of contents is almost identical to Jawanza Kunjufu's counterpart in \\"State of Emergency:  We Must Save Black Boys\\", but the former is excellent while the latter is trash.  There are better books about black men out there.  (Devon Carbrado and Don Belton have authored some, for example.)  Still, this book was worthwhile.  I would recommend it to any reader interested in black masculinity.	2002-01-24

However, when so many great books have been written by/on black gay men (Brother to Brother, One More River to Cross, Vanishing Rooms, etc.), there is little need to read this book now.  This book allows white men to speak more than blacks do.  Relatives of Smith's black lovers say he exploited his mates.  Why did Langston Hughes' estate allow his work to be published here but not spoken in Isaac Julien's &quot;Looking for Langston&quot;?  Don't let the new cool cover fool you.

Gay (male) Asian Canadians must face the same issues that their American and Australian counterparts do:  being a double minority, only being courted by older white men, finding themselves attracted to other Asian men for the first time, etc.  This book is a collection of fiction, political articles, drawings, and photographs of up &amp; coming gay Asians, mostly from Toronto.  Still, there's something that feels redundant about this book.  The book is a quick read.  Perhaps because it says nothing that &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; or &quot;Witness Aloud&quot; haven't already said before and better.  It has these photos inside but they will remind you of 1970s American gay liberation publications, except featuring Asian men.  Further, you can't tell if the photos challenge racist myths or re-inforce them.  Women are left out of the picture, as are South Asians and other people of color.  Plus, they use the term &quot;rice&quot; unproblematically, almost admitting to non-Asian readers that they are just a dish to be eaten and forgotten.  An American voice is included here, but it belongs to Justin Chin who always surprises me that he gets published when so many more gay Asian-Americans write more interesting stuff than his.  This book is good for looking at gay East Asians in a comparative, global context.   There is an interview with Richard Fung, who is always awesome in every way.  And I must remember that people of color face different issues in Canada  than they do here.  Still, there is something unimpressive about this book.	2002-01-22

Every other sentence is a rhetorical question, rather than a comment or analysis.  This book is just a huge series of statistics showing that Kunjufu can only cite other people's studies and he really does little that is fresh or original.  <br />This book, in many ways, is supposed to be the sequel to the early 1980s book about black boys in the education system.  But since that time, many books have come out about black men that are far superior to this book.  Books by Devon Carbrado and Don Belton are examples.  This book is paranoid.  Kunjufu never admits the male and straight privilege that most black men have.  To him, brothas are only victims.  Almost the only good thing about this book is the beautiful sculpture on the cover.<br />Because radicals and liberals are condemned for always criticizing but never constructing, Kunjufu presents some solutions.  However, they are pretty impractical.  For example, Kunjufu suggests that we could barter more (trading work for shelter, etc.).  Well, what landlord or landlady is going to allow that in the new millenium?  But Derrick Bell's solutions are not that feasible either.  I don't blame a brotha for being creative.<br />Kunjufu notes that many black men are illiterate.  Perhaps that's why his book is written in such a simplistic style.  Maybe that is why it's so repetitive.<br />There are greater black male writers out there (Dyson, West, Gates, Harris).  And there are definitely better texts out there.	2002-01-20

I was first introduced to his work in the great political commentaries he has written for A.Magazine.  In &quot;Yellow&quot;, he mentions that he has been writing this book all his life.  So I am not sure if this book is just a gathering of all his previous articles or something new.  Wu is a cool guy and I would have loved to have a guy like him as a law professor.  He shows his depth of knowledge in literature, history, and pop culture: non-legal readers should not fear this text in the slightest.  However, this book is long and drags in many places.  Talking of model minorities, perpetual foreigners, etc. has already been beat into the ground in Asian-American writing.  As much as Wu wants Americans to break the black-white binary (another tired topic), his inclusion of South Asians and Latinos in this large book is sorely noticed.  (However, I admire that he is very Jewish-inclusive.)  I wish Professor Wu many years of success.  Still, I preferred Angelo Ancheta's and Helen Zia's recents texts on Asian Americans much more than I did this one.	2002-01-19

In this study, Higgonbotham asks black women who went to predominantly-White, Northeastern colleges how they got there, how was it, and how did it affect their lives afterward.  The book is written in a style that is scholarly but not impenetrable to non-academic readers.  But here's the shocker.  This book does very little comparing black women to their black male siblings or their white female peers.  Most of this book compares the choices and actions of middle-class black women to working-class counterparts.  Really, this book was more a labor studies text, than a women's studies or African-American studies one.  Further, with the exception of the occasional mention of Patricia Hills Collins, there is no mention of black feminist/womanist thinkers.  I wish too that the author didn't make up cheesy names to keep the universities attended hidden.  But I enjoyed this book.  I think I'm going to give it to my mother as a present.  If white women can have Miriam Horn's &quot;Rebels in White Gloves&quot;, why can't sisters have an equivalent?

Takagi takes a sociological look at this issue as it affected two premier UC schools.  Takagi tracks how universities pitifully defended themselves first by saying, &quot;Well, we have enough science majors&quot; and then by saying, &quot;We can't admit Asians if we have to give so much affirmative action to blacks.&quot;  It is particularly interesting seeing this book in light of Proposition 209's aftermath.

This collection of essays may have come from a particular exhibit or conference.  It is a book that discusses black men's status as objects of art.  Don't sleep!  The art world is racist.  Coco Fusco and bell hooks have effectively documented this.  So this anthology is a very needed intervention.  Articles cover topics such as gay black men in movies, the visual representation of gangsta rap, Mapplethorpe, etc.  The contributors analyze numerous art mediums, not just painting or film.  What I love about this book is how straight black men and gay black men are treated equally; a discussion of one does not marginalize the other.

Sometimes, I am not too impressed when journalists write whole books.  (Example:  Ellis Cose's oeuvre.)  But Wickham really did his homework and gives a historical look at presidents and their reaction to black citizens.  This book also includes an interview with Bill himself.  The majority of the book consists of comments from famous, often political, blacks on this labeling.  Sometimes, the comments illustrate the genius of the commentators more than they do Bill.  Still, after you have read a few, there becomes little need to read every single one.  This book does have a scrapbook feel that somewhat disappoints me.  Nevertheless, until we actually get a president of African descent, I think readers should grab this book and think deeply about our cherished Bill Clinton.	2002-01-15

Sorry for the essentialism, but originally I was skeptical about what a European academic would say about gay Latin American art.  However, the author resisted Eurocentrism here and others have described his previous work as very anti-racist.  In this book, Bleys looks at Latin American art from 1810 to the present, with a chapter on art from gay Latinos in the US.  Bleys examines Mexico, Brazil, Cuba, and Puerto Rico under his idea of Latin American.  This may frustrate some.  (I hear that Argentina has a rich history of both gay expression and repression.  It doesn't come up here.)  Still, given the geographic, linguistic, political, racial, and historical diversity among these four countries, I think Bleys made a great effort.  Too, the discussion on lesbian art may feel scant to some, but I think Bleys tried his best.  This book included a huge range of photos that aided the text.  Social constructionists will love this book because Bleys emphasizes artists that reject Western ideas about gay identity and artists that problematize the gay/straight binary overall.  Under this constructionism, Bleys uses the term &quot;homotextuality&quot; which he never defines well.  This book has a terrible intro.  Also, Bleys' timeline is shakey.  (For example, the chapter on art from 1810 to 1910 discusses much art after 1910.  The chapter about 1975 ot the present focuses heavily on works from the past five years.)  This book is much more typical of an art text than it is gay studies or Latino studies.  Nevertheless, it will make you think deeply about what is homoerotic art, who can be a homoerotic artist, and how race intersects with those questions.  This was a veritabe encyclopedia of gay and lesbian Latin American art.  I am beyond impressed with this work.	2002-01-06

However, this anthology is well worth the effort.  Here, academics analyze the history and social construction behind ideas such as &quot;South Asians&quot;, &quot;Asian America&quot; and even &quot;Asia&quot; itself.  One gets a sampling of the works of the top South Asian-American scholars around the country.  Even as East Asians are criticized for hogging the spotlight, East Asian-American academics were allowed to submit pieces to the anthology.  The book uses political campaigns, student groups, gay rights, and literature to answer many complex questions.  Some essays are convoluted and odd (Song, Prashad) but most (like Roy and Shankar) are excellent.  South Asians must buy this book and other Asian Americans will be equally challenged and pleased if they read this text as well.<br />I have one main criticism of this book.  This book often re-iterates that South Asians get left out because both whites and East Asians think of all Asians as &quot;yellow.&quot;  However, this book fails to point out that South Asians get punished for being dark-skinned.  If East Asians get considered &quot;model minorities&quot; or &quot;a paler shade of white&quot;, it is partially due to their phenotype.  This book doesn't discuss that many Americans confuse South Asians for Latinos.  It doesn't mention how Urvashi Vaid was called &quot;practically a [Black American epithet]&quot; when she was appointed as the head of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.  It surprises me that the challenges of being &quot;brown&quot; rather than just &quot;not being yellow&quot; are not even mentioned here.	2001-12-30

So much of men's studies does not take men of color into account.  Then, that which does focuses on African-American men, and sometimes Latino men.  Thus, Chan's book is a direly needed intervention.  The book focuses upon Chinese-American men, but it is applicable to Asian-Ams of many ethnicities.  This book would be a wonderful edition to any collection of Asian-American studies texts or works on men of color.  Chan has two projects.  First, he discusses the history and racist underpinnings of four Chinese-Am men in popular culture of this century:  Fu Manchu, Charlie Chan, Bruce Lee, and Shiang-Chi.  Second, Chan is trying to formulate a Chinese-American masculinity that is neither sexist nor homophobic.  He thus encourages &quot;ambi-sexuality&quot; and borrows the idea of &quot;democratic manhood&quot; from Michael Kimmel.  My only critique of this text is that it did not have photos of the characters Chan examines.  (I mean, I have heard of Charlie Chan, but I've never seen any of the decades-old films that use him.)  In brief, if you enjoyed what Lisa Lowe said about Asian-American women in &quot;Immigrant Acts&quot;, you will really love what Chan says about male counterparts in this book.  Many readers may be turned off by the deeply academic, and some might say overly &quot;PC&quot; lingo that the author employs.  Still, I think every Chinese-American man should own this book.  I am very pleased that I bought and read this book; it's brilliant!	2001-12-28

On the contrary, this book is a Latino male academic writing in the veins of bell hooks' &quot;Sisters of the Yam&quot; or Iyanla Vanzant's books.  If white men have Dr. Phil and Asian men have Chopra, then Latino men now have Abalos.  This book was more about self-help and improving family functioning than it was about politics or sociology.  It is a decent book for Latino family men looking to better themselves.  This book is gay-friendly.  The author very aptly condemns sexism and praises Latina feminists at the same time that he states that Latinas sometimes do willing let themselves be the victims of machismo.  Not only is this a nice read for Latino men, but Latina wives and non-Latino wives and male lovers may learn much from this book.  At times this book is repetitive and the author has clearly read too much Jung and beat drums in the wilderness a little too much.  Still, this was an interesting topic and a nice read.  For anyone interested in books about men of color in the United States, this is a must-have.	2001-12-23

Being not-quite lesbian, and not-quite disabled has pushed her to ask questions about the murkiness of categorization.  In this book, she dedicates a chapter to the &quot;bi's&quot; of race, gender, sexual orientation, and ability.  This is mainly a legal text, but I think non-legal readers will still be entertained.  I wasn't bowled over by this book, but I think it is great that someone is speaking of multiracials and bisexuals in the same breath and looking at the grey areas across categories.  This book is a must have for various &quot;bi&quot; activists.	2001-12-19

Robson is a complex thinker, so do not assume this book will just say, &quot;Aren't lesbian lawyers cool!?&quot;  Robson's analysis of legal issues can be overly pessimistic at times:  as if one domestic partner law or pro-gay legal decision can be criticized for not removing all oppressions throughout the world!  Still, this was an interesting read.  It differs from many gay legal texts.	2001-12-19

I think that it's really great that academics are starting to look at majority groups (whites, men, straights) as they do minority ones.  And the intro of this book makes the author sound like a progressive, cool guy.  However, I am not convinced that these biographies speak of whiteness as he claims they do.  I preferred &quot;Critical White Studies&quot; and &quot;Was Blind But Now I See&quot; over this book.  In addition, &quot;Stiffed&quot; and &quot;The Invention of Heterosexuality&quot; are better books as well.

It is a good reminder of our nation's imperfections and that the battles are still not over.  I did not read ther editors' first book, but this book reminded me a lot of Ward Churchill's writings.  The material feels a little dated, but it is historical and those reading it after September 11th may find true insight in it.  Some people may feel that the jump from pure historical writing to descriptive narrative feels disjointed.  At times, this book seems paranoid, but at others it feels quite visionary.

I thought Hemphill's &quot;Brother to Brother&quot; and even &quot;Afrekete&quot; were much better books.  Maybe due to the Canadian-British-diasporic scope, this book dealt with blacks in far whiter milieux and seemed a tad white-washed.  Notice how the book has &quot;queer&quot; in the title when almost no African-American gay text does.  I think the editors did not have much vision with this collection either.

It was made in fits and starts due to continual fundraising for the movie that Dash had to do.  This book documents getting the movie made.  It has a good section in which Dash and cultural critic bell hooks discuss the symbolisms in the film.  Given that even Spike Lee has trouble raising money for his films, it is essential that incipient black filmmakers get advice on what they'r getting into.  In that way, this book is an important first tool.  Those majoring in film studies, feminist studies, or Afro-American studies will want to have this book.	2001-10-24

Unfortunately, the tales inside are not as fierce or defiant as the title would suggest.  In many of the pieces, issues of race and sexuality take the back seat to &quot;l'art pour l'art&quot;, typical literature.  The pieces near the back are better than the introductory ones.  The piece by James Earl Hardy (who almost never writes short stories) is great.  Jaime Manrique has a piece here and I've never seen him write about black issues (he writes almost exclusively of latino ones).

In another, an Italian-American gay man talks about class matters at Harvard and in Boston.  This book is excellent in the way that many books by gays and lesbians of color are.

It basically assumes first that no modern societies support it and more importantly that no non-Western societies, ancient, modern, (or postmodern) support it either. Thus, it's great to read a book that discusses sexual orientation and gender identification in a positve manner outside of a Western context. However, this book is just some Aussie's observations on the topic. The book is practically like a &quot;Gay Guide to Thailand.&quot; It doesn't get too in-depth and I would have much rather have read something from a gay Thai or a gay Thai living abroad. Still, this book is a good first start. It has awesome pictures. I would recommend it for Thais of all citizenships and sexualities, as well as many gay and lesbian readers.	2001-09-25

Oftentimes, when the media discuss &quot;Black-Latino tensions&quot;, they speak of the matter as if Blacks discriminate against Latinos, but that the reverse can never happen.  This book shows how untrue that is.  This book is supposed to be about a grumpy old man who learns about life through his odd interactions with a black youth.  Instead, we get a patronizing look at how an old white man supposedly leads a dumb black kid to be upstanding.  This book is not a great contribution to Latino literature as the character is practically portrayed as any other white ethnic, rather than a minority in the United States.  I was generally disappointed by this book and I hope the author does a better job in his other works.	2001-09-25

Parker's book is an important intervention in that regard.  It is a survey of Brazilians' views on sexuality.  Parker interviews Brazilian men and women of all sexual orientations.  It shows how Brazil's sexual mores may differ from those of the United States.  (For example, a Brazilian man would fear being called a cuckold more than he would fear being called gay.)

It includes chapters on Native, black, Latino, and Asian-American men.  It avoids graphic descriptions of incidents that may scare away timid readers.  This book can point to institutional racism and poverty as phenomena that aggravate DV in communities of color without falling  into big pitfalls.  At no point, does it forgive men of color for DV nor does it discount sexist behavior among minority men.  It mentions how precolonized men had different notions on how to treat women without overromanticizing the past.  This book is written for therapists of any race or gender more so than your average man of color.  The book relies a little too heavily on beating drums and telling old myths than it does on concrete actions that could be taken to solve this problem.  In addition, it is totally heterosexist and the editors don't even think once to mention domestic violence among gay male couples of color.  However, this is an important first effort on a necessary topic.  I would recommend it to many readers.	2001-09-24

This anthology features articles from the leading gay and lesbian API academics in the country. I purposely say &quot;API&quot; because the book includes a chapter on gay Polynesians. There's gender parity in the articles, or at least the editor is mindful of not making another androcentric book.  I think all gay Asian-Americans should get their hands on a copy of this book. It's neither hyperacademic babble nor another cheesy poetry book. It would also be a great resource for ethnic studies majors. I think straight API allies will enjoy it as well. I recommend this book. It's a keeper.	2001-09-19

Too many gay Latin books focus on Spain, basically (though unintentionally) reinforcing the idea that homosexuality is a European phenomenon.  To add salt to the wound, they focus upon ancient, obtuse Spanish writings rather than the cool cultural products being made by living gay Latinos.  This book avoids that trap.  Though there is a brief, cursory mention of Garcia Lorca, all the works analyzed here are about Latin Americans and US Latinos.  Quiroga looks at cultural products from these two groups and provides commentary that combines the best thought of queer studies thinkers (Sedgwick, Halperin) with Latino academics (Oboler, Fusco).  This book doesn't get bogged down in separating Latin Americans from US Latinos or privileging one group over the other.  The book is male-focused, but it is conscious of that and it does include a chapter on lesbian writer Lydia Cabrera.  This book is wonderful like Jose Munoz' &quot;Disidentifications&quot; and Manrique's &quot;Eminent Maricones,&quot; instead of being boring and cluttered like Molloy's anthology or &quot;?Entiendes?&quot;  It's not perfect.  Quiroga uses much hyperacademic babble: many sentences I read twice or thrice and they never made sense.  He, like all current writers, problematizes the term &quot;gay&quot; but is totally uncritical of this concept &quot;queer.&quot;  Chapter introductions are long and have nothing to do with the main topics.  I don't agree with some of what he said (Example:  Gay Latino Carlos dolls are not an ounce as offensive as Ricky &quot;I love Geore W. Bush&quot; Martin.)  Still, this book gets progressively better and I may even suggest that people read the last chapters first.  This book is a must-have for gay Latino readers.	2001-09-18

Halperin looks at the classic writings of ancient Greek \\"homosexuals\\" and puts them into deep analysis. Halperin avoids a lot of the \\"essentialist\\" mistakes that John Boswell fell into with his Social Tolerance book. Dover's book has more cool photos in it, but Halperin's book is very worthwhile.

There is much academic literature on women in the law and blacks in the law and it is not incorporated well into this book.

Don't let the title deceive you. This is not a cute, accessible anthology with writings that would interest the average gay, black man. This is not &quot;Brother to Brother&quot; or &quot;Fighting Words.&quot; This is a series of musings from a professor that is clearly trying to impress a tenure review board. TO ACADEMIC READERS: Reid-Pharr gives nine chapters which deal with theoretical questions on race, sexuality, and gender. The title is supposed to scare you in its seeming essentialism. The book is divided into three sections: black, gay, and man; but these are arbitrary. Reid-Pharr's project is to critique obtuse, overly &quot;socially-constructed&quot; academic hyperbabble without returning to played-out identity politics. However, this book is just as theoretically burdensome as any other recent cultural studies. Shockingly, the author never once mentions postmodernism and only discusses modernism. A lot of this book seems borrowed: the grotesque picture on the cover smacks of Mapplethorpe; the raunchy sexual tales are influenced by Delaney; the &quot;I'm a lesbian&quot; line comes from Sedgwick and Francisco Valdes. I usually would say all black gay lit. enthusiasts should buy something like this; but I can't say that this time. This book is going to disappoint many. It reminds me of Hazel Carby's weird &quot;Race Men&quot; book.	2001-09-03

This book is an anthology about the school experiences of young gay men and lesbians of color. It is an important intervention in that this group is twice as removed from mainstream educators' radars. It annihilates the pure fallacy that all the gays are white and all the people of color are straight. However, this project is all over the place. Academic readers will hate the &quot;uhm&quot;'s and &quot;like&quot;'s of the personal student narratives. Non-academic readers will be turned off by the high-level jargon of the scholars. Many people will especially be lost after reading Kumashiro's introduction. The uncritical use of the word &quot;queer&quot; is very problematic as well. Some articles are great (McCready, for example); some are the definition of terrible (Shen-Hayes). I think those interested in gays and lesbians of color will want to buy this book. Still, they should be aware that it could have been better.	2001-08-30

When originally released, the critics mocked him by saying, &quot;What do you get when you mix Truman Capote with James Baldwin?&quot; However, this is not an imitation or duplication of other gay authors. This is a black gay masterpiece and if you are truly fierce, you will order it! SNAP!	2001-08-22

The anthology is divided into academic writers coming up with theories on the matter and vignettes from gay students of color describing their experiences.  It brings up many common topics from which LGBTPOC students often have to endure:  being the only person of color in gay-straight alliances, dealing with same-race peers who say no one of their background could be gay, coming out to immigrant parents when there is no word for &quot;gay&quot; in one's home-spoken language, etc.  In general, the point of the book is to get educators to think of students who are twice removed from mainstream school radars and whom many don't even think exist.  However, there may be too many cooks in this rather short anthology.  With much effort, Kumashiro attempts to explain why this anthology does critical work without trying to state that racism and homophobia are the worse or only injustices facing students.  Nevertheless, his words are bogged down in inpenetrable language and many readers are going to (wrongly) stop reading the book after his introduction.  The non-elite, non-academic readers are going to be bored and confused by the writings of the academics.  The academics are going to be dismissive of all the &quot;uhms&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; of the young gays of color.  IN ADDITION, READERS WHO DON'T COME FROM LEFT-WING, POSTMODERN SETTINGS WILL BE INSTANTLY HORRIFIED AT EVERY AUTHORS' UNCRITICAL USAGE OF THE TERM &quot;QUEER&quot;.  There are superb pieces here, such as McCready's exploration of why black males haven't joined a California gay student group.  Still, there are hollow, poorly stitched-together pieces such as Chen-Hayes' article on multiracial families.  Education is a hodgepodge field that draws from multiple disciplines anyway.  Thus, I don't know where Kumashiro's project falters on its own or what.  But this was a difficult effort on an important topic.  Fans of writings from gays and lesbians of color still should add this to their collection.  The work cited pages in all the articles point to other (better?) sources that readers will want to find as well.	2001-08-16

Beemyn has edited an anthology of works from emerging academics who are studying gay life outside of the white, vanilla, male mode.  This anthology has great articles on gay black men, Asian lesbians, biracial female sadomasochists, etc.  It is a very welcome edition to my gay studies collection.  I find myself citing articles from this anthology all the time.  I truly recommend this book.  I think gay men and lesbians of color will truly appreciate it.	2001-07-15

A huge audience for and books about gay Native Americans have been born.  Whereas Sue-Ellen Jacobs' book is more anthropological, this book is more social work-oriented.  It talks about the issues that social workers will face in serving some gay and lesbian Native Americans.  Again, this is another white-edited and -authored book on the topic, and I can't wait until a Native gay person takes the wheel on such a project.  Also, this volume is slim and easy to read within a day or two.  If you love the topic, you should add this to your collection.  Otherwise, you may want to select the other books out there first.	2001-07-13

It covers a span of topics from black slavery, Japanese interment, to Native Hawaiian colonialism.  Though written by a law professor, the text is not case-heavy and could be digested by most every reader.  It discusses some interesting concerns about person-of-color unity as well.  Those interested in Asian/Pacific Islander studies may be particularly interested in this book.  Some people may find the text too simple, especially those who view governmental apologies as ineffective.  However, this book was a decent read generally.	2001-07-12

She responds that we are going to see a turn toward gender activism, rather than specific women's rights stuff.  This is primarily a legal text, but all non-legal readers will be able to handle it.  The book will in no way intimidate men at the same time that it avoids disrespecting Steinem-types by talking about &quot;post, post, post&quot; anything.  For some feminists, this book will mention too much of the obvious.  For those who are novices, but know that Betty Friedan is dated, they will enjoy Levit's insights.	2001-07-12

Bill Platt details and analyzes the tensions between Black Americans and Latinos.  He covers a range of controversies from Miami,  to New York, to Los Angeles.  He argues why the two minority groups need to get along better.  I have two major problems with this text.  First, it overlooks the many instances in which blacks and browns get along quite well.  I am an African-American and I think that the majority of us would say that we get along better with Latinos than we do with whites or Asians.  Particularly in this age, many minority programs have to be split between blacks and Latinos (thus the proliferation of made-up words like &quot;Af-Lat&quot;, &quot;Blatino&quot;, &quot;Blackano&quot;, etc.), thus forcing the two groups to see eye to eye.  Further, I think the book is written in a simplistic style that borders on insulting the reader.  I love the topic, but I was a little disappointed by the book.	2001-07-12

After book upon book about Asian-American cultural studies or Asian-American history, finally a book has been compiled that deals with Asian-Ams from a political science perspective.  This book would be a wonderful edition to the bookshelves of all Asian-American/ethnic studies majors.  Despite the thickness of the book, it is actually a quick read.  I did learn some facts that I did not know before.  Unfortunately, on the one hand, this book is a fresh, new idea, but on the other it repeats things that many already know (the Wen Ho Lee case revealed the country's anti-Asian sentiment; Asians have problems forming voting blocs outside of Hawaii, Asian Americans are stereotyped as apolitical, etc.).  Also, the book gets bogged down in statistical jargon.  Still, it covers a wide range of issues and it is an important first effort.	2001-07-09

Too often books on the international gay rights movement focus too much upon Western nations or those nations heavily influenced by them (i.e., Israel or Puerto Rico).  Drucker's book is a wonderful survey of the &quot;gay and lesbian&quot; rights movement in non-Western nations.  He discusses Latin America, Africa, and Asia equally.  The book is well-divided between men and women.  There is a nice inclusion of transgender issues as well.  Most interestingly, both constructionists and essentialists will be pleased with this book:  this book does an excellent job in problematizing that every person in the world will want to &quot;come out&quot; and identify with a &quot;gay&quot; community, yet it avoids being overly postmodern or assuming that non-Westerners are not influenced by Western gay rights at all.  Some of the articles are by whites or concentrate on whites who pushed gay rights in the Third World.  Luckily, the position of those writers, and the editor himself, is acknowledged and called into question.  For those who have done extensive readings on non-Western &quot;homosexuality&quot; (i.e., fans of Roscoe &amp; Murray books), this book may seem repetitive and nothing new.  For those who haven't, however, this book will be a breath of fresh air.  I think that every gay man and lesbian of color who is concerned about homeland politics should grab a copy of this book immediately.	2001-07-08

However, this biography is more a scrapbook than a polished work.  Oftentimes, you can't tell when the author, Richard, or an acquaintance is speaking.  There is no analysis of the events in Richard's life.  This book pales in comparison to texts on Billy Strayhorn, Josephine Baker, etc.  This book drags on about concert after concert after concert.  Besides, Richard is in his homophobic phase at the time of the book's writing and there is no attempt to put his self-loathing into context.  I needed to learn more about Richard, so I am glad this book exists.  However, this was a poor piece of autobiography and I am surprised that the author did not take the time to fine tune his work.	2001-07-08

Messner basically develops a sociological chart for analyzing writings and activism from men's groups.  He reviews the literature in this field over the past three decades.

The subjects vary from Eddie Murphy to Italian muscle movies to Elvis impersonators.  I am very pleased that the editors had the vision to bring this book to life.  Some readers may be turned off by the highly academic writing.  Many essays ramble on in the way that they encourage graduate students to write.  The ending essay is too simplistic and almost lets the anthology down.  Still I am glad I own this book.	2001-07-04

He questions the underpinnings of this concept and asks if it depends upon class or is an Anglocentric, racist projection.  Those interested in Puerto Rican studies should purchase this book.  However, it was somewhat boring and overly sociological.  It's far slower than Mirande's &quot;Hombres y Machos&quot; and far weaker than Gonzalez' &quot;Muy Macho&quot;.  The chapter on male homosexuality seemed entirely stolen from other academics.  I'm a big fan of men's studies books and yet I wasn't quite impressed with this one.	2001-07-04

It looks at male homosexuality from a historical, pre-colombian, and tribal perspective as well.  Murray is an erudite anthropologist and therefore does not fall into the loopholes in scholarship that many white men who \\"study\\" homosexuality in Latin America have.  The author is a bit of an essentialist and that may rub constructionists the wrong way.  Of his books on international male homosexuality, this is the best one buy far.  I think every [homosexual] Latino who wants to know their own [homosexual] Latino history should own a copy.	2001-06-29

Few books have discussed ethnic and racial differences in Australia and this is truly an important intervention.  It is great for a comparison of race and sexuality between Australia and the United States.  However, the absence of Aboriginal [homosexual] writing is noticeable.  If this book is accurate, minority [homosexuals] in Australia are decades behind their counterparts in the United States in terms of activism, publishing, and a host of other topics; the editors fail to acknowledge this either.  Also, the editing is a bit haphazard.  The authors say one Asian [homosexual] contributor got a fact wrong.  Well, why not edit his article correctly rather than make him look stupid?  The submissions are pretty evenly divided between men and women.  Those who collect [homosexual] Judaic studies texts may especially be interested in this book.  There are American books that are soooooo much better; but this could be a valuable tool for comparative ethnic studies scholars.	2001-06-29

Alexander is a female, academic, biracial transracial adoptee who recounts her time working at an organization for South Asian male youth in a British, working-class neighborhood.  She details the opinions and life experiences of young men that British officials have begun to view as &quot;a threat&quot; (read: like Afican-descent youth).  It's hard to judge this book because it is by a British author and for a British audience; it makes no attempt whatsoever to be a comparative ethnic studies account.  Alexander has a great project and will be a keen expert on race relations in the United Kingdom in the future.  However, much of this work left me frustrated.  Alexander does much to problematize the oft-oppressive field of ethnography and her place in it, yet I find myself skeptical that all her subjects had no problem with her as an academic observer.  Sometimes this book becomes far too internal, never answering why a reader would care about some of the mundane issues, yet it also led to no larger answers that readers could apply to their lives or future readings on similar topics.  This book adds little to the burgeoning field of men's studies as it relates to men of color.  Nevertheless, it could be an okay scholarly addition to those interested in Muslims in the West, South Asians in Britain, and the villification of youth of color throughout white-dominated communities.  If you enjoy Asian Dub Foundation's music, or liked the film &quot;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid&quot;; this is another project documenting the British South Asian experience and may be worth a read.	2001-06-04

I didn't see Cho's similarly-titled, stand-up performance, so I may be missing something.  I admit that I started this book thinking Cho would write, &quot;I am a proud, bisexual, Asian woman and this is how I learned to fight the Eurocentric heteropatriarchy!&quot;  Let's just say this book is nothing of the sort.  Cho places herself in the long line of brilliant, but severely tortured, comics such as Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx, and Nathan Lane.  These pages were pure tears of a clown.  Most of the book details her being drugged and drunk.  The last half of the book is her going from one useless, heterosexual relationship to the next.  Even the end doesn't explain how she triumphed over her many demons.  While she tries to explain it, I still detect much racial self-loathing in her words and actions.  But maybe this her point.  She too wants to explain how her failed show &quot;All-American Girl&quot; doesn't come close to defining her existence.  She wants to show that Asian-American girls aren't all virginal and constantly studying for the SATs.  This work does a decent job of showing a human trying to find her space outside of the boxes in which we place each other.  So in that way, we do get to understand a talent who at times can be a genius.  Yeah, this book was okay.  I'd add it to Fong-Torres' &quot;The Rice Room&quot;, hooks' &quot;Wounds of Passion&quot;, Rebecca Walker's new autobio, and other useful biographical works of people-of-color-who-made-a-name-for-themselves-and-found-a-medium-in-which-they-shine.	2001-04-30

This is a big sign of how everything about this book is fresh and unique.  Eng's book finally provides a gay male perspective on the burgeoning field of Asian-American studies that Robert Lee and Lisa Lowe have helped to introduce.  It also adds an Asian-American take on the growing number of masculinity studies about men of color.  Eng employs classic psychological theories to look at how cross-historical cultural works portray Asian-American men.  I'm so excited that Eng had the vision to bring this book into existence.  However, let the reader by forewarned!  Eng is a hardcore, postmodernist, poststructuralist, hyperacademic theorist.  I have a degree in gay studies from an Ivy League school and still portions of this book went right over my head.  Don't think for a second that you can hand this book to some Asian-American friend just coming out like you could with Helen Zia's &quot;American Dreams&quot; or even Eng's previous book &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;.  Also, the apolitical or homophobic straight Asian male reader may be upset at how much this book is focused on gay Asian-Am men, rather than Asian-Am men of all sexualities.  Still if you enjoy highly scholarly books about gays and lesbians of color (like Munoz' &quot;Disidentifications&quot; or Delroy-Simms' &quot;Greatest Taboo&quot;), then you'll find Eng's book very worthwhile.	2001-04-05
